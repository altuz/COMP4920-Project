However, it is extremely badass and very promising despite the complete lack of content it shows a lot of promise. Next-car game offers much for a game so early in its development, the physics engine is second to none and the handling on the cars feels like it's getting there. The pre-alpha even boasts a photo mode to capture all the carnage, and looks like it will support lots of lens effects and photo editing tools too. Neat!Verdict: One to watch. Don't hesitate to buy if you support development. Very promising.7.5/10"

It's unfortunate that I have to do this, but I can't just sit here without exposing Bugbear for their shady practices that have been haunting the game's development.After many years, the game is still an unfinished mess, Digital Deluxe backers still don't have their perks and now... they made a new game and they are already developing consoles versions of Wreckfest without finishing the PC version first. It's clear that they are squeezing as much money as they can right now, so they blatantly screw their customers without giving a rat's butt about their reputation.The new game they made, is free for people who backed Wreckfest on their site. YET, people like me who bought the game on Steam for the same price, don't get the new game for free. There's no way, anyone in this planet can think this is fair. They don't care about their Steam customers, otherwise we would get the same perks. I've had enough with Bugbear and I certainly won't buy anything else from them unless they clean up their act.If you're reading this and you still don't own the game, wait until the moment they say the game is complete. I really want to know if they have the guts to call this complete in early 2017 (which is the date that's being rumoured right now) despite having at least one more year of work for this game to be truthfully complete.Do NOT defend Bugbear's evil practices, this is what's ruining gaming nowadays."

,Not Recommended,228380,18052630,"Posted: 15 September, 2015",all,Cpt. Crazy ©™,"My probelm with this game is that in every way it is not worth $30. I put in about $5 when it was in kickstarter and it's totally worth that but anyone who paid $30 got ripped. They will never finish this game, it was their toy, and now that they have made some money on what is now an outdated game, they will do what they have done with other games and move on. It's a shame, but it's true.HOWEVER, this game could be a ton of fun with very little work involved. make the game as-is right now but add the ability to download from a third party, cars and tracks and for gods sake fix the damn MP to function. Every time i join a race I'm all psyched thinking ""i have a ping of 50 this race should be incredible"" only to be disappointed when the screen constantly flutters and my car jumps around on the track and i have momentary loss of all control over the car for a half second at a time.Even more idiotic is the control scheme. they have (what i can only imagine) is gear selections for someone with an H shifter (6 gears+ reverse) however, there is no clutch binding, rendering that useless, and if you go with some sort of sequential, you might as well just select automatic, because the shifts are so slow I could complete a lap around one of the Oval tracks before someone could shift from reverse to 5th gear and back... just kinda sad. it's like grandma is sitting in the passenger seat trying to shift the gears for you. There is no real support for axis controls. The throttle only really gets recognized at about 50% anything before that makes the engine do funny stuff like not work or sputter or just go full throttle, the steering axis seems to be the only one that works, and I'm pretty sure if you set an axis for handbrake it doesn't work at all. All of which the axis cannot be calibrated. This goes for any controller, xbox controller, wheel, doesn't matter, it just doesn't work well.Lastly, The soft body physics were supposed to be the spotlight of the game yet they are an embarassment to anyone in the animations world because it's so terrible and fake. The cars deform, but not realistically. Watch some video's of Beam.NG that is true car deformation. This game should have that, but instead it is as if your car is build from some kind of metal that after it gets hit with ""x"" amount of force it turns into putty and then back hard. It's laughable, and somwhat comical at times, but to be honest I would rather the frame break or a wheel fall off than to have some warped up car with two wheels still able to drive at full speed even though the engine is bent at a 45° angle and would not function any longer. Yes it's supposed to be a goofy game, but how goofy do we really want it to be?That brings up another point. The devs brag about a tire model to make it realistic yet show no concern to make the game realistic. I think the devs got lost somewhere and didn't know what to do, and to be honest I think it was when they started selling the game. I think they said ""heck with making what we started, let's just conform to our target market"" and that tarket market is somewhere between chimps on cocaine and Sim racers looking to goof off, which would actually be a great discription of how this game is made. Some parts are super awesome, other parts seem to have came out of a coloring book.I'm just not sure what this game is or isn't supposed to be and every time you go to mention an issue with the game on any forum, you will be blasted for questioning it. I don't see how so many people can drink the kool-aid thinking this game will be finished when it took nearly a year for a single update to drop on this game. Let's face it a year between updates means they don't care anymore, regardless of what they post on their website."

The game used to be real fun, you could load it up get straight into an online race and race and smash your way around the track!!  So great!!Now the devs seem to have implemented some type of rpg career type mode in the MP!!!  This means that you start off with a slower less powerful car and race against others with better faster cars.  Your car will become damaged now and you have to finance the replacement of new parts.  It seem you get most money from playing singe-player.  So back to that mode to get some money to be able to go back in multiplayer.Why would devs make it like this?A lot of people just want to online race, not screw about replacing body parts and having the other people on the start line having faster cars!!!If the devs realise the error of their way I will rewrite this review, but this mechanic in the game completly breaks the game."

They found a full-time funder, so they can really start cranking this thing. More info here:http://www.wreckfestgame.com/wreckfest-december-update/Anyways, I have always enjoyed this game. I have had it for a while, and I have enjoyed most of it. Yes, it has been in ""early access"" for longer than any of us wanted. However, I think the future will be brighter for this game than it has the last few years. At least I hope so.If you are looking for an all-contact racing game, this is your game, as long as you can run it. My GTX 970 on the highest settings on 1080p, I get 40-60 fps.The driving in this game is very heavy, unlike its predecessors. You can really feel it when you hit another car head on. There isn't a whole lot of content in it- about 5 tracks and about 10 cars. The AI are brutal drivers, so you have to fend them off (or go on the offensive) while staying on the track. There is a multiplayer, but I don't think it is too populated.If this game interests you, or your rig might not be able to run it, you should also look into Flatout 1, Flatout 2, and Flatout Ultimate Carnage. They are more arcade-y and lead to more intense racing.Edit: Here's a link to Bugbear's twitter so you can see what they are working on:https://twitter.com/bugbeargamesHere's my part list for reference:http://pcpartpicker.com/b/Xthqqs"

I bought this game under the promise of getting the next Flatout game, from the original devs. The original alpha build was fantastic fun, with an emphasis of destruction of vehicles and unpredicatable car mayham. It was an absolute blast. What happened afterwards baffles me. I have no idea what happened to the devs and what happened to this game. The physics have completely changed, now making destruction minimal and not very fun. The arcadey fun racer has turned into a pseudo racing sim. Its been 2 years and next to nothing has been added.

I don't have a supercomputer but it's not a bad computer either ill put my specs at the bottom of this edit. My computer can handle Arma III on max and still run at 30 frames if there isn't a large scale confrontation happening, so why the hell can't i get more than 5 frames on here on the lowest graphics settings? I even turned down the amount of cars from 23 to 7 and it barely changed a thing. Ark Survival Evolved is more optimized than this which is pretty sad considering how long this game has been stuck in one stage I like to call the ""World of Tanks stage"" because thats exactly what the current stage reminds me of, a WoT clone but instead of tanks, it's cars. I really, really want to like this game because it's everything I love, yet somehow the developers somehow manage to screw up the game so badly that it's damn near unplayable for people with intermediate rigs. Bugbeat has a lot of ground to make up in my book and it already may be way too late for them even though THQNordic is helping them out now. At this point I highly reccomend that you do not buy this game in it's current state as it's unplayable in my experience and that's a really big problem that the devs need to iron out, not the players. I understand this is pre-alpha but this game has been in development for years only for what was a nice tech demo that ran fair on intermediate systems to running downright awful on said systems on the lowest possible graphics settings.Specs:AMD Phenom II X945 3.0 GHZ CPUAMD Radeon RX480 8GB GPU16GB of RAM***Edit EndDon't buy this cashgrab, its just a nearly abandoned project as of now.

You gave us Flatout, probably the greatest, most fun racing game series of all times that conquered hearts of many, including mine. For me Flatout 2 will always be the one and only out there.When GameSpy support was shut down and multiplayer became nomore, people almost forgot about you, yet kept playing your games. The fans found a way to play online even after the official online support was cut off. You know what it's called? Devotion. And also approval, it reflects the quality of your product, of your hard work that's been put into it to deliver. A silent thankful tribute to what you once did. You actually managed to do something incredible back then. Then after several years you came out of nowhere with NCG and made such a hype with this new project of yours, which was understandable, people remembered who gave them Flatout and supported you with EA. I heard you raised what, a couple millions at least?.. NCG was supposed to become a spiritual continuation, was supposed to become the new Flatout. But from the very first look at it, it was clear that something was wrong, at least for me. Something was terribly wrong. The far the worse, for the reasons unknown you've made that weird decision to overhaul the engine. Why, who asked for it? Did you do it in order to be able to have 24 players, i heard? Why, why such a need for such a mess on a track, whose idea was it? I think i know. That's a step towards the quantity over quality, which is never good. People on forums talk from your name. You know who i'm talking about, yes. Same people. All the time, everytime.Why couldn't you just stick to the good old Flatout concept of yours? NCG doesn't have to be EXACTLY like your old games, but it's become clear enough that you don't know yourselves where you're going with it, you're completely lost. Your game is neither a hardcore sim nor a fun arcade. And let's be honest, your fans just wanted the new Flatout. Including myself. Why couldn't you just stick to what you knew how to do like nobody else and decided to re-invent a wheel, will always remain mystery. Your community tore itself apart due to your highly controversial decisions. And now look at it. All that's left from the communty now is a tiny group of people. One and a half person play your game, servers are empty and deserted, i heard. The very same people who write on the forums under EVERY SINGLE POST that  rightfully criticize your unfinished, ugly mess, because there are no other words for your... creation, if it may be called so.  And they behave aggressively. And it's noone's fault but yours. You've had it all, all you had to do is follow your own instructions, but no! You've failed your own concept!

This being an Early Access title, it is subject to more bugs than released games.Menus aren't interesting enough. I feel like the buttons are too small. Keyboard and mouse navigation is ok, but gamepad users need to use the left stick to navigate sluggishly. You can open your car's boot, bonnet and doors for no reason other than to look at the things inside - if they allowed access to certain tuning categories and especially showed the engine change from upgrades, I'd like this feature more.Graphically, it lacks artistic flair but the technology is good. Something about the mildly muted colours puts me off from enjoying the rather spectacular impacts and particle effects.Engine sounds have an annoying, though admittedly somewhat realistic, tendency to be really quiet until you hit the high RPM band, then they're really loud. More diverse crash sound effects would be welcome. The same two songs we've heard for years are still the only actual music in this game.If you've played Flatout 1, 2 or Ultimate Carnage, the gameplay will feel pretty similar. It's either full contact racing or demolition derby arenas, with an added strategic layer as locational damage to your car's segments means you'll want to reverse into people to protect your vulnerable front end. The hybrid of locational damage and overall health strikes me odd, however, and cars can become wrecked if they lose both front wheels despite overall hit points being above half. The handling feels like too much of a simulation, with respect to banger cars not exactly being easy to drive. Shifting into reverse with a manual transmission is torture.This game initially had a Kickstarter campaign in, I believe, 2012 or 2013, but it was cancelled because it wasn't successful enough. In 2014, it hit Steam Early Access. The actual progress made on the game, to be honest, feels way too incremental. Major additions since the initial Steam version are: a rudimentary crew system, where you assign crew to each vehicle and allow maintenance on worn parts; multiplayer; several new cars and tracks; dozens of reworks for the handling and physics systems; and a Workshop page for mods and conversions. Bugbear insisted, initially, on avoiding the over-the-top ragdoll elements of Flatout so as to keep the age rating down... then we got lawnmower derbies, and wrecking or flipping tossed your driver around the field.What especially disappoints me about the €25 purchase I've made, is that now rumours are surfacing about Bugbear being in financial trouble and in danger of bankruptcy. What is most concerning is that they've also announced development on: two console versions of Wreckfest for the PS4 and XB1, AND a spin-off title, Stuntfest, which brings back Flatout's ragdoll tossing minigames as its selling point... and using the environment and many assets from the Wreckfest Sneak Peak Demo that you received if you purchased it from Early Access or Pre-ordered from their website. It's become clear to me that they're trying to cash in now while they still can. It's very unlikely that even a talented studio such as Bugbear could providefour gamesbefore running out of money. Oh and you need to buy Stuntfest separately, because pre-orders and EA purchases aren't getting Stuntfest. And to hammer the nail into the coffin, it increasingly feels like the addition of the Workshop to Wreckfest is so that the community picks up the game from where development will eventually cease, and make it into a ""complete game"", which I'm upset about.EDIT:Bugbear has announced that it is backed by a partner and it is now on track towards finalizing the game, in addition to openly acknowledging Wreckfest as its top priority.There might be hope for the game still, but until then, please refrain from buying it in its Early Access form."

Since then, there's been a major patch, plus a lot of little ones, that have improves the difficulty of the game and added more variation. You can no longer simply hold the gas down the entire time and braking in tight curves is needed to avoid crashed. Speaking of crashes, the crashing and damage has been upgraded as well and now you can really feel the imact of the crashes. You no longer flip as easily as before the big patch, but it is still possible to roll in the right circumstance.It is still early access, but I think it is worth the money. I've certainly put in enough hours to enjoy the game.One last note: If you see any review from June 30th to July 7th or so, ignore it. The physics engine has changed a lot since the June 30th update.

It litterally feels as if one person takes a weekend a month to type in a few lines of code to keep this game updated to a bare minimum. Steam should really REALLY force to implement a system to get your money back and bankrupt studio's who pull off stunts like this. If you want to have an early access game, you are basically asking for a kickstart. Not finishing the product is basically stealing money from people who trust the studio. And when you steal my money, I want it back. Period. That or give me what I paid for, investing money in a great concept and finish a functional game. This trend where people try out game design and quit half way through is getting out of hand. Same with Cube World. One guy earns millions. Wife comlpains he should focus more on his family and he stops updating the game. Litterally nothing new has come out there as well. Paying money for tech demo's? Has the market really changed where the gamers themselves are the investors? Are we supposed to take the risk with our money to pay for, not only an unfinished product, but the chance they abandon the project as well?If you want to pay for a really nice and original tech demo 27,99 is 27,99 too much for this title. No updates. Half a demo with barely any content or game design. Abandoning your game is a gamers crime and should not be accepted. Steam should really work on a envirionment where the gamer is put on the first place and this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behaviour stays unrewarded. Early acces should have a function that if too many people downvote the progress of this game, they should be able to get their money back. They are stealing from us while we trust them with our money. This is legal, but really should be made impossible. I know it's our choice to pay for it, but if the developer abandons the game the buyer should have the right to abandon the developer and get their money back.Do not buy this game anymore...

From a distance it looks like just another derstrcution derby type game that we all have seen times before that is amazing, yet get bored with after just a few hours of gameplay, but being that it was from the makers of Flatout 1 and 2. I had to do some research on it and as I dug into the game a little more I found out what the plans are for the future of the game and my perspective started to change a little.Now with this game being in an early state. There is a limit to whats available right now. You get 2 cars to choose from right now. One being your typical American Classic Muscle car and the other being a a small European Classic. Along with that you also recieve 3 tracks to play on. One Demolition Derby style track and 2 race tracks each with 3 modes of play including a 24 player race, a 12 player race, and a practice mode. There is also something included with Early Access that is called ""Next Car Game Sneak Peak 2.0"" Which Is pretty much a playground for enviroment and body damage testing.  Its actually really fun to just play around in.As for the physics and controls on the cars.  I was quite impressed as the destrction and just the overall feel for the cars felt quite unique and really smooth. The game features soft body damage and even environment damage that looks and acts far more realistic than any other game of this type has before. Right now the AI is a little aggressive and there is no difficulty option available at the moment so you will have to learn how to defend yourself against them. I reccommend practicing the tracks atleast once before starting a 24 player race. Multiplayer will be made available and players hosting will have options to customize the server by changing various options like private or public and allowing upgrades on vehicles or not. I can imagine a 24 player online race would be really intense in a game like this and definitley something I would want to experience.Along side all that there is vehicle upgrading and modifiying as well. You are limited on what you can change right now, but there are a few options. Alot of stuff is to be added later so expect to be spending alot of time in your garage customizing and tuning the 24 vehicles that are supposed to be released with the full game. Customization will include engine upgrades, body parts, and custom paintjobs altho the main focus it on the internal workings of the car itself. You will also have to change parts between races too as the parts will take damage and become worn out.  I have also read there will be an ingame classifieds section where you will be able to buy and sell cars and their parts, but not much was said about it. Lets hope this does get included.Overall I'm really looking forward to the initial release of this game as I have become quite bored with the very few tracks and cars available right now. Im hoping for a patch really soon.I highly reccommend this game to any racing game finatics and especially anyone that is a fan of the Flatout series. I have high hopes and expectations for the game so lets hope Bug Bear really puts their all into this."

I doubt I do have it however and the fact I bought it when it just exited greenlight on steam or around when it first came to steam and paid full price, never the less since it is still in EARLY ACCESS I refuse to allow them to try pull this BS.Oh yeah, now they are working on a new game without finishing this one, great, just what I wanted, an unfinished game because the devs found something shiny and decided it needed their attention other than this unfinished game which is comparable to a 3 year old currently on life support in need of life saving surgey, although this 3 year old may not get it, theres another 3 year old across the room that sneezed a couple times."

,Recommended,228380,13172285,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,Dave_Eagles,"I've long been a fan of racing games, and I have to say Burnout Paradise was one of my favourites, I played it to the point of obsession, up until i got that damn platinum trophy on PS3. I loved the driving, I loved the vehicle smashing, i loved the game and picking it up on PC I expected once again to have fun. However having already completed the game in full, I unfortunately no longer had the desire to do it all again.This game has filled my Burnout Paradise void.Whether it be in the crazy races which I never seem to win (but never get frustrated with), or whether it is in those Car derbies which turn into an orgy of metal blocks running on their own fumes in the middle. The chaos in this game just fills me with the same joy Paradise did all those years ago.Whilst there's not a lot available now in the game, I expect myself to get on and race to pass the time every now and again until more and more content becomes available. The smashing of the cars is the game's greatest strength and it never, gets old. This means there is tonnes of replayability if watching wrecks fly through the air is your thing (it is most certainly mine). There is nothing more satisfying than sending an opponent into stacked tires then watching them fly through the air with those same tires following behind him before showering down on his bonnet.The handling takes some getting used to, the extreme physicality that the other vehicles have sends your already hard to drive vehicle dancing and spinning from side to side as you try to gain control and move in a straight line. However once you do learn how to drive, you can take advantage of the sliding and turn into opponents during derbies or let them push you before you slide around at a corner in those races. Hard to master, but very rewarding.If racing or derbies get old for you, you will definitely want to check out the 2.0 demo. The smashing vehicles into crumbling textureless buildings and blue tires is oh so satisfying. A very fun way to pass the time. It makes we wonder if challenge maps will be availabe in the future in which users must navigate their way through traps to an end point. A lot of the 2.0 demo reminds me of the flatout games, were users would need to launch their car drivers out their windows towards a target. A similiar thing will hopefully be introduced in which users must get their vehicles the longest distance with the least damage or perhaps even most damage! 2.0 has welcomed a world of possibilities to this excitingly fun game.I'm looking forward to the future Bugbear, I hope you deliver and exceed everyone's expectations with what is already a solid racer.If car orgies and intensely chaotic races are your thing, I would most definitely pick up this title, and along with me, look forward to what's to come!"

76561198072204200,Recommended,228380,31026412,Posted: 8 April,all,HomerJT,"Firstly, let me say that I clearly understand why many people have a mixed opinion on this game at late. Yes, this game has been in development since 2013; since I started university. Yes, it is taking way too long to finish and people are losing patients with the long wait to a highly anticipated game, especially since the flatout license has been passed on to a developer that had dragged the Flatout name through the mud. In fact, I'm getting frustrated over the long wait for this game.Because from what there is at the moment, this game is fantastically fun and has huge potential, with a mix of Flatout & Destruction Derby. The visuals are beautiful and gorgeous to look at with huge amounts of detail, from paint scratches and shattering glass to the environment of the tracks and even the garage you are placed in at the start. The sound effects are blissful and wonders to the ears without being overpowering; everything from the crunching of cars into each other and other world objects are addictive to hear. The racing is fun with the mixture of destructable scenary from the Flatout games and rally style racing. Alongside everything else, the modding community is awesome to see, providing everything from racetracks from Destruction Derby 1 and 2, extra cars and other features!If I were to add any flaws to this game, there is honestly only two; the framerate when the screen is cluttered with many cars and effects going on in one place. And finally, and the most obvious among the many negative opinions among gamers; the game is taking to long to finish off fully and the updates to the game are usually far between each other.Other than that, the game is fantastic and has huge potential, and in fact it is one of my favourite recently made games! To everyone else, I completely understand you frustration over this game's overly long production cycle. But bear in mind that Bugbear is a small indie game producer now compared to its days when it produced the Flatout games. But hopefully, now that they have a permenant backer, the game could be close to completion. And with the amount of work they put into this game and the potential this game has, I'm looking forward to the final outcome! :)"

I remember a new car being added within the first year of me owning the game, but not much else. I took a ~2 year break from playing, and was hopeful to return to additional content and a greater online community. You can tell where this is going. Nothing noteworthy has been added (i think there is a new track and maybe a couple new cars). The game is still terribly optimized and barely runs on my (albeit outdated) crossfire 7850's.

This is still an early build, but already impressive. The car damage model is probably the best I've seen in a game. The graphics also look outstanding, though the game requires a powerfull PC to max things out. Car handling is somewhere between realism and arcade though driving aids are avaialble and even with these on, the cars act in a plausible manner. That said, this is not something you would play with a wheel. It's supported alright, but what good is a cockpit view, when yur can hardly see anything with the dust and bent bonnet after the first corner. PLaying on a wheel in 3rd person... Not really that fun.That said, this racing game has huge potential.So should you buy it? If  you are expecting a lot of content and hours of fun out of the box, think again. This is an alpha build, and while a lot of elements are in place, the content is limited to a few cars and tracks, no career mode, just single races / destruction derbys. At this point, buying is sort of an early investment and supporting the devs. I am sure though, that once the game is complete, it will be a gread racer for anyone, who is tired of your typical clean racing sims and street racing games."

Good graphics and hilarious damage modeling. Mutliplayer that works really well. Still Early access so only more goodness can come hopefully.After many more hrs into this game I can still say this is fun as hell. Still waiting on lastest patch but if you follow the Bugbear forums you can see they are making significant progress. Don't listen to anyone saying this game is dead. The devs are posting once a week and seem to be very responsive to community needs. Paid 3X as much for Nascar 14 and having so much more fun with this even in its' unfinished state.

Do I regret the buy? No, because I had my money worth of fun.Would I recommend the game at this point? Depends on you. On a Sale, for driving around a bit, this game definitely deserves a buy. If I'd be Bugbear I'd sell it for 20€ because that's the minimum you get out of it's state right now. A few tracks a few cars and it drives and looks good. Nice soundtrack too.It's also fun to drive with friends. If the future of Wreckfest wouldn't be as critical I'd recommend it immediately because the last few patches really showed ""it's worked on!"".What do I mean? Well, Bugbear is starting to develop another game called Stuntfest.Therefore the many bad reviews. Now at first you'd think: ""Meh this will take away time they'd spend on developing Wreckfest."" This is true in a way.I'm not sure if Wreckfest is dead, but according to their website and also the recent updates it's far from dead. I'm not sure if they will use the car models from Stuntfest in Wreckfest. It would be great if they'd do that because it takes a lot of time modelling one. If not than we can at least be happy with what we got with Wreckfest. Yes at first I was disappointed on the fact that it probably won't finish to a game they promised us but we all should make sure to not forget that we bought: an early access title, meaning we bought ""what we have at this point"".And as many software projects fail, a game can fail too. I'm sure Bugbear did not want to drop Wreckfest. As I said above, it's not safe to say that they dropped it. Sometimes working on another game will give them the opportunity to generate money to stay afloat and refresh creativity. You remember that they are also people and that it's their job combined with a high risk of failing. Wreckfest didn't generate that tonne of revenue. They are probably struggling at this point because Wreckfest did not get as much traction, hype wise as estimated. The only logical decision to stay on the market is to create another game.Does it mean we can't trust Bugbear anymore? It's up to you. I say we can still trust them, I think they maybe will show their dedication of creating games in the next one.Conclusion: I'd never support an EA title with deluxe edition again, because that's the only content I didn't get. Also I think Bugbear would do better on selling the games cheaper to get more people to buy it. 20€ and at max 25€ is what many would pay for an early access title and not feel sad when their dropped 40€ are spend on a game that is no further developed."

Graphically, this game is beautiful and the Engine it runs on wants to run it that way too. Never once did I feel that this game even looked sub-par. The Tech-Demo that you get  when you pre-order it is alone worth $25. I could play, just that Tech-Demo, for years. But, ofcourse, you also get the PRE-Alpha. Keep in mind that it's PRE, and it's already better than most finished products i've played. The destruction mechanic blew my mind. It is definetly the best destruction Engine i've ever seen. Just the way the debris mesh together, or get blow sky high, made me feel powerful. For instance, instead of driving around in a car, you can press C twice (In the Tech-Demo) to leave the car and fly around, destroying things as some flying demon. It's THE best Pre-Alpha i've ever played, and it's ONE of the best GAMES i've ever played, and I can't wait to see what the finished version of this maginficent game will look like."

,Not Recommended,228380,35145640,Posted: 22 September,all,Pat (ty cake),"Looking past the developers' abandonment of this product, the game used to be great. It's now representative of a game created by a first year english major, who does not possess a driver's license, has never seen a real car drive on dirt, and has never even been a passenger in a vehicle, on a remote alien planet, where gravity's strength is dependant upon an objects forward speed. Posessing only a vague understanding of what a ""transmission"" is, on this alien planet an object's forward momentum is all-powerful; even when sideways, the gearing of a car takes orders according to speed, rather than RPM. This hypothetical ""intelligent"" being also has the quaintest of understandings of tires and grip - leading to the puzzling feat of a 319 horsepower engine transferring it's power to a dirt path, in a straight line, and accelerating at a comparable rate of that of a 400 horsepower car on earthen concrete, but unable to accelerate at 10% throttle in a slight bend without sending it's rear bumper out to graze the spectators.The game used to be wonderful, as I said. Somewhere in the 4 year period I stopped playing the game it was sucked into the vacuum of space through an industrial woodchipper and handed over to an isolated child-colony of never-never-land to be plastered back together with only 1 roll of gaffer tape, a melted chocolate bar, and their own excrement.In short, it is now an orphaned disaster worthy of at most thirty cents. Throw in what used to be a physics engine and you might have a five dollar value. It would take a telethon of a universal scale and all the galaxy's highest tear programming establishments to salvage what was left after the 4 year ragnarok that is ""early access -- pre-alpha"""

I'll add a TL:DR down there. This review will most likely change to a thumbs up in the future.At this time, I cannot recommend this game. Pretty much just for one very obvious reason. At only half hour played, it isn't a fair time period to propely demo the game, but time isn't a factor for the reason I can't endorse this right now. Read on, or skip to the end.+ Graphics: Very pretty. The entire visual portion of this game is great. The cars, the effects, the debris flying off, the lighting... pretyy much all of it. Excellent job.+/- Sounds: For the most part the sounds are well done. The engines sound good, the collisions have goot impacts... On the down side, the engine sounds get monotonous. The constat revving, and the poor localization of sound makes it sound like someone is constantly right behind you.+ Gameplay Options: With the standard demolition derby and destruction races, there really isn't much else to want for. It's a great modern adaptaion of the Destruction Derby games for PSOne+/- Physics: Almost entirely positive here. It a game based upon the physics of objects colliding. It does this very well on almost every area. There was only one thing that struck me as out of place while I was playing >  I saw an AI car get some unrealistic height out of a jump(sand pile), and then proceed to change direction in the air. It was a small thing I guess, and I'm not holding it against the game.- Controls: This is the reason I can't sign off on this game right now. Only control option at the moment(incomplete game, this will most certianly be addressed) is keyboard. Meaning DIGITAL controls. It's a racing/driving game which requires an amount of finesse that can be frustrating with only digital controls as an option. Not everyone has access to a steering wheel set up for their PC, but everyone has some other analog devices at their disposal. Most people have a controler with thumbsticks for analog input and triggers for analog throttle. EVERYONE has a mouse, or some form of trackpad input. Euro Trucker 2 has made this work as an option for people who don't have a wheel.TL:DR - Keep your eye on this one. It's a good game, and fun in it's current state. The deciding reason for a thumbs down are the controls. I'm certain this will change, and my review will aslo change at that time.I'm stopping at under 2 hours of play time in the hope that it goes on a better sale before the event end. Either way, I may just return it and wait for more changes to take place. It is an 'early access', and it's nice that we finally have a risk free way of trying things. IDOlike this game and will most likely just hold onto it until it becomes more complete.P.S. Seriously Valve, WTF?! This binary yay/nay, good/bad, black/white, review system has to go. Give some sort of rating system to more accurately reflect someone opinion of the game. This shouldn't be a thumbs down. It should be a 6/10, or something."

,Recommended,228380,22827580,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Go Towards The Light,"TL:DR - 8.5/10, the game has come a very long way, its a solid arcadey simulation with a lot of fun to be had on multiplayer, worth it for anyone to check out, especially when its on sale.Update: The updates keep coming in and slowly but surely the game is starting to shape up nicely, if it goes on sale definitely pick this game up.Do you remember Destruction Derby for the Playstation One? I do, and I freaking loved it. Sadly that game would be absolutely unbearable nowadays. Thats where Wreckfest comes in.The great thing about Wreckfest is that it isnt just Derby. There are circuit tracks on tarmac, and gravel. You have a small variety of cars to choose from and with recent updates there is a progression system so you can finally start from the bottom and work your way up.Now, Wreckfest wasn't always as good, and wasn't always recieving updates as frequently as it is now. The good folks developing this gem have spent some time ironing out their version of car physics so that racing can be exciting and enjoyable for all car classes. The damage modeling they have done is great and its extremely satisfying to see your car get wrecked up during semi-clean contact racing.This game has come a long way and the developers truly appear committed to completing this game and having it stand on its own in a sea of racing sims. A racing sim you will not find here. This is an arcade style simulation with the flavour of real physics behind it. You can enjoy it with wheel, a controller, or even a keyboard and you will not feel at a disadvantage which to me is extremely important. Although with a wheel you could probably have a great deal of fun drifting through corners in their new Asian Drifter style car(kind of looks like an old skyline).The absolutely best part of this game though has got to be its Multiplayer. This game is like the DayZ of racing games when you are online, its just awesome. Most of the players that stick with this game prefer a Semi-Clean racing style, so you will enjoy the bump and grind of a derby, but against the backdrop of a circuit race. Its incredible how much fun you can have when you get a server full of people to race so clean no one is intentionally hitting, but everyone is trying to get in front and you have cars going 3 wide through corners without wrecking, but instead shoving and pushing each other out of the way as they jostle for that lead position....And then. You might join a server with no rules at all, and you'll be wiping the tears from your eyes because for the first time ever you're in first place, and then crunch! Both your front wheels are gone, your engine is bent in half and there is a smoldering wreck of a car from a player going backwards on the track, probably giggling and laughing hysterically in front of their screens as they watch 4 or 5 more cars plow into you, turning your car into a smoldering wreck aswell.To each their own to be sure, but man the multiplayer can be wicked fun. I hope they make it so you can play the entire game progression wise on multiplayer. Right now you simply get all the cars for free but dont earn anything, and if you choose to race with a car you do own, you don't really earn enough for it to be worth while.Anyways, thanks for reading, this game is an easy 8/10 as it is, because it really is that fun. It will climb to a solid 9/10 by the time all the content is in and they leave early access."

They assured everyone that the game will be finished, maybe not at the predetermined date but we waited this long I am okay with it as long as it keeps getting better over time.TLDR, its fun, and a splash between simulation and arcade, but it clashes in certain places. Content is a little thin right now but the game is moving forward slowly but steadily. A very solid 3.5/5 as it sits in its demo state. Tech demo bonus is a blast.Now lets start with Pros. The game looks good. Cars have a nice destruction to them, the tracks are more realistic right now and they feel like real courses. (though the few mod tracks I have played with jumps and more arcade style play is more my personal speed) The interface of the games menus are set up like a Warthunder style, pick crew, check parts, chose paint and stuff like that all confined to neatly set drop downs. There is multiplayer, and it works pretty well for what I have played and it feels a lot better to drive with a bit more unpredicatbility since the AI just stick to the middle of the tracks and take turns very safely. The sound effects so far are good. Cars are loud and crashes have appropriate noises and smashes to acompany the shatter of lights, windows, and the car in general. The music as of right now is... forgettable? Its serves its purpose but it isn't anything that is gonna change your life.Now some cons. It still feels like a demo. Which at the time it is. Tracks are pretty, but certain assets are not set in stone and unfinished still. The cars all look very nice but there is only a handful to chose from (and one lawnmower, which is funny and welcome) There isn't a single player really, and there isn't anything to progress too right now. So you just race for the sake of racing which can do it for some people, but the controls are a mix between a simulation and an arcade and it feels off sometimes. And I can't imagine most people who like simulations taking it seriously as it is, and I can't see arcade style races enjoying the bit of simulation that you feel saps a lot of the wacky stuff you could otherwise do. But if you like both it serves it purpose as an inbetween. And for a game about cars, especially lately, I feel it a bit odd to have so few customisation options.To finish with some personal thoughts. I absolutely adored the flatout games. They changed my whole way of thinking when it came to racing games. As a kid I hadn't played anything like it. Where there wasn't wacky missle powers but you could still destroy another racers car. It was so rewarding to take a turn just right, ruining the storefront you drifted through to get your turbo meter up, and then hit the boost at just the right time to scream around the corner. The ability to play so aggresively and be rewarded, or play it safe and cool and be just as well off. The maps were tight, interesting, and fun to play again and again. The main single player wasn't much of a story but the feeling of progression came from upgrading and getting newer faster cars. Going throught the multiple teirs and different styles of racing. I would highly recommend it to anyone.I feel like this game is... trying very hard to appeal to both the simulation drivers like gran turismo and forza, while trying to keep its more arcady and fun feel and it clashes more than blends. They have a wonderful destruction engine and it seems to be used hardly at all in most races because the tracks are very realistic, with only the figure 8 right now feeling like the ""for fun"" map. I could just be hung up with it since i love it so much, but flatout seemed to really hit all the right spots of welcoming new people with controls that were forgiving enough to let them play correctly and eventually you could really press the controls and your skills to the limit, all while staying above a 50mph speed on sharp turns because you could always pocket a bit of boost.I would love to see this game lean a bit more toward jumps, and obstacles, and things that really show off what attracted me in the first place which was the wonderful sight of car being crunched by stuff in the tech demo. But the way it is crashing is so punishing because there is no way to reaccelerate, and one medium crash could set you out of first place instantly which seems to go so hard against all the work they put into the flying car parts and paint rubbing. But that doesn't mean completely lose the realism, I do like what is here. The tracks feel real, which is a neat experience in its own right. And i would love to see both some sick♥♥♥♥♥jumps in some maps and some tight turns and competetive driving in others.I would like to see the turbo boost come into this game. Just something that makes this game stand out from many other racing games where crashing is the end of a race. When you have car programmed to lose bumpers, don't punish people for seing that lovely piece of programming.Bugbear keep up the good work. Value good content over consistent releases.  I am excited to see where this game goes."
,Recommended,228380,12781325,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,Zycorax,"Wreckfest has the potential to become one of the greatest racing games ever in my opinion. The game is made by the same guys that made the Flatout series (excluding Flatout 3) and it's more or less a spiritual successor of these games, so if you liked Flatout, chances are that you'll love Wreckfest.-Performance-The game looks really good on high graphics settings and runs smoothly most of the time (the only FPS drop I've had was when a car with a smoking engine drove right in front of the camera at some point). I've only had it crash once in the 7.5 hours I've played and it was just while trying to start a single player race.-Driving-The driving fits in somewhere in the middle between arcade and sim racing, maybe leaning a bit more towards sim. I've been using a 360 controller when I've been playing and it's been working really well for me. I've found that I often have to correct the steering a little while turning, something I would imagine is a lot harder to do successfully with a keyboard (although I haven't tried), so a controller of some kind is probably recommended.-Crashing-As the name suggests, one of the main elements in this game is crashing. I think all of the bodywork of the car can be destroyed and it probably will after you've rolled over five times after getting t-boned by a competitor that didn't bother trying to avoid your car while you were recovering from that spin. The visual destruction looks good, though maybe a bit over the top. You start wondering how you can still drive when your car is suddenly a metre shorter than it was when you started the race. Your car can take quite a lot of punishment before breaking down. In some cases you can actually keep racing (albeit not very well) even if you're missing a wheel.Some of the tracks also features some small, steep hills along the tracks, which works really well as ramps. It's always amusing to watch the AI drivers in front of you fail to take the turn properly and launch themselves into the air before suffering the consequences of a not very clean landing. Until you arrive at the same corner and understeers terribly or receives a shunt from the guy behind you and suffer the same fate.Cars that breaks down stays on the race track until the race is over, adding extra obstacles to the track. In longer races you'll often see piles of cars in some places.-Cars-Right now there's only five cars to choose from. Each of them comes with five liveries and some performance customisation. Hopefully there will be a lot more to choose from when the game is finished. On the bright side, the current cars feels quite different to each other, at least the ones I've tried do. The American muscle cars (there's two of them) are fast and heavy, but seems to be struggling a bit in sharp turns, while the little European coupe is both fast and handles really well, it gets pushed around easily.-Tracks-There's currently nine different tracks, something I also hope will be expanded in the future. Out of these three of them are demolition derby arenas, which I'm personally not really a fan of. The six others are more or less proper race circuits. There's three basic tracks in different environments with different surfaces, one tarmac, one gravel and one sandpit (my personal favourite. All of these three also come with a reverse layout, which actually feels quite different from the normal version.There's also an oval track, which has an alternate figure-8 version and a pure figure-8 track.The last one is a work-in-progress sandpit circuit that comes in two slightly different layouts (plus their reverse layout). These works perfectly well, if you don't mind the missing ground textures off the track.-Singleplayer-The only game mode at the moment is single races. All of the tracks works with up to 23 AIs with an upper limit of ten laps. The AI isn't very fast over one lap, so if you take an early lead you can expect a rather uneventful race, unless you do any major mistakes. However, if you get bogged down at the start and find yourself in the middle of the pack, you're in for a challenge. The AI likes to get in your way, so while you're fighting your way through the field, the leader will often be next to impossible to catch.Single races against the AI is only fun for so long, so some sort of career mode would probably dot he game good.-Multiplayer-I haven't played multiplayer a lot yet, but I've certainly enjoyed it. A multiplayer game has to be hosted by the players, ideally by someone who has a good internet connection (8 Mbps upload is recommended according to the Create Game window in game). Multiplayer supports up to 24 players and I have to say, the more the merrier. Having 24 cars on the oval track (which appears to be the most popular online by far) is guaranteed to be a mess. There seems to usually be at least one or two who just tries their best to crash into people to ruin their race, but they're nowhere near as annoying as they were on GRID, mostly because the cars in Wreckfest are a lot more durable. I've had some good racing online, including a battle with another guy that lasted for nearly three laps and at some point I also got two takedowns in a race, despite trying my best to avoid any collissions.-Conclusion-The game itself is great and I recommend trying it out if you like games like Flatout or the demolition derby races in GRID. Just keep in mind that the game isn't finished yet and because of that it feels a little light on content."

For me there are 2 racing games that are absolutely without rival, Gran Turismo3:A-spec and Flatout2, they are great because they give you a great race, a fear of crashes, huge enjoyment from hitting other cars and the damage done (to the car or just their position), and just a bag full of fun.Wreckfest is a lot of fun and has the potential to give everything you could want from a racing game so could be one of the great racing games once it has been finished.Aug 2016:Still a good game, it is still in alpha but has impoved a lot in terms of everything really. Thus-far Wreckfest has not had me addicted to it in the way I had hoped it would (as Flatout 2 did) but the game has kept me coming back to it, although sporadically. The addition of new tracks/vehicles as well as the announcing of a new HUD and Career mode etc has definately kept me watching the updates and jumping back on. The newer damage mechanic is much better than it was in my opinion, making the superbowl derbys amazing fun and carnage.Conclussion: Still a great game, heaps of fun, it is still being worked on in a big way so there are updates still coming.  I DO still recommend this game but I would grab it on sale and grab it at the same time as a few friends. The reviews that slate this game DO have ground to stand on, it can be frustrating and irritating, the actual races send me over the top, but the stadium derbys are amazing. hopefully the developers will sort it out though as the updates seem to have CRAZY gaps between them.... Pull your finger out BugBear.I would still recommend Wreckfest as the spiritual successor to Flatout 2 and that alone endears Wreckfest to me at a level only reached by these 2 games and Gran Turismo."

And, greater yet, is it worth your time playing? R: AbsolutlySo, Demolition Racing games haven't been a great bet since the 90s; they have tried with Test Drivre: Eve of destruction and Dirty: showdown, but then wreckfest made me witness things within the game that I haven't seen so far in any car derby game I have ever played. The graphics are amusing, trying to be as realistic as possible and the physics of the game is something new, revolutionary I would say since the game is not being made by no great company, FlatOut is good... but you know...You can put up to 23 cars racing simultaneously, what takes the carnage to the next level. The UI is good, nothing bad that I have noticed or disturbed my games so far.Also I think Steam should learn something here with this game; Since the ""Early access"" thing I have seen some really Shi* games being released, I think All games and game developers should do an Early access with the quality and well polished job that Wreckfest Already has.I have nothing to say against this game, BUT the dirty trick, low blow so-called ""Digital deluxe version"" that gives you an exclusive car or something; Do I recommend you to buy this game?! the answer is yes, BUT!!! ONLY the normal version, I believe the developers have forgotten what is the meaning of EARLY ACCESS selling; This is not a Sale this is a BET on something you have no Idia of the final product or even if the final product will be delivered, early access buyers are the ultimate supporters, we should be treated as kings with all the best.Hope this was useful ^^ Thanks.-Rony"

,Recommended,228380,8738038,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,Optipissed Prime,"This is the Flatout game I've been waiting for since the first Flatout, my favourite racing game of all time. This game is all about semi-realistic driving physics and down and dirty racing/demolition. This is by no means an easy racing game. From what I read of the negative reviews, most people were expecting a successor to the arcade style Flatout games (Flatout 2 and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage). Do not buy this game if you want to win every race by default, take corners at 300 km/h, or even finish the race. Each car (so far and I expect in the full release, as in the first Flatout) has it's own driving characteristics that takes time to master and I recommend a gamepad or wheel for proper gas control. To quote the top negative review ""Why even have races in this game when you have no control over the car what so ever?"" This person has obviously never driven a 300/500 horsepower muscle car and is using a keyboard. If all you hit is full gas you're just gonna do circles. This difficulty leads to a deep appreciation for how much work has already gone into the destruction of both the cars and environments. The 24 car starts are beautiful as everyone jockies for position, often leading to spectacular end over end crashes that require quick reactions to avoid, lest you be caught up in it. When you mess up a corner or are shoved off track by a rival racer and smash into the cement barriers for the first time you're amazed at how the wall realisticly crumbles. And that's just one of the many items to crash into and destroy on your way to learning how to survive and then eventually win. I can't wait to see where this game goes and would already recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first Flatout or enjoys a satisfying, beautiful and challenging racing game.TL;DR: BUY if you like Flatout 1, destruction, challenge and semi-realistic physics. DO NOT BUY if you want a fast, arcade style, easy racer or a successor to Flatout 2 or Flatout Ultimate Carnage."

The game has been in pre-alpha for a year and a half, and no new content has been added. The obstacle course is great, for about 5 minutes but after that it is just boring. The actual game is ok, but doesn't really differ from map to map. I also had no clue how to speed up faster than the other racers. and my final problem is the hardcore lag. For this game, even offline, you need a computer that has a great graphics processor for the game to run smoothly. My computer isn't directly made for gaming, but does have ok specs.

,Recommended,228380,31756616,Posted: 14 May,all,JDubz,"Next Car Game: WreckfestWreckfest is a game similar to the Flatout series but more focused upon the demolition derby aspect. You race on through grinding against the wall and back at your opponents and trading paint against one and another. The race is on, first place is the winner!What's included with Early Access?The game at its current state isn't perfect but rather playable.Vehicles: There's a fair amount of cars to pick from. You start from Class D vehicles to class A and have the option to upgrade your vehicles. BugBear also updated Lawn Mowers in the scoop, that's entertaining in my opinion.RaceTracks: There's a fair amount of racetracks too. You have  Figure 8's, Demolition Derby Arenas, Rally based racetracks, and the classical oval races.Weather: There isn't any word yet on any weather systems implanted in the game. There are only two options of Sunny-MidDay or clear Dusk.There's apparently a mod for an alternative, but I can't confirm if it worksDamage: Every bump, jump, and slams you make will cost your vehicle to be damaged. You have a limited health for your vehicle, make sure your careful so you don't get that DNF.Note: Damage can be altered with several mods to realism. The Vanilla of the game is more in an Arcade feeling.Is there any Mod support?Steam Workshop has this all ready to go for ya. You can download several mods to new cars, racetracks, and modifications for damage control and with AI configures. Although, there isn't a lot but I'm seeing more and more mods being added as time goes on.Final VerdictIf you want a game that's a stress reliever, then I would suggest getting this game as an Early Access. Seeing your car and your opponents can be quite entertaining, especially dealing with the Figure 8's. It's complete chaos!Unfortunately for having the game as Early Access, there isn't a whole ton of content. I feel that this game isn't being focused a lot as it should be based upon updates. But at least for the Steam Workshop, that'll help me stay occupied coming back and forth to this game.I try to refrain from final ratings on Early Access games as they can often change the sense of balance and directions.I guess I'll try something else this time for the rating:  'Don't screw this up.'"

,Recommended,228380,8755193,"Posted: 18 January, 2014",all,Reki,"First off, I would like to say that the idiot that gave this a negative review for this game because The ""main layout"" of the game is a ""ripoff"" of World of Tanks, just because it has simmilar features it isn't the same thing as a complete ""ripoff"" With that, he also called it a beta, which is horribly wrong, and he obviously has no idea what he is talking about.Now to the actual review...This game, just in the physics playground was worth the money. It has the feel of something between DiRT and FlatOut, (more leaning towards FlatOut) but also has the car handling of Forza, those are also my favorite car games. Alot of people are saying oh, it doesn't feel like FlatOut, but they are not trying to make a FlatOut remake, they are making a new game. The handling is fantastic if you know how to use it, do not keep on the accelerator the whole time, let off around turns. You can do this easier with a controller, but I can manage it fine on a mouse and keyboard. Negative right now is preformance, but as it is in early alpha, I see no problem with it, especially considering how many things are on screen at once. The demolition derby is pretty fun, but I really love the races. Racing with 3 tires, a broken engine, and no doors is pretty insane, and it really isn't comparable to anything else, the destruction is something like Beam NG Drive, but it has better car handling, because Beam NG is a damage simulator, not a racing game. Overall, as an alpha, I would give this 9.1/10"

It's amazing, the damage engine is wonderful. I'll admit it won't run well on lower end systems, my computer can handle high settings but my laptop (GT 750M, 12GB RAM, i7 4th gen etc) can run it medium-ish settings at a constant 40-50fps but does have lag spikes if there's a lot of carnage going on. But don't let that deter you from purchasing this game, I've played this on an average laptop using the intergrated graphics and it runs actually okay as long as the graphical settings are at low.Now to the actual gameplay. Racing, crashing, debris everywhere... it's so fun. Sometimes I just find myself hiding in a corner of the map just watching the AI do its thing and boy does it! The AI will ram you until you're on your last legs and then kick you with its tires while you're down.Completing a track...? Pffft, as if. I've never completed a track and that's what makes it so wonderful. I don't even want to finish a track, I just want to crash into people and make other cars flip.I really enjoy this game and you should too.

I am writing this in July 2014 and it's not even in alpha; yet, the game still manages to look, feel, and react like you would expect a final product. Cars handle exactly like you would want them to handle, damage modeling is outstanding and overall the sound and graphics are impressive.To me I am not seeing a $30 half made game. I am seeing an opportunity to fund something that could become something truly amazing and with the reputation that Bugbear has, I am sure we will see exactly that.Some complain there is not enough content and that updates are slow. I don't really see that. Content comes once every few weeks and when it comes it is impressive enough for me to launch up the game for another fuel-filled run.At this point the pre-alpha has 4 cars, 7 tracks, full customization, LAN support, and full 23-vehicle races.The damage model in itself is outstanding and more than enough for nuts like me to keep playing.

You're given what is basically a place to test game physics as well as the very early basics of the game. The latter is where the fun really is. You're given 3 car types, that can be modified. There's a demo derby, a figure eight track, etc. Not much, but enough to get a good solid glimpse of what's to come. You'll be racing around with a few dozen other cars, and expect the track to quickly get littered with debris. Everything on the cars seems to be deformable and destroyable. The walls, bails, tire piles, etc all seem to be too. Don't expect to bounce off a wall and keep driving, this is much more realistic and you're going to get wrecked. That said, it's not SO realistic that you're out of the race after you've crushed your car into a cube. Of course that's part of it's charm.I'm looking forward to this being fleshed out more, and when this goes multiplayer it's going to be a huge hit!"

The physics are impressive, and the AI drivers are fairly challenging and have a tendency to smash into each other around a corner.

Just like Destruction Derby on the Playstation but BETTER, Next Car Game revives the child in me that just wants to see cars DESTROY eachother! Car parts, tires, bumpers go FLYING along with destructible enviroments like concrete and tire walls. First person view included! You can see the window smash before your very eyes as you ram your vehicle head first into an oncoming opponent.Two gamemodes, Classic derby and Race track (two race tracks to try) for alpha. Derby is like an Arena but the gladiators are CARS. You can choose if you want to compete against 12 or 24 opponents, free for all, always. When you drive straight into the middle at full SPEED you don't know where you'll end up and all you see is smoke and fire until everyone clears and your lying upside down in a graveyard of metal and glass. The ANTICIPATION is amazing when you're tailing an opponent and you yell ""Boom!"" as you drive into them causing mayhem as you do.The race tracks are even better. Choose 12 or 24 opponents, race on gravel or tarmac. Drive fast and never look back because everything happens in front of you. Cars flip, roll and burst into flames. You need to dodge your way to first place and when you're there you need to watch out for opponents that will try to take you out with force, be prepared for anything.I was rolling in tears as I witnessed an opponent drive off a ramp and out the stadium, next, two vehicles persued me and tried to elimate me from the Derby so I slowed down, spun left and watched them collide into me. All I saw was blue sky and then I hit the road and landed safely on my wheels but half of my vehicle was missing. Collision is everything, your car will literally dissapear as pieces of it get lost in every collision, so make sure each one counts.I was driving fast down a long road then I came to a left turn and slowed down. What I saw at the bend was pure chaos, some vehicles had driven into the barrier and blocked the road so everyone had to drive through them. I made my attempt and piled into the mass, I couldn't see what was in front of me from all the smoke but I finally made it out and realised I had two vehicles in front of me driving the opposite way!At the finish line I was making it into my second lap of the race but my driving skills were put to the test as wrecked vehicles littered the entire course from the first lap, I went left then right then left again and thought I was through until two drivers came hurdling from my right, one of them flipped and rolled across the track and suddenly I had to dodge a moving vehicle! My heart was racing. I came 13th in that race. I am yet to come first in any race.Just like Destruction Derby only better.

Some modded tracks can have texture issues, but this is not suprising. The AI are crazy, but can be too easy to beat at times.  Overall though the AI is good. I also enjoy the Cars that the game does have. The vanilla tracks are fun overall, but sometimes lacking in terms of difficulty or creativity.Cons: If you strip away the workshop options, this game is lacking content big time. Only a handful of vanilla cars and tracks exist. If there were no mods allowed or if they did not exist, I would have never gotten this game. The game as it is without mods is not even a $10 dollar game, let alone a $40 dollar game. The mods are the only thinbg that make this game worth playing, which is a shame. The only reason I even recomend this game is because of the mods, and even then its better to wait until it goes on sale. I also dont like how it forces you to earn money and buy cars and parts right off the bat. That should be saved for a career mode. And the fact thast parts go bad can quickly turn an A class car into a C-class car. Very annoying(But should exist in a career mode).Things that need to improve/be added:Add a paint booth: Please!!!!! this would massively draw appeal and add a creative element to the gameAdd a Career mode: This needs to be added, using some of the curren features. Along with this have a separate arcade mode where you can choose any car, at any class, on any track.Add more tracks and cars: Another must happen. The current vanilla options are only a small handful.Add sandbox options to arcade mode: Options such as choosing what the AI drives as far as who drives what and how skilled they are, choosing your starting position along with choosing the ai starting positions.Add a track ceator/editor that is easy to use: Even if its a separate application!Allow replays to be saved: For those of us who forget to run Fraps while playing the game.In conclusion, this is a very fun game to play. However, it lacks content. But the developers are looking to fix this starting in February of this year, and Hopefully this will turn into a great game. Again, if it wasnt for the mods, I would not buy this game. But this game has mods, and they are a blast to play! So yeah. Buy this game... when its on sale of course!"

76561198112235271,Not Recommended,228380,20216443,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,G.B.Datenshi_408,"So I bought this game while it was on sale, and I am satisfied so far. To all of those people expecting an upgraded version of Flatout, don't buy it yet. It needs A LOT of work to come close to that. But if you are look for a game that has a clear potential of being so, then this is the one to buy.One of the best parts of the game is clearly the realistic soft body system. The metal bends according to where you hit the car and how hard you hit the car, something which you often don't see in racing games. There is a problem to this though... it is too realistic. During these few minutes I have been playing I saw 2 cars with their roof literally flattened to the point the driver should have been killed... and to the point where the steering wheel popped out of the roof so yeah, the car's soft body physics are taken seriously too far.The game modes that are offered are vast for a game in pre-alpha. Figure of 8, plain old destruction derby, mudbowls, you name it. Although this game is meant to be a destrction derby type of game, I would really like to see tracks where you can plainly race since it would give you a relaxing breath after all the mayhem.The car choice so far looks promising, although I hope that more are added tp the list... much more. I mean 10 cars is hardly a selection right? But the models are awesome, nothing too flashy but don't all look like rust buckets. Another interesting feature regarding cars is the ability to change its parts. For example, you can change your stock exhaust manifold to a racing exhaust manifold provided that your car is compatible with the upgrade.Something that really sucks though is the career... because there is actually NO career mode yet. For f***'s sake why the hell didn't you include a friggin' career mode?? People, this game has been in early access for whole months and it doesn't have a simple career mode yet? So yeah, no career mode yet...Another thing that I really didn't like is the fact that they put in the feature to repair your car's parts as they can be bought in a used condition thus not being totally efficient... but you can't use it for some reason. So the button is there, the concept is on the plate in front of you but you can't touch it cause your hands are tied behind the chair. That's exactly how it is.Finally, I would like to talk about the game's damage system. It is total bull****. I seriously wouldn't recommend hitting the other cars, in fact avoid them. This is because you will get huge damage all the same. In destruction derby I ended up finishing 22nd but I was (according to the statistics at the end of the game) the hardest hitter... so shouldn't I have the honour of being 1st?? Especially if I wasn't hit during any part of the race but only hit other cars?? Yeah, it needs some work.In conclusion, although I like the game so far it still isn't worth getting at full price. But if you manage to find it on sale grab it. I did have fun playing this game but some crucial details are missing, and they must be implemented fast. The developers are getting lazy as a lot of games that were in early access after it were completed before it. And honestly I don't want to feel that I wasted my money on this, it has the potential to be a GREAT game."

The Early Access phase is not yet completed and the game has still a lot of bugs, no ""storry mode"" and the tuning sytem is also not quite finished.

They also have a few absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicles that you'll use once and then never use again like the tractor for instance. And they did add some refined handling from what they had at the start.they also added a crew management and upgrading car mechanic to the game but it honestly feels tacked on and is more a nuisance then anything. Plus they way they have it there are only one or 2 cars everyone will use in multiplayer because all the other cars are to slow and cant compete, it generally pretty cut and dry you win if you have the better car.Multiplayer is pretty much dead, no dedicated servers at all, of the few player servers most have 100+ ping for me, or rather its more like 2 have 100+ ping and then the other 15 servers are 150 - 250 ping. All games multiplayer games are ruined by floating or teleporting cars even when you do get a lucky 74 ping game.

,Recommended,228380,8815521,"Posted: 22 January, 2014",all,NoMoreClaymores,"Handling:Cars handle more realistically but that makes racing less forgivable. Some of that is due to the sensitive keyboard controls, some of that is due to the exaggerated (but awesome) physics they have included. Car damage greatly affects handling, which is a nice touch. Bugbear is aware and will be tweaking the controls.Graphics:A huge improvement over the already nice looking Flatout 2. It's obvious there has been tons of work on the engine. Volumetric smoke & fire, dynamic shadows & lighting, god rays, high res textures, full anti-aliasing, particle effects, etc. All standard camera views are provided including in-car which is awesome during a durby. It looks like the CryEngine.Physics:The main selling-point is obvious. A very robust physics engine that affects all aspects of the game. Most of your vehicle can be damaged or ripped off. Terrain gets grooves from tires, concrete barriers smashed, signs fall over, waves of tire walls punted across the track, skid marks stay, glass shatters. Damage is modeled realistically yet exaggerated for entertainment.Tracks:The beta is only provided with 3 tracks. 1 derby & 2 races. Very basic, feels more like a tech demo. Bugbear has admitted they are only for demonstrations.Cars:Only 2 included in beta. 1 muscle & 1 euro-compact (rear engine!). Marketing says their will be a lot of cars. A garage to customize & mod them. None of that is in the beta.Performance:I couldn't run it on max (but god was it glorious looking when I tried) the framerate kept dipping during the intense action. It doesn't appear to be because of any optimization issues, it's just that demanding. I could run it on High settings fine. People on the forum have had good performance overall as users with high-end vcards are able to play it on max. FYI - i7 920, 6gb, GTX 560Overall:While my overall opinion is positive they still have a ways to go. There's not a ton of content at the early access price right now and it feels more like a tech demo (which is actually included with early access). I think it's obvious they have the framework laid for an amazing following to the Flatout series. As long as they add-in some of the missing features from Flatout 2 (which is on their road map) and tweak the handling - I'll be happy."
,Recommended,228380,8841522,"Posted: 25 January, 2014",all,Patrick,"Sitting on Steam just a few days past, I felt the sudden urge to buy into this game. Next Car Game may not be the most ingenious title for a video game, but I can assure you it’s well worth the 20 quid (or equivalent) right now. I should note, it’s still in early access, don’t take this as a final say.For a PC only game you expect top notch explosions, collisions, physics and visuals, and Next Car Game delivers in every one of those aspects. While small details may be missing, such as the steering wheel just being mute to a point where it’s rendered non-existent (literally), the pre-alpha for the game certainly impresses me. We’ve come to expect a lot from PC gaming, quite why isn’t clear to me, but at first glance, I’d blame it on the so-called next generation consoles. In other words, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC has long been outdoing the dust attracting heavyweights, and for an unfinished and incomplete game, Bugbear Entertainment certainly have crafted one of the best experiences, for me personally, in a long time.There is no recipe for a racing game, sure you have the cars, the AI and the main aim, but it seems as if Bugbear have stepped into a gap for the genre. The option to go into a hardcore derby or race on an impossible gravel track just satisfies everyone’s needs.The lack of tracks, cars and any real options will detract you from the game, but again, it’s pre-alpha. It has unfortunately fallen victim to the early access trap, which may not necessarily be a bad thing, it’s a pest that certainly has invaded, not only the Steam platform, but also the master race in general.I summarised the review in the introduction, inject your 20 pounds. Just get the game. You’re going to loaf the title once new features are added, for the time being, while it’s in early access, you can grab the game for considerably less. Of course if you’re a racing fanatic you can also obtain some extra perks if you’re willing to part with a little more cash. Enough advertising, back to the review at hand, for those who want to read more.While the game itself impresses in it’s relatively early stages, like I mentioned, the early access virus has infested every corner of the game. Just a while back, when Bugbear released the first sneak peak for their new title, money was already flooding in, for what? A mere crumb of the game. Sure, the mechanics were there (to an extent) and it did impress? I guess? It may have been a free sneak peak, but I can’t help, but think, the game has been a small cash grab for the indie company. It’s certainly an accusation I don’t write down lightly, but I feel as if this is a perfect example as to what an early access game is. While it works, the version you get to play, even if you paid a full amount for what could be a triple A title, you receive a condensed stripped down pre-pre alpha, which barely functions. Now don’t get me wrong, it does function, but barely. Not for what I would expect, the same can be said for the full game. There’s another point.I’m not in the know what state the game is currently in, is it done? (I know it’s in pre-alpha) Steam shows the title as ‘Next Car Game’ – So is the pre-alpha it, no more sneak peaks? I can deal with that, but the game has sneaked onto Steam, taking money, with what is just the sneak peak version two with added gravel and tarmac scenery.If you’re looking for an easy-to-play racing simulator, this most definitely isn’t what you want. Simulator yes, easy, no. Having been through seven to eight races, on both tarmac and gravel, with the various tyres and engines and the default level 2 cars currently available, Next Car Game does not go remotely easy. There may be the practice options, tactically placed right down the list, but if you’re as professional as me, you will want to jump right into the 24 car race.Admittedly, the races themselves may not be as fun, but there is a satisfying feeling to crashing into your opponents and racing to the finish. At this moment you won’t find a 54 lap frenzy, you’re limited to choosing between two tracks and racing for 3 laps. The three laps are a little disappointing, it’s not an option I would consider particularly hard to integrate, especially for a pre-alpha, but hey ho, it’s not in the game (yet). If you want the core fun of the game, where you spectate the real beauty of this game, play the Derby. More specifically the 24 car derby. The hilarious sight of a bonnet completely folded in itself, still capable of driving and crashing (purposely) into an opponent just sets me off every time.There isn’t an awful lot to talk about, which you have gathered from the rather slimming context of this review. There are just two modes as of now, the derby and the race both with options for the number of opponents. You can change the spec of your car by upgrading wheels, better suited to the job at hand, and installing a more powerful engine. Customization is largely restricted however, with no alternative paint jobs and just a different car altogether, you won’t find your creative side come to life just yet.If you’re looking for a cheap car game where you can really push the boundaries of destruction (and possibly test your PC), Next Car Game certainly won’t disappoint. But it’s far off a solid car game, at least in its early access stages. Bear in mind however, if you do decide to wait it out, you will be digging a little deeper into your pocket."

So, the screenshots you see on the homepage are literally what the game looks like, and the crashes are NOT the coolest I've ever seen happen in this game. But really, this game is like the advritisements from other games, amazing crashes, a true sense of speed, and an always working crash engine to fuel it all.On the topic of this games crashes, they are AWESOME the engine may not (arguably) be as precise as something like Burnout Paradise but the fact that it doesn't glue you to the ground and that it has no annoying ""crash mode"" makes it better than any other. It's a wierd thing to describe but it feels like the crash engine is always present, barring realistic car weights your not glued to being in the upright position, and if your not good, you can end up roling over other cars or even getting stuck in other cars (it happend to me, not a glitch or bug, just the physics engine working)Speed is not the coolest part of this game but it is as good as any Need For Speed or otherwise good racing game, the turning and driving feels heavy yet controled, as if your piloting a muscle car, but it isn't as heavy as it is satisfying, and sure as hell, bumping into another car is satisfying as hell.Last minute details, it does offer controller support, it does have different views including a realistic cockpit view, and it has JUST enough content to be satisfying with three race tracks and one derby stadium.9/10 if full game                                          10/10 if considered as a beta                              11/10 as considered as an alpha"

Not alot to do. Only three cars. Only 2 racing based tracks. AI will ram you ALOT. AI are quite skilled( probably my fault for not playing enough racing games and the lack of a gamepad(you should get one).No difficulty settings. Have to exit the game to change important settings. The first menu's settings ( the important settings) should be low mediun high settings (just being picky).Overall: it was hard to find much wrong with it considering it Is in PRE-Alpha stage or even Alpha or beta stage.most likly the Cons will be fixed in a matter of months .

I can't imagine how many hours I've put into that game alone. It had a decent number of cars on one track, and the tracks were absolutely mental. As a result, I enjoyed the immense chaos that was always had whenever I played the game.I thought I'd never find a game quite like it... Until I discovered this game. 'Wreckfest' (or whatever title Bugbear decides to finally give it in the end) is as close of an experience to that old PS1 game I've ever had. The game, whilst only still in alpha, has the option to play against 23 other opponents on a single track, and the current build at the time that this review was wrote, already has a nice selection of tracks to choose from. The tracks aren't as insane as the ones I came across in Destruction Derby RAW, they're still pretty hectic. The damage modelling on the cars is also brilliant to witness and having 24 cars on a small figure of eight track is pure utter chaos that I adore.  While I wish I had access to some more cars and the option to have more laps, I've been enjoying my time with Wreckfest and I do get the odd flashback of Destruction Derby RAW.The game already is worth a purchase, in my opinion, and everything to be added on later will just make my experience with the game even greater."

I would like to see customizable paint and possibly stickers as well as items to aid your vehicle such as improved tires, brush guards, and nuts that look like balls dangling from your car. Other fun items to add to the car customization could be snow plows, spikes bolted to miscillaneous places, and maybe other items you would find in a redneck neighborhood/TMZ series.

As someone who thoroughly enjoyed FlatOut:UC, I can say I look forward to the full release of this, and even now, the fact that you can ""shape-shift"" your car to nonsensical proportions in a race, whether you consent to it or not, and have pieces of cars just scattered all over the place is just damn-tastic.However, in it's current state I do not think it's worth the full price tag, maybe $20 at the max, simply because to me there doesn't seem to be enough content, such as cars, upgrades, tracks, minigames, and a good soundtrack. The two or three music tracks currently in the game get repetitive and annoying when sitting in a lobby for so long, so I ended up turning off music altogether and just used my own.Should you buy this game? Yes, but you may get bored of it quickly due to a lack of content. Pick it up on sale and if you get bored, you can always wait for release, which may or may not have a full $60 price tag."

I have a feeling this game will not see the final product as those did. I bought this in really early stages of development and I have slowly followed it since. It is a nice visit for anyone that played the flatout games. But after years in development I have heard nothing of a campaign. You earn new stuff by basicly winning and earning awards in custom matches and online. Car customization has not progressed much as far as I hopes it would, you basicly have 6 preset paint skins for every vehicle and your limitted to parts that are assigned specificly to each vehicle almost. I'm not saying I didn't have fun playing this, but I don't see it getting finished anytime soon if ever and it has been in development for years now. It is in my library if anything new is worth checking out, but for the last year or two there hasen't been much outside hotfixes."

According to what has been done already and the devs plans (career mode fundations are there already, and we have a nice clue of what it's going to be), it's very promising. To the point that even simply spectating a race is fun (much like it's fun to spectate real stock cars races).Also, networking simply... works. Though obviously, there's still too few people playing it to find a non-empty public race session 24/24, better try it during prime time for now, or with friends at anytime, or solo (though AIs may need some tweakings to be a bit more agressive, devs also plan to give them more personality).Stability is quite good too. I played it several hours and I only had one crash to desktop.Granted the price is quite insane for an early access. I usually ignore such highly priced early accesses (for the principle only, it's not a money issue to me). But I finally decided to make an exception... and I don't regret that at all.

The game was an exceptionally fun smash and crash racing/derby game, a modern take on the fun that was Destruction Derby. The cras were arcady enough to handle, real enough to lose control when hit well. They were fast and manouevreable and the choas that followed wes gold. Made some friends through this game and we had a blast for a few months.BUT... things have changed. The game has become more or a simulation and the cars are now heavy and the game feels slow. Hitting another car seems to not be satsifying anymore, like hitting a concrete wall with a foam swimming noodle, it just doesn't do much. It seems to be turning more into a racing sim and team career managment game than...well...a wreckfest.Don't get me wrong, if you like a good, semi-realistic game with wearing parts and accurate handling, then this might tickle your fancy for a while. But if you wanted a game where you could jump in, smash stuff up using skill and gile and have a blast without it feeling too arcady, then this is not the game for you...at least not any more or at the moment."

I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment. And there is still so much potential here. The physics are great, the vehicle models look fantastic, and the handling lines are excellent. The tracks are fun and challenging, plus they're frequently improving existing tracks and adding new ones. Of course, none of those things I just mentioned are absolutely perfect, but I think that there's plenty great stuff here to build off of now, and the main focus should be to create in-game goals, challenges, and an end objective. Currently the game consists of racing just to race. You earn money and experience, but there's really no point to those things in the game's current state.Understanding that this game is CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, I would still absolutely recommend it to any fan of the racing genre. If you're turned off by the idea of spending $40 on an incomplete game, drop it in your wishlist and wait for a sale.Yes, this game has been in development for over 3 years, but no, that does not mean it is a bad game. Most of the negative reviews here are from impatient turds with no understanding of the time and effort it takes to produce a game, especially with a small team.I really do hope Bugbear can make this game a complete reality, because I can see potential of it being the best Demo-Racing-Sim ever.

It takes some getting used to how destructive the environment is to your car.  While I would love to see more traditional racing types replaced with more experimental and fun game types that take into account the vast amount of deformations the car can have, it is incredible in its current iteration.I can say pretty safely that this style of physics deformation is now the standard that all other car games must match.  No more indestructible car crashes.  If you crash into something fast enough your car should turn into a super compact.As well the game is screaming for multiplayer, but I am okay waiting for that feature to make sure the main game is complete.The subtle detail of each crash makes is worth paying attention when you play, to see all the bits of car laying on the track when you are racing.  This also means the terrain can be a part of the race, quite literally when you knock a fence over in the middle of a race.The demolition derby section almost needs additional car armor so that each car doesn't get destroyed too soon!  Overall this is a very positive car experience.  Can't wait to see the final product.  There are a number of new tracks to explore now also."

Now to one of those questions, the answer is no. This is the epitome of Early Acess games, and it is very far from complete.Now, should you buy it? Probably! This game is a heck of a lot of fun. If you enjoyed games like flatout, dirt, burnout (ok, maybe this is a little less intense than burnout), or any other arcade racer you would love Next Car Game. When it comes to the game mechanics itself, the controls and damage are superb. I play using an Xbox 360 controller and it works pretty well.As far as game content, it is NOT worth the $30 price at this point. There is simply not enough content to be worth the price that it's asking for. There are two gamemodes, (derby and racing) and three tracks for each. There are three different cars to choose from, but there is very little that changes when playing as a different vehicle. The AI is a bit.. Let's say ""interesting."" This is the only game I've ever played where the AI cars screw up, hit eachother, and crash. Now, is this a bad thing? Not at all! Atleast in my opinion it makes the racing much more intense with the thought of the other cars having the power to suck as much as you do.Ok, let's finish this up. This review is pretty long. Now. Do I recommend it? Yes! It's a lot of fun if you like crazy racing and derby games! Do I recommend it at this price? No. Not at all.

It is in pre alpha at this time and is more of a test bed for the final release. There are only 4 cars and a few tracks, no real game modes yet like multi player and career mode. This game shows a lot of potential so far! Excellent physics effects, sound is great, graphics are great too. It also runs very smoothly and appears to be well optimized. The controls are lacking a bit on my X Box 360 controller though. The cars appear to change suddenly from snappy to sluggish and back again sometimes. I would also like to be able to fully navigate the menu with the D pad, which as of now does nothing in the menu. Those are really my only complaints about it, but this is a pre alpha game and is not even close to finished yet and they are contantly releasing fixes and improvements even now. The pre alpha release is a nice strategy as the developers can learn from those playing the game and improve it before final release, this is a very rare thing these days. If you want to get involved in the game and help the developers out buy it now, you will not be disappointed. Even with the few tracks and cars it is a lot of fun!

Somehow, and I don't if this is intentional or a happy coincidence, but even when the game is running at 10 fps, which is usually unplayable, you can still compete. A few things that I would like to see change would be the AI, or at least a difficulty slider for them.

If you hit a wall the wall crumbles on impact. When you do flips and get drawn back to the ground by gravity, the smashing of the car being crushed and then flipped over, rolled and turned looks and feels awesome. Wheels go flying, car parts and dirt. Even at this point there are about 4 cars that can be driven and a number of both derby and racing tracks that can be used. Multiplayer is epic. The fun of crashing and racing with other people is so much fun. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. It is fun, entertaining, epic, awesome, funny as and so good.

76561198077054156,Recommended,228380,35426345,Posted: 2 October,all,Ivan The Space Hunk,"I grew up with the Flatout games. Flatout: Ultimate Carnage is an awesome game, with chunky driving, a real sense of weight to your actions and interesting extra gamemodes. I hope and pray that Wreckfest will one day become a great experience like that.Every day that passes without an update makes that hope seem less and less possible. Bugbear needs to finish this game, because they have an excellent gameplay and technical base with Wreckfest. If they complete the game, it could easily be known as THE next-gen demolition derby experience. At the time of writing, it's been more than two months since the last update, which was only a hotfix to the june update, which was five months ago. This after a promise from Bugbear for monthly content updates.In Wreckfest's current state, it plays well and looks great. The feeling of driving heavy, slippery old junkers that was present in the Flatout series is still there. Sliding an iron behemoth from half a century ago through a dirt track feels just right, and shunting a car out of your way does suitable damage to both vehicles. Wreckfest plays and wrecks great. Its basic gameplay even better than any of the good Flatouts, and the deformation as far more graphically pleasing than Flatout's limited model-change-based deforming.Gameplay is not the thing holding Wreckfest back. The issue with this game is its' lack of polished content. While there are around twenty levels included in the game currently(more if you count circuit variations), but there are only about seven completley finished tracks. The rest are in various states of completion, with some nigh-indistinguishable from a completed level and others having placeholder assets and misaligned roads. The car customization is pretty good on the one car that actually has customization parts, all others being static apart from their paint job. If there were more finished tracks and cars with actual parts to use, this would be a superb game. As it stands it is only a good example of how a lack of content can't be completley made up for with gameplay.I still reccomend Wreckfest because it plays well and is a fun distraction from time to time, but unless a ton of people buy this game soon, I doubt we'll ever hear from Bugbear or this game ever again. Don't buy this for a deep, feature-rich experience like the Bugbear-era Flatout series. Buy it if you enjoy contextless screwing with a fun driving model and interesting deformation technology.Edit: better descriptions"

The handling is much better now and I can play the game with a challenge again! A lot of the tracks have also improved visually and the new multi route track is very fun! This bumps it up from mixed to a positive review, I'll leave the old one down below for those who haven't read it as some of the information still applies.Old review:THIS IS A MIXED REVIEW, STEAM PLEASE MAKE THAT AN OPTION.Well as you can probably see, this game has been under fire a lot recently.The bizarre thing is that was back when I thought the game was better. I'll split this in to pros and cons for an easier read as to why.Pros:The tracks are fun and well designed. Some tracks aren't finished and the AI is slower on these tracks but several of the tracks feel very finished and far along.The complaints of no updates are misinforming for the most part. Whilst yes updates have been slow, the content has improved ten fold since release and they are lots of tracks to choose from and a decent amount of cars compared to initial release.The racing is fun with a great mix of destruction and racing.Mods add to the experience with cool paint jobs, new tracks and even new AI and damage systems which are better for the hardcore race fans.AI manages to be challenging without having to cheat. Although they could do with adding difficulties to the game as the AI seems to take one or two laps to work out how good you are.A 24 car field to race with, very fun and chaotic.The old handling system was fun to race with and gave the AI a fair chance against good drivers. The player and the AI felt like they were on a level playing field.Cons:The recent December update ruined the handling system making cars too easy to handle and the AI feel way too easy, even without the assists.Again not all tracks are finished meaning the AI can be super easy on some tracks and challenging on others.Derbies feel a bit too unforgiving. The more aggressive you are the more you get punished, meaning you have to skirt around the arena waiting for everyone else to get wrecked.Updates are slow though this is meant to be stopping in February with a promise of faster fleshed out updates.The Racefest and real 2 life mods vastly improve the game. Without them the damage system feels too forgiving and AI pack is less fun to race through.Playing with friends seems impossible, no clear ways to set up servers and a poor multiplayer system meant me and my friends had to give up playing with each other unless we played with randoms on their servers. Something we did not want to do.Upgrade system seems to be fairly basic and can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you don't play the game a lot. Would rather it be removed altogether or made less bothersome to manage.Overall this game is great fun with the right mods and the old handling system, I loved how challenging it was as I am tired of AI being way too easy to beat if you are good. Unfortunately the new update has ruined the game for me as it makes the cars way too easy to drive even without assists. Bugbear need to add difficulty levels to the AI and find a good balance between simulation and arcade because right now the AI drive like they are struggling with the car whilst you can powerslide round every corner and don't have to worry about spinning out at all.TLDR: Great game but handling needs reworking in order to keep the AI and single player experience fun and challenging."

Think of a cross between the oldFlatoutseries, and the Playstation'sDestruction Derbyseries. The graphics were very, very nice (they still are actually). And although it was known Early Access could be a year or more, it was getting regular updates and Dev responses. It had destruction, racing, good particle effects and promised a season mode.. I was actually enjoying it even on one track, with two cars.Eventually, there was an update where we were told they wanted to overhaul the engine to provide better graphics, simulations and multi-threading. The Dev's asked for our patience while they worked on this and assured us it would be worth it. Then over six months went by with no word about anything from any one, no updates, no respones. It seemed clear the game was dead and I stated as much in a review back then.The Devs then came out and gave one update several months later and all declared the game was just slow to progress, and there was much rejoicing among the hopeful. The next update or two basically broke the game. After that, updates were few and far between and contained what could be termed as empty changes (the last one six changes, one of which was fans added to the stadium..really) or bad ones.I don't think Bugbear intentionally did a money grab. In all likelihood the main devs, or some of them moved on (be it through other job offers, frustration with management, lost direction, etc). This game now is given updates, but it will likely never be finished.TL;DR Basically the game's been shelved until Bugbear knows what to do with it, like what happens with many R&D games. The only problem is.. EA isnotR&D. Should refunds be given? Maybe, but this is the risk with Early Access. Let the buyer beware, and let the buyer be careful with EA in the future. This game currently has 22% positive rating for good reason, very good indeed."

The cars crumple and break down masterfully as they get hit. Unfortunately, the driver also gets squashed into weird shapes. At the moment there is no depth to the game and the scoring system can be weird at times. You get a free crew. You move them to any car at any time with no penalty. As you race, they get better (which allows them to fix an extra point of damage per go) and you get more money (which allow you to purchase better cars and better parts). Everything is available from the get-go and you can skip a lower tier (if one can call it that) car and/or part altogether and go straight for the last one from each region or group. From the first car with no upgrades to owning every car with all the upgrades took about two hours total. I even purchased two more crews at a grand each just so each of the three regions have their own crew. I don't even play the races as I didn't buy this game for that racing simulator experience (""Wreckfest"", remember?). Though derby mode is a lot of fun, I often wonder why I didn't get a point for hitting another car hard or assisting in wrecking it. Especially when driving in a smaller (lighter) car, the damage you do to your opponent is often considered moot, even though there are clear signs that you made a fender or door cave in completely.tldr; Give it a go if it's on sale and you really want to get that Early Access feel, otherwise wait and see if things change."

Does this mean it’s not a worthwhile game?I played the game when it first released and it had only a few tracks but there was a lot of players so the online races were good fun. I revisited it again (24/2/2017) and there has been a lot of progress made in terms of content.I counted about 19 different tracks, half of which are fully done, others are still work in progress. However the online community seems to have given up (for the moment) so there’s not really any worthwhile servers to play on.Since there’s no online community left I instead played through all the tracks against AI and the reverse tracks and got enough credits to buy most of the vehicles and upgrade them. The upgrade system is kind of odd with only a few parts you can swap out for better ones (stock, sports & racing). The thing is when you go to upgrade something you can't compare that is already in the car with parts you want to buy so you often but the same parts or you have to keep going back and forth.The AI is pretty good, they will try to run you off the road if you lock into their sides.The physics are on point, you really need to be careful with trying to cut corners, even the slightest bump will cause your car it flip which sucks when it happens to you but it REALLY satisfying when you nudge someone else into an object or cause them to spin off the side and go into a roll.The destruction is also really good and works pretty much as you'd expect it to without all the horrible disadvantages the previous had where your car would start pulling to one side after a single hit.The graphics are 10/10 but a lot of the track assets are not finished but the ones that are look amazing.Bottom-line I do think this has the blueprint for being the best FlatOut style game to date.I'll be revisiting the game either when the community grows to something worthwhile as it is currently 30-100 consistent players, most of which seem to be playing against AI like me OR when a major update hits/ goes full release.6.2/10The next big racing game, up to the devs to make it happen"

And while yes, I am dissapointed at the pace of development and Bugbears apparent bankruptcy (google it), it is still an excellent driving game.The car physics are excellent with a lot of attention to detail. Depending on your tires and engine power you get different grip on different surfaces and it's noticable. Feedback through an xbox controller feels solid and it pays to be subtle on the thumbstick, throttle, and break. It's beautiful, too, especially at 4k. Destruction physics look great and enhance the game because your wheels, body, and engine take damage during the race which can effect your driving. Multiplayer and online are a lot of fun if you can find other plays. The game's AI is a lot better than in other racing games I've played, too. I have just as much fun playing single player as I do multiplayer.The problem with this game is the slow development and lack of direction. It has taken a long time to add features like new cars and maps. The menu option for purchasing vehicles and parts has been there since I bought the game but only recently became a feature you need to use. Also, the game promotes destruction but the latest update penalizes you for it by adding permanent damage to car parts so you eventually have to replace them. I understand the reasoning behind this feature but it seems counterintuitive toWreckfest's nature.I don't think Bugbear is just going to dump this game on the modding community and bail, but they raised over a million dollars on their Steam Early access campaign and have only produced half a game in two years. If they can get their butts in gear and show some direction and start updating more often this could be the greatest racing game ever. It's a risky bet, but it's sooo much fun.Is the development process wonky? Yes.Is the future not so bright for this game? ProbablyIs it a fun game to play? You bet your sweaty palms it is."

Year ago, when I purchased it, game was lacking the content & had poor optimization & I refunded it. I don't regret my decision, because It's been already 2 years now & game is still stuck in Early Access stage & probably it will be dead & abandoned soon. This game is a good example why so called Early Access games are meant for robbing the customers & should be avoided. You don't have a guarantee that game won't be abandoned even before it gets finished & you just pay the full price for it & if you play more than 2 hours, boom, you can't refund it.

I think it likely that they will never happen.There are two types of updates that should be happening:1.) Bug fixes and UI improvements. (these can be constant, and there probably could have been 50 since I bought the game, and there has benn 0)2.) Content updates. These updates can take a long time, while you create new models, debug, etc. And they probably could have done a few since I bought the game, yet again, there have been 0.Every day this is looking more and more like abandon-ware.Updating a blog with a bunch of words that mean nothing isn't worth anythingUra Zelda project anyone?Update: 05/07/2015Making excuses for devs doesn't help the process at all.I think we can all agree that when you buy EA you expect:1.) A game that is rough around the edges2.) A Game that is not finished and may take a very long time to finish3.) Glitches/Bugs and times when it doesn't run at all.I've played DayZ (both iterations), I have played Rust, I have also played Space Engineers and Minecraft, and many other EA games, so I am no stranger to them.That said, one thing that SHOULD be expected, is/are updates.It would be asking a lot to expect updates every week or two (like speace engineers does and has done for a very long time), but once a month is NOT too much to ask. (like pretty much every other non-abandonware EA game).Some updates can work in parallel with each other... Just because a dev team is working on an engine update, or whatever, doesn't mean they stop dead on their existing game (or it shouldn't anyways). See Rust as an example of this, they kept updating their legacy engine Rust game, while creating a new engine based Rust in parrallel, and now the new engine is starting to be much better.I remember reading BB's blog, and they 'were having issues with the next update, but will be putting it out before the end of year'...or something like that anways...You know the year that we are in now???...yeah...the one that is almost half over....? Yeah... That's the year AFTER the last update that was 'delayed by a few days'Unacceptable! Moreover, what's more unacceptable are the excuses that people are making for this behaviour.Like the product all you want, but you DO NOT have to like the behaviour.Don't get me wrong either, I like the game, and I hope that one day there will actually be an update, and hold out for that day, but something here is being severely mismanaged, and it isn't right."

The realism at high speeds with the different configurations for the cars is unbelievable. If you have ever driven offroad when going over 90 or driven on a high-bank oval track with 15 other cars with in inches of you, then you will probably prevail because of how realistic the driving is. Because of the realism i highly recomend using a CockBox 360 controller, or using a wheel and pedals, or you will likely fly off the track and into a wall. Of course since it is in very early alpha, it has its veary fair share of glitches, but most of which dont efect the gameplay. I would give this game a 8.5/10 considering the early acess alpha."

And even then, I'll be back.The latest update has entirely made this game for Me, personally. Sure, there is a new track and car, but the Physics have been a bit more than tweaked, and i find the driving a very safe medium between Simulation and Arcade. You still need your brakes (And if you know how to drive, you will ANNIHILATE the AI), but you can still take a few 'creative liberties' through the turns. I would easily rate this game a solid 9/10 in it's current state.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To say the least, i cannot justify the price for a game that is, alegedly, in a 'Pre-Alpha' state... The game itself is good. There should be no debate on that end. Everyone saying that the game has been abandoned is wrong. I too, had jumped to that conclusion with the addition of Mod support, but the updates have been frequent and, overall, changing in one way or another. In short, the game is good, updates are still coming out, but personally, i can;t justify the $40 price tag. On sale, sure, but as someone who has been with this game since the Pre-Steam stages, i would certainly recommend the game, currently. It has done a full turnaround from being good, descending to horrible, and now rising to one of the better racing games on Steam. Take my word for what it's worth, i'm still going to be playing it on a regular basis from now on."

As an Early Access title, I've already played it more than some full version racing games, mostly because it has a certain feeling non other can give. Sure, it has a lack of content at the moment, and the miss of an offline carrier mode can be frustrating, especially after more than a year of the pre-alpha's release. But still, the multiplayer is an awesome experience. It's like FlatOut 2 with all the ""next-gen"" glory.

I bought this game some time ago, like I don't even know how long ago, there were only three, maybe four cars when i got it. Now after at least a year (or close to one) there is an astounding number of cars. Or so I would like to say, there are six of them. They can be decently customized with a few options, but still new skins do noe = new cars. For all I know, the game had been given up on.Not to mention: I am pretty sure i read that the game was meant to be feature finished by the end of 2014, it is not by any means, some parts of the main menu/garage (whichever you want to call it) are not complete, as a couple sections are faded due to not being in the game yet.TL;DR: Don't buy this game if you are looking to have much more playtime than me (4.6 hrs at time of review), even that might be a little generous, not much content to work with and no updates.PS: I don't often write reviews, but i figured this was worth noting, also, the 2014 thing may have been rumor, but i am 95% it was official news.Edit: I stand corrected, the team is appearantly still working on the game, but I still cannot reccomend anyone buy the game until either its full release or at least after some major updates."

Load the old school rock or metal of your choice into your external mp3 player(Motorhead or the Destruction Derby 2 OST are my favorites) and you have an aesthetic that you can't have in any other game with these graphics and performance.I usually don't do early access reviews because the games are obviously incomplete, but in Wreckfest there's that aesthetic, only made possible by the coherent and fast damage model and physics (something that always impressed me in the FlatOut series but it's much better now).

You can usually find enough people playing to fill a server even though the number of players have dropped since around January. I certainly do not regret the 300 + hours I've already put into it since  I purchased it last November, but without any updates, people are starting to wonder if Bugbear has abandoned it. I have seen a few recent tweets from the dev's so I have faith we will see a finished product eventually. Even if we don't, I do not regret buying it, however for people who do not own it yet I would advise holding off until the next update as the number of people hosting races have dwindled. I still host now and again and my server does eventually fill up. You will find more people playing it on weekends than  throughout the week though. Even if bugbear could release a small update, such as a new track, or car, or even some textures for the unfinished Sandpit 1 track terrain, it would be something to give existing owners of the game some hope.I will give the game a thumbs up, but I cannot recommend purchasing the game at the moment due to the lack of online players.Actually, just buy it and play it."

It even has Steam Workshop Support!Played around with some modded tracks in multiplayer earlier in the week and it was some of the best fun I have had.Build dated 23/03/2016.  Original review at bottom.Time for me to do a real review of this game.It's been an interesting journey through early access with this game.When I first started playing in 2014 it was mostly a game about crashing cars, doing jumps and getting stuck on Sandpit, and the highlight was getting screenshots of massive crashes.  It wasn't until they added multiplayer later that year that I really 'got' this game.At it's heart it's a multiplayer party game.Go nuts with people online and have a good time.  Crash and bash, go for the fast laps, or race somewhere in between.  Its up to you.For me its the first car racing game that I really enjoyed.  Multiplayer is so well done, and so darn funny even after 200 hours in game.  I've seen so many crazy things.Recently I've been doing barrel rolls in lawn mowers, and watching my girlfriend beat the best driver in my region due to an AI car wiping out his lawn mower.  I even saw lawnmowers flip European minis, collide in mid air and punt the rag doll driver 20 metres down the track.Lawn mowers are great.One of my favorite old memories of this game is everyone on the server getting thrashed by one driver in the races, so that fast driver asked if they could go backwards.So for the rest of the races, we dodged them while racing amongst ourselves.Ironically, it's even become a good place for clean racers.  Because small crashes between drivers don't screw up your race as badly as they do in sims like Assetto Corsa.I've watched the game evolve a lot.  At the end of 2014 when multiplayer was added it was an arcade racer where cars were crazy fast around corners.It was light on content, but a heck of a lot of fun.Over time, and with some lengthy delays along the way the game has been moved slightly closer to a sim racer.  You can still wipe out in a big way on a corner or against the bumper of a derby car, and get yourself back into the race.  However its not quite as easy to control, and car damage affects your race more than it did when multiplayer first came out.Being able to choose and buy parts for your own race car is another new sim feature, and currently the system works well.  Its awesome being able to up-spec and down spec your car for more or less speed while playing with different diffs and suspension, and the current repairs system means parts wearing out never has to ruin your tim with the game.In early 2016 Next Car Game Wreckfest is still that same core game I fell in love with in multiplayer long ago.  The new tracks and cars added over time have been top notch, and every single track and car is distinctive enough to make it worth trying them all.The addition of new game modes and tracks has made multiplayer even more hilarious, and its amazing to see what game types the community comes up with.It's not uncommmon for me to log in 'for a bit' and walk away two and a half hours later with a massive smile on my face, having experienced things in game that I'd never seen before.Wreckfest just needs a proper career mode, and more game modes and cars before I can recommend it to all.  The core gameplay is amazing.  All I want is more of it.If a hilarious mulitplayer car racing game is what you are after then look no further.Next Car Game: Wreckfest is the game for you.(original review)Hi I'm Charles Loris.I had it all on the racing circuit.A red car.  Stickers.  Four tyres.  And even a guy to change them for me.I still had to pump my own gas, but I was always a stickler for the simple things.I raced in all the big races.  I did so many laps in the Indiana 500 that my race team found me six hours after the race rolling counter-clockwise around my own bath tab, yelling ""Gotta clean fast!""It was a crazy time.Its amazing how it can all fall to pieces so fast.I was sued for a cool half mill when in the headiness of being a young driver I called my sponsor Red Bull the taste of a new generation while drinking water from a diet coke can.Some people would have gotten mad and blamed the man who put the drinks in my hand or my manager for hiring a fifteen year old to type my autocue lines, but I took it all in my stride.  I walked over fifteen press journalists and camera operators after slipping off the stage in a blur of flash photography and hurrying for the nearest stairs.  When the tv news completely ignored my embarrassing slip up and instead played the NASCAR prayer I knew my career was dead.In my next race I took a wrong turn, took out four cars, and skewered a dart board right through the middle with a track side dummy I hit and sent flying into the nethers.Rumors spread that I had been driving while drowsy and that news soon reached my manager.  I was out on the street.  Destitute with nothing, but a race car with no tyres and 13 rolls of sponsor stickers to keep me warm at night.It was a tough time, but then I found this game.And I was hooked.I used a USB stick to get my now non-moving race car to run Windows OS and used my steering wheel for a controller.  Combinations of the buttons for opening my car trunk and hood were my a and b buttons for navigating menus.  At first my neighbours (mostly pigeons at this stage, don't ask) all told me I was mad.  But for the first time in years I had a real drive.I sent my car hurtling over hills to take shortcuts.  I drove clockwise around an oval track.I even used destruction derby as a way to get revenge on my racing enemies.All this I did with a shouty glee.  When online mult-iplayer rolled around I had to get in on it.I single handedly towed my tireless race car to a non-parking zone, where I knew I could get a free tow service closer to McDonalds wi-fi.Sure I had to stay in my car permanently as a protest to prevent my not-so-mobile home from being crushed into a cube, but it was worth it.I even got a new job snitching to police about local gangstas trying to use the car compactor to hide bodies and evidence, but I digress.Oh the online racing!  How my heart did leap when I first saw online multi-player destruction debies and rolled around the outside counter-clockwise while the young-uns pummelled each others chassis with reckless abandon.  The destruction was joyous.  Until I realised the game let me re-spawn and I realised I had to enter the fray to score a point.  But still for the first time I felt like I really truly ""got"" this game that I loved.  And it turned out that the game understood me too.Real life opponents asked me if they could drive backwards around oval tracks and I laughed heartily before allowing it.  Although I admit I have so far been too timid to drive backwards where others could see me.  I kept my secret joy for backwards racing to purer backwards versions of the tracks away from the prying eyes of the public.So for now I have been living in my former race car in a wreckers yard a mere 15 feet from the local McDonalds for the past five months.  Every day I work hard on perfecting my laps and crashing strategies in this strange new life.  Occasionally I get on to the Steam forums and complain under my numerous aliases about the next update taking too long, but I guess that type of deviant behaviour comes too quickly to those who witness at least one murder and too numerous to count possum fights every week.For now I must bid you adieu.  I look forward to seeing you on the racing tracks.Keep watching the mirrors,- Charles Loris"

We now have great new physics, a few new cars, a new track (that plays beautifully) and the promise of much more to come.The one thing the game needs (and is supposed to be comming) is a 'career' mode to keep the solo players happy, otherwise there's little reason to play the same tracks over and over after the initial thrill at how great the play (and damage) is.  Loads of fun, but just no longevity until career mode comes along.Online/server mode (from what the regulars are saying) is a real blast, so there's that for you multi-player guys.I'll give it a thumb's up with the caviet that we get more car customizability to go along with the proposed career mode."

I personally have just picked up an interest for racing games and I remembered this was in my steam library, so what I'm saying is this is the closest I have to any kind of racing game.So i downloaded the game and I've had a good amount of fun with it so far. The crash physics seem to be pretty good (not sure how they compare to real life), and the racing experiences on maps from the workshop (SHOUTOUT TO THE VERYTRACKS PACK) give a good racing experience.I do understand that the game isn't meant for a racing game and more a demolition derby kind of game, however this is the closest thing I currently have to a racing game so that's how I personally used it. However you will get a different experience if you play the demolition derby side of the game.Here's a list of pros and cons:PROS:-Fun racing experience-Good crash physics-well designed levelsCONS: (partly personal)-Inactive workshop community-Inactive dev team-Practically no updates-Still no campaign (after 4 years from what I've heard)-Cars still drive normally even if crushed to a pancake (cars don't take damage easily)-Hardly any customisation options for vehicles (apart from american 5)-AI is too easy to beat with good upgrades-Lots of maps are missing descriptions-No support for mod creators by the dev team (RIP Nascar addon)The game is ok for an early access game, however it seems like it'll never ascend that level. It's a good concept, but it's for the most part abandoned. Also, there isn't much else to do than change maps and cars. After you've gotten all the cars, there's no replay value.In it's current state I can't recommend it. If the devs come back and work on this game more, then I'll probably change the review.5/10, Would maybe play again."

To be honest, with their track record, it's a gamble on whether it will really happen. So we will see.Another Updated Review: Nothing like a big ♥♥♥♥ you from the developers. Hey while we're not changing hardly anything, lets give them a ♥♥♥♥ing lawnmower. wow6-30-15Updated Review (Again): I can't believe this much time was spent on this when the result was almost identical to how it was before. Only NOW I've experience my first actual crash for this game. This game has never crashed before and then all of a sudden after this long awaited disappointment of an update, the game crashes after less than 15 minutes. Seems like they just tweaked some random crap and copied the original cars and made different skins and shoved it out to ""keep their word"" that this would be out this month. This is just ridiculous."

Very promising for Pre-Alpha....until......one month passed......then another one......and many more......no update......no patch...Came back online to check it out after half a year or even more... only 3 players online on friday.I rest my case. This game is only worth for its multi-player and it was running thanks to people who host games old-school style. Its not for every cable and not for average hardware.

Destruction looks cool, but there's no strategy to it, you can't see detailed damage on opponents afaik, and cars turn slowly, so you just go around in circles until you die. In a destruction derby I think handling has to be more arcade-y so you can do cool things, not so slow.So it's just that, a tech demo. Development is slow as hell, so slow that I don't think they will ever finish it.

Playing the dx11 64 bit option, I seem to be getting a pretty decent performance. The new driving physics are welcomed by me too, although more realistic than before, when comparing to other sims such as Assetto Corsa, Wreckfest still leans toward the simcade driving feel. A good mix of the two worlds for me right now.Obviously the real reason to buy this game is the carnage, and that is what you'll get. Crashing into a huge tyre wall and then watching as they rain around you is a good time in itself, but starting a race with a car and finishing with a motorbike is always hilarious.I play this game with a g27 wheel. FFB is pretty decent, I can't always feel a lockup, but I can always feel when the front tyres have lost grip. Maybe that is why I can't see the updates being a problem.

(Major Slow Downs in certain areas)- Controller Support  is awkward moving around menusBugbear: Look, I'm glad you are all giving your all to make the engine just where you want it, but I have a little gripe as to the game at this stage gets very old very quick.

As I grew up and got into actually driving for fun and sport, I found I didn't enjoy simulators much (the same is true for flight and motorcycle sims,) as they couldn't compare to the real thing. It's been years now since I drove derby, and I've really been itching for it. Without much chance of getting on a team here in Michigan, I started looking at video games - and saw this. Never one to do things by half-meaures, I bought the game and a Logitech G27 wheel. BOOM - Off to the races, literally. The physics of this game are outSTANDing - coupled with the excellent feedback systems of the G27, this may be the most fun I've had in a game in quite some time. I also picked up Project Cars, but for someone who hasn't played a driving game in over 20 years, it's way out of my league - Wreckfest, however, is just how I like it - dirty, gritty, bumpy, violent... FUN. While the selection of cars is extremely limited right now, there is a nice variety of courses, ranging from the classic destruction derby to simple speedway to gravel and sand tracks. It's very simple to learn and to get used to, and if you have any affinity for cars, you'll be up to speed in no time at all. I did try it once without the wheel controller, and it wasn't anywhere near as enjoyable. This is definitely my new obsession."

Due to the lack of official dedicated servers all online action depends on these few remaining users, who run non-dedicated servers.

No.Some people out there seem to think that a game is made in a matter of months, a year at most.

Maybe add a beaten up Mustang GT, a Firebird, a Camaro, maybe something like an old beaten up Porsche or something like that."

Now the things I would normally look for in a racing game are accurate physics, proper controller configuration setup as well as controller choices. I find myself always leaning towards a racer that is more like a simulation than an arcade game. Well, so far NCG: Wreckfest is NOT one of those types of racers.  This is, however, a very good thing. You see sometimes it just liberating, entertaining and just plain fun to smash headlong into every other moving machine that finds itself in your path. Now this is not to say that NCG:W has bad physics by any means.  On the contrary I am quite satisfied with the overall physics and control of the vehicles in this game and the fact that it is still in ""Early Access"" status just makes me wonder how much better everything is going to get before release. For I have seen my share of destruction driving games as well, and I think I can safely stand behind Bugbear on this one and say that it is shaping up to be a contender for pole position at least as far as demolition derby racing is concerned but there is much more than just derby style racing awaiting the brave and foolhearty in Next Car Game: Wreckfest. I promise you that!"

The customization system is cool, and it's not too hard to max out the parts you have on your car.My only real issue with the game is that they have only done systems like the upgrades and the maps half way. Almost all of the maps say that they're still in construction, and it's clear that they're not done with the upgrade and customization systems. The career option is also not yet available (as of the date of this review).I wish they'd work faster, but I understand the lack of speed since they're an indie company and are probably working at max capacity."

I havnt played in months and i do feel somewhat duped with the promise this game would be finished years ago, it can't possibly be finished anytime soon, the suggestion it will get a release this year made me laugh a little, it won't.

Notice where we are in this game versus every other game that's not in Greenlight.Currently this game only has stock vehicles with single/multiplayer on a handful of maps.

As it is....the game is fun, but maybe not worth full price. The soft body collisions are awesome. Flips and twisted metal are all around you. But that's about it.

If you've played Flatout and liked it, you are gonna LOVE this. The cars seem to have good weight on them and the feel of them is quite nice and unlike in Flatout, the ramming feels more authentic.The only negative thing to say about this game is the name... Wreckfest sounds like a name, that an 8 years old would come up with. I'd either keep it as ""Bugbear's Next Car Game"" or change it to something like Carnage or whatnot."

Sandpit 2 is AMAZING and exhilarating to do well in, and frustrating because it is so challenging! Honestly don't notice any bugs in game, but the menu is a mess, and career mode doesn't work. Most of my crashes occur when trying to start a quick race with adjusted settings. It would be cool if the servers were populated, then again I am really bad so would get wrecked. This is a difficult game with complex driving mechanics and intricate tracks that would take a lot more than 5 hours to git gud. I hope it gets finished, I bought it in 2015 and it had nothing but a demo derby. Now there's tons of cars and tracks that are really fun. There's been several updates this year!

It was a slightly over the top banger racing game with a detailed career and fun arcade gameplay. Remembering this, I picked up Next Car Game when it was on sale. And I can honestly say, I've never been so impressed with a game before! You play this game with a stupidly big smile on your face because the crashes are epic! Not only that: but the game runs perfectly, the cars handle great, the graphics are good and the AI is somewhat challenging.The developers are listening to the community! A lively and friendly forum awaits you where you can help to sculpt the game with your ideas and feedback. No doubt an extensive career is coming, along with more customization and vehicles.All in all, this game is truly fantastic!

So far, very powerful rear wheel drive cars are only available, I drive with the tractions off as you would have no traction in a muscle car with a v8 from the 70s! I use manual shift, I find its easier to try and learn to control the cars using speed, gear changes, opposite locking and hand brake adjustments..... It can be quite technical.  Or you can just jack up the traction setting, use auto shift and mash the accelerate button!The cars play a little like GTA 4, I remember I couldnt keep those muscle cars on the road for more than 5 seconds... The physics of wreckfest are brilliant. Cars and car parts and rubble flies all over the place! Its carnage out there! I have some amazing screens. This game get me amped, its such a rush. And the brilliant part is, you can try to play seriously and go for a win, you can try and just get over the finnish line in...well sort of one piece... or you can just go for total carnage and smash, crash, bash and trash your way around. Its great to have a game where winning does not matter, at least in the conventional sense.The graphics are good enough, the particle effects, damage, light bouncing off the paintwork, its all pretty neat. There are lots of views aval in or out of the car and a cinema mode.. The stadiums look 2d sort of homealone house party carboard cut outs but you dont have time to notice when you are trying to stay alive (and on the track) and not head into a wall! The sounds are ok, I like the roar of the 302ci V8 on my head set and especially when you push it to 6000rpm. Its loud and lairy and immerses you into the game I feel.I have 5 cars in my garage, they are of all the similar speed really with a few minor settings to change. Some handle better but are lighter, typical of US cars they are not built for corners... but they carry weight and torque so are still lethel. It looks like there will be a fair bit of customisation to come.This is a game in progress, but I love what I see. There are things that need fixing obviously. Overall it seems stable though, I think Ive had 1 issue maybe in 18 hours of gaming! The devs are active on the forums. I paid only 14.99 for this. Im very happy and cannot wait for the end results. If you remember Destruction Derby and like a good driving sim where you can live out your road rage fetish, I recomend this 100%"

,Recommended,228380,8975362,"Posted: 4 February, 2014",all,Qais,"This has the potential to be a very good and enjoyable game. Simply put, it's racing tailored to how most users enjoy playing the genre anyways - smash other cars out of the race to get to the top, in a wicked spectacle of steel meet steel (at terrifying speeds) all the while - as oppose to being as clean and careful around the course as possible (this still works, but where's the fun in that?). The lack of variety however due to the game being in early access state hinders the extent to which the user can enjoy the current build without it feeling repetitive. But despite having only 2 barely customizable cars, it is very clear where there is potential to massively expand this range with a World of Tanks/War Thunder style research and upgrade system being the current look of how the game folds out. This aspect is one I find quite interesting for a racing game; yet problematic in some ways. Overall, the current gameplay is wreckless fun anyways and beating cars to pure pulp has never looked more beautiful. Excited for things to come of the future, I'd like to re-iterate how very clear it is that this game so much fun potential. Definitely recommend for those who always want to crash their cars in the standard racing games; like I have done so many times! Note: only get this early access if you are sure to stick with it - but I'm sure the gameplay will find it's own way to convince you!"

The races are sub-par -- I can't get a lap through without shredding my entire car and veering to the right into a concrete wall. I guess that's a testament to the fact the game isn't arcade like FlatOut, so I'm not bothered at that. My biggest gripe though is the handling (I'm surprised barely anyone has commented on it). It's slippery as hell and even with traction control on, I still slide and die violently as I crash into a wall.Otherwise, Next Car Game is promising.

A lot of people do not like the arcade physics but I found it fun, in a weird way. I love simulators. I thought, I need to give this a go. And I don't regret it. The suspension and motor(s) feel like they are in a junker. The crash physics may not be the best, but still well over average. You can have some very funny crashes. From my experience, the stability is great. I don't really have any problems with it. It has so much potential and could become one of the best acrade/demolition derby/racing games. I say, go ahead and get it.Update: New computer. Much better than old one. Wreckfest has updated a couple times. Let's update my review. First off, the game got a huge physics overall. They claim to be more realistic, but it still has an arcadey side. A good balance of it too. I like the arcadey-ish (not a word but who cares) physics, and this is from a sim racer. It just fits this game. I've put hours and hours into this game, and  it is just good. Simple. Content updates came. More cars, more tracks. That's good. But I need to question something. Why is there still no AI difficulty setting? I found them to be too easy, and no way to change it. It makes racing boring (besides figure 8 racing). It should have been there but, I can't completely bash it. It's still under development. To kinda conclude, it's still a great game.

This appeared to be a Flatout type format but too much focus is on the physics and not enough on the game.  My first race lasted less than 30 seconds due to a multi-car pile up where the bot cars seemed to be able to drive away but not me.  At least in Flatout you could take a beating and still drive away but not here.  This feels more like a proof-of-concept rather than something to play over and over.

The game is now worse then ever. I played a round with the ""new update"". After finally finding how to set a demolition match, 4 minute timer, deathmatch, Class D car opponents, and I am in a ""American"" Full Size Demo car, and I enter the arena with 26 opponent lawn mowers. Yes, Lawn mowers against a full size demo car.My car at one point was so beat up that the front of the car was lifted at a 45 degree angle off my wheels, and wheels were still on the ground, large air gap to the damaged front end, before being wrecked by the lawn mowers with 30 seconds left. Mind you the opponent class options were, Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Lawn Mowers. I chose Class D, and chose a car not a lawn mower, yet the game gave me Lawn Mower opponents.Match ended. 45 Frags, 1 destroyed car.This game is what is the current Roller Coaster Tycoon World.

That got me thinking, they should just build this using Frostbite, that would be awesome...but I digress.Wheel support kind of sucks still. It works, but there's loads of FFB and then when tires break traction, NOTHING. Then BOOM, FFB strength again.Multiplayer is still kind of a mess and it's getting to the point where the races available might be very low on players. Played one today that had 4 of us in a figure 8. Not fun. And the connection was very jumpy and unstable at times.Graphics looke updated a bit but still gets a little janky from time to time.Still have my fingers crossed...UPDATE: New patch rolled out to fix controller binding for USB pedals and wheel. Works now. FFB still not great, however.This game is beyond Early Access status. It's Pre-Alpha as ahown in the startup splash screen. Get it on a big sale is my recommendation.Force feedback is super strong and then boom, GONE, when you lose any traction. Very odd.Graphics are nothing to write home about.

The car upgrades are pretty pointless too. Top car upgrades can be purchased for any car in just a couple of hours gameplay and that's it, you've reached the end game.The online multiplayer is basically dead too. On a good day there is around 15 servers and of which, only two or three might actually be populated with a handful of people. Each server also comes with at least one clown trying to ruin it for the rest of the players. Even worse is that if you wish to play with friends by hosting your own online session. We had no luck being able to see the servers we created in the multiplayer browser.As other users have stated too, the developers have long abandoned the game. There wont be any further update releases appart from community developed mods.It's good for a laugh for an hour or so but that's it. If it was still under heavy development I'd say it had potential but given that this is all it will ever be I'd say it's best avoided. It's definately not worth the money."

The UI is still utterly worthless with a controller (Which is likely what you're playing this with). The Market is awesome in theory, but can be a bit of a nuisance when you're trying to weigh options. Vehicle handling remains incredibly difficult to judge (It's neither sim, nor arcade, it's quite annoying). And the performance is still all over the map. But the addition of mod support makes a huge mark on the positive side for me, and the lawnmowers were so different from everything else, they've made things fun again."

Whats the point of racing if after a few races I have bought everything? No goals? Handfull of tracks,handfull of cars,two paintjobs per car,few parts to purchase for upgrading.(Doesnt make much difference by the way)No structure at all,just race...for just racing...?

Too many ""shock & awe"" moments to name.By the time we get mid-race, there are crushed, flamming, and smoking metal corpses littering the track; literally.The track itself has come apart in areas due to crashing into its walls.Safety tires and tire marks litter the speedway.Fenders, wheels, glass, doors, hoods, and all sorts of debris litter the speedway.The race track eventually turns into a minefield.And when I'm speeding through it, I get this warm fuzzy feeling inside.It's like 1975 Rollerball meets 1985 Mad Max.And it looks GLORIOUS! :)Setting up your opponents at the right time to have them careen into these junk piles is a vision to behold.The pure glee of pulling off these maneuvers is something I can't explain. You have to experience it yourself!And we still haven't talked about the racing!The cars handle in lifelike manners considering the context.Different cars handle speed, turns, braking, collisions and power differently. You WILL feel the weight of your car in your hands. Despite its damage gimmick, Wreckfest is a very good racing sim. It's not arcady like Flatout (Bugbear's other developments). It's more on the side of a sim. So you wanna win the race by RACING, not pushing a boost button.Moreover, all this wouldn't even work if the graphics and physics weren't so superbly done.You can run this game at defualt graphics and have an amazing visual and gameplay experience.At the detected default setting, the game runs perfectly fine and looks amazing!The force feedback (FFB) on the controller is spot on.As far as content goes, you have access to several cars, tracks, and events.You can set the races to suit you.There is enough here to keep you busy for a while.You have online races to mess with too. But the offline AI is pretty damn good; especially for an early access game. It offers an awesome amount of challenges."

Nice physics, nice crashes and even not easy to win round-track races. That is, what startet with FO1 and FO2, which I played for hours, especially in LAN mode with friends.For lovers of the former versions from bugbear, this is a must have in my humble opinion and I am looking forward for more finished content. Did not read much from the content here, but I hope, that the ""mini-games"" (ragdoll games) will also be back.So keep on developing, this one is hot and the best compensation between ""serious racing simulations"" (of which we have enough right now) and the big franchises throwing out a new (full of bugs) sequel every year."

I never played those, but their fans seem to be very forgiving.Next Car Game isn't really much of a game at present. There's a physics and damaging model that works quite nicely. There are a few tracks and three cars. That's pretty much it.You can get the old tech demo for free, which shows you most of what there is and is a lot more fun.I'm sure Next Car Game will become a fine racer, but at present it is impossible to tell what it will be or how the game will be structured. None of which would be a problem were the devs not asking for Twenty Great British Pounds.I got suckered in by a couple of interesting looking YouTube videos, imaginging there would be more to play with than there was. I've had the game for months now and there's still little sign of an actual game. Also, the handling keeps changing, making it impossible to know what kind of feel the game will have when finished.The whole experience has really put me off Early Access.My question would be, ""Early access to what?""It is disingenuous when the blurb uses the present tense to describe features that are not yet in place.As for the claim that damage is ""convincing"". Well, hardly! I've never seen a car made into a concertina, let alone still run.OK, there is a separate list of Early Access features, and perhaps I was naive to expect more, but this isn't worth 20 quid in its present state.The problem is, who knows if it ever will be?Lesson learned."

Unless you get it in a bundle for a couple bucks it's not worth your time.Not that it ain't fun but after 2/3 years in alpha you'd think they made progress, yet it's still pretty much the same game I played a couple years ago with pretty much no content added and all the physics still the same.The mechanics simply aren't perfect, it lacks a campaign and especially fun minigames like flatout 2 used to have.Racing and derbys are fun and all but only for a short amount of time, it does not make up for the price you pay."

Seen a June30th review claiming otherwiseMultiplayer lag: This game is demanding you have 24 cars hurling down a track at 100+Mph. 10ths of a second can seriously effect how something goes down. I've played the game from a slower extremely realiable connection, and also from a very fast but less consistent connection. I'll tell you when you have a low ping on a reliable connection that doesn't ever spike, the multiplayer can be excellent. On a connection that lags even just a little you're not playing, it doesn't matter how ""fast"" it is.  I noticed the same effect with GTAV. Friends of mine who have trouble with this game have problems with GTAV too. Yet can play a game like War thunder fine.The new update ruining the physics, that is completely hog wash. The cars handle more realistic now, but not to the point of undrivable. BUT if you've been playing for awhile its gonna bother you cause you have to re-learn the best way to run tracks. I know alot of people complained about the physics before not being realistic enough, so bug bear did something about it. Personally I don't mind them either way.I wish bug bear had just left the physics alone and focused more on adding features to the game. I feel the people that were crying about the physics probably were just looking for something to moan about, or couldn't admit to themselves that they suck at driving games. Every racing game is different, some people can't except that and need to go back to playing Nascar 2012. Ultimately what makes this game fun is the banger style racing. The people complaining about handling were the same ones freaking out that someone put them in a wall on purpose. I don't like to generalize but I've been on all the forums and raced with alot of people and I can't help but notice the connection.Ultimately though this is a great racing game and their is so much that is done right. If you love door to door racing don't pass this game up."

I'm able to find people to race with every night if I want currently.  It is made by Bugbear which is the group who designed the Flatout 1-2 games. I loved those games. It's like a new verson of those games. The reasons I play the game are:1. You can wreck and damage other cars your racing against and be damaged or wrecked.2. The cars are fun to drive and a total blast on the best tracks.3. The track design is very good like it was in the flatout games.4. The racing happens at extreme speeds pushing the limits of how fast you can go without wrecking all the time.5. I've had so many super close races with other good players and who is going to win is totally unpredictable in those races.6. I use a logitech gamepad and the game has perfect support for it.7. I know what the flatout games were like and this game will be like them or possibly better when it's finished being built. Like I said it's in preaplha so the game is only partially complete and it should  have more tracks and will definately have more cars.8. The cars and driving are realistic enough and fun at the same time so I have no complaints about the feel of the cars and the racing.9. You can damage things on the tracks and there is debris on the tracks from that at times ect.10. The sound in the game is really good. The graphics are also impressive and I see nothing about them that is not to like.11. Wrecks happen all the time in this game and it's a game of dirty racing, although I dont focus on wrecking others I do it fairly often. Most of the time I'm just racing to win.12.

It doesn't have nitrous boosting like FlatOut 2 (Which I think is better than this game being in-dev) and Bugbear responded to a comment on their FaceBook page that it will not be added in. But the damage systems are much better. But, since it's early access, there are only a few cars and tracks, and barely any customization so there's not a very wide variety of things to do. I don't reccomend buying the deluxe edition, unless it's on sale. I bought the deluxe edition for 50% off. The new car should be updated into my game near the end of 2015 or early 2016 (game's full release)The multiplayer kinda sucks, because there aren't many lobbies, and if you join one with more than three people, it's in-game and you have to wait a few minutes(long time for waiting for entertainment) and you cannot spectate, although I expect that to be in an update.Speaking of updates, an update this month (June) will raise the car count from 5 to 7 and add two more tracks. I don't think one of them was a derby, but, whatever. One is a figure 8.So I only reccomens this if it's on sale, because right now, it gets boring quick.But if you wanted this, something that's just like this and won't get boring quick is FlatOut 2 (If you're in early June all four FlatOut's are six bucks in a pack, BUY IT NOW)"

I check back every so often because the game looked so promising and had so much potential. Im still hoping that it someday gets finished. the driving physics are decent thanks to the most recent update. the damage physics are what makes it special of course. The last thing close to it was of course flatout u.t. Its amazing no one else has thought to do a demolition racing game since 2008.unfortunately its taken a turn for the worst. with a recent update the parts from your car wear down after each race and you have to purchase new parts with in game money that you earn from races. Not necessarily upgrades, just replacement parts. And i guess you level up after each race for some reason. I feel like im being trolled at this point. That just makes it like every other survival crafting early access turd on steam?!?! Why not ad zombies next? They also added lawn mowers recently which is just stupid. Im pretty sure if the dev team is streched this thin that the game has been in early access for over 2 years now, giving us lawn mowers to play with is a waste of time.  Please just make a worthy successor to the flatout series. There is still only a handfull of cars and tracks, most of which are ""under construction"". The game still feels like a tech demo and theres really no reason to come back other than to check up on the extremely slow progress.

One glitch that I get a lot is a map texture error where the entire map turns black, white, green, or pink, and I have to rejoin the server to fix it, which causes me to frequently miss races or derbies.Also, the damage system doesn't really make sense to me. Sometimes I will go at 40 mph and perfectly t-bone another player, but do severe damage to me and not as much damage to them. Obviously, it would make sense for the door to crumble because it has a hollow space behind it, and my car's front to take less damage because it has much less space behind it.

Crashes are really good too, car damage can do with some work but it is still early days in the development.

But a sorry excuse for steering wheel and gamepad support are my biggest issues. The game with all assists OFF still takes away a larger percentage of your steering the faster you go. 20 MPH=full steering. 45mph steering is cut by over 50%. It almost makes the game unplayable. I say this because if you get tapped by another driver and start to spin there is no way to counter steer. I have tried everything in the settings and I still get the same results no matter what they are.I could see this game getting a lot of my time but as of right now I cannot stand to have a game force vehicle physics and surface traction differences on me (dirt, tarmac, grass, ect) without a proper way to actually control the car. As it is right now I find the game playable but only on the keyboard. It seems to be the only control that does not suffer from the limited steering.As of right now I cannot recommend this game as it is. Could be great but isn't. Simple."

You can tell what each car is based off of and the tracks are amazing. With the choice between racing around several tracks to t-boning opponents in a demolition derby, from single player to online multiplayer, this game is by far the best car game of its time.The only down sides to it are the fact that you need a powerful computer to run the game without a lot of lagging, and the customization on the cars is limited. However, Bugbear Entertainment does keep adding cars and things to customize with each update, so I have no worries there. Although, the damage inflicted to your car seems to be the same whenever you are hit in the same spot. If you want to check out the gameplay, here is an example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAMec-IJZh4If you want a game where the car crumples with each impact, awesome racing and cars, then you really need to get this game."

Since I bought the early access a lot of tracks have been added along with cars, the possibility to change the car parts, and multiplayer. However this is far to be a finished product so be aware if you are going to buy this that the game might not be finished until 1 or 2 years, if not more.The game you get now is a solid base and you can have a lot of fun with it. I believe it can be played with a wheel, pedals and H-shifter, but I still have to check. The physics in my opinion are quite good and the cars handle realisticly for a game like this, it is not a hardcore racing sim but not bad with all the aids off. The damage system, not too hardcore(at least yet), visually stunning and provides tons of fun"

Yet the store page is now flooded with negative comments about slow development and lack of content.Failed kickstarter, failed game, failed your fans who got bored and wandered off. Great engine gone to waste by slow lazy development path.*Update Jun 2015It's been a full year since my original review.Please do not buy this game, you're investing into a failed kickstarter (literally flopped on kickstarter). There have been no updates, just an ever diminishing group of fanboys sticking up for the slowest project in history, that it seems will never be completed.If your'e interested in distruction physics and vehicles go spend a fiver on Besiege or the amazing red faction guerilla, or Just Cause 2. Anything but this!*Update Jan 2015Still big gaps (this time 3 months) without anything resembling news, still nothing on single player modes or planned beta release date. Getting frustrating, Theres a slim chance I will still be interested when/if this ever releases.*Update 07/09/14No new content in 2 months and no update on when to expect it. Poor show for a game with less than a handful of races and only 3 cars to date!Original Review:Still no new content to speak of and another three months have gone by, one unfinished map, a car, and some minor tweaks. This was my first taste of early access and will be my last. Should have guessed from the failed Kickstarter that this wasn't going anywhere fast. Got it on sale so I don't feel too robbed. The real problem here is lack of news. They're obviously working on something but for whatever reason they don't let us know what it is or when to expect it.Verdict: Leave your money in the bank, only pay for games when they resemble games and not tech demos with stretched out promises. 'Has potential' like many other early access games, but really has no replay value until it's a fully fleshed out experience."

I often find myself starting a match only to quit within a few seconds due to the repetitive nature of gameplay.

No one tested that update before releasing it...it's impossible.

However, when I came across this game, the thing that attracted me was the damage system.  It seemed to be really amusing, no matter how bad you were at the actual game.  I wish that I had thought more about how much processing power it takes to render all those bits that fly off your car.  Mainly what I'm trying to say is that you need a very good computer for this to run at its full potential.If you like racing games, and have a good computer, this game will satisfy you very much.  The driving is smooth as it can be when using the keypad, but controls can be customized to fit your liking.  The damaged is still fun and amusing, just not as much as I would like.  Especially since the lowest settings is the only way I can play this game without it lagging every second.The cars feel like cardboard.  There's nothing wrong with that, it fits the game's destruction everywhere style.  If you bump a corner you headlight will be smashed even if your are going at about 2mph.  If you are more of a fan of realistic style games, don't consider this.The graphics are nice if your computer can handle it.  If it can't, then expect Playstation 2 eyecandy.  All the destruction that goes out throughout either the race or derby; the only two modes in the game, do stay throughout the entire thing, which is a very nice touch that adds to the atmosphere since you can look back at the end and see all the carnage that has unfolded.Overall, I'm going to not recommend this to people like me without a good computer; but if you have a nice one, give this a try."

If you ever heard of de-sync (from PoE) here you have it again, sometime my car moonwalk cause of the terrible multiplayer coding.- There is no 'crash' effects or sound- The graphics isn't even half as beautiful as they look on the screenshots- The game feels choppy as you drive, and the cars is very hard to control. (yet alone to hit another car)- There is too many bugs in the game.

I feel like a ghost playing against AI, there is no feedback or gratification from pitting someone off the course or having a takedown.In terms of replayability and hours worth of gameplay, there is a lot of work needed. It should be noted that this is a early-access game, but at the current point this game is NOT WORTH $30. I am 3 hours in and feel devoid of content.This is a nice game to mute and start playing your favourite music with, however it gets repetitive fairly quickly.

Nothing beats smashing into another car and watching the parts fly.Hitting the concrete barriers are also fun as they show damage too.The damage is done a lot better than the Flatout, however it's a lot harder to play and the damage is far too high when hit. The two cars that come with the early access game are not that great when racing but are fun for the demoltion. The red one kept pulling to the left when I accellerate off the mark?Turning was terrible didn't feel right and you never had 100% control over the car, the demolition level was the most playable.Overall I find the Flatout series a far better game playability wise (apart from the appalling Flatout 3 which was bad at everything). In Flatout controlling the cars was spot on here it never feels quite right.Hopefully it's more playable once complete, not a lot there at the moment.Is it worth the $25-$30 at the moment, no.Huge Flatout fan, so fingers crossed the final version of this game is a winner, after all it's far from finished."

Cars don't feel like they have any weight and get tossed around like nothing when hit.  The A.I. is not great. In a derby, if you start driving in circles, the A.I. will just follow you forever rather than taking a different tactic.Driving is very sloppy. You never feel like you have control because the stearing is so loose and again, your car feels too lite.If there is a reverse cam, I haven't found it yet.

You get two vehicles, two tracks, one demo derby track, and a separate ""sneak peak 2.0"" minigame that allows you do mess around with things that look taken straight out of BeamNG.Drive.The Deluxe Edition does not currently give you anything extra, as you have to actually wait for the developers to actually CREATE that content, as it does not exist yet.The controls are extremely awful as well. It makes due for the demo derby, but the racing? good luck keeping control of your vehicle or getting higher than 12th place  in the HUGE races. I used an xbox360 controller, and played around with the keyboard. Neither allow you to accurately control your vehicle.TL:DR, wait for this game to improve and add much more content before making a decision to buy or not. As of right now it's really not worth the money and dulls out extremely quickly.As far as my game time goes, i've played about half an hour of the game, which is why it says ""0 hours"""

If you enjoy fishtailing around like a lunatic then this probably the gane for you.  The racing AI is terirble too, you can like slow down by bumping a wall and suddenly you are in last place without anyone passing you, do not buy this game until it gets some major imporvments, which could come, it is in alpha.  Also, the cameras are pretty bad too, as well as inm the sneak peak.

The game is going to be great [ probably ] but if they don't get away from the silly arcade style of gameplay this game will never make any more of a mark then the flat out series .. which dont get me wrong was ok if you like silly shoot your car through rings crap. But was more fun for kids. I want to see more serious racing like World of outlaws dirt tracks .. not silly dirt tracks that are made for trucks with jumping etc. If this game continues on the path of silly racing game without putting any remote bit of realisism in it .. i will be very disipointed . 98% of Demo derbys in the USA are on clay or dirt not assfault . Try putting some oval dirt tracks in there , what good is upgrading your car if all you are going to do is destroy is like some silly arcade racing game.EDIT: 7/11/2017. Game price increased to 39.99 Been 3 years since my first review.. although much has been added, mostly by mod community after releasing steam workshop. game is now dated.

Cruising down the race track in full speed, seeing a car turned side-ways, and smashing into it with  full force, parts flying everywhere... it's so rewarding.I have fun with this game, however not so much fun that i want to play it for hours. This is an early release, 3 cars exists, some car customisations are possible and a few tracks are available. It's fun to drive around and crash into things, seeing how the car behaves but not for longer periods of time.I'm not overly experianced with car game, I played some Gran Turismo, Colin McRae and so on, but not a die hard fan, however I can say that the cars feel realistic to control. The bigger cars are heavy to steer and slow at start, while the smaller ones are faster and more agile in their turning. Eventually I guess it will be possible to even tweak the settings alá Gran Turismo style, but we're not there yet.I'd recommend this game, even if the only reason being that the cars get wrecked (which is fun!).

It is essentially those demos you see at E3 of games like Need for Speed/Burnout with all these crashes and amazing things happening, but that happens all the time. That is the core of the game. It may need a bit more of a beafier computer to run so before purchasing check the recommended specs. Also, being in early access, the content is a little light. However, when an update comes out, it is like waking up on Christmas morning. It leaves you filled will happiness and joy and you wanting more. The game still has a long way to go and seeing it at such a great stage this early on is giving some promising results for the future. It is a must have. No doubt. This game is raw amazingness and you should just stop reading this and go buy it this instance, even if you have to steal money to afford it. It is definately worth it and I can see the price raising when the game becomes more developed.

The descturable enviroment is great and the softbody physics on cars are great. The driving feel is bit less arcadey than in Flatout series but that is just a good things in my opinion.

In the Demolition Derby, things are awkward every now and then, but eventually it just gets better the more and more you play it. If you are someone who enjoyed other Bugbear games, I can already guarantee that you are going to love this game. It's basically the same thing as their FlatOut series, but spiced up WAY more with a brand new physics engine, with very many improvements. The price is a bit of a stretch for a game with not that many features (yet), but at the same time to some people price doesn't matter. Overall, it's a wonderful value and fun for anybody."

Damage model is a bit on the crazy side, some of my cars look like they shouldn't still be going but they put along, but it's a small gripe and it's done to help the fun part of the game along. This goes for the physics model as well. Not perfect but it aids in making the game more enjoyable.This is Demolition derby for the current generation. The racing is suitably difficult, after a single lap there will be debris all over the track and the opponents won't think twice about smashing you off the track. The demolition events are spectacular, good luck surviving till the end.Down side is that even my reasonably powerful PC was struggling for frame rate when the debris really starts cluttering the circuits.All up, one to look out for, I'm sure it will only get better as this churns along the development cycle."

I've never driven a real car before but I imagine that's what it would be like.It's quite a challenging game as well. It takes a bit of skill to get to first place with all the other cars trying to smash you off the track. It's harder still to stay in first place, if you drift around a corner badly you'll let a few people past and will struggle to get back to where you were.Bugbear is constantly adding new stuff to the game so it's going to get better and better and it's already worth the money as it is.

The racing in this is incredibly fun when you learn to control the vehicle. Ifind that using a controller is easiest; Driving games: controller, Shooters; mouse.This is the kind of game that I find much easier to play when tipsy, not drunk; but tipsy. I feel more relaxed therefore things run smoother. When sober then game runs incredibly fluidly, the destruction is absolutely top notch. The only thing to me that needs adjusting is the way the camera moves, both in the sandbox and in the main game.

You see damage on that door. Genuis.The objects in game [Concrete walls, cones, tires] all have thier own intitiy which means you run into a stack of tires, you dont just bounce off the stack of tires, the stacks goes flying with each tires having its own hit box and intity, after they contuine to make a great mess throughout the race.Walls have damage, so if you smash a wall full speed the wall breaks into peices, hit it softer and it takes damage over time and finally will break as other drivers... or you hit it.Throttle control is something too, you cant just smash down RT and think you'll make it, you have to actually control the throttle to get traction on differnt surffaces.Game looks amazing, no lag even when mashing a huge stack of tires.Of course its a little empty right now because of its Alfa state, cant wait to see a leveling system maybe and new parts to earn, or a point system.

,Recommended,228380,8819945,"Posted: 23 January, 2014",all,Charlie,"Let me describe a basic 24-car race for you.You enter the grid. You're starting in last, but that's ok, because your classic muscle car is tricked out with a 500hp engine. You rev your engine, pretending to grip the steering wheel, wondering where your character's hands are, only to realize that because it's a pre-alpha game, there are no drivers in any of the cars. No time to focus on that now, though, the countdown has ended, and the race has begun!You gun the engine. You shift into second gear, beginning to pass other racers. And before you can even get into third, two cars in front of you are upside down blocking the road.Not to fear, you plow right through them! Only now, your hood is crumpled, and vision obstructed. If you're REALLY stingy, you'll continue on in first person, otherwise, you'll switch to chase cam. As you drift around the first corner, two cars in front of you slam into the wall. The outside car is now broken, and can no longer race. Congrats, now the worst you can do is 23rd place!The race continues on. As you finish your first lap and move into your second, the track is littered with debris. Car parts, tire barriers, and billboard pieces provide quite the navigational challenge... oh, and did I forget to mention the actual dq'd CARS blocking the road? I'd suggest you plow right through them, but your front end has probably taken a beating right now, and if you had trouble turning left (similar to Derek Zoolander) I wouldn't be surprised. If you've made it up to 10th place by now, you're pretty spectacular. If you've been dq'd due to excessive damage, that would sound about right.I don't think I need to continue.If that's not your idea of fun, you should definitely seek professional help.This game is, flat out, fun. Is it the most realistic racing sim? Nope. Is it easy? Nope. Are you going to be able to finish every race? Nope. Are there a wide selection of cars and tracks? Nope. Is the game itself even close to finished? Nope. Are you going to have fun? Yep.The $25 is worth the racing alone.

I hope it's going to happen because in fact it doesn't seem to be so far away. But there is still a lot to do.The tech preview / pre alpha shows the capabilities of the physics engine which seems to run in a very efficient way by means of computing power needed.crashes and model deformation is awesome to look at but yet too unrealistic. this could be fixed very simply: reduce the number of debris after a crash - but make it solid - and kill the player after his cockpit is so deformed that no one can survive! a simple double cuboid collision detection would fix that!another problem is controlling the car in race mode: both of the two cars available are hardly controllable in low speeds. steering seems to be prone to kind of ""resonance frequence"". The input shakes up too high after a few controls. this would be an acceptable behaviour for a simulator but not really for a ""i love crashes""-game.and my last critic is that this behaviour does not realy depend on the ground you drive on. the angle of the ground seems to be the leader of what happens to your cars' vectors. but there are few to no local vector disturbance events, such as rocks, debris, ect.all in all: I'd LOVE the game to get final. and I am sure it can be done. if financing doesn't fail..."

The devs should add clutch too to make driving WAY more interactive.Hopefully the Devs don't just leave this game sit and rot and actually put some time in it.

No. Even in this early stage, where the game doesn't even has a real name, it's already the most fun I had in a game for a long time. It's just beautiful to see the cars get smashed into pieces and see the parts and tires flying in the air.There is something magical about destroying the cars, it doesn't even matter if you win or not. But don't expect too much yet, even tho the game has allot of potential it is really early acces. There is no way of saving, buying or really fine tuning you car, no multiplayer. But the creators of the game (known from the Flatout games) already made it up by making this a pure joy.And if what the game can offer you is not enough, they also have the sneakpeak 2.0 where you can destroy your car on more creative and extreme ways.

There were intense crashes, amazing overtakes, and tremendous ♥♥♥♥ups all around.  Very vew racing games make me giggle like Wreckfest does.- The community seems to be pretty cool, and understanding so far.  They understand it is a contact racing game, and dont get mad over a little rubbing (or full on t-bone).   Although, as with any racing game, there are a few jackasses who think its funny to go in reverse around the track, just to crash into the people actually racing.-------------------------Next Car Game has a mountain of potential.  With easily some of the best Physics I've ever seen in a racing game, on top of a tight handling experience and an amazing Soft-Body damage system, Next Car Game is looking to be one of my favourite racers of all time.In its current state (May 19, 2014), there are only 3 vehicles, 4 race tracks and 3 derby areas, I have still managed to pump in 5 hours.  The indeterminancy of each race makes playing the same track over and over again a complete joy.Although there is no Muliplayer support yet, the 23 other AI drivers in each race still make every corner exciting, and every crash breathtaking.For what you are getting right now, the asking price is a bit steep, but with the amount of momentum this game is generating, I have no doubt it will be well worth the money later down the line."

And so far I don't see a lot of difference. The graphics look pretty much the same and the performance didn't change a lot either.So...I still can't recommend the game. The engine and game mecanics are solid. The part of the game they already delivered is fun but there is just way too little content and the game is in early access since...well since way too long.My recommendation: Keep an eye on the updates, but wait until there is (way) more content before you consider buying.UPDATE[May12 2015]So i finally have to change my recommendation for this game to ""not recommended"". The game has a lot of potential and you can get quite a lot of fun out of the EA version already but it seems like the devs have given up on it. There hasn't been an update in about half a year and since the PR guy at bugbear quit his job (his contract ran out) there has been hardly a word from the devs.For now I can only tell you not to buy this, because it is unsure if you will ever get a finished product for your money.I will update this if it ever seems that developement is back on track.[Original review]What a game. Even in this early stage with just two cars, 2 tracks and one destruction derby event as I'm writing this review, this game is really fun to play.That's mainly due to the great mechanics it offers, above all the great physics system and the almost human AI. Other drivers are fighting door-to-door battles with each other, making mistakes or just kicking your♥♥♥♥♥ Those systems working together create situations like a car being rammed off the track, sliding sideways over an obstacle, turning in the air and wrecking 5 metres worth of wooden fence on impact. All the while car parts, tires and splinters are shattering everywhere around you, bouncing off your car.And that's not a once-per-game Need For Speed script event. That's just something that can happen during any race in endless variations. With very moderate system requirements. And keep in mind, this game is still in pre-alpha stage.While the graphics are already pretty sweet, the audio part could still use some love. There is no music in the game yet (except on the physics playground you also get with preordering) and the crash sounds are very weak, compared to the visible destruction.So if you ask me, all Bugbear has left to do is putting a lot of content (cars, tracks, game modes) on top of their already incredibly fun base systems and finish their sound system to create one of the best racing games since Flatout 1 (whitch was also developed by Bugbear ;))."

With a new build in the pipeline (google next car game news and click the official bugbear site to keep up to date) the game is set to become even better. Car physics are good, even if a car that shouldn't be driving still handles pretty well it's a lot better than the scratched panels you get on forza 5 after wiping out at 250 mph in a bugatti.(and the bugatti then continues to drive?????)Currently fun game, I'd love to see splitscreen and car customisation added with achievements and a much bigger selection of cars however I'm more than happy to play it in it's current state and let the devs taek their time.TL:DR - Good game with future updates may become great, not for people who want boatloads of content/finished game."

The one thing; the best thing that stood out was the derby… The roar of the engines, guttural and deep, the flash or coat of spray paint arms, plastered on the cars. The death match set; one winner, against and rage, fire and meatal… for all the little intra – secrecies, the partial development, overall this game is pure.

The vehicle damage a bit rediculous, to the point that I can't believe that the driver is still alive, and theres no way that the car is gonna keep going  when the engine is in the driver's lap. If they toned that down on certain parts of the car I'd give this game a 10/10. Very fun, speed and carnage, controls are not too arcadie. I'd like to be able to map my own controls and have a chase cam that lets you use the mouse to turn the camera, including inverting the y axis.

It's too much funny.I think it's pretty normal that the game is updated every 1-2 months, the engine of the game is very high (i would say that's what a game of 2014 deserves.) so the projects are complessive and it's normal that they take a lot of time. I read that they launched the game in early alpha because they didn't have enough funds and because they launched an ""idea"" to get money that failed (u may look up on google about it).Well the early alpha release gave them tons of money. Much more than what they expected. So i suppose this game will become very very nice. I'm up for the bugbear (i played both flatout 1 and 2) and i know they can do a god game.By the way i reccomend this for the multiplayer, as i said before, and for the game by itself.

I loved it when it was just single player playing with 23 AI opponents but when the multiplayer came out the game just blew my mind. This is literally the funniest game I've ever played. Watching, avoiding or causing ridiculous crashes and damage provides me no end of amusement.Much of the environment is destructable, and the debris even after one lap on some courses ends up everywhere. And the fantastic thing is that the debris is actually there in the eyes of the physics engine, and your car will take damage from debris in the track. I've actually been knocked out driving a very damaged car and then hitting a medium piece of concrete in the track. The engine is gorgeous and in my opinion very stable. Game is in pre-alpha but runs and looks better than many other finished games.I'm not a huge fan of the derbies, mostly because I don't have the hang of them I think, but I do like the servers providing much more mayhem oriented races. And thats the thing, you find very different flavors on different servers. Some hosts want pure racing and kick anyone playing ridiculously and that becomes very competitive, and then there are hosts that are driving backwards themselves. On those servers the race becomes practically a derby and I like to practice crash avoidance and recovery.This is not a simulator, it is a bit more on the arcadey side of things. You will see cars missing wheels and crushed in half that are still going around the track. Your cars performance does degrade, but they will keep you racing when a car normally would be dead. Racing wheels are supported, gears work but no clutch, force feedback works great. gamepads as well.It is still a pre-alpha so there are many things in the menu that don't do anything yet and some things don't work quite right yet and some things that you demand from a game will not be here yet (like spectator mode when you jump into a race in progress, things like that). But Bugbear seem to be pushing the patches and new versions out pretty often. And it's not as frustrating as it can be with other alphas becauase theres no save game to break and no progress to lose.Its great fun, I want everyone to buy this game. Honestly some of the best fun I've had in a game in quite a while.Oh, and I almost forgot. I believe when you purchase the game you still get access to the sneak peak 2.0. This is a fantastic little sandbox that is just a grid with some stuff to mess with (think beamNG but with wacky stuff in there). Its basically a playground to explore their physics and destruction engine. Theres grinders, basketball hoops to jump through (into grinders), hammers, jumps galore into destructable stuff, a giant spider crusher thing, one of those balls to drive in like motorcycles used to do at the circus, and more. A cannon, you can shoot yourself out of a cannon. With no explanation or turret your car can spawn and fire any object you see (most objects) and fire it at things including other AI racers. Also you can fire huge metal balls, Black hole balls and missiles. The sneak peak is great fun and worth checking out."

One is if you choose to want to race around a circuit you can and the other (which at the moment is my favourite) is to just drive around an open area not too big in scale but enough to feel total freedom, where you get to smash into other cars and obstacles.The graphics are amazing and the damage visuals are great. Smash into anything where you can play for fun or even when you take it seriously as a racing game on the track game it is still at the top of its game. The handling is really spot on and the slides around corners feel great and are just at the right difficulty in handling.Overall:- Great phsyics, great handling and great graphics.For me as an early access game WOW! love it.I bought this game 16 Dec, 2014  in a sale for £11.49 Purchase Next Car Game: Wreckfest.I see that the last update has not happened since before I bought it, last update was 24th October 2014.

Crashes often have spectacular results and leave debris almost everywhere!The game isn't all about racing either, but also about demolition derby. Facing you with up to 23 opponents and having you fight till the end (untill your car is literally un-drivable).It's increadably fun and worth the current asking price as well. Plus buying the game before it's full release will throw in an exclusive testing ground mini-game kind of thing. And trust me, that's just as fun.-Tyke"

Two or three maps....2 or so cars...and a destruction testing game ( Basically do whatever you want, showing off the engine).An with only that, became the best racing game i played. There wasnt any customizations yet, No multiplayer yet, Not many cars or tracks. But what it did had which was perfect. Gameplay and Destruction. Ooooooh boy the destruction. You start a race with 24 cars, You will be seeing cars fly over barriers, cars crashing into each other and rolling off the track, just utter destruction and perfection. Most intense racing game to date.....but unfortunately it has lost that title.Thanks to community feed back from the wrong people who ""dislike"" destruction, made this company become less....Violent in this game.The destruction is lowered......dramatically. In the earlier builds, everytime you hit a car, hit a barrier or etc. You will hear a huge crash/clash against another vehicle or object an parts flying everywhere. Now, you barely hear it. An the physics changed a bit, not by much but definitely made it slower persay.The added features is nice but the dramatic change in destruction and gameplay which made this game shine when it first appeared. It shamefully went down the wrong direction.With no definite news of when this game will be updated or released. There is no point in buying this as of right now.Unless you have money to spare and then i would recommend it. Overall right now, not really worth it anymore."

,Recommended,228380,10773279,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,Eclectic Fence,"2016 Update at bottom.Ok, so there are 2 things I had never done before this game.1, Bought an early access game.2, Written a review on Steam.(For the second I apologize and use as an excuse).**Edit: Seems the second point was a lie. Whoops.**After watching a few game play videos on youtube and reading up on it I decided I wanted in on this a.s.a.p and couldn't be happier so far.Firstly, for a Pre-alpha release it is very well optimized. I run it on a laptop using a Intel i5 and Nvidea GT 750M gpu (although it only seems to detect the integrated intel HD graphic card at the mo') whilst I don't have it running at full spec, it runs nice and smooth whilst looking very nice indeed.The game play itself is great fun, the damaged modeling is brilliant and races are pure chaotic fun from start to finish (whether that be the finish line or totaling your car). I can't wait to have more tracks and vehicles to play with.Obviously, people need to remember the fact this is very very early on in its development and ergo, there is still a lot to be added and refined. It's very basic menu wise, only 3 cars with limited upgrades, and 4 tracks (with reverse configuration) and 3 destruction derby arenas, that said, I'm still amazed at how it is at this stage.If you liked the FlatOut games, Destruction Derby 1 & 2 from the old Playstation or just enjoy good old fashion automotive carnage, this is definitely the game for you.Even if you don't fancy joining the early access (you'd be foolish and are missing out) you need to keep an eye on this one.TL:DR? Well how come you're looking at this for one thing, but mainly just buy this game, it is feckin' great.2 years later, new laptop, still loving it.I see a lot of people moaning about how it's been in early access for ages, which is true, but making a game from the ground up takes time. I'd rather they took their time tweaking and perfecting rather than rushing it out like a lot of devs do with predictable results.People (should) buy into Early Access understanding the risks and caveats that come with it. I did, and am glad I have. This game, bottom line, is fun. Yes, it's subjective but reviews always are.If you're looking for the destruction derby game we've all been waiting for, this is it. If you're not ready to buy onto a game that is still in development, and could be for a while more, wait. It's simple really.I for one have already got my moneys worth out of this, looking forward to the completed game whenever that arrives, I can wait."

Then they changed some things that sort of ruined the game.  Then they added Santas on lawnmowers.  Now this game that was what everyone wanted in a demolition derby/racing game with fantastic physics is a gokart game with physics from 2008.  On top of all that, the devs have seemed to have left the game, or at least slowed down drastically.  A few years ago this was a great game, so I'm not sure how it got to this point.  Maybe the developers are hiding some secret in the background that they have been working on all this time.  Until they tell us this big secret, I can't recommend paying $40 for an Early Access title with no substance beyond what it started with years ago that doesn't seem to be expanding."

I was happy to notice that these could be turned off already in the early versions and a wheel will soon be testing the game.The current early access and the sneak peek (never remove the sneak peak!) are more of the same only bigger, better and more jawdroppingly beautiful. In few other games do you have insane fun when you're in 14th place.Along with the insane destructive environments, long lasting debris, tire tracks the detailed sound is also highly impressive.The replay feature should have rewind possibilities (unless this is somehow very resource demanding) and the free roaming camera should have the ability to be moved in Z-axis.

There are currently multiple tracks that have been left unfinished, and instead of finishing those tracks, Bugbear has decided to just add even more unfinished tracks (missing textures, poor coloration, jagged edges). The cars also handle quite poorly, with a lot of the cars feeling loose and almost slimy on even grippy surfaces. I was willing to forgive the poor handling, but the fact that the AI are cancerous and constanly push you off the track in addition to the fact that there are only 2 cars at the time of writing this that have physical customization (bumpers, hoods, etc.) pushes this game off the edge for me. I don't expect a full game release until the start of the next decade to be honest.

Not soo many people playing atm ( see steamcharts if you care )You need to forward ports to host multiplayer ( and a lot of upload, at least 1,5 mbps )Annoying repair system ( to be exact, only wear of parts but no repair system --> so you have to buy new stuff )Not really fast development and no release date atm --> but at least the development which has doneis great, game is evolving good, and as stated above its also in the actual state worth the money twice.So, if you know what early access means, and are willing to be patientyou should buy this game...

I cannot recomend this game simply on this fact, the standalone preview has some fantastic simulation mechanics and showed promise. Returning to it years later however not much has changed. If you are interested in the vehicle destruction in this game pehaps consider looking at BeamNG Drive as a (although slightly less realistic) much more complete alternative.)(Original)The physics that Bugbear put into this demo are incredible... the cars realisticly deform in realtime without using the usual Morph Target trick developers have always used to fake realistic car dammage. Its all simulated in real time... and the enviorment destruction in the full game is bound to be complete havock if we learned anything from Flatout... I would highly reccomend supporting the studio in its upcoming game the tech demo in its early stages are remarkable and I am already having fun with the wrecks in the demo! they have a free demo you can try out for yourself... if you love playing around in it please support Next Car Game...

Really a shame since it was a cool racing game at a time. Now they have added the requirement for you to ""buy"" cars with ingame money and they got rid of the good war thunder UI and gotten something thats really consolized looking and horrid.I had my fun with it and in the year or more since I got it it hasn't gotten better from what I have seen, its just gotten worse at putting out frames."

Framerate all over the place with a 1050ti.Flatout 2 engine AND the Sneak preview were Superb engines that ran like Butter on Mercury even on Low-end Hardware.The Sneak preview is much different in tone for what the game now is.The Sneak preview had many crazy ideas i liked.And i liked the wrecking model it was hilarious.Now we got some kind of weird sim-arcade on totally realistic tracks.The Maps they deliver put way too much emphasis on landscape decoration which eats away all the framerate so it seems.Also the maps lack imagination and ramps, options for stunts, easy and hard path choices that made the Flatout 2 Maps so fun.They also introduced modding way too early, and now it's a mess because of incompatibility.The AI is way too bland and unspectacular, wheres Jack Benton and Sofia Martinez and all the other Characters which each had a different driving style?They luckily got rid of the inane crew upgrade and part wearing system and that dev-gui.The current gui is still way too complicated for what it does, but it's a slight step in the right direction.The upgrade system is still lackluster and not fun.How much fun is it to get 6 more horsepower for some linear piston upgrade? For me not so much.That's the same boring upgrade path that mad max has.Almost the whole part system is like this and unnecessarily complicated.Only choice that seems to matter is the differential mode, and i was too lazy to test the actual effect.Actual gameplay impact for 90% of these upgrades is next to nil.And then with a keyboard (i love driving games that work with keyboard and you can tap at different frequencies), its not very good to drive the higher horsepowered machines, even on tarmac it behaves more like wet mud.keyboard driving with this game is 5/10.just lowpass filter the keypresses and make the cutoff a user setting.Also better than the whole boring incremental upgrade system would be to get rid of it and just make distinct cars for different tiers like in flatout 2.But this is a different game now.Physics are ok i guess, but i remember they had in early time a better version (before they lost big part of the codebase and rewrote everything.) That would be the Sneak peek code i guess.My main problem is the total tonal discrepancy between the sneak peek and the current game.Sneak peek promised 100% fun mode.Wreckfest is 60% 'finnish folk racing simulator with (pretty cool) muscle cars' and 40% 'sorry we couldn't do any better'The game is still unfinished.For singleplayer there's not much content out of doing random races with a pretty boring AI.Multiplayer seems dead because of mods, but i didn't really check this. About 1/2 servers with ppl on it.Actually, the current state is what i would expect as a *start* for early access, not the result of what is it now 3-4 years of development?I also remember a more fun (and much better running) game before they 'rewrote everything physics and gfx from scratch'. I guess the guy with the fun code for the sneak peek left over a dispute whether to make a fun game or a finnish folk racing sim. But that's just a wild speculation. Latest additions seem to steer back to the fun part, let's see what they do.I don't recommend the current (08 2017) game because of the heavy sneak peek dissonance.Might be worth a look at a discount for someone with a top cpu/gpu combo interested in a somewhat semi realistic rendition of finnish folk racing 'alpha/beta' with muscle cars."

I really don't see why this game has gotten such a bad wrap, I hear... it hasn't been worked on in awhile, it's been out for 4 years and it's gotten worse, it's poorly optimized, the price is too much...the list goes on and on...now when these games come along that people wanna scam money from you, lets throw money at it, but when games come along that can genuinely set apart PC from console, everyone turns into a lil cry baby. I hear people complaining all the time since I got my PC, that ""because of consoles low specs, PC games get the #$%$@ end of the stick"" Then these low budget companies, or genuine groups of real people trying to make the dream come true. And they aren't like all these companies EA, Activision, UbiSoft and so on. They need help from the people.Instead of helping make pc a better place for great high level gaming, you wanna decide how much their work is to you. You can buy games on console with SO much less for $60. Trials Evolution & Fusion was a $40 2D-3D motorcycle obstacle track Platformer when they came out. It was great!  Don't just talk the talk, walk the walk and actually help the games that can potentially make PC gaming what it's supposed to be.  Maybe it's just you kids crying on here about ""poorly optimized"" I don't know. Maybe you shouldn't worry about killin a console and getting the cheapest pc you can, just for the sake of being a ""pc gamer"", to talk crap to console gamers with your low-med settings lol. Get a jobby job and earn you a pc that can actually play games.I have a good setup and I have no problem running this game, and it looks beautiful. I play in 4k and I only have 41 hours in this game. But I'm a coop player. I play multiplayer games to play with people for the most part. Racing games like this are the few games I like to get competative with, mostly because I can drive the crap out of a car, and on pc games the driving is so close to real. This pre alpha game makes this coop mostly player, play this game 41 hours 99% in single player race a race or two or a figure 8 derby and then watch the replay in cinematic view and sit there in awe with my mouth open, it looks so close to real.This game is also still in pre alpha right? That tells me that they aren't getting the backing they thought they would and its taking alot longer than planned. Does everyone only seem to remember how it feels to make a dealine for yourself to have things just keep goin wrong and you got people on your back whining and complaing, and your beating yourself up worse than anyone else every could. Plus you have to watch your dreams slowly fall apart, Humans have complicated lives and things have a way of happening. This really doesn't seem like the kinda game that doesn't want to be released. It just needs some support from the people whining that consoles are holding games back. People want pc gaming to be better, then they should help make it that way. It's funny people seem to think empathy is one way, when they want it from others when things aren't going their way.The few things I would really mention...is one, to say it's a bit exaggerated in the ""real-to-life"" remark. The graphics ARE amazing, the physics are equally amazing... up to a point. I think I understand why they did, if I'm right as to why, This game I'm not really sure you can have as intense a racing environment with BeamNG type soft body physics. One snapped axel, or controller arm and your race is over. Now if your car has an engine in the front it would seem close to real-to-life when you break down from engine damage. Sometimes in cars with front end engines you can see your cars engine might not be dead but you car wouldn't physically be able to move with the end bent the way it is. But you car seems to be driving as if all four wheels are fine. It happens alot more with cars with engines in the trunks. You can smash head on into other cars till your basically driving a backseat and two wheels, and your still driving perfectly fine like you got 4 wheels. The entire car has been smashed into the back seat, I wouldn't even wanna be there when they peel that poor guy off of the interior. If you look into these cars you can see your guy (picture of a derby racer) is all kinds of discombobulated, bent and strecthed in all kinds of weird and impossible contortions of the human body.Now I did notice that when I first got the game like 6 months ago...ish the car physics, and the way they handled, seems a bit different after THQ stepped in. Whatever they did I liked it the other way, Turning and just driving in general seemed more realistic, but I do like what they did with they menus and making the game actually look like it was more than pre alpha. I wish the community was a bit better, less choatic, and more organized. I would play it alot more. All I can do is my part to help it along, add my constructive 25 cents(inflation) with the intent of making it better, and hope no one has to watch their investment get run to the ground. Now for ppl actually just trying to rip people off to make easy money...to hell with 'em. But there are legitimate small groups that start out with a dream and it ends it a nitemare...Contributing a pittance to someone's dream gives you early access and the feeling of helping make something happen. Doesn't give u a backstage pass to crap on them as they pass you on the way down. What kinda person would help someone hit rock bottom faster. When your falling...do you need anyone else's help, or complaining as you're hitting rock bottom?"

There is still quite a few bugs, mainly video related. I've seen people with higher resolutions (higher than 1920x1080) having a problem at the moment, not sure if it's solved. Bugbear has stated that they will continue to work on this until it is a complete game, no matter how many pre-orders they get. So your money is in safe hands.

There is practically no flaming or anything negative going on what so ever.So buy this game, fool around and be active on the forums. I highly recommend it!EDIT 3 years later:So Bugbear bailed on us. It was so close. They only had to add a few more vehicles, a few more tracks, and a working campaign. Instead we got multiple physics-rewrites that only made the game worse with each iteration.
