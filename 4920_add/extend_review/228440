,Recommended,228440,9235079,"Posted: 23 February, 2014",all,Captain MooMoos,"I haven't played cubemen since the release of the new updates, so I will be updating this review once I have had the chance to test out the new unit balances.Gameplay:If you're not playing this game to compete with friends, but rather just occasionally compete against the AI then you will probably enjoy this game. It offers interesting new features such a placing mines and building walls, which allow you to control the enemy flow. By using special units you or the enemy can disassemble the walls.  The AI are rather simple and in reality offer no competition even on the hardest difficulty. Although, unlike the first cubemen the interesting feature this one has to offer is that the units can be upgraded. This means you can build armies up with strong weak units rather than more expensive units. The problem is this leads to unbalances. In the original if you lost the first fight you could send your cubemen out and kill the unit that killed yours without too much difficulty now the player can heal the unit by upgrading it and you're stuck in second place for the rest of the game. Because the new unit has upgraded range and damage so winning the second round with your un-upgraded stock unit is not too likely.Campaign:The campaign is just mission after mission with no story, random levels, and increasing wave numbers. The campaign is rather lacking as the enemy does not possess special units so you can easily control enemy flow by using wall placements. I also found myself only ever using Grill units throughout the campaign and just upgrading them. You will also notice there is no saving throughout the campaign so you may want to reserve about three hours to give yourself enough time to play through it.The Price:Cubemen 2, another installment to the Cubemen series. The game is sort of fun, and if you can get it for under $1.99 then it’s not a bad price either. This game is on the itunes app store for $1.99 so the fact it is here for $7.99 just seems plain ridiculous.Results:All in all I am going to recommend this game, but only if you can get it for the right price. $7.99 is absurd and honestly I am amazed 3 Sprockets has the audacity to ask for such a high figure with this game. Despite the price 3 Sprockets offers a fun little games; Cubemen 2 has interesting game types which offer new strategies not demanded from the first game and a map editor so you can create your maps that optimize each game type. If you ever played Warcraft III and liked Footman Wars then this is probably the game for you.Pros:+Map editor+New units (that allow you to control enemy flow)+Unit upgrades+New game types (that allow for players to not just perfect one strategy)+Smoother gameplayCons:-Boring campaign-Units can be hard to click sometimes resulting in the unit you were last on running next to the location of the unit you want to select (should have a different select and move key)-The health tile heals too rapidly (one player can easily hold the health tile)-Sometimes units do not turn by themselves instead they just stop fighting when units walk past their periphery.-Does not have the epic menu music like in the original cubemen."

,Recommended,228440,9498801,"Posted: 16 March, 2014",all,HA Mockingjay,"This game merges tower defense with real time strategy. Think Team Fortress 2, with smaller maps, always on Comannder from Battlefield, and everybody actually does what you say.You have 10 different classes of Cubemen. You have Pistol, Flint, Lightning, Ice, Rocket, Laser, Sniper, Engineer, Wall, and Mine. You move them around the map, and whenever somebody gets inside their shooting range, they shoot.You can play online with up to 5 other people, with modes such as Mayhem, CTF, Skirmish, and Territory. You can play with the AI if you want.In singleplayer, it's tower defense, but in real time. Each wave starts on its own, which creates a sense of danger. Your opponents charge WILL shoot back at your defenses, so make sure you have a ton of them.This game is amazing and I would suggest it to anyone who likes strategy games."
,Recommended,228440,9512864,"Posted: 17 March, 2014",all,GuyInJeans,"Cubemen 2 is a stark improvment from the first Cubmen. With new units, maps, and slightly different AI. It's a new experience for any RTS player. The campaign is in my opinion still unbalanced, but not as bad as the first Cubemen. The textures and menus are better than the first cubemen. And the skins and themes are a fun adition as well. I like the updated GUI and teleporter and medic station features. Overall the gameplay is good and entertaining, however I reccomend the freeplay mode more than anything else.Sadly, like the first cubemen, the multiplayer is sullen and empty. It's totally useless.The level editor is a load of fun and there are many published maps to play.The game is decent for the price, especially when your an avid RTS player.Overall; the game is a LOT better than the first Cubemen, 8/10"

It's not tactics. Its spamming, It makes the game beyond boring when they spam.Almost all the games characters are pointless except the basic infantry guy whom you can spam too who does more damage than the other gys and is MUCH cheaper. I'd reccomend Cubemen one than this one. Get that game."

,Recommended,228440,9223551,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,Revan1207,"Cubemen 2 is a strategy game where you use several types of cubemen to defeat your opponent. The types of cubemen range from soldiers with pistols to flamethrowers to rocket launchers to sniper rifles to ones that turn into walls and land mines. To unlock these units during a game, you buy them with cubes which you get for defeating enemies. Each time you buy a new unit, the price for that unit goes up one cube. For example, if you buy a flamethrower cubeman for 20 cubes the price goes up to 21 and so on. There are a few different game modes like defense, skirmish, rescue, and capture the flag. The game also comes with a level editor so you can make new levels and upload them so other people can play and rate them. Because of this, you may be finding yourself finding lots of interesting levels that you can play other than the ones that come with the game. This game also has an awesome techno soundtrack.I recommend this game, but I think $8 is a little too much for this game. If this game interests you, I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale. I wouldn't say you'd play this for hours straight, but it's a good game to get if you're looking for something new and interesting to keep you occupied for a few minutes."

Less than 2 hours into the game and a game-breaking bug already popped up (de-syncing in multiplayer and stuttering/clipping because of it). Also, the lack of hot keys and no option for lan multiplayer irks me. In its current state, I do not recommend it, but I might change my mind about it if it gets better."

I almost started to feel a sleep. This game did NOT GAME ANY challange at start. Well ok , newbies  are newbies , maybe some slopokes can have troubles but really u must be a terriable slopoke to have any troubles there, game starting to get BORING AT START.I dicided to make a ""skirmish game"" and made a endless with pro mode. You wont beliave but i did fell a sleep after 99+ wave - i didnt feel any challange , any options in game, that was deadly boring.All ""-"" of the game:-It have JUST 6 ""towers"" (sisnce this game is tower defence , so we call them a towers, u can call them a soldiers ofcourse , as u wish) BUT WTF just 6 towers and u cant advance them at all!!!!! All u can just lvl them up with damn 3 lvls.It is too easy.No challange , looks like u playing with cheats and  dont have even any chances to lose.(ok i lost once at first game , i didnt really understood at start WTF u should do with this game and just rolled around a camera)OMFG u can lvl up just 3 lvls up. This is really terriable. Even  falsh games can give u a full deep advancing of towers in 12-15 diffirenbt levels with unique skills and properties, and u dont need to pay money for that. OMFG here it is just 3 damn lvls. And u have to pay money for this.The conclusion.Gameplay - 2/5 - deadly boring.Difficulty - 1/5 - feel a sleep.Graffics - 1/5 - good cube idea but there is no any graffics anyway.Advance - 1/5 - God damn 3 lvls up is all u can do in game- no comments.Story - 1/5 - does it have any story? maybe i skipped it ?Idea -4/5 - well i did like the main idea of giving a new version of Tower defence style. I give a good 4 for that.So i dont really know what to rate in this game, all it was is IDEA. cube ppl attack cube ppl. Idea is good. Final product is trash.That is all what u can do in this slowpoke game."
