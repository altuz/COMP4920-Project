If online against others or alone, it is basically always you vs. the best time. There are no collisions, no agressive driving people smashing into you... just your own skill stands between you and the gold medal. ;)Highly recommended."
,Recommended,228760,12591138,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,Uchi,"Let me explain something about this game. This game has a multiplayer that is NOT for the casual gamer. It is quite competitive, and it likes to display this competitiveness all up in yo' face. You WILL see that one dude (or multiple, I mean, they're everywhere) that can finish the track in half the time it takes you to finish it. I see this every other time I go onto this game.The game has a steep learning curve that requires at least an hour or more in order to learn the basic physics of the game. After that, there are tricks that, once learned, can help you set better times in the multiplayer. (i.e. Left-CTRL braking & using a controller.) The tracks in this game play a major role in shaping your skills, as they are user-created. They can go from being pretty basic to being some of the hardest tracks you'll encounter on your time here.I know very well that time makes all the difference in the multiplayer. In fact, it MEANS the difference. Times are what determine your position in a round, and the time is calculated in thousandths of a second, making photo finishes seem like nothing. You can set a record time in a single round, only for someone to beat you by .002. It really can be that close. There IS the odd tie, but it doesn't happen that often.Now, you should go into this game knowing that you're not gonna win your first race by a long shot. Practice makes perfect. It blends in the arcade-style driving physics and fantasy environment with a competitve multiplayer that stands with some of the best. I've never been so involved in a racing game that isn't a sim. Trackmania 2 also has its own ladder system, which determines how well you do amongst other players worldwide. And we're not only talking worldwide, either. It can track official progress to as close as your own state (if you live in the US, that is). You have a number for everything, from server rankings, to single player rankings, to country rankings. The better you do, the more the number goes down, and the more accomplished you feel.I recommend this game, because it makes the $20 you'll dump on this game worth the cost. Now, do mind, this was a game that was made BEFORE the UPlay era, so it doesn't require the UPlay launcher. Instead, it has its own launcher for launching titles, although it still is in need of serious revision."

It has single-player substance, however Nadeo's continuation isn't wanted to be played alone. This is an establishment about sharing, about social event, and about dashing all through of this world circles in the wake of taking a snappy skip off an avenue lifted over a gap floor. It runs with a social occasion of force tracks, yet the certifiable delight of the redirection is picking through the get-together's appearances and ricocheting into servers to go up against others for smart times. Certainly, even so not long after dispatch, there's as of now a critical designate of substance there.On the off chance that you basically need to play alone, there are still a couple of things you can do. The included tracks have benchmarks worked in for you to go up against for changes, and if you're not a power racer the substance will set aside a long chance to open. Regardless of getting to the end of a parcel of the Black-level tracks can be a massive test, additionally fuming through at satisfactorily high speeds to get improvements. While the substance can enthusiasm to race through, the experience can feel genuinely devastate with just phantom vehicles to keep running with you. Thankfully there's a choice to stack in the soul autos of the replays of different players in case you're connected on the web, which drives a supposition rivalry moreover tip you off to better lines around the tracks.Playing on the web can be generally more fun, regardless, in light of the way that you can meanwhile fight and speak with others as you advance through the server's guide turn. Diverse techniques for play are open, however Time Attack is the one being played by far a vast parcel of those on the web. In it all players race over a length of track to post the best time. There's a general time control until the guide switches, and inside that breaking point you can restart as a significant part of the time as you need to record a middle of the road time and help your general arranging. You can see the autos of others as they race however there's no crash, which means you're set up to try the best line to the get done with paying little notice to what number of different players are pressed onto the track.Online preoccupations run an assortment of custom interfaces that show data like near to records, the present tune playing, the track name and client that made it, moreover live rankings as everybody sprints totally, which give a superior than normal layout as you speed along. The track changes for a couple of servers beginning now combine just client made tracks, which can continue running from truly standard, clear associations where the crucial test is to turn as valuably as could be allowed to more extraordinary game plans where you'll hit different speed cushions and go taking off through the air for extended time ranges.In multiplayer stimulations you're given a lot of unexpected beguilement as people around you pound into bars, miss the mark as for gigantic hops and crunch nose first into dividers, or flip end-over-end around sharp turns and off the sides of circles and slants. You'll keep running into relative pitfalls, the effect of which is showed up by the point by point hurt appearing on the autos. Replaying tracks for better times can in actuality change into a fixation in light of the way that most tracks take between 30 seconds to barely a moment to finish, so it never appears like one more lap will be a lot of a period obligation until it's four hours a short time later and you understand you neglect to eat.This is an arcade style racer, so it's unquestionably not hard to get and rapidly show signs of improvement than normal handle on how everything limits whether you're utilizing console or gamepad controls. Controls are clear, simply invigorate, brake and turn, yet there's essentialness to the managing as you comprehend how to utilize the skimming mechanics chronically major for getting a handle on tight changes without beating into a divider or losing a wealth of speed to braking. It's no essential accomplishment paying little regard to the principal controls, as keeping your auto level with the ground over the bangs, bounced and flawed turns of different tracks can be a shaky business. Without enough speed or certainly the right edge it's amazingly simple to end up moving over the gulch floor, however since such an unavoidable danger of dissatisfaction exists it's especially fulfilling when all goes right.Notwithstanding the way that each auto is in every practical sense obscure in Trackmania 2, you can skip into the auto head to re-attempt your paint occupation and create on a track. The unassuming bunch of included formats are all bolster enough, yet in the event that you require something without goliath Ubisoft logos on top of it you may need to contribute the imperativeness to make your own. You can then name and additional the auto and bring it into online rivalries so others can consider about your elegant limit or scorn both your auto's system and you're completing times.The moved track distribution director is astonishingly more strong, permitting you to shape as crazy a track as you wish with a degree of included building pieces. By burrowing through the toybox of grades, passages, S-turns and gorge pieces you can manage some truly imperative courses, an indistinct number of clients from of now have. These appearances are then shared between those in the Trackmania 2 accumulate. It makes a few additional strolls in the event that you need to pick particular tracks, yet it's a key matter of downloading records and setting them in the fitting records. You can then give them a shot yourself in a LAN beguilement, split-screen or in outrageous position modes, or disregard the entire creation point of view completely and simply welcome the get-together conveyed content interweaved into the track insurrections on your most treasured server.It absolutely doesn't hurt that Trackmania 2 looks phenomenal. The lighting impacts and appearance in your auto's reflexive surface are particularly phenomenal, and however the detail on the track pieces isn't decisively on near level, it barely matters as you zoom at high speeds through turns and over hops. To some degree more blend inside seeing the tracks would have been regarded, however the get-together is beginning now working consistently making exchange looks. What truly matters is Trackmania 2 goes on an empowering opinion speed, which adds generally more imperativeness to the experience.Nadeo's Trackmania strategy has dependably been about mixing arcade-style hustling with insane track design, and Trackmania 2 is the same. It empowers an over the top mission for the ideal dashing line however dazzling tracks. You can have a stunning time doing combating to be the speediest in a server or basically welcome the stimulate of taking off at fast crosswise over yawning split and tearing through circles. It's a redirection about social affair and sharing and Nadeo benefits a control of wrapping up the entire of the Trackmania encounter – neighborhood multiplayer, online rivalry, track and auto editors and general rankings – into one bundle. The failure felt through emphasized disappointments examining the crazy turns and touches of Trackmania's courses may put off a couple, yet without the risk of disappointment there could be no conclusion achievement. When you finally run a perfect line through a track to post a record time, every busted fender and yelp of anger is forgotten in a rush of sublime satisfaction.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

Trying to shave those 100ths of a second off can be an infuriating experience but when you nail that clean run and take half a second off it's all worthwhile.  I have had a HUGE amount of fun with the track editor too (as evidenced by my workshop submissions).Nothing beats the chaos of the first turn in a large multiplayer server either.
,Recommended,228760,25746686,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,A Glowing Thing,"This is a fun arcade racer with odd physics settings(including being unable to touch other cars. Easy to play hard to master. Most of the gameplay would come from racing on other peoples custom tracks or attempting to get times on the leaderboard in solo. The big seller behind trackmania is its map editor that has a lot of preset peices you will assemble together. The odd physics allow you to create crazy tracks, anywhere on the board for having fun or to have something challenging to beat. The game can also be very competitive with a leaderboard that can be viewed at local and international levels(You pick your location when you create your account and you will be a part of a set of regional to international leaderboards). The most fun i have is competing for the solo international records who get to have their posted to that track.What I liked:Compete Against Anyones Records- For every single track everyones best score is saved to the leaderboard along with a replay. You can select any of the records from the top players to your friends and add the vehicle to track to race against. All of the records you select will appear as ghost cars that align with your actions(reseting will reset them as well). You can use the top players ghosts to learn their strategies for the tracks and have a crap load of opposition to choose from.Solo Mode- The tracks are Divided into difficulties(represented as colours) from super easy to super difficult(and trust me when i say difficult it becomes extremely hard to even get close the the finish line). The difficulties are great for easing you into the easy driving to the crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥you will end up doing as the tracks slowly introduce harder and harder combinations of the track peices.Track/Map Editor- Very easy to use. All peices have interfaces that tell you what can connect to what. A large number of peices to choose from. The peices are now much more ""realistic"" in design and appearance/ They look much more natural. Once you start thinking outside the box in your design you will come to realize that actually connecting peices is not even necassary. Then you will start to make crazy courses.Physics/Driving- Like in the past for the trackmania series. Each of the themes use different settings of physics and cars that perform quite differently. The same applies here so your going to need to learn the unique physics. Simply driving is very simple however you will find the the courses you will end up driving suddenly the driving becomes difficult to master.Multiplayer- Generally the race types are time trails and regular racing. Time trials give you as set amount of time/laps to get a good time. You can reset yourself/return to last checkpoint at will. What the others are doing is irrelevant however you can still what they are doing. The regular racing is either a point to point format or an actual circuit. In these races you cannot reset your time. You can still return to the last checkpoint or the start, but your time is not reset. The order the playing cross the finish line is the final score. The matches will be ranked(solo tracks with hard rules and full leaderboard support)Low System Requirements/Graphics/Performance- The graphics are not really great or anything special. They are an improvement from the older track mania themes. Max graphics is laughable for a gtx1070 and when you drop them down many lower end machines can get playable performance. My laptop with a gt740 works perfectly well on descent settings. Game is well optimized as a whole as I haven't come across any issues relating to it.Perfect Balancing- Like the rest of trackmania everyones car is the exact same performance wise. You can only customize is paint scheme. If your not lagging everyone is perfectly balanced when it comes to the game itself. The gameplay consists of experience and skill.Unified Launcher- When you have multiple trackmania2 titles they are all accesible without closing the game you originally started.What I disliked:The is nothing in specific that really bothered me about this game, but just to clarify it is an arcade style game not a simulator in any way. There are no ways to modify the body or performance of the car. So if your into the serious racers this game might not interest you.Final Summary:I would recommend this game to anyone who races casually or wants a challenge. If you need to be able to change setting for the vehicle this game is not for you."

I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you referenceSteamChartsfor Canyon, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 10 and 100. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes."

Quite the opposite, Trackmania is a game of subtle, incremental improvements, perfecting the driving physics, the environments and the community.Trackmania Canyon is not perfect, but it is a perfection of everything that makes Trackmania so deliciously Trackmania, and here’s much to love for Trackmania fans such as myself; from the brand new Canyon environment which combines the best from both Stadium and TM Island, the tightly refined car physics and the overwhelming amount of community content.If you’re a Trackmania fan, Canyon will give you hours upon hours of fun, but if you’re not already a Trackmania fan, this feature is not likely to pull you over.Still, this game is highly recommended."

To me it seems like you are able to do more with the car and map combinations than the other two, such as drifting and platforming. With this being the only one of the two that you can drift the cars in, it makes going around high speed turns atually more fun than a hassle, and  you dont lose speed while doing so. The platforming is another great part to this game. If you've ever played jet car stunts for android and ios, you'll quickly learn to love the platform mode. However when it comes to editing and making your own, to me at least, it proves a creative challenge that can be fun and rewarding if you happen to publish your courses to the community. Above all really, just have fun with it. It's not really ment to be taken seriously at all, like every other vanilla racing game out there (forza, gran turismo, need for speed, etc) If you get bored of single player, definately try out the multiplayer on the custom dezined tracks as well. For lack of a good conclusion, try the demo, you'll enjoy it."

This game is remarkably different, and certainly an improvement.The graphics are much better than TrackMania United, showing off crystal-clear textures and some very nice filters and reflection effects. But for TrackMania, graphics really aren't that important. It's all about the car and the tracks.The Canyon car drives very differently from the 'traction block'-like cars of yesteryear, and really feels more like you're actually driving a car. The car throws weight into the usual precise TrackMania driving, and ensures that you have to know not only the perfect line but also how the car reacts to skidding and countersteering to get a perfect time.Tracks are insane thanks to the huge array of blocks, and making tracks has never been easier with the refined editor.If you are new to TrackMania, beware the difficulty. Everyone is driving cars that all drive exactly the same and there are no collisions between cars, so your only goal is to drive the insane tracks as perfectly as possible, which is usually much easier said than done.If you enjoyed the original TrackMania and crave an even deeper experience, Canyon will keep you entertained for a long time.

,Not Recommended,228760,30946406,Posted: 4 April,all,Snowmind,"I love the TrackMania series of games and spent many an hour on TM Nations Forever from release and after steam launch. So I decided to purchase the whole TM collection, starting with Canyon.And that's where the problems and frustration start. As the trend of negative comments show, the DRM of ManiaPlanet is terrible and far outdated. Firstly, it requires an always online connection, even when ""offline"" mode is selected! Secondly, my old account (and achievements) worked once and after that wouldn't be recognised (even after changing password). Waiting without a reply from TM support for over a week is not really professional and of course re-installing the game does not help as it now gives a ""key is in use"" error!?!All in all,TrackMania Canyonhas many positives as an arcade racer (editor) but I cannot recommend a game which uses a third party service (ManiaPlanet) with so many problems and non-existent support. I've spent 30mins in game and over 10x times that scouring the forums (fora?) trying to resolve issues with it. If Nadeo isn't bothered improving their service to support their TrackMania titles, why waste any money on them? In the end I had to request a steam refund.-----TL;DR: TrackMania Canyon is a good fun arcade racer but be prepared to experience many problems with their ""always online"" 3rd party service required. I would suggest to download the freeTrackMania Nations Foreverand give it a spin ironing out any potential problems first, before splashing out on any of the paid titles. Good luck."

The various games in this series (Canyon, Stadium, Valley*) are quite similar in structure yet still have their own gameplay.  Canyon, like all other Trackmania games, have simple, highly-responsive controls.  You do not need a steering wheel or PC controller to enjoy this!  Despite the simplicity of the controls, the feel of the game is much deeper.  Powersliding around corners and launching off of ramps seem easy at first, but you'll have to think twice about your performance when another user beats your time by 1/100th of a second.  The precision needed to beat other (human) player will make you drop your jaw --only to have it slam shut after choking on their dust.To add onto the play style game feels like it is trying to straddle hardcore precision as well as arcade (think Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010), and it does a fantastic job at this.  Despite how frustrating it might be for trying to top the leaderboards, the game also has a little bit of a comical side; it can get very amusing playing on a server with 100+ other people and seeing many of them fall behind as you cruise on through.  ...  What?  100+ on a single server?  It is easier than you think!Within all gamemodes, even circuit, there is no worry of server lag because times are handled more on every computer individually and there is no running into each other at all, everyone can play at their own pace --heck, you don't even have to run the race to have fun if you choose to go running off the track for your own adventure.  As for playing against other people, the leaderboards are the best I've ever seen.  You can see where you rank amongst other people globally, your country, and even down to your state/province/region.  Plus, there are individual rankings for single-player and multiplayer as well.Hey, guess what?  I only told you what got me hooked on this game.

I like it, I want to recommend it, but the fact of the matter is that it simply isn't worth the price. Hell, I bought it at 50% off and I still feel like it isn't worth it. The controller support is awkward, but it works. The convoluted set up is just plain silly - this is less a standalone and more a part of a greater game. The interface is far too busy. The player base is incredibly small, but there's still populated servers.My main gripe however, is that even though I'd be expected to pay £16 for this normally and it never goes on sale, the game is covered with bleeding advertisements. Ubisoft, kindly go sodomize yourselves with a spikey metal stick."

Switching from Nations to this, they've added a good deal to the physics: Drifting feels controlled, as opposed to driving on ice. Dirt feels like dirt, now, and the effects of it are apparent enough to strategically account for.The singleplayer is more varied, it seems, and serves as an excellent training ground for the new techniques presented in Canyon. But the heart of the game is in the multiplayer, which includes things I haven't seen in other Trackmanias. It feels like the map-makers of Canyon are more devoted, and more creative, in a lot of cases.If you are new to the series, then Stadium might be a more preferred starting point, but Canyon definitely feels more satisfying. Check it out."

Note that car acceleration is very high, but handling and grip is poor; you literally glide across the road like wet soap on ceramic.This was the first of the TM2 series, and its also the least polished.  Other games fully exploit the features and such that Trackmania 2 has available.Note that environments are canyons, dirt roads, and sand.  That's it.  There isn't much concrete or manmade aesthetic blocks you can use to create custom, beautiful environments.  As such, its a bit harder to create custom maps for this game.However, this game is beautiful and its fun to play.  It comes 3rd in my recommendations of the Trackmania 2 franchise."

This results in emply servers. Usually, there's only about 6 populated servers at a time. They also constantly play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music on their radio. Better play your own instead.- 5min cooldown on official races. Was this really necessary?- You get only one environment. At a price tag of $20.

The graphics are beautiful, however you probably won't have the time to appreciate them to their fullest extent while trying to dodge various obstacles or while trying to get that one corner just right. Without having to worry about your car actually colliding with the others, you can focus fully on getting yourself to that finish line as fast as possible, with the added benifit of a major decrease in lag on even the worst internet connections. However, I do have a warning, this game is not easy. If you're the kind of gamer that expects to be instantly good at a game, this game will catch you off guard. Basically, get the demo, play it for a little bit, if you like the driving physics and feel you can put some time into this game, then go ahead and buy it already. However, if you're the type of person who is easily frustrated or you think that you wouldn't really be willing to put an effort into learning the game, stay far FAR away. It's a waste of twenty bucks if you don't think you can take the time to learn it.I recommend this game due to the fact that it is the perfect arcady, pulsepounding, physics breaking racing game that we've needed for a long time."

TM Canyon is not Gran Turismo, Need for Speed or Forza. It's something different all together and it is fantastic at being what it is. Just as those games are great in their genre, this game is great in it's."

,Recommended,228760,20201568,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,SuperJesse64,"After getting the complete version of TM2 during the Steam Winter Fail 2016 (Most of the discounts weren't my cup of tea), I have one thing to say about this game compared to the only other TM game I have played, TM Sunrise.This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you  do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe)."

If u have never played a trackmania game before, you might want to read this. Trackmania players, you already have an idea what it will be like. If you have watched the trailer, it shows cars going around a loop. This is actually super hard to do, because you have to control the car as it goes around. It also switches your view to first person when you go around the loop. The single player is fun, though the multiplayer is better. Would recommend to any racing fan."

,Recommended,228760,30911927,Posted: 2 April,all,nickwarrior5,"This is not your average racing game, in face its not technically a race. What you do is keep trying to beat your previous and other people's scores within a quicker timeframe. This game is very competitive, and has tons of hard maps. Canyon is all about drifting, stadium is less drifting, and valley is the hardest. Each trackmania game has its own different feel, so try all 3 of them and see which one you like. Just know, this game has a very steep learning curve. I would recommend this game since it is fun."
,Recommended,228760,12091904,"Posted: 13 September, 2014",all,boos and nigga,"Trackmania 2 Canyon has a lot of pro's and con's and is only really just getting a thumb's up from me. This is also purely my opinion.Pros:- Good Graphics- Good Car Physics (i.e. good/fun drfiting and handling)- Variety of single player maps- Good multiplayer- I haven't tried Map Making, but I've heard from friends and reading reviews that it's good.- Leaderboards for lap times is excellent, and adds some competitiveness in both single player and multiplayer.Cons:- The only real game mode is time attack, which has no collision with other cars, and is purely just you driving and seeing the 'ghost' of other cars. This makes the game repetitive after a while. There needs to be other game modes like Race or Elimination, with collision. This would add heaps more fun and diversity, and reduce the repetitiveness.- You only get one type of car. This isn't a major problem, but having a few different looking cars just adds more diversity which is good.- As it is TrackMania 2 CANYON, theres only 1 type of environment. Yes this is expcted when buying the game, but once again, this makes the game repetitive, and for $20 you'd expect a little more.- Car customization is very basic, and is still hard to do.  And you're customized skins can't be seen (Unless they download the skin youve made manually) by other players on multiplayer, so you're basically showing off your nice skin to bots on single player.- There's no real atmosphere. Your purely just driving through a track. There's no birds flying around, or planes flying over or anything to add some atmosphere to the game. It's just your car and the track.- This isn't really a con, but, when your car falls into water, theres no splash at all. It just goes into the water and NOTHING happens, you just sink or float.So overall, you're paying $20 to drive 1 car around various tracks, doing the same game mode over and over again. Yes, this is still fun, especially with friends, but the game lacks any real change in pace, and gets repetitive after a while. Overall I would say buy it when it's on special, as it is definitely not worth $20."

The editors are easy to learn, and to make something unenjoyable, you would need to try really hard.The feeling of SPEED of this game just blows me away. It's so fast, yet I can process what's happening.  I played the first level countless times, trying to squeeze every last millesecond out of my ability. The ability to not only see the medalist but also your best time makes it easy to make corrections, as long as you are thinking ""what went wrong?""The gold medalist always makes a mistake in the official levels.Online, the community is so helpful and kind. I've only seen something like this in Kerbal Space Program, but you don't get live feedback on Reddit. Here, you just hop into a populated server and bam! someone is giving you advice after your first few rounds.To use player made skins, you need 'Planets', roughly 3 for each skin. But that doesn't mean much, since you get FIVE THOUSAND of them just for buying any game made by the same company. You can also donate them to a server's prize pool, and they will be distributed to the 3 podium finishers as follows:1st place: 20 planets2nd place: 15 planets3rd place: 10 planetsIf a player is too far above the average skill ranking of the players on that server, they do not get awards their planets. if less than 3 players finish, no planets are awarded. unawarded planets are stored for next time.I love this game, and I have no idea how I haven't found it earlier. Definitly give the demo a shot."
