,Recommended,228960,1547310,"Posted: 5 August, 2013",all,noibn,"After playing through the full (post early access) release, the verdict is in and I can confidently say that Skulls of the Shogun is a winner. This quirky turn-based strategy game seems simple at first, but there are actually some surprisingly deep levels of nuance and complexity beneath the surface. You play as a Japanese swordsman General who is trying to reclaim his stolen identity in the afterlife. The art style is very unique and really well done. The cast of characters and story are also very cool. The dialogue, in particular, is a highlight. I wasn't expecting much from that aspect of a seemingly simple strategy game, but I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and entertaining it was.So the aesthetic portions of the game are definitely good, but what of the actual gameplay, you ask? In short, it's pretty damn good. Gameplay is turn based, but on each turn you have 5 ""orders"" that can be performed. Your team is comprised of various types of units (warriors, cavalry, archers), each of which has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of moving on tiles like other strategy games, the actions in this game are more free-roaming. Units are able to move anywhere they want, within a certain radius, and are also able to continue moving after performing an action, which adds to the level of strategy involved. One of your main goals is to eat the skulls of defeated opponents, which restores health. However, if a unit is able to eat 3 skulls, they transform into a Demon, which enables them to perform 2 actions per turn, which is a huge advantage. Gameplay becomes a delicate balancing act of attacking, positioning and staying alive long enough to power up.Outside of these main elements, there are a number of other nuances (summoning monks with special powers, forming spirit walls, environmental hazards, deciding when to bring your general into battle, and more) that add many layers of complexity to the basic strategy. Every level seems to provide some new elements to learn or deal with, and this keeps the main campaign fresh from start to finish. There's no padding at all. The main campaign lasts several hours (more if you play on a higher difficulty or attempt to complete the set of special goals for each level) and is worth the price of admission alone. In addition, the game also features online, local and asynchronous multiplayer matches. So there is plenty of content here for both casual and competitive types.All in all, this game is solid and brings some really cool twists to the turn-based strategy genre. If you are into that type of thing, pick this one up. And if not, well, this could be the game that makes you a fan. Check it out."

Units are varied - samurai, cavalry, archers and four types of magic using monks - all with different strengths and weaknesses. Positioning of units is important, because they can counter attack in certain situations, and can also be knocked off ledges for an instant kill. Eating the skulls of dead enemies regains health and increases max health, while controlling rice gardens and shrines lets you summon extra units. The game is challenging, because on most levels you are outnumbered and surrounded, but at the same time well balanced, because each side can only move 5 units per turn. However, any unit that eats three skulls unlocks an extra attack per turn. The game has a wacky sense of humour, particularly with its amusing text only dialogue and animation style. The singleplayer campaign is quite long and very stable. Definitely worth checking out."

Many consider it as a spiritual successor of Advance Wars, and it is in many ways yet by being a  truly unique experience in the even rarer ''cartoony TBS'' sub genre. Don't get it wrong: despite its ( marvelous ) cartoony construct  & hilarious dialogues ( really ), Skulls of the Shogun also shines via a lenghty campaign of well drawn maps.Overall strategy and multiple tactics may seem basic, but ways to win versus enemies ( AI or multiplayer ) require the full attention of veteran players as well. It's not perfect on crowded bottlenecks when trying to command orders, some little glitch here and there, though nothing to alter an otherwise joyful turn based combat.Pros: vivid cartoony construct and turn based combat mixed pretty well; lenghty campaign and multiplayer modes; hilarious dialogues; great audio track.Cons: ordering units when crowded like sardines; some questionable unit range versus obstacle placement.Bottom line: Highly recommended.

,Recommended,228960,35457605,Posted: 3 October,all,Bass][e,"★★★★☆Solid gameplay, mostly replayable and interesting because of the well-programmed AI, but the overall experience suffers from the hedious artstyle that leaves a bad first impression.SotS is an turn-based strategy game, inspired by the perfect Advance Wars series, which are only playable on Nintendo devices. The former is not as deep and doesn't follow the 'grid rule' (like a chessboard) like the latter. You move units anywhere within a certain radius, and you are limited to five actions per turn (in contrast to AW, where you can spent a whole lot a time in one turn moving your whole army). Games like these need a good competitive AI player to fight against. 17-bit knows and shows that.The downfall is when you have trouble overseeing the battlefield. The artstyle of the units tend to blend in with other units and surroundings. I often didn't notice that I had another unit behind my archer, making me reload the last autosave. The free-movement also makes it difficult, at first, to understand why you can't move a unit between other units or objects. Even the AI seems to fidget around specificly with that. In the end, these annoyences aren't gamebreaking, but they do leave a bad first impression, which means you'll get used to them.The 'stretching animations' and the corny - sometimes fourth wall breaking - jokes aside, I can full-hearthedly say that I enjoyed the music, challenge and general length of the game. I didn't check it out myself, but apparantly the multiplayer is really fun too. I should warn completionists, though, for more than 50% of the achievements are either time-consuming or just difficult to unlock because they require you to build specifc setups/arrangements in the battlefield."

You sit patiently as you build your army until you are strong enough to crush your oponenet. This is not that kind of game. It is usually quite fast paste. This makes it great for casual gaming. You can jump on and do a quick match against the ai. Alternitvely you can play the campaign which is a bit more difficult.There are three basic units, the archer, the horseman, and the footman. The archer is arguably the best as they do the most damage and of course do it at range, however they have the lowest defence so if you get in close enough, they will die very quickly. Your most important unit is your general. If they die, you loose. There are also monks that have different abilites that you can get from capturing shirnes. A map won't always have a shrine but when it does, you can usually only find one type of monk.There are some interesting game mechanics such as eating skulls. They increase your unit's overall health and heals them by 3 hit points. If you eat 3 skulls they become a demon and can take two actions in one turn. A general can already take two actions so they are able to take three. Your units can also stand together and make a spirit wall. The enemy cannot damage a unit behind that wall or pass through it. The units in the spirit wall will recipe 0 knock back.I think it is a good game overall. I have never played the mutliplayer as that requires a new account which I think is a downside but other than that, it is great fun."

There is also online and local multiplayer which I haven't dabbled with yet. Overall, this is one of the more underrated games I've played this year.

,Recommended,228960,10338210,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,cirreal7,"Set in ancient japan the skulls of the shogun beckons the player to take hold of a shogun backstabbed by one of his subordinates during a battle aiming to seek revenge after being reincarnated in the afterlife.  The gameplay consists of a relatively simple but unique turned-based combat system where the player and the AI each take turns commanding their units in a round to either move, attack, or perform other actions until they run out of moves (5 per side).  The player wins if he/she can kill all of enemy units or the enemy general, but must protect his/her own general in the process.   Three types of basic units are available from start including infantry, cavalry, and archer where they can be utilised to work together for maximum effect in a scenario.   Multiple strategies come into play during each scenario which is unique in their own way such as preventing enemy units from counterattacking when they are being attacked, or positioning one's units properly before the end of a round to minimise the damage received during AI's turn--can be accomplished by either running out of enemy's  movement range or hide in a bush which can grant a 20% chance for an attack to miss.  The gameplay can become stale were it not for golden skulls challenges and the succinct degree of humour present in the game which, surprisingly, can be quite amusing and definitely goes a long way in making the gameplay experience more satisfying.  There are also xp for levelling up and emblems you receive at end of each scenario depending on your performance but otherwise they do not have a direct impact on your gameplay, if at all, whether you are level 1 or 10 you do not possess any distinct advantage whatsoever aside from having bestowed a different title each level.  The emblems are purely for asthetic purposes to show off your dedication or time committed to the game, notwithstanding the amount of repetitive grinding just to be able to collect all the rare/very rare emblems either through gameplay or combining them to hopefully obtain the ones you want and then upgrading all or most of them to Gold rank.There is a multiplayer component in addition to the single-player campaign as well.  However, the matchmaking lobby is usually empty majority of times and hence one would have to encompass a gross amount of patience in order to possibly find a mattch courtesy of the ability of the game to continuously search for opponents in the background whilst you wreak havoc in traditional campaign mode or casually browse through the leaderboards and emblems you have amassed.  Despite the near non-existence of an online community, I find the single-player campaign infinitely enjoyable on its own and that alone is enough to make this game remarkably innovative and is a refreshing change from the traditional, stagnant TBS mechanisms"

I dare say that this game is the evolution of chess. There are no spaces, or square counts. There is movement distantce and proximity combined with ranged attacks... If you attack with a piece, be careful to make sure you have some movement left over (the little thing white circle tells you that).The controls are clever, elegant... Not complicated or complex.The map variety is nice, though we could use bigger maps for two players to face off with massive armies like the 4v4 fujin falls map, not the 2v2 version.All in all, this game sets a very high bar, and a new standard of board games.This game gives you the biggest bang for your buck on steam without a doubt.BUY IT!!!

In fact, I think it may be the best small-scale TBS game released on PC in recent years! Core gameplay draws heavily on the (excellent) Advance Wars series, but swaps out large armies and extensive unit rosters for small-ish scale battles that carry a real sense of streamlined elegance and tactical choice, without losing the crucial magic of turn-by-turn strategic oneupmanship enjoyed by its spiritual predecessors. The gridless movement system works surprisingly well and makes the game feel fresh as a result, and teh campaign is quite meaty and enjoyable too.

The graphics are clean, and the characters are quirky and fun. At the time of writing this review I haven't completed the game yet, but I don't imagine the game getting drastically worse.If you haven't heard of/played Advanced Wars, then the best way I can think of describing the game is a turn based strategy game without leveling or grinding characters. Your starting units are preset for every mission, and it's up to you to plan out the best course of action. You can use the terrain to your advantage, and control rice fields so that you can build more units. When you kill an enemy they leave their skull behind. You can make one of your units eat it to heal+upgrade them during the mission. Once you eat 3 skulls the unit ranks up and can act twice per turn.The only downside is that the online community will probably be dead. I wouldn't purchase this game solely for multiplayer unless you have friends that you want to play with. I can't comment on how the multiplayer is, but I'd imagine it would be fun."

Many turn-based strategy games rely less on strategy and more on rock-paper-scissors like tactics in order to counter your enemy's units rather than out-thinking them. Skulls of the Shogun shakes up the genre by being rather fast paced, especially for a strategy game, and forcing you to make decisions under multiple different kinds of constraints that have to be worked around. These constraints force you to use strategy and essentially play parts of the game more as a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy, and that's mainly where Skulls of the Shogun tends to stand out.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=956546769Spooky Scary SamuraiAs I said many times before Skulls of the Shogun is a turn-based strategy game, which means that it has plenty of competition. So the question then is, what makes this Skulls of the Shogun different from all the other turn-based strategy games out on the market. The main difference is the orders system, limiting you to only being able to use 5 actions a turn. Those actions could be moving and attacking or maybe buying a new unit, regardless of what the action is though it always costs one order, represented by the scrolls at the top of your screen. I really liked how this actually influenced gameplay, it made me have to think about which unit I should be moving and actually plan my game out instead of moving first and planning later. Seeing as in almost every battle you're outnumbered significantly, you're going to be doing a lot of planning so that you can overcome odds that are certainly not in your favor. You start with a handful of units, but on pretty much every level there are shrines that you can use to buy more units with rice, the game's currency. Rice is acquired by haunting rice paddies with your units, a task that takes a turn and leaves the unit doing the haunting defenseless for said turn. The paddies are normally put in locations that tend to provoke conflict with the opposing side, so you have to strategize as to which ones you can take or hold. Rice paddies, like mineral fields in C&C or Starcraft, eventually run out so you are somewhat on a timer and will eventually reach a point where you run out.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=956547084Units Here and Units There!Now in Skulls of the Shogun you're going to be using 4 types of units: cavalry, archers, infantry, and your commanding general unit. You also have different monk shrines that can be haunted to give you special monk units with themed abilities, which massively change how you play the game. I found that the hardest part of the game was actually fully utilizing each kind of unit, but I got better at it as the game progressed. When enemies are killed, they drop skulls, which can be eaten by one of your men to give them a health buff. If 3 skulls are consumed on one specific unit, then they turn into a demon and can attack more often and hit harder. So strategy in Skulls of the Shogun is not only about the usual things like positioning and knowing when to attack, but you also have to work with both a small number of moves and units, as well as knowing when to upgrade your men. The best part about Skulls of the Shogun is that I found as the game progressed, I didn't feel like I was playing a strategy game and instead felt more as if it was closer to a puzzle game in some places. Finding the right combination of moves to successfully out-think your enemy was incredibly satisfying, and at times difficult, but in the end I always found myself looking back fondly on just about every level.TL;DRSkulls of the Shogun is a colorful and refreshing take on strategy games that switches up the monotony with faster paced combat and gameplay in places that feels almost like solving a puzzle, let down only by its lackluster story.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my Steam Curator Group atMudkips Gaming"

It's important to note that the game is not frustrating, but pleasantly challenging, a fine line that I feel many games overstep.

,Recommended,228960,10730116,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Irohnman,"A few things that I like about this gameThe movement system: Skulls of the shogun, rather than having a traditional hexagon/square tile system, allows you to freely move your units within a movement range circle that shrinks as you move.Combat: This game doesn't over complicate the combat system by having a million different rules and exceptions, the combat system is pretty basic (3 main types of units with several unique spell caster units and a general) while still leaving room for a lot of strategyOrders: Every turn you can order a maximum of 5 units, which I really like because it involves more strategy, neither you or your opponent can utilize their entire army at once, it forces the player to make smart decisionsThe story/campaign: You take the role of the recently deceased Akomoto, a general in feudal Japan, who reveling in his greatest triumph, was stabbed in the back by your former second in command and sent to the land of the dead. Your second in command, who also died shortly after killing you, and has convinced everyone that HE is the great general and taken your rightful place in the paradise of the afterworld, you quickly organize a rebellion in an effort to take back your name and get revenge on the coward who stabbed you in the back. Long story short, the story is funny and entertaining while allowing for some interesting game mechanicsEasy to pick up: This point is really important for me, the game is easy to learn (goes back to not being overly complicated) and fun to play if you don't have a ton of time. Looking at a similar game, like Civ, once you start a game it takes a long time to finish. Skulls of the Shogun has fast paced gameplay that you can get into in only a few minutes, while still being difficult enough to give you an enjoyable challenge.Overall I really like the game, and I think just completing the campaign, should last you around 20+ hours, I would highly recommend it for a pretty unique strategy game focused more on combat/tactics than other turn based strategy games that require you to build up an army first."

SotS features strategic gameplay that is complex enough for veterans of the genre to enjoy -- yet short and sweet enough for newcomers to pick up the title. As a player, you command a shogun - this unit is the strongest on the battlefield, and if you lose him, like a king in chess, you lose the match. Luckily, your shogun has troops to defend him: infantry to soak up damage, calvary for fast movement, and archers for long-ranged assault. Your shogun utilizes another unit type - one that depends on the landscape of the map - the monk. Your units will fight to capture valuable mink shrines that will then summon whichever spirit inahbits it: fox, salamander, crow, or tanuki. With these special units, the tide of the battle can be turned easily, for either player. For cartoony, playful, and stylish gameplay pick up Skulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition. 7/10 on the Stoop Scale."
