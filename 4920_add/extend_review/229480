My friend and I were both bummed to find out they'd sold the arcade cabinet for it. I came home and did a search and saw it had come out on Steam.I've played the crap out of it and can say that it is still, to this day, the best side-scrolling beat-'em-up out there."

I've yet to try online multiplayer so I can't comment there, but the single player and local co-op is fantastic.It makes me wonder why fantasy brawlers aren't more common, I'd definately pay for a modern brawler like this."
76561198018107346,Recommended,229480,15783467,"Posted: 10 May, 2015",all,Prinny,"I was a child of the arcade era. Sneak off and walk up to the mall to waste quarters on the arcade cabinets, all that jazz...And this just brought back tons of memories. All the quarters I dumped into this thing since I had no clue how D&D worked. That's the thing to remember going in.A side-scrolling brawler incorporating D&D mechanics, one would be surprised at the amount of knowledge they should have going in. If someone doesn't have a party when they're a magic user, they might wonder why they can't cast their spells against the Beholder boss. Or in Tower of Doom, they might wonder why certain monsters just won't stay down until they're burned or beaten to jelly.Even not having this knowledge however, these games are still fun. Replayability is definitely a factor, with dozens of items to collect as you go along. A radial item wheel is available to access the items or spells you collect, and even to switch equipment for classes that can do so, and while some people may claim the keyboard controls are clunky it's a minor hiccup in all honestly. Even going from WASD movement to arrow movement for this isn't the end of the world. The game isn't as pretty as one would expect from a packaged port like this. I personally haven't tinkered with options, but there are some glaring issues here and there with things that just pop out, at the least in Shadow of Mystara. The audio is just as I remember, excellent music for around the year these games came out and a reminder that before Squenix took over, Capcom was the go-to music company.Considering you're picking up two games for the price of one, the TL;DR of this is yes. Chronicles of Mystara is worth it. Graphically, you get what the age and port would expect. Audibly, the game is ear-candy. Playability-wise, exceptional. It's not perfection, but it's damn close to it for the price."

76561198025011010,Recommended,229480,8133078,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,StrangeApe,"Chronicles of Mystara is a classic arcade brawler from the 90s.  It contains two games, Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara.  They are remarkable in that they both stand up remarkably well for being nearly 20 years old.  Branching paths, level ups, weapon upgrades, shopping...  Basically these games, for their time, and even now, do a fantastic job of capturing much of the Dungeons and Dragons formula.That being said, these games run on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) rules, so if you play a character who casts spells, don't expect to be able to blast away willy-nilly.  Spells a ultra-powerful abilities that are extremely limited in their use until the party makes camp for the night, and this only happens at set story moments in the game.  You don't get to choose.All in all, it's a fantastic game."
76561198051242041,Recommended,229480,17164977,"Posted: 21 July, 2015",all,Donoknight,"Dungeons&Dragons is something that I really enjoy (am I a Dungeon Master). Even though this game is slightly old, it still has very good playablility. The game itself is set in Mystara which is a unknown/unique D&D world, or basically what is known as a Home Campaign. Anyway, enough of the basics, lets write out the pros and cons.Pros-Graphics, the graphics are actually pretty good (for the time that is). The characters and things look cool, and have many different animations.Character Development, although there is a set number of characters you can play as, as to how you use them is totally up to you. Want to have a Dwarf tank while using only ranged weapons? You can do that (albeit unnatural). Plus your characters level up the more you use them, so playing the game through with a single character is ideal here.Music/Audio, the music is really good, but the audio is really good. From the clang of weapon on shield to the hit of a spell on an enemy, it just sounds cool.Cons-Difficulty, unless you play this game a lot, then you will likely think the difficulty to be overly hard. But you must remember that this was an arcade game, where they made it hard so you would have to dish money into them. If you get good at it, it actually isn't to hard, just keep at it.Class Balancing, although each class has its own unique things, the classes overall are not balanced. The mage by far is overpowered, with so many spells available to him and so many uses for such spells, you can basically walk through almost all the levels. But the real over powered character is the Warrior. If you get good at using him, he can basically defeat anything given enough time.Menu, using a keyboard is not recommended, it is just to inefficient to try to cycle through the menus while avoiding a Displacer Beast or Beholder.Conclusion-Overall, it is still a very fun and challenging game. If you like old style arcade games and hack and slash games, then this is a must. If you like anything Dungeons&Dragons, then you may be interested in the story, much like myself. Anyway, hope this review has helped at least a little bit.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League"

You also have options for better resolutions, vsynch, and even options for playing the game from an arcade cabinet, though that makes the screen much smaller and harder to play.  It's better to play in widescreen or standard with achievement bars on the sides.Sound:All the sound is just how it was back in the day, perfectly ported to this version.  And the music is just as great as it was back then, too!  No complaints!Control:It's a bit different than using the old arcade stick, but it's quick to get use to a controller for it.  I have NOT tried keyboard/mouse and for a game like this, it is probably best that you don't.  Gamepad gives you quick access to your skills and secondary weapons and makes it easy to use them.  So yes, gamepad.Gameplay:JUST how it was.  Secondary weapons, spells, able to change weapons.  There is NOTHING missing from this game (that I can tell).  The characters even have their special attacks (attacks taht require specil move button combos)!  This is a straight port of the game that was also touched up for modern computers.  Though I do have to point out that online play is a bit of a lag fest if you play someone with a less than perfect connection.If you like old-school beatemups and D&D, this game is worth a look...

,Recommended,229480,15831509,"Posted: 14 May, 2015",all,King Vegeta,"A surprisingly good Beat-Em-Up RPG-like game where you gain levels & upgrades as you fight your way through the game with added features that make it unique compared to it's arcade original.PROS-Up to 4 player Online/Offline Co-Op-Easy Multiplayer where people can jump in/out of games easily-Several different Characters to play-Fun Classic Arcade Beat-em'up Style-2 Games in OneCONS-Repetitive Game Play-Lack of D-Input Support (Joy2Key Needed)FEATURESThe game has two games to choose from.  TOWER OF DOOM & SHADOW OF MYSTARA.  Shadow of Mystara is the game's main campaign with more game play elements & characters to play as while Tower of Doom is the 2nd campaign which is basically an older version of the 1st campaign with slightly less features.Both campaigns are very similar with the exception of graphical differences.  In SoM each character has special abilities unique to them which gives them a unique play style.  The Rogue can Double Jump & Throw Rocks with her sling, the Warrior can Block attacks with his shield & so on.  ToD doesn't have these features for each character.You can also swap your special ability for an item that you have in your inventory & is easily switched by simply pressing a button then rotating to the item you want.  It can be cumbersome to do so in the middle of a fight since you can't move/attack while doing it.  The same cycle mechanic is used in both campaigns for items.At the end of each level you fight a boss & after the boss you enter a shop menu which lets you buy health potions to heal & weapons that your character can wield. There are also branching paths in each campaign near the end of each chapter.  If you are playing a co-op match you choose by majority vote.  If the vote is 50/50 I think it's random.You also gain level ups after each mission. These feel pretty much tacked on but they do serve a purpose.  The Fighter gets a stronger sword, the Mage gets more spells, & every class gets more HP every level.  If you die you can swap characters mid play through but they start out at the lowest level so it's better to stick with the same character as you play.The Final Boss in SoM is probably one of the most hilarious things I've seen in an arcade game.  It's not how she looks but how she fights.  She's just a super killing machine meant to eat quarters & even has a giant instant kill AOE attack that you can't dodge & takes up the entire screen.  Luckily, you have infinite continues so you don't have to worry about that nonsense.The game also has ""House Rules"" which let you customize each play through with different game play elements.  These can make the game easier or much harder depending on what you choose.  This adds much more replay value as there are a lot of different settings to choose from.  You do need to unlock most of these by completing achievements, though.  There's a convenient achievement tracker while you play the game as well.OVERALLOverall the game is fun, enjoyable, has a lot of content added compared to the originals & is very well done for an arcade port.  The online co-op is simple & easy to use.  You make a room, & can either wait for people to join or start playing & have them join mid game or join another game in progress.  The Single-Player is also enjoyable but the real fun is in the co-op.I recommend buying it if you like Classic Arcade Games or just want a good gaming experience."

,Recommended,229480,23047408,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,Harley,"The pair of games in Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara collection may very well be the best of its beat-'em-up games from the '90s arcade era, and these ports from Iron Galaxy are the most robust versions of the duo of Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara to date. The 1999 Sega Saturn ports were exclusive to Japan and were unfortunately downgraded from four-player to two-player co-op, but these new HD ports are upscaled versions of the four-player arcade originals with a few modern additions, such as visual filters, unlockable rules, and concept art. Of course, the real draw is the co-op beat-'em-up experience, which has stood the test of time surprisingly well. It's a return to form for these nearly 20-year-old games; for players who remember them, and even those who don't, Chronicles is worth the time it takes to wrangle a party of warriors and suit up for battle.Coming toward the end of Capcom's stint in side-scrolling brawlers, these games are far more advanced than was typical of the genre at the time, when their contemporaries included only temporarily equippable secondary weapons and a small selection of combo attacks and special moves. Capcom took a more role-playing-game-like approach by including elements of level progression, optional equipment, and supply shops. There are branching paths and conditional events, and even the name you give your character determines certain factors of your character's skill and equipment loadout. These nuances, especially in Shadow Over Mystara, with its advanced Street Fighter-like inputs, provide plenty of depth. There are moments when fighting common enemies becomes repetitive, but it's not difficult to find new ways to play to keep the experience fresh; it's often as easy as choosing a different character and exploring their distinct moveset.You and your co-op cohorts have four character classes to choose from in Tower of Doom: fighter, elf, cleric, and dwarf. Shadow Over Mystara contains those four and adds the thief and magic-user classes to the roster. The classes differ quite noticeably in speed, power, and abilities, and though you can charge your way through the game with any selection thanks to unlimited continues, it's a far more rewarding experience to plan and build a team of complementary characters. The availability of unlimited continues is good in the sense that it lets you see everything the game has to offer, but it ultimately cheapens the thrill of victory.Typical thief. Picking up loot while everyone else does the dirty work.Both Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara were designed for co-op play, and though playing solo can be enjoyable, it pales in comparison to the fun that can be had when joining up with a team. Without expert knowledge of the nuanced controls, such as the proper timing of a riposte with the cleric, it's not uncommon to die quite frequently when fighting monsters on your own. Each class's default abilities are detailed in the main menu, but it will take considerable practice to memorize, and consistently perform, some advanced but crucial maneuvers, a task that's more easily done when someone has got your back.Health pickups are few and far between, but again, the unlimited-continues system negates their worth. Don't bother spending money on health in shops between levels (unless you're chasing a high score); you're fully revitalized the next time you continue after death. It's the nature of a direct arcade port that doesn't include a coin limit. The unlockable Elimination mode does away with the default continue system--entirely. Once it's enabled, you die the first time your HP runs out. This is good for those trying to prove their mastery, but it doesn't really resolve the hand-holding nature of the default system in a desirable fashion.And people wonder why dragons get such a bad rap.Of course, judging classic games by modern standards is tricky. Ultimately, it comes down to expectations. Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara were revered upon release, but their classic traits can be off-putting without a nostalgic perspective to give them context. Players who have graduated from the past and are looking for a more advanced experience may view this collection as a lighthearted diversion. However, for anyone who has waited the better part of two decades to play these games, their arrival on modern platforms is nothing short of awesome. Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara is a great port of two delightful games, and unsurprisingly, they're the very best versions that you can get your hands on.The GoodTwo sought after arcade games in one package.The classic gameplay holds up better than that of their contemporaries.RPG elements add necessary depth to the beat-'em-up formula.The BadUnlimited continues sully the joy of victory.Too few enemy types.7/10Good"

The different paths you take will result in different levels and bosses, leading to an ultimate battle that will test your skill.  This game had endless replayability for me when it was in arcades, and it still keeps me drawn in nearly twenty years later."

So maybe the co-op will be better.But my impressions of the game from what I saw.I like the levels and how you can choose your fate of where you go between some levels.The combat knocks a point off because though it is simple. Sometimes the evade slide or even your lunge attack(down, forward, attack) won't work, or the enemy hitbox will be out of range somehow despite your weapon going through their body, and you just get beat on.I had a boss stand still, I kept swinging, every swing missed. Then suddenly I hit him a few times and kept missing again.A boss (some kind of frost serpent) went down on the map, where I couldn't move to so I missed every attack but he could hit me fine. I like the combat on normal enemies. But when the boss fights happen it feels like the game breaks.I like the fact you can change characters any time after you die. So if you don't like a certain character you can change before respawning.Speaking of respawning, there is unlimited lives. So can make plenty of mistakes and not have to restart.If you put time into it, many people can seem to beat it fine on 1 life.I don't see me playing enough to get that good.I got this full price, but I recommend it at a sale price to be sure. Especially if you don't have friends to play it with and stuck at solo only."

Mix that with new ""House Rules"" and local/online drop-in/drop-out multiplayer for up to 4 players and you've got a game that's worth the $15 in my eyes.The combat system is pretty basic, but each of the 6 characters are indeed in-depth enough to make things interesting. Unless you're the Magic-User, combo potential is pretty good for beating down your opponents. The Magic-User can also combo, but not to the same degree of depth. Spells make up for this though, and BOY does he have a lot of them.Unsurprisingly, this game has a Level-Up system. The Score you gain from grabbing items and killing enemies are the Experience Points you gain for leveling-up, which increases your Health and makes you more powerful to some degree. I mean, it's Dungeons & Dragons, so it's kind of expected, even if it doesn't make too much sense for a Beat-Em-Up.The game is kind of unforgiving in terms of difficulty, so expect to die a lot. I got game over 30+ times during my 1st and 2nd playthrough of Shadow over Mystara. I haven't tried online play yet, but I hope to if my friends pick the game up.

The pausing of in-game action every time a player character's special power is used breaks the immersion. I understand that part might already be ingrained in the original arcade version and hence difficult for the devs to remove. If yes, I've forgotten about it and was expecting a more fluid movement. Furthermore, the story text scrolls too fast for normal people to read. The controls feel awkward especially when jumping while using a game pad. The nice colorful art work definitely brings nostalgia, but you might not like how the game appears in a Full HD screen as the stretched graphics is very pixelated. I appreciate how Iron Galaxy Studios tried to resurrect this once great game and they might have done their best to improve it. But the remaining negative aspects, consequently, made the game feel less valuable. The sale price of PhP 220 is too much for me.

The attack button is the ""pick up item"" button, and you cannot what you want to do, so when one of the thousands of goblins drops a single gold piece in front of the dark elf you're supposed to kill, you pick up the penny instead of defend yourself from the stone cold killer. The move controls are the arrow keys instead of wasd, you know, like every other pc game ever. The space bar is the pause button instead of the jump button, so when i panicked, which happened 9/10 of the time while playing this game, i would bring the game to a screeching halt instead of dodging the attack, remainding me that i could quit at any time.

It's great, need to try single player & will write back. Otherwise Co-Op is phenomenal.Additionally. you make choices in between lvls, so lvls progression will change based on interim selection.

Discover each character's abilities and level them up by yourself or with local and online co-op (finding people to play this online is a challenge, as not many people set up lobbies for this).Sound: 5 - Nostalgia-city for most arcade-goers in the 90s.  The music and sounds are spot-on and have aged fairly well.  All the yelling, grunting, and character voices are all here.Graphics: 4.5 - The grapihcs get the job done with vibrant colors and great special effects.  Still, you may get bored looking at some of the same browns and greys, but each environment differs from the other in some way, making it not so bland.Control: 4.5 - The controls are flawless, but it does require learing which keys/buttons do what commands.  Still, with a 360 controller, it's nearly a walk in the park.  Using magic, items and having to select them can be a pain, especially in the heat of battle, but it still works and remember: this is an arcade port.Overall: 4.75 - Even solo, I find myself coming back and visiting Mysteria over and over again.  Though I only have 2 hours put into this game, I've been playing it since I got it a bit at a time.  I first finished the game with the cleric, and am currently working on the elf as of this writing.For those wishing to take a trip down memory lane, it's well worth the price.  Those looking for an interesting 4-player beat-em-up and have a few local friends to play with, it's definitely worth it.  Fans of hack-n-slash games will also find some enjoyment and there are unlockable items only attainable by purchasing with in-game currency earned while playing."

If you ever played it in the arcade there were never enough quarters in the world to get you through.  Now that is no longer a problem and with full online co-op support with drop in and drop out you can play with your friends  from anywhere without having to both be sitting in front of the same screen.  Oustanding port by Capcom that does not lose anything from the original.My only complaint (and maybe I just have not figured out how to adjust this yet) is the sounds of the actual heroes in the game.  They are EXTREMELY quiet compared to the arcade cabinet.  In the arcade me and my friends would always be parroting their ridiculous quotes like the infamous ""LIGHTNING BOLT"" as the characters say whatever spell they are casting out loud.  That was a huge part of the fun of this game was the extremely silly voice acting of the characters shouting out the names of spells as they were casting them.  It is very hard to hear them over the battle sound effects that are going on as you are almost always in large fights in the game.For $14.99 its a steal- as it includes both of the full arcade games.  If you can get it on sale (I nailed it for the $7.99) it is a stupidly good deal for the play through value you will get.DO NOT buy this game for single player as it just feels extremely lonely and wrong to try and play it by yourself with a single hero.

For a beat em up you have tons of variety in spells, items, classes and different paths you can take on, adding lots of replayability. It should be noted, that some people have some crashing experiences in the main menu, but I haven't heard anyone dropping from the game yet, so all things considered, it gets a pass in my book.Multiplayer is for up to 4 players and there is 6 classes to choose from: Fighter, dwarf, elf, cleric, thief and magic user. They have some of the basic things in common, like basic combo and slide, but there is major differences in how they actually play. For example, dwarf has a lots of tankiness but is somewhat slow, while thief is weaker but can backstab, double jump and steal items.Game rewards people for teamwork, and a right team saves of a lot of continues, since every class is tailored for something: Fighter, dwarf and thief are good for killing standard mobs, while cleric has a heal and stat boosting abilities, lastly Magic user and elf are useful for killing bosses. This doesn't mean you can't solo the game with any class without dying once if you have played it enough and know it's gimmicks.At the moment of this recommendation, there is a a few players in online, so you still have a chance to play this on multiplayer even if you can't get your friends to play this. This game is made in 1993, however, it has aged well since it was made for the arcade board. Just remember to change filters and resolution from the options first.For a nitpick, I'd say it is a bit on the easy side, because you get unlimited credits by default. You can later change survival mode on, which causes everyone to have only one life, but it would've been better, if you could set the amount of credits yourself.With it's good replayability, animation and presentation, this title was a classic of it's time and before Dragon's Crown comes out, it doesn't get better than this."

Before all this here internet gaming got itself going, well, we actually had to get out of the house if we wanted to go and play with other people. Oftentimes they would be found out at the mall, as part of a bowling alley, or maybe you were lucky enough to live near something like a Showbiz Pizza (nowadays known as Chuck E. Cheese) or an Enchanted Castle. They used to have all kinds of games that never used to see a home release- shooters, driving games... but my favorite were the multiplayer beat-em-ups. The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle four-player cabinets were really fun, and who could forget that X-Men double-screen six-player game? If you could get six players going on that, it was the stuff of legends.Out of all of them, well... my favorite really wasn't any of those. This was about the time in my life where I was starting to spread my little nerd wings, and well... I spied a certain franchise on a few arcade cabinets- Dungeons and Dragons. Guess where multiple bucks worth of my tokens could be counted on to reliably end up when I went out to game? It was always a chore to choose which of the two to play- unless I just dropped twenty bucks on tokens and played through both games, one after the other with a meal break in between. Those were the days... until I moved away and couldn't play them for the longest time.Most of the arcades have closed down- but thanks to some wonderful people, well... these two games have been preserved and re-released on Steam, and to be honest, I couldn't be happier. So go grab your character sheets, dice bags and cheez doodles, today we're looking at Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara.Consisting of two games- Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara, both of these games take place in the Mystara campaign setting. The premise, well, is very simple- you're one of an adventuring party in each game, choosing between four different classes in ToD- warrior, dwarf, cleric, and elf, with Shadows adding in a thief and a magic-user. You're tasked with finding out just what the heck is going onto cause a rise in monster attacks on villages, and from there, well... no, I'm not going to spoil it! Just play them in order- finish Tower before you play Shadows and you'll get the whole story!The action of this game brings to mind someone dropping a D&D adventure and a Final Fight arcade board into a blender and hitting frappe- you'll work through a number of levels, knocking the heads of classic D&D monsters like goblins, kobolds, gnolls, owlbears and others as you battle through to find yourselves the culprits as just just what the blazes is going on- picking up massive piles of shiny treasure, powerful weapons and magical artifacts along the way, gaining experience as you bash in heads. You'll hit levels at certain points of XP, granting better health, power and special abilities. The money you collect even has a purpose- sometimes you'll hit a between-level shop and be able to refill disposable things like burning oil, hammers, daggers, arrows...Oh, did I forget to mention that? Every character gets a number of ring menus full of stuff to use instead of their regular weapon- this is most important for your caster classes, because it's how you access your spells. Just tap the ring button, tap until you have the spell you desire (Spells go by level- you get a certain number of spells per level per life, and once you burn through them all, you better hope more scrolls drop out of chests or you're going to be out of luck and down to whacking stuff. For example, Fireball and Lightning Bolt are both third-level spells), and then select it and hit the action button to let that sucker fly. Just beware that certain spells just won't work on everything- Cloudkill doesn't affect skeletons, for example.A number of stages contain various routes or selections- you will sometimes be given a choice of routes to take, or you might be up against a time limit to kill something. You could also find secret treasures. All in all, they're both really solid beat-em-ups and worth plying over and over and over...The best part of these games, however, was actually included- the multiplayer. Feel like risking your sanity with some random Steam gamers? Make a public game and wait for slots to be filled... or you could just get a bunch of your friends together and make a private game- and then invite friends directly from your Steam friends list. Easy, simple multiplayer- you can easily kill a late night with this game, and it's a blast to play because you can keep going as long as you want and then people can drop in and out. That fluid, that seamless. All the other players have to do is wait a few minutes.Downsides to these games... well... hmmm... They end? There haven't been sequels? The fantasy theme might turn some people off? Each fighter is limited to one of two looks and can't change gender?The price point is fifteen bucks retail, but it might catch sales that could knock it to half or better. Even at fifteen, though, it's a good purchase, and completely worth it.You can't go wrong with this one- just buy it, install it, and enjoy.TL;DR - This will let you slay your boredom for 14d6+10 fun damage. 9/10."

Also I should mention that this has 2 full games in it and both have a lot of replayability since you have to choose your course practically after every level.This game is worth the normal price but on sale I would say it would be an instant buy for me."

,Recommended,229480,21578407,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,Not Here for Fortune or Fame,"Chronicles of Mystara is a port of two Capcom arcade beat-'em-ups from the mid-nineties. The main gimmick is that this is not only a solid beat 'em up, but one that's set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, which means neat little features like access to a limited number of powerful spells that get recharged after a ""rest"", enemies that have mechanics like their tabletop counterparts (Undead, for instance, can't be hurt by any type of gas attack because they don't have lungs), and explorable environments with a few secret areas tucked here and there with bonus loot, and branching paths that, while not affecting the plot in any way, increase replayability in a MASSIVE way. With four to six playable classes, depending on whether you're playing Tower of Doom or Shadow over Mystara (the later of which has alternate variants of the Cleric and Magic User classes with different spells, bringing the effective total closer to 8), plenty of levels, and a rather ridiculous amount of loot to find, this is one beat 'em up with a LOT of meat on its bones. This port even comes with achievement milestones, adding even more to the pile. It's a fair amount of content for the asking price, especially on sale.Unfortunately, the playerbase is a bit small these days, so random matchmaking is a bit empty. This is definitely the type of game where buying a 4-pack to split with your friends is a solid investment."

Great 4-player beat-em-up action, and credits are earned frequently in the game. Don't worry about not being able to complete it, unlike some  other arcade ports.Note that while it says ""full controller support"" a couple of the controller options are a bit difficult to find, and the game does not play nice with any controllers I have tested except the Xbox 360 controller. (i.e. no older model Logitechs, DS3s, DS2s, etc. will work unless you use a third party tool to emulate the inputs as an Xbox 360 controller.) Not a huge issue though unless you don't have an Xbox 360 controller and want to play locally with friends."

Including added achievements and unlockable concept art!Do you like Dungeons & Dragons? Are you a fan of the Rules Cyclopedia/DnD Basic? Do you want to see Sticks to Snakes come to life!? All in a four player co-op beat-em-up!?Then boy, are you in for a treat!DnD: Chronicles of Mystara is a great package of two all time beat-em-up classics: Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara which have been regarded as one of the best Beat-em-ups ever, now with online multiplayer!Now for people who have never played the originals, i will explain the basics of these two gamesBoth Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara are really good beat-em-ups, but what makes them differ from other games of the genre like Streets of Rage or Knights of the Round is the different paths, secrets, Leveling and items like Throwing daggers or Magic ringsDuring some levels, you are given a choice. For example: In the first stage you are asked to either help a town or chase the monsters to their lair in the mountains. This gives the game a lot of replayability and makes the 1 hour completion time feel not as bad.I also mentioned secrets, which include all kinds of bonus equipment like the Ring of Damage Resistance +2 and getting all of them will not be easy as some of them are well hidden.The first game, Tower of Doom has 4 classes to play as: Fighter, Cleric, Elf and Dwarf. Each of the characters levels up as you progress through the game, granting more HP and more spells to the classes who have magic.The second game, Shadows over Mystara adds a lot of content over ToD like, two more classes: Thief and Magic-userBetter inventory, Additional combat moves, smoother controls, faster and better looking spell effects, etc.Both games boast incredibly good music, like most Capcom games back then and also the graphics look really good and detailed considering their age.If i had one complaint about these games, it would be the arcade difficulty designed to get as many quarters as possible, but thanks to the infinite quarters, anyone can play through these games.*edit also doesn't support any other controller besides Xbox 360 and PS4, but can be avoided by using x360ceThis game gets my recommendation, so get in there with friends and smack the living daylights out of everything that moves!"

Picking this up on sale for $5 is definitely preferable to the $15 I would have spent at the arcade trying to get to the end. Relative to other brawler games from the era, there is some depth to this one. That said, even with the range of character options and branching story paths, it's still a short game (I beat both campaigns in about 4 hours) with a lot of repetitive action. There are better games for $15, but if you're nostalgic for the old arcade game, it's worth picking this up on sale."

It loses a lot of the urgency to play well when you can just continue infinitely, but its fun to hack and slash through, and finally see the whole game past the first 2-3  stages.I thought it was pretty much only for nostalgic types, but the kids have got on and played through it as well and seemed to like it as a change of pace. It's not going to keep you occupied for 50 hours, but it is a fun and pretty quick playthrough. Probably not popular enough to remaster, so you've got the classic, very dated graphics."
