Forum are filled with bug reports since the day it came out. Some people can't run the game at all, achievements are not unlockable for a lot of users, graphics / sound is broken ... nearly everything you can think of. Having bugs is inevitable but the lack of communication / support only shows that the developer cares more about creating a sequel (money) than fixing bugs (quality).It heavily feels like this game is designed for a touch screen and that the PC port was done in a hurry as far as controls are concerned.If I overlook all the bugs and only focus on the game I would simply say this:  it`s extremely repetitive as you only do one fight after another, no ""world"" / ""story"" to discover, nothing. It's a mindless loop of fights from start to finish.Buying it is like rolling dice, it might runs on your system if your lucky enough."

,Not Recommended,229520,10933847,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Dungeon Hearts is a match-3/RPG crossover that fails under its own ambitions of trying to recreate the wheel. It's bursting at the seams with original mechanics and a fresh take on match-3 games, but seemingly forgot to test if any of the ideas it presents actually add anything to the experience or makes for a game that's worth playing. It continually tries too hard to insert itself as something unique in a broad spectrum of derivative peers, that it forgets that the reason those games bare such a resemblance to each other is because the formula works, leaving it standing awkwardly on the sidelines like an odd kid who has been ostracized at his own party.Broken down into its simplest elements, Dungeon Hearts plays like a combination of Collapse and Guitar Hero. Colored gems come horizontally across the screen toward your characters, and you must combine three like colored gems to form a power gem that allows you to clear away skulls which hurt your character if they make it all the way across. This basic system is continually and rapidly expanded as you play, with unique levels for your four characters, blocks that can't be moved, skulls that take multiple hits to clear away, and so on and so forth. It all combines to make for a game that starts out simply enough but quickly becomes entirely and utterly overwhelming. There begins to be so much constantly happening on screen, that it's nigh impossible to begin to keep up.I kept hoping that maybe if I just played another round or two Dungeon Hearts would finally click for me, but the longer I stuck with it the more annoyed I became at its cumbersome controls and incessant need to constantly throw more at you than you can handle. There are undoubtedly some really neat ideas hidden in Dungeon Hearts that could potentially be spun out into a better game, but what Cube Roots has done with them feels more like they threw everything at the wall hoping something would stick, than careful and deliberate design. And even then it almost works, which makes the colossal waste of a game that it turned out to be all the more disappointing."

Shapes scroll from right to left on screen and you need to move them around to make a match of 3 to form a jewel which you use to attack the monsters. After killing each boss you hav a match 3 of each color to level up the character of that color. I certain levels characters will unlock a power you can build up for to use.I felt like this game would be a lot better suited on a phone or tablet. I got annoyed and frustrated trying to move shapes sometimes while they scrolled by. I would click on them but just barely miss I guess and not pick the shape up to move it. This happened quite often and would screw up trying to match them.Not a game I would recommend to my friends.

At first I thought it would be a good game for my mom to play, since she's taken a recent interest in casual gaming, but I wanted to test it out first. It's actually a decent challenge, it took me a few tries to get to the final boss and even then I couldn't beat it (each time you fail you have to start over from the first level). It's not the greatest puzzle game and it definitely has some problems, for example you have to get through the game and fail in order to gain XP for the permanent upgrades, but even getting to the boss doesn't get you enough for the most basic ones. I think my biggest gripe is that the save and quit feature only works until you close the game out, since there's no actual save feature. But, for 50 cents it's given me a good enough value to recommend it."

I see now that there is   a version for touch devices and I think that's where it belongs.  I say this because a majority of the gameplay involves moving different colored blocks around a DDR/Guitar Hero-esque track.  You only have a limited time to make matchs (before they hit the end) and it gets very hectic very quickly.  Mouse controls just don't work very well for this, and I think a touch device would work better.Anyway, the gameplay is cool and the ideas are unique enough that although they don't really work that well in practice, I recommend checking out Dungeon Hearts just to see this gameplay.  I really want to get good at it but it's god damned hard, and I think the difficulty comes largely from the limited means by which we can play it.Oh, the basic idea is to order colors together before they reach the end.  You want to stop enemy attacks from getting off while building up your own combos via hitting multiples of s color.  By hitting your colors you do damage to an enemy.  Your team's skills aren't the best explained in game, so that's annoying, but yeah."

What i want is to meet the developers and watch them play it in front of me so I can see what kind of freakish experts they are.  It is entertaining and useful when you have exactly 10 minutes to waste on a game and it's colorful and innovative which are all things that I like.

If I wanted to treat this game punitively, I'd say it takes the standard Final Fantasy team line-up (warrior, black mage, white mage, archer) and they've thrown in a puzzle game). I can't be that punitive. This game has complexity, and depth you'd struggle to find in some of puzzle games you'd immediately think of.You have four lines across the screen, gems will slide towards you, if they reach the end, they disappear. If you move 3 of the same colour in any pattern except diagonally, you can make an attack gem. Which, when clicked, will attack the enemy you are fighting. The enemy has their own gems too, if you can't move them quick enough, or can't use your attacks to remove them from the bar, they will attack your characters and drain their health.And I'm only getting starting. Characters level up between runs, learn abilities, monsters, mini-bosses, runes that make the game move faster, or randomly freeze different runes, or make you take more damage.Oh, one thing I didn't mention. This game is tough. It starts deceptively simple, but it works through it's mechanics like Neil DeGrasse Tyson blows your mind.It has different modes of play, an easy to grasp tutorial level, and a very FF-esque art style (think DS remake FF games).The only thing I can even think to ping this game for, is the soundtrack is incredbily repetitive. You might do better to listen to your own tracks and turn the music off entirely.The best part? This game costs under a dollar. Seriously, less than a small fries from McDonalds. If you've been looking for a rich, deep, and challenging puzzle game. I implore you, pick this up. You will have an absolute blast."

Which is probably why I got half of the achievements so quickly within the first hour of playing the game, hehe.Now, where to begin... This game is no ordinary RPG, it's really a mix of somewhat-RPG mechanics and a constant score attack. Even during the leveling portions you're required to be matching tokens all the time, and the best advice is to stay on top of everything. Like any match-3 game, match 3 regular tokens of the same color to create an attack token that when tapped, will do an attack with that hero. The player can store these tokens by sliding them along the constant stream of tokens that fly past, and you can accumulate them to do huge combos. These attack tokens are more for just attacking however, as they also remove any gray tokens and regular tokens of their color in their current column and row thereby eliminating the chances of the enemy being able to attack the player's heroes. Enemy tokens can even be moved as well, allowing the player to set up combos while removing the enemy's method of attack.While the levels start off easy and slow, the game picks up in pace and sets more roadblocks as the game progresses through status aliments and enemy tokens that require multiple hits to get rid of. Enemies also do increasing damage, and hits become nearly fatal in the last 5 levels. The enemy variety is based on random elements, and each has their own set of hexes and even altering the speed of how fast the tokens come at the player.The graphics and music fit the game very well, and the soundtracks are amazing that I'm sometimes coming back to the game just to hear the music. Its streamlined well, and makes progression eminent throughout the levels.My only qualm about this game is how the mouse/finger can be inaccurate in moving tokens due to how the Fatestream is continously moving, but then the game wouldn't be hard if it wasn't that way. Definitely a recommend."
,Recommended,229520,9270343,"Posted: 26 February, 2014",all,skovacs1,"A swiping/tapping match-3 game where matches equate to attacks in classic RPG battles. The concept of having a party of characters with interesting special abilities makes this match-3 game far more interesting than others of its kind and the levelling mechanic also being a match-3 is a clever touch. The music choices and unlockables are also pleasant. Easy is exactly that. Normal is reasonable, but challenging. Hard is ludicrous. All in all, it is a briefly fun experience, but is clearly designed for the mobile systems from which it was ported.Using a mouse to swipe and tap is awkward at times and much more challenging than it would be with a touch-screen. To truly succeed on the hard difficulty and win the last achievement is an extremely hard task. You can improve your odds by purchasing upgrades which were likely micro-transactable in the mobile version because the cost to get those upgrades versus the effort required to earn that currency is very unbalanced, leading to a long grindy haul only to slightly improve meager chances at an exceedingly difficult trial - the game would have benefitted greatly from rebalancing the cost gain ratios to make it a bit more reasonable for this version. Like many such arcade-style games, chances of success are highly based on random number generation as a few badly placed pieces or of the wrong color in a few places is all that it would take to completely ruin your attempts in fairly short order."

What may appear like a rhythm rpg is actualky a match three puzzle, which feels almost like something entirely different. As you start playing and pass some easy levels you will begin seeing different shapes, new types of blocks, and ability blocks. All of this is happening with the playfield moving to the right quicker and quicker. Gameplay becomes even more fun because of the shorter time available to move your blocks, and having to decide which blocks to match. Based on that last decision you may perform any of the number special powers each of your character has. As can be seen in screenshots, each character has 3 powers fo ra total of 12 when you have all 4. Basically the premise and the gameplay are excellent.In regards to graphics and art direction, Dungeon Hearts does not impress too much. Character models are 3d cartoonish characters with large heads. They are not very impressive. Their animations are very basic and sometimes repetitive. It could be annoying or irritating. The models of enemies and their animations are much more interesting. I am not sure how many there are, but they are pretty well designed, diverse, and since they circulate and you see new ones a lot, it maintains interest. Backgrounds are great. Pretty good on the eyes, but they don't mean much contextually.there areBut all of that depends on importance you give to those things. Different for everybody.Sound is alright, and I do not have much to comment about it. Maybe one area that deserves commenting is the music. It doesn't play a big role in the game, and you do not hear a bunch of unique soundtracks. It may give that impression perhaps because the playing field looks like the screen of a sideways Guitar Hero screen. It is just techno action, somewhat generic tracks.I recommend the game if you want a very cool battle match three game, which involves rpg elements and to a lesser degree strategy. If you want to be impressed by music and fancy graphics, this game appears to never have aimed to impress us with those features."

Although it doesn't seem to have any major flaws, it's just no fun. I like my puzzle games a bit more relaxed. You're just end up dragging spheres and diamonds around almost aimlessly. THAT'S BASICALLY ALL YOU'LL EVER DO, OVER AND OVER. And sometimes there's a lot going on on the board and you can't move things around properly. Also, dragging things around is not as smooth a task as it should be.Some other things that bugged me:- You're always in such a hurry that it's easy to forget you have skills to use.- Each battle takes way too much time.- You should be able to keep better track of the enemy's HP.- I didn't get the achievement for reaching stage 7, although I got the one for stage 15.I didn't like the game.

For $3, I definitely can't complain, and anyone with decent hand-eye coordination and a durable trigger finger probably won't either, since the game does require both of these, especially on the higher difficulties and further in to the story mode.There are only two things I can possibly make a negative remark about. The ""XP rewards,"" which one uses to buy rudimentary upgrades for each of the 4 individual characters, are very stingy (there are tens of upgrades in the shop, and they all cost between 20-110 XP, while a full story-mode completion, which takes usually around 50 minutes, only gives you 11, 22, or 33 xp on average when finishing on easy, medium, or hard difficulty, respectively). There is also the fact that if you do the entire story without a break (saving and resuming later is possible, however), you'll probably feel like you have carpal tunnel in whichever hand you hold the mouse in for several minutes afterwards, as playing the game does require many precise clicks and rapid mouse movements.However, neither of the negatives impact the actual gameplay, which is fun, intense, and both simple and complex at the same time. Not to mention the game comes with up to five soundtracks, which are all absolutely amazing and go perfectly with the theme of the game. I personally can already tell that I'm going to get more hours of entertainment out of this than some of the games I've spent $10-20 on simply because of my love for intensive and strategic puzzle games, and anyone else with similar interests in gaming genres will probably be able to say the same. $3 well spent!"

It's gameplay style is simple, but can quickly turn from being easy to making very quick thinking. You need to match up 3 of the same color circles in order to create a diamond to attack. It gives you something to think about, and strategize as you go further in.The graphics have a nice style to it, but nothing outstanding. One of my favorite parts about this game is the music, ranging from 5 different soundtracks entirely. (Pop, Jazz, Metal, ect)Now the gameplay. These color ruins represent each character, and the grey ruins represents the enemy's attack, or debuff abilities. They travel from the right side of the screen to the left side of the screen. If the color ruins hit the end of left side, any of your ruins will dissappear as well as grey ruins. If an enemy's diamond ruin, or debuff ruin, hits the left end, then it takes effect on which ever character it was heading for.I can go on forever on the gameplay, but it's somewhat simple. I do have a few problems with the game. The difficulty can spike, even on Normal mode. I got half way through the game before I couldn't do anything. It felt like the enemies would take more than 10-15 minutes to defeat if you don't stack the damage. Another thing is that the enemy's don't have a clear health bar. The only way you can tell that an enemy is near defeat is when their ruins begin to crack which can be somewhat annoying. One last thing is the level up system. It is a minor nickpick, but I don't consider it all that bad. You must match 3 color star ruins in order to level up. Fail to do so will result in low level characters, and some challenging enemies.Overall I think this game is fantastic with amazing music, and quick thinking puzzling, RPG, gameplay. It's just very nice to play this game and it puts me in a relaxed mood in the beginning to becoming intense in the later part of the game. I give it an 8/10."

Its fast pace and constant introduction to new boons/curses keep you on your toes, and you'll get probably a few hours of entertainment. The RPG system is interesting, as you need to ""level"" your heroes at the end of each battle with another puzzle sequence before you advance, but the appeal does kind of get jaded afterwards. Take it with what you will, though. If you truly love puzzle games, try it. If not, it's probably best you don't touch it"

Or do you take the hits and build up an attack that will kill that enemy dead in one hit?

A few things could have saved it and made it playable, but having only four lines, long distances to move the scattered bobbles to make matches, and a somewhat jerky execution both of player input and the scrolling made this game a waste of the bandwidth it took to download it as well as the time spent trying to play it."

Dungeons hearts adds some enjoyable elements to make this millionth iteration of match 3 games a bit more fun.  There are blocks that are sent by the enemy to slow you down.  Your goal is to crush the enemy while stopping his attacks.  As you progress through the game you get certain skills that fall outside simple block movements that can get you out of a pickle.  You also gain experience which gives your characters different abilities.  This gives the player a chance to feel like they can actually beat the game even if their skills aren't up to snuff to make it to the last boss.  There is an incentive to keep playing and boost your skills so that those final levels don't seem to tough.  If you are into puzzle games and don't mind staring at moving blocks all day, you will probably enjoy this game.  If you are sick of the million different iterations of puzzle games, I would probably pick up something else.Follow us onhttps://www.google.com/+Brick-mediato see more reviews, walkthroughs etc."

In later battles you will devote youself all into finding gems of the same colour on the super-fast scrolling board, desperately trying to prevent the enemy from attacking, and it takes an eternity to take down the foe. You don't even have time to use your skills, which are quite limited and also take quite a long time to obtain by doing (even more) meaningless 3-match actions. In addition, the control with mouse does not always respond promptly.In summary, I would not recommend this game even if it's discounted."
