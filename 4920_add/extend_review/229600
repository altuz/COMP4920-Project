Bientôt l'été isn't a game. It's an artistic piece, and this needs to be understood. From what I could gather, the goal of it was to demonstrate how people can communicate, even if limited by language, actions, or possible phrases (as seen by the chess board in-game). However, this requires that someone somewhere is playing at the same time you are, unless you want to talk to an AI. It's a beautiful experience when it works well, but this is so rare I can't recommend a purchase at any time other than during a sale. Due to the game's artistic goal and nature, it was heavily slammed upon release, driving away potential players. Without a community waiting for another person to chat with, more people slammed the game for not having a community. This is Bientôt l'été's biggest problem, without players it simply cannot achieve the desired effect.For this reason I suggest buying this when it's on sale. More players are likely to be experimenting with it at the same time as you, and you're more likely to see the beauty of limited conversation with a complete stranger."
,Not Recommended,229600,7921227,"Posted: 4 December, 2013",all,TheBreakfast,"Game developers should be encouraged to challenge the status quo with narrative and mechanics, but I feel that there are certain best practices for game design that Tale of Tales often overlooks for no visible reason or benefit to the game. While Bientôt l'été has the most conventional controls and straightforward instructions of their games to date, it still suffers from the same problem: some strange design decisions have little to nothing to do with the concept, and may even hinder it.Imagine the PS3 game Journey: two players meet at random in a surreal world to make a connection. Except in Bientôt l'été, both players are chat robots stating phrases at random while smoking cigarettes, drinking wine, and playing chess (with a catch: you have to find the pieces first, but one at a time). The highlight of the game should be the multiplayer, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be very populated (a symptom of its avant garde concept, I guess), and the interactions are severely limited.What should be a virtual date with a stranger in a surreal world becomes tedius, with no real interaction or connection with said stranger. Unlike Journey, which limits your characters' intractability to serve the purpose of the mechanics and design, Bientôt l'été's design stands at odds with its concept, preventing players from creating any kind of meaningful connections."

I typically really enjoy introspective forlorn romps through artsy settings, but this is a bit of a streatch even for me.Spoilers follow:No seriously, there's nothing to this game, so litterally anything I say past this point will ""ruin"" it for you.Don't read further unless you've either already played it our have no intention to.So the idea is that you go for long walks on the beach reflecting on this relationship you've had. Sometimes there's something on the beach that will drop a chess peice which you can take to the house and use on a chess board to hold something resembling a conversation with an online partner... The dialouge seems to suggest that these two love each other out of necessity and not for any actual romantic reasons... they don't seem to actually like each other but are bound to eachother anyway. It's really sad...These two need to see other people, but it's clear that there are no other fish in the sea, so to speak.Oh, and once you've collected all the chess peices, the next item to drop is a gun... well that escalated quickly. You can use the gun on the chess board like a peice. It does nothing in particular, but I think it's more meant to be a metaphore for putting an end to the relationship more than anything.To sum up the game: Help I'm trapped in a holodeck of angst and regret! I don't know what love is and I want to kill myself because I'm so messed up about it!"
,Recommended,229600,1872459,"Posted: 12 February, 2013",all,PyroXPyro,"This is, by far, the best cigarette smoking simulator on the market. At first, it seemed confusing with the long walks on the beach and random phrases popping up on screen, but only once I entered the café did I realize the actual draw of this title. As I sat at the chess board and waited five minutes for a partner to join, I then realized something else; I was the only person to buy this game. Thank god they included a computer controlled character to interact with or I may have missed the hidden gem in this pile of coal.We moved our chess pieces across the board and spoke sweet nothings to each other until only silence hung in the air. And then I saw it. Near the bottom of the screen was a classic lighter and a half full soft pack of smokes. Move over wine glass! The true beauty and meaning of game play was at hand. Once clicked, the screen goes black and you can actually hear your character click the flint, light up, and take a long, smooth drag. You can almost taste the tobacco. A puff of smoke fills the screen upon return to the scene. The cigarette is then seen majestically smoldering in the ashtray on the table. If clicked again, another drag is taken until there is nothing but a snuffed out filter left.Oh, but that's just the beginning. It seems there is no limit to the amount of cigarettes you can smoke! My only complaint would be that there aren't enough ways to put out your coffin nail. The choice to put it out on your lover's hand or leave it floating in their wine glass should be included in a future patch for the sole reason that some of the predestined lines are mad creepy. 8 out of 10 because I can't tell if they're menthol or not."
,Not Recommended,229600,4205600,"Posted: 24 March, 2013",all,Maghook,"I really enjoyed Dear Esther. I also enjoy Tale of Tales other games, like The Path. I simply do not understand nor enjoy this game at all. I went into it with low expectations and an open mind, I left questioning exactly what should be considered ""art"" in gaming.Bientôt l'été is the most pretentious of pretentious indie art games. One that is ""too deep for you"" to even understand whatever trivial message it's trying to put across. Let me just say right now that when a developer needs to address their entire userbase in a forum post, revealing what their inspiration for the game was in order for you to understand its purpose, then the developer has completely failed to convey any sort of rational thought with their game. Still, no one slightly understands the purpose of Bientôt l'été and those who do are obviously elitist intellectuals whose thoughts and opinions on the matter are also ""too deep for you"" to understand yet again. It's hard not to call Poe's Law into play.This game has a mechanical crutch which becomes limited by its users. The main attraction of Bientôt l'été is being able to connect with other players in a cafe of sorts, decked out with a chess board, a glass of wine, cigarettes, and the ability to communicate intricately with one another. Except this all falls apart when you realise you're the sole person in existence to be playing this game at this point in time, forcing you to instead substitute a human presence with artificial intelligence. This severely impacts the game as a whole.I never found a partner to play with so I had to resort to A.I., and after collecting all of the chess pieces I managed to find a gun... although my character holds it backwards. Does this gun do anything more than intimidate the opposing player? If not, then there is no point to this game since there aren't enough people playing this game at any one time; you can't really surprise artificial intelligence.The entire process of Bientôt l'été took me little over 80 minutes to achieve. After collecting the gun and positioning all the chess pieces in their correct order, hoping for something to ""unlock"" or tell me I've done something right, only to find out nothing much happens. I decided to go back out and collect more items, coming to a stinging realisation that the cycle has restarted and I'm collecting the very first chess pieces again.This game is insulting."

But that's the exact reason this game is practically unplayable. I gave it a little while, hoping to get somewhere, but instead I just sat there and played chess while rereading the same dialogue over and over. I don't know whether this game gets more interesting or enjoyable later on, but from what I have played, I can tell you that I'm glad I bought this during last year's Summer Sale, because for $9.99, Bientôt l'été shouldn't be payed for until it goes on sale... between 80-100% off."
,Recommended,229600,9867492,"Posted: 18 April, 2014",all,Bahuemac,"Short:+ Relaxing ""walking simulator""+ Eerie, dreamy, surreal, transcendental design, music and ambiance+ Bold multiplayer concept: People are strangers, no direct means of communication- Lack of any significant, forward-driven narration/story/plot- Lack of any significant, long-term gameplay- Odd/Awkward, not exactly comforting (keyboard) controls- Multiplayer barely works for the lack of people playing this game (workaround: joining Steam group and timing online time with other people)Long:Interesting from an art-ish and ambiance-related point of view, lacking gameplay-wise, and with an irritating control scheme.Badmouths may call it a boring walking simulator. It provides less exploration and narration than for example Dear Esther, but a bit more than for example Proteus, and has it's own unique graphical style and ambiance. The graphics, sounds and music give you an eerie feeling, it's dream-like, surreal and transcendental, and for this alone it's interesting to look at and listen to, eventually even admirable.You select a male or female character stored inside tubes. ""It's nearly summer"" you are told. You appear with your character on a simulated/virtual beach shore and walk it. Random phrases will appear drawn onto the ground. You ""collect"" (""remember) some of them by closing your eyes, you also hear them voiced  in French then (they are always subtitled in the language of your choice). You collect some object ""hidden"" beneath some worldly, ""holographic"" thing (a tree, a bush, a crane, ...) that disappears to reveal this object (chess pieces mostly, and one more unique and confusing one which leaves room for interpretation). You enter a house, meet with a virtual partner of the opposite gender in some sort of bar, put your objects in turns on a chessboard (freely, you don't actually play chess - some spots trigger the words/phrases you previously collected to appear on the screen and be voiced), take a smoke, drink some whine or select some pre-set of music tracks to play music-box like in the background. The lines you collect and make appear are circling around the two characters and their relationship, who are or used to be lovers  After that you leave the house, walk along the shore again, collect more phrases and another object and enter the house again. This you repeat as many times as you wish, at some point the simulation starts over again with you collecting about the same pieces again (the game however seems to remember all pieces you once collected - I've just started up the game again and could place all the objects I once picked up many months back when I first played this game).The partner in the house is either A.I.-controlled or an actual human who is playing the game at the same time as you do. You don't see his/her name, he/she is a stranger, there is no text or voice chat to use, you only communicate with the words and through symbolism you can do with the chessboard and the objects, and the only indication whether there is someone else playing/waiting in the house is - from what I've been told and noticed - a window you see from the outside that has lights on. I haven't been able to meet up with a real human yet, because either the mechanics to match you up with one are not working too well or this game was never played by too many people to begin with. There is a Steam group one can join, and sometimes people try to group up through it. However this is a bit of a misleading way of playing this game, since it was obviously intended to meet strangers, an idea Tale of Tales originally came up with in ""The Endless Forest"", but which isn't executed too well in this game. A game that did this better was the PSN game ""Journey"". But I guess one must probably consider that ""Journey"" was a larger success than any of Tale of Tales' games ever were - the more players play these games the higher/better the chances to meet up with them. At some point no one will play these anymore, I guess, not even ""Journey"".The control scheme isn't entirely bad but not exactly too enjoyable. This is a problem I keep seeing in the games made by Tale of Tales. You look around by moving the mouse to either side of the screen, you walk by holding down the left mouse button, you close your eyes with the right mouse button and run with spacebar. It feels odd/awkward and not very comforting. They could adapt to the more classic control schemes that games with a first- and third-person view give you, the usual WASD and mouse-look thing. I don't see any good reason in doing things differently there. Has it to do with being different for the sake of being different? Or are they inept and don't play their own games? I don't know, and I don't like being harsher to them than they deserve. You can play with a gamepad too, maybe I should try that and will feel better then."

At every turn I found myself subjected to a dialog that was profoundly disturbing, of which if I am to understand Lacanian psychoanalysis properly, came to enjoy as a manner and extension of the game.After this realization I came to wonder, and eventually resolved, why it was that I found this game so unmatched in its presentation -- it is what constitutes the substance ontology of a cosmopolitan bourgeoisie.On an ephemeral beach they engage in this digital discourse, aimlessly embodying the transcendental human experience, exclaiming to themselves ""This is what interaction amounts to; a game theory of chess and the parries of regular 21st century parlance and nomenclature."" Smug and content the player makes a category error in assuming that this is ""beyond"" or too ""meta"" for the proletarian mind.From here we see that indeed, this game is the ontological groundwork of a cosmopolitan bourgeois character."

The developers forgot they should SHOW, not TELL. The controls are easy, the characters move in an awkward way, the music is good, and your dialogue is restricted to the pieces you collect. The only reason I recommend this game is because of the dialogue. I never thought that it would hurt so much to listen to a sudden ""I don't love you anymore"" inside a game. Ouch.Buy this game only if it's above 75% off. You'll have a fascinating DTR that lasts just 30 min or so."
,Not Recommended,229600,2006422,"Posted: 14 March, 2013",all,Zuro,"First off, this is as much of a game as you'd call something like Dear Esther a game.The ""gameplay"" consists of walking along a beach and finding out of place objects like a pile of coal or a field of wheat placed on the beach. After finding each of these objects, you get a chess piece to use in the cafe that's present across from the water.When you enter the cafe, you sit down at a chessboard and wait for someone to connect (or use their extremely awkward in-game partner connect to actually play with a friend). After waiting at least 10 minutes to connect to an actual player, the view changes to a top-down of the chessboard and you both take turns placing your own chess pieces on the board. Some spaces make your character say a line of conversation (which can be found by walking across the beach).Icy and I played this for an hour and a half and we could not discover any sort of progression. After you collect all your chess pieces you come across some sort of pistol. This pistol can also be placed on the chessboard, but does nothing else once on it.The story seems to be a very weak and very cliche talk of romance between artists gone sour. I'm sure the developers have an idea of what it /actually/ means and expect some users to gain a lot from the shallow symbolism, but in all honesty this would have been better as a 15 minute independant film.I would recommend against buying this. It doesn't belong on Steam."

If your the type of gamer that can get lost in a pretty space, or for that matter even played second life, and have the money to spend, i'd say go for it. it's purely art and not a game and with that being said, you'd pay 10 bucks on a painting right? why not this?"

In this game you walk around a strange, silent world and can interact with objects to gain chess pieces.  You can then use the chess pieces to have a virtual conversation with a stranger.  The more chess pieces you have the more options you have as far as things to say.  The interesting thing is that you each play the role of lovers and so the conversation has a strange intimacy even though the participants themselves are strangers. The possibility is that you might share a moment of connection with a stranger over these bits and pieces of dialogue and action.  However, I have played this game three or four times and have never been paired with a living person.  The other choice is to participate in the conversation with a simulation.  And in this case, interaction with a simulation is hollow and completely misses the point because there is no chance for that spark of human connection."

Because that's what this game is, a fanciful and supposedly symbolic experience in which you will reflect on whatever you can imagine to be the depth of the 'piece'.Secondly, are you seeking an actually meaningful or deep experience that doesn't require DIY symbolism, perhaps with a strong but non-violent narrative? If you are, then turn away immediately, the game simply isnt worth your time.And thirdly, do you mind performing repetitive actions with very little benefit? If you do, then perhaps you should try something else, like the Stanley Parable or something.My personal opinion of the game is that if I have paid good currency on a piece of content, then there should actually be content and that content should be legible and self constructing. I should not receive a random set of letters and have to conjure up some sentence. The sentence should come at least partially pre-made to give the thought some sort of legitimacy. If I have to make it up without any kind of confidence that that is what the media was saying, then the thought won't only be short lived, it'll probably be too weak to have any kind of effect when it is in my mind. Deus Ex Human Revolution creates a moral dilemma out of a slowly constructed jigsaw that you see pieced together before you, the Stanley Parable hints at the deeper meanings of it's gags but only so much as to force you to complete the meaning yourself. Both games have made me seriously think about the messages they were pushing. This did nothing."

В Российской действительности это говорит о том что в игре игрок будет о-о-о-о-о-очень одинок. Во вторых игра состоит из бесцельных блужданий по берегу моря, иногда разбавленная неким интерактивом ввиде текста или сбором шахматных фигурок. В игре ничего нет, графика очень минималистична с наложением кучи фильтров и размытий. Проект однозначно не для России, и будет очень плохо продаваться у нас. Если покупаете, то помните, покупаете на свой страх и риск. Я лично не рекомендую. И отговариваю вас от этого."

I'm trying to dress myself up as I feel like exactly the type of person for whom this game would be created. And yet here I am, absent of any feelings for this game that aren't expletives.I suppose if you enjoy wandering around trapped in negative space, desperately hoping that there will be some semblance of experience to be found, this might be for you.Team Fortress 2 makes a thousand more powerful statements than this lazy half-made excuse of a game.

You can use those chess board pieces to play online with a random opponent (which may take time to find) or a robot wich is still equally fun. Usually the human takes their pieces and flails them around the board and ruins the entire experience.Put on your headphones to get the most out of this ""game"" it trult changes the experience.I reccomend this game because it is a stress reliever.
