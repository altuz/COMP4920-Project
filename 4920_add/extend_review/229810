What he did not expect, however, is that an old shaman is living there, raising shootists from the dead to fight their way through the Wild West, killing the enemies they encounter and stop Boon in three acts of pure action!!!the fun and the replayability with friends in this game is enormous!!!i  strongly recommend it when it is on discount8/10"

Farmer Gnome genuinely impressed me with this title.Each charachter offers a unique twist on gameplay with their own arsenal of firepower at their disposal which not only offers a offers you a level of replayability within the single player campaign, but also extends that replayability to arcade / multiplayer. In the hours i've played, no one game has ever been the same, or for that matter, predictable, it's a challenge every time which is something i look for in a game, aside from genuine fun i like titles that offer the player a challenge.This is personal opinion, but i feel the game is as good as hotline miami, slightly different art styles and even different style of game sure, but at their core, they are as good as each other but hotline miami is more predictable.I like twin stick shooters and this one hits the mark for me. Good game."

Took me a while to adjust to the pace and sometimes a screen would be over before I'd even processed visually what was on it to begin with. Then I learnt to slow it down by getting in cover and shooting them in the back..In a nutshell the game proceedurally generates screens of enemies and obstacles and you clear them to progress.  Along the way you upgrade weapons and abilities in a roguelite manner.  Had some fun playthroughs and it's good with friends.  I hope the game continues to develop as the gameplay is solid

,Recommended,229810,18261946,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"This game is fun enough for an upvote from me.There is nothing drastically new here, as it is a fairly standard top-down arcade shooter. One thing it does nicely, is have a wide variety of wildly different playable characters. They all control quite differently and have a place in the combat. There are also enough game modes to keep you going for quite a while.The online leaderboards really add encouragement to have 9 people playing the game at the same time to get that number one spot.Pros:+9 players on the same screen!!+Crisp graphics+Great spaghetti western feel complete with cool camera work+Controls are tight+Lots of interactables in the environment+Arcade mode is great and gives you permanent upgrades at the end of each round+local multiplayer is a blast - really the only way to play IMOCons:-Nothing drastically novel is brought to the table, what you see is what you get-Some of the controller setup options are strange - like 'start+back' is used to reverse out of a menu (and I had to search to figure out how to do this)-It can be quite difficult at times (one hit kills, unless you have a horse - then you get an extra hit, but that is really all you have as far as defense)This game is a good deal of fun if you have local friends to play couch co-op or versus.Price is right, too."
,Recommended,229810,18216975,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,jest,"Booze, hallucinogens, and j1zz in the wild west!Gameplay's a cross between a SHMUP and a twinstick shooter.  Each character has a unique playstyle and control scheme.  Some are dpad/keyboard only.  Some are mouse+keyboard or twinstick. One guy requires you to play a DDR minigame to shoot.The single player is rogue-lite.  You have choices such as: where to travel, partaking in peyote trips, robbing people, rescuing them.There's boss fights and a cast of unlockable characters.  Funny and very replayable.Multiplayer has coop Arcade mode and Versus pvp with at least 4 player support."
76561198046151965,Recommended,229810,18197636,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Morrowind's Most Dangerous N'wah,"I saw this game on the front page of Steam and being a sucker for westerns I just had to try it out, and boy am I glad I did. As for the gameplay, it is quite fun and generally controls quite well, except for a few of the characters which can be a bit awkward at least on KB+mouse. I think the biggest selling point of the game is it's eleven unique characters, which each have a very different style and are all fun to play; chances are you will find at least one character you enjoy playing. You can play either story, arcade, or versus mode. Story is single player, and has some rogue-like elements, it's actually something like Binding of Issac in that you have to get through X number of squares to reach a boss, and you have to defeat a number of bosses before you reach the final boss, picking up and buying powerups along the way. As you'd probably expect, the story is about as simple as it gets, it is a standard western revenge plot: the head of a railroad company has wronged you and now you are out for blood. Personally I think most of the replayability lies in the arcade mode, where you must clear out as many of the randomized areas you can either by yourself, with friends, or online. As long as there continues to be an online community I think this mode could have some lasting appeal. As for versus mode, I honestly haven't played it yet, though it seems like it could easily fall prey to unbalanced characters.The art style in this game is fantastic, pixel graphics have been done to death at this point but the visuals of this game manage to capture the aesthetic of spaghetti westerns very well, and considering how rare western games are, even in the realm of indie games, I think the style really holds its own. As for the music, from what I've heard I'm not too impressed honestly, just seems like a bit of a mish-mash between retro game music and Ennio Morricone, but it really doesn't have a style all its own like in say Luckslinger, another indie western-themed game, in any case this isn't that big of a deal.My Verdict: For a little over the price of a movie, I think you'll probably get your value and then some out of this game, especially if you enjoy westerns or top down shooters."

,Recommended,229810,29215205,Posted: 12 January,all,BludStanes,"An awesome Shmup. It's tough, it's fun, I love the graphic style and it's 4 player online/offline coop. Eleven different characters and they each have a unique way of shooting. That's what grabs me, no two characters play alike. No ""hold down fire button to shoot"",Example, one guy uses a quick draw revolver so you have to press the right buttons in order to keep shooting, the longer you chain the buttons the faster and further the bullets fly, while another guy plays like bomber man. You run around dropping explosive barrels that can kill you as well. Also, once you get upgrades sometimes it can change your shooting mechanics. Cool singleplayer too with crazy bosses."

It also plays and looks a little bit like Teleglitch (which anyone who likes Fistful should check out), in the sense that it is top-down with mobs that you pew pew at with cool guns and bombs.

The reason is bad contol of most characters and bad balancing of most parts, but the most important reason is game design errors. well I never could pass the first boss, because most of selectable characters will die with one hit. and the boss area is swarmed with enemies that will shoot at you plus a very angry boss that will take too much damage to die. This means a very hard bullet hell game like Enter the Gungeon without any abilities to dudge bullets and without cool upgrades of that game (and other roguelike classics like Binding of Isaac) and you only have one heart!!! This means hell and a boring one! Wasted potential..."
