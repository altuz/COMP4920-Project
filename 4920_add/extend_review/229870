A solid FPS with simple yet unique gameplay mechanics that don't come off as gimmicky at all. Slides, grappling hooks, jump pads, teleporters, and perhaps best of all, it's community fuelled thanks to the fantastic easy-as-hell-to-use built-in map editor.There's also no gore what so ever, it feels a lot like a sci-fi laser-tag game in that ""killing"" your opponent gracefully teleports them back to the finish rather than tearing them apart or dropping them to the floor. It feels very much like a sport or tournament and that's fairly refreshing to be honest!Recommend this game to lovers of classic FPS games like Quake or Unreal Tournament, those who love to design maps and environments, or those who feel like they need something different in the FPS genre."

,Recommended,229870,9176365,"Posted: 18 February, 2014",all,YAVOR,"Currently the best competetive FPS game experiance on Steam. The FREE demo lets you play competitive, so its easy to convince your friends about giving a chance for this game. If you sick from cheating (like me), this is still your game, because the cheater population is pretty low. I play this game for months, and never met a single cheating person in SM, and this is a very memorable thing nowadays. As you can see on the pictures, this game don't contain automatic rifles, so don't expect anything like it, only laser, rockets, every weapon pinned to a location, so its your call what to choose, but be smart. It's an ""unreal"" arena battle with low gravity, walljump ability and various team managment (1v1,3v3 - and theres a solution for 2v2) It's not easy to aim here, but the full game containts DM, where you can become skilled, with some practice. Also if any of your friend buy the full game, ask for the Super Invitation. It's free (only cost LP, but not real money) but whitout it, you can only play a few matches/day, which can be very irritating, especially if you close the day with a loss (who likes that? :D) After playing with various games on the highest competitive level for more than 10 years, I recommend this game as much as I can. 10/10"
,Recommended,229870,7960881,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,Zurg,"It's like a futuristic sport, with all the elements of a fast paced arena shooter. Combines parkour and crazy shooting action across a multitude of fun online gamemodes. Also includes it's own map editor for creating your own maps which can be posted online and shared with the Maniaplanet community, Steam Workshop and your friends. The game also features beautifully polished graphics, sounds and effects. It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. Would highly recommend to anybody who is a fan of old school arena shooters such as Quake or Unreal."
,Not Recommended,229870,29571169,Posted: 29 January,all,Agent BLU,"You know the most common thing any arena shooter share?  no one seems to want to play these types of games anymore, not matter how the dead genre is sliced.   Shootmania is a simple game but with depth and strategy involved in it.   This game should be up there with CSGO, DOTA2, and other popular e-sport titles, but I think one of the things that really killed this game early was the poor, poor advertising before the game's full release, since this game was made by a french company anyway.This game shares some aspects from other older arena shooters like unreal, Quake and simplifies itself as a lasertag sport.  there are no weapon pickups, it's just you, your arm blaster that can change it's fire mode by itself depending on what part of the map or zone you are in, your wits and your own skill in movement, which is pretty big here.   Your arm blaster features 2 other weapons than the fireball.  You have the bolt which fuctions just like the railgun from Quake, and there's some kind of wierd mine blaster for indoors use, but becareful not to blow yourself up.oh yea, and your arm blaster needs to recharge after some shoots so if you try to spray fire balls everywhere, you're looking at a recharge time for each slot while getting shot at yourself.You have 3 bars of health, sometimes two bars and one bar is taken away from each hit you take.  there are no health pick ups so it's best to stay mobile and not camp.seriously, don't camp.There are no perks, no demon runes or hack cards like in Halo: Demon slayer brutality Mulitplayer 2016, no loadouts.   This isn't exactly a copy cat of Quake either.  It's a game that kind of does it's own thing and that's great.   It's also a game that can be demanding in the skill department and that's probably another thing that killed this game....which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.  the average gamer probably just want a simple line of sight shooter like CSGO for instance and just point and click.Sure the menu is cluttered somewhat but it's still presentable, alive because of the animations--its actually pretty-- a night sky moving forward as you navigate through the menu.  one of the best things i've seen in a video game to me.This game looks gorgeous, and it's a shame the player count is at zero all the time, and it's also another goddamn shame that no one wants to play arena games anymore than just the same old contemporary military shooters that are pumped every single year---you can't walk into gamestop nowadays without seeing a poster or some life sized figure of a soldier holding an assault rifle, advertising the next 100th copy of Call of duty that's coming out here in about few months, every single year.♥♥♥♥ing.   shame.   Worst of all, the market for anything first person shooters is completely overbloated with all these military games, which is why anyone thinks ""Oh yea, gotta get Battlefield one!"" or ""Yo Rob, you got the new CoD yet? I'll be online in a few!"".The market needs to open up to other kinds of shooters, not just military themed.This game had huge potential back when the open beta was running few years back.  I got destroyed myself not because the other person had abilities, or weapons had better ranking or stats, it was because he/she knew how to outmanuever other players, had better aim---positive things, okay so you lost, lets get better next time---nope, all that magic is gone nowadays.Now you get killed along with your team mates because some scumbag piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥enemy player used a drone strike to bomb the entire map or just simply hiding in a corner while racking up kills left and right which leads to gamers raging and calling people names over the internet, or if you do great in leaderboards you'll get accused of hacking and banned the next minute over the other person doing the actual cheating   << that is what most first person shooters have turned into these days.People, it's a fun game but with no players around, it's really difficult for me to recommend to anyone, and for that same reason, I can't give my own score for this review.  I ain't wasting my looking for a server with people for almost an hour while looking at the background or fiddling around with the level editor with no one to look at the content I made.move on somewhere else I guess..."

What makes me come back to it is the movementsystem and the tight controlls. You can really do some amazing trick jumps, including walljumps, rocketjumps, rocket-walljumps, grapplehooks and all that good stuff. The thing is, the game does a really bad job of teaching you that you can do this. So the game doesn't make that good of an first impression. To go fast in this game (and belive me, you can go really fast in shootmania) you have to put in some time into it. The mechanics are very unique and takes a while to get a hold of. It has a style of it's own and no other game plays like it.On top of this, it allows player to create new maps and game-modes, items, characters, skins, weapons and more, so it has a ton of content, and there are allways new maps and modes.There is a really good arena fps here, but it's hidden under some pretty bad menus and the lack of tutorials certainly doesn't help.

The real fun starts if you get better and better with all the mechanics though.You can see yourself progessing and you always learn new ways on how to do something.On top of that the game delivers many different game modes (many are custom designed) which provide enough variety.The only negative thing to say is that there are not so many people playing this game.So I'll hope you gonna join the community.If you played quake or a similar game before you probably gonna like it ^^"

A couple other weapons that activate once you reach a certain spot, like mounted weapons.Jumping gets you killed as it's too hard to maneuver in mid-air. To win in this game, move fast, shoot smart and actually capture the damn poles when it's your turn to attack.One big downside is it's hard to get players online. If you have friends, this is a PERFECT game for a LAN party, or even online. Most servers are filled with skilled players. Not pros, but skilled players.If you have friends, this game is a definite buy. Sculpt a weenie into one of your levels and invite your friends to play with you.

It was going to be a worldwide game, which was exciting, supposed to have its own tournaments, and was made by the same guys who made TrackMania. The trailer looked fun, intense, and fast, which is just the kind of game I like. The only problem with it is when it launched.It had many members/players at first, and it was easy to find a server with your friends on it. Overtime, though, it seems like everything sorta went downhill from there. Less Americans (I'm American) played the game, and soon, there were only players from certain regions. Honestly, if I knew that, I wouldn't have purchased the game. It has different gamemodes and fast gameplay, probably would've been one of my favorite games on PC, but sadly, I couldn't understand anybody on my servers. Once a month, it seemed like, there was finally someone that spoke English, but over time, the probability of finding someone in your country became as small as a grain of sand.It's not a buy to win game, thank goodness, and has seperate gamemodes that you can download. However, there are excessive ads on TrackMania2, and after a while, that gets kind of annoying. There are three different weapons, one's similar to a sticky bomb launcher, which you get underground, the lightning gun, which you get in long range gamemodes, and then you have the plasma shooter, as you can see on the title picture, which is the deault weapon you use all the time.I'd give this dying multiplayer game a 7.5, and please consider this review before you purchase the game.

Unfortunately, the game is heavily reliant on the contribution of other players, which just so happens to be in very short supply on the ShootMania servers. There's plenty of potential for a good time and it is a very fun game with replayability out the yin-yang thanks to the built in level editor we all expect from any ManiaPlanet game. But with no one to share the experience with, the game simply collects dust, begging to be jump started - my sincearest hopes that it does.

I didn't have steam at the time and I was too young to know the possibilties of downloading files off of a random website. And my computer was nuked with viruses. Next year I got Steam and 2015 I discover this on Steam. The same thing as last time happened when I downoaded it. But that was only because I didn't have a good PC. Now I have a Razer Blade Stealth and I am using it to write this review on a game I have long forgotten. I have seen other people run this game great on laptops that aren't as good as the one I have now. And I really want to give this another try. But I am anxious to redownload it because all the reviews I am seeing are saying the game is dead. Anyone that currently plays this game and is reading this review please tell me that there is still a chance for me to actually play.Well a few minutes after I made this review I tried playing it again...No luck. I got a message saying it couldn't find my graphics card and then it crashed...Is there a way to fix this in the NVDIA Control Panel?

There are only two weapons in the game that I've encountered so far, the focus is on accuracy and mobility, you can jump around really fast in this game. Since the bullets of the gun you fire travel so slow, you have to shoot where you think your target is going to be, not where they currently are, which is a really cool because it amps up the skill level. Haven't had this much fun with a FPS since Unreal Tournament."

It's just as french and weird as Trackmania, and getting to see how Maniaplanet is coming together as this and Stadium release is pretty exciting.For the uninitiated, the Mania games, when initially released, are♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's being overly harsh, but  the level that the community takes the content to is so far above anything the developers include with the games that it is ridiculous. As a result, what is currently available in Shootmania is pretty middling. You can see the groundwork and tools are there for people to make some cool stuff, but right now, everyone is still playing on the default maps and gametypes, the pro players are still talking in IRC, and the custom content creators are still figuring out what works, and what works that is also fun to play.To give you an idea of how one gametype works, imagine a standard FFA match. In the center of the map is a big metal pole. Once someone has captured the pole, respawns are disabled for the rest of the round. Additionally, there is a bigass storm closing on the map the entire round, and touching it kills you instantly, so you have to move towards the middle of the map over time. You can get hit twice by an enemy players weapon before you are killed, as well.OH AND THE SURFACE YOU ARE STANDING ON DICTATES YOUR CURRENT WEAPON AND WHETHER OR NOT SPACEBAR JUMPS OR SPRINTS WELCOME TO MANIAPLANET ENJOY YOUR STAYI wouldn't start your PAID experience with the Mania games here. I do suggest you play the Open Beta by downloading the demo, however. Trackmania 2 Stadium is pretty cheap, and is heavily populated at the moment. Canyon is more expensive, and since Stadium is still a pretty recent release, it's pretty empty by comparison.Maniaplanet is one of the most unique...things I've had the pleasure of playing, and I suggest you check it out, from one of its components or another."

I played the game in the beta phase and the gameplay itself is of the best amongst all shooters. But at this point the game is unplayable, because there are usually not more than 50 people on the server and in the most competetive  playmode ""elite"" you only have 3-4 servers with people who are beating up and flaming new players. If you never played the game I would recommend you not to buy it, because there seems to be no support from nadeo anymore and no matchmaking, so unless you spend hours of pointless training you wont have any fun."
