I  read some reviews and watched the gameplay videos and figured that the game would be appropriate for a 6 year old. While the game is more than satisfactory for my son it is also hours upon hours of fun for myself. I play a lot of FPS, flight sim, and TF2. Most of these games have excellent gameplay with great graphics  and serious story lines. This game was a fun and lighthearted change of pace. I have had fun playing maps over and over finishing level accomplisments and laughing at the cartoon daredevil crashes. The graphics are fantastic cartoon graphics, the controls are easy to learn and with a control that fits his hands my son easily plays this game accomplishing levels and stringing together combos of stunts. This game belongs in the library of anyone young or old that plays games because everyone wants to have some relaxing fun occasionally. The levels are chanllenging enough to be interesting without it being too hard for a child to play or too easy for an adult to enjoy. Excellent game."

Get it now while it's 40% off with Joe Danger 2 - The Movie (Which is even bigger!)I would strongly suggest using a controller though it is still playable on keyboard"
,Not Recommended,229890,28455477,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Renegade Master,"I cannot recommend Joe Danger to the average gamer, as I can only recommend it to experts at bike games due its huge downsides:-Collecting is required for level/stage advancement, not just obtaining scores for trophies.  It'd be one thing if a ""star"" required to unlock levels were like ""collect 40 of 50 specific things"", but its more like ""collect all 50 things"" which turns this game into a tedious challenge once you reach certain stages that require stars. This stopped the game dead in its tracks for me after getting through a few percent of career and training modes.-""Full controller support"" is a lie. Lane changes either cannot be performed with a controller, or they're restricted to limited areas.  Also, multiple controllers for split screen are not supported!-Only Xbox controller controls are shown & explained in game.  Keyboard controls can only be seen and configured using the pregame launcher app.The upsides to this game might be enough for bike game experts:-Level building & steam workshop is pretty extensive.-Absurd number of unlocks and in-level collectables.-Leaderboards, ghosts, and split screen."

,Recommended,229890,7782220,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Faseeh,"Joe Danger. Go in expecting nothing. And this will blow your mind.There's a little charm about Joe Danger. It's like your Excitebike in 3D with your mission based gameplay and speed and exploration in a linear progression based game. It's hilarious. It reeks off 70s to 90s and if you're from that time or you like those times, you'll love this.Joe Danger is about a retired stuntsman who wants to rejoin and get back his skills and audience. You take on the role of that guy and you bring him on the road to success. Not much of a story but this game's all about the gameplay.With tons of replayability, nooks and carrines to explore, a whole lot of missions, this game is well worth its price!"

Something breezy to play for a few hours without a lot of complexity.  Pick it up when it's on sale, $15 is probably a little too high.Also, the ""Training Ground"" is actually the HARDER levels, not the tutorial.  Just start with the regular Career mode first.  They didn't explain that very clearly."

There is over 100 levels in basic game, but also Workshop levels and you can make more by yourself.

Sort of, but not really. There isn't much racing going on, and the racing itself isn't very interesting. Nor are the tricks or the collecting. Frankly, I just can't find the point of it. I can't tell my friends what the objective is because I just can't figure it out. I get to the end of the level and move on to the next, but I didn't do much of anything to get there and the next level doesn't give me any goals besides to get to the end."

Challenging fun and to learn new jumps tricks and or stunts is fun and really like the challenge of it. Give it a chance and you will surely enjoy this changing challenging game....

Now don't get me wrong its not a bad game, it just is different and wasn;t what I was expecting.  Pretty simple controls overall its basically a fun time killer game.  Pick it up on a sale where you only pay $5 for."
