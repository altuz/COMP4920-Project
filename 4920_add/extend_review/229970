76561197985573260,Not Recommended,229970,14344496,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,Hade,"I played the game here and then I purchaed the gold edition on Gamer's Gate before it was available  on Steam. The game is fun to play and moddable. However once you hit turn 200 or colonize 20 planets (this is RAM dependent I found out(16gb, at 32gb you can colonize upto 30-50 planets maybe)) the game has a dramatic slow down in game play. At this point you'll mostly be waiting on the Resource or Population Manager, often times 20 mins plus for your turn to come up. At turn 200, I was just getting into the game and having fun. So I checked if there was a fix for this. No fix. Per the developers, the game is not designed to be played for long periods or for you to colonize every planet in sight. I usually won the game after 30-45 minutes of game play, often winning before I ever met another race, having gotten bored with that, I modded the victory conditions for more time. What's the point of having a universe with hundreds of planets, but if you colonize more then 20 planets, the game becomes unplayable with long periods (many minutes waiting on the AI to complete processing your turn) between turns. Eventually you'll get tired of waiting and hit crl+alt+del, kill the game and go play something else.The other thing is that diplomacy is a joke. The ai will attack you, make peace, agree not to attack you for 20 turns, 5 turns later will attack you again, make peace, make you an ally, attack someone else, you'll attack the enemy of your ally, they'll make peace, you won't even know they made peace, etc. Or you can attack another race, make peace, attack them again, make peace, etc. If a planet has too amny defesnses, buy the planet, the ai will sell any planet they have except their home base. Hey, there's an invasion fleet at your planet, just buy their ships if you have the cash.If you manage to wipe out a race, they'll become friendly and start asking you for tech, even though they don't have any ships or planets and you've completely wiped them out.I've never been able to get thru all the techs in the game, just takes to long to research them and playing with the default game without modding, you'll just barely scratch the surface. Once you've researched every tech in a particular catagory, it would have been nice to get a messages about it, but you don't so you have to keep checking and then remember to go thru every planet and delete that type of research facility. I have noticed from conquered planets that the ai does not have the same limitations as you do when it comes to building research facilities. So the top tier reseach facility, you can only build 1 for your empire, where as the ai can build 4 per planet. And on top of that, the ai will always be willing to sell you any tech that you don't have and they've researched.There really isn't much difference between the standard game and the gold edition. This game stil lhas all the bugs it did in the original, all they did was add about 2 buildings as far as I can tell.When I bought the gold version on Steam, I was hoping that the bugs and gameplay had been fixed, but I came to find out nothing has changed. Luckly i got it for around $4 so it's no that big of a loss, definitively not worth $20.So all in all the game is fun in the beginning, is moddable, but has too many issues to keep you inteserested for any length of time.Update:I'd like to note that most of my playtime is watching TV and waiting for my turn7/23/2016 Update: Still works on windows 10."

Most of the reviews I've read aren't even aware that this is an unpdate of a game so old is pre-dates MOO and MOO2.  So to compare this with the MOO games isn't really fair, since it's just as likely MOO took ideas from the old Armada 2525.There are some great features to the game.  In particular, the events notifications after each turn allows itself to be used as a sort of checklist when resolving issues, in a way that not even the new Civ games do.  However, there are several tedious features.  Moving population around planets is necessary, and it just takes a little too long to issue each transport command.  The issues are minor, such as having to move the mouse far across the screen, instead of having common commands set right next to each other.  So it isn't awful, just a little tiring to me after some hours of play.Alien races keep spamming me with requests and deal offers, and there is no way to stop them.  Unfortunately, most of the offers just aren't that important.  I finally declared war on one race to stop their nagging, which reduced communications to a series of offers for peace.  The aliens will also sometimes park on your planets, doing no harm, but causing the game to prompt you to declare war every single turn, which also gets tedious.This is basically a good, relatively simple sci fi 4x game that probably has some good strategy.  But the polish isn't there, for me.  The pace of play tends to tire me rather than energize me.  So I recommend avoiding it, although it might be enjoyable if you are really interested in 4x sci fi games, of which there are not enough.I have only played the Gold edition.  Based on the new features list, I would avoid the regular edition and only buy the gold, if you do buy it.  It adds quite a lot.Update:  Okay, I changed my mind.  But with some caveats.  The game is funny, quirky, and easy to mod.  If you like exploring a game to see what makes it tick, and if you don't take it too seriously, this might be a good buy.  The problems I mentioned lessen as the game progresses, and there are many ways to win.  Myself, I have made small changes to the random planet generation to reduce the number of useless planets.  It appears to have been made by one person, which I find quite admirable.  It isn't really polished, but it has a good heart."

Witha plethora of starships to choose from Armada2526 GE allows for limitless in battle strategies. While at the same time allowing for dictator like control over all that goes on in your empire. If for one reason or another micromanaging becomes a pain, several features allow you to hand different aspects of control to the AI. Alothough there are only 18 different alien races, there are several other factions with differnt perks than the main branch of that race. The map designer enpowers you to create just about any galaxy you heart desires and choose the riches at each planet. The only down falls to this game may be that the game can become a little monotonous after 200 turns if you don't set new goals for your-self and time between turns can be long if you are playing with a lot of races. Above all the game provides a wide variety of stratagies to conqur the galaxy."

Twice, once for each computer. So now i have bought it on Steam and i have laid out $100.Now i can play it on either computer without porting  problems.The game is by far more interesting to me as my years of playing it go on.Yes, it needs some creative tinkering to make it an even better game in forms of management. I would love to be able to find just the planets that have reserch staions that have become obsolete so i can both remove them and replace them without going through hundreds of planets,But if you like broad expansive strategy as well as figuring out how to make an economy work I think you will like this ""game of chess with few limits."""

Galactic Civilization (1&2) is the best 4X space I have seen so far, then Space Empire V then Armada 2526. I can envision playing Armada before Gal Civ when I don't feel like committing too much time. It is challenging because opponents advance fast and pile on, just have to be aggressive."

I really love the space map as it's easy to navigate, great to look at and shows everything you need to know. One of the biggest difference to other 4x games is that each race has it's own goals. So it's not so much about conquer everyone but to achieve your own objectives (happiness etc.). The game is really complete with very different races to play with. While the combat could still be better, i really like it because you can lead many ships as well as ground troops on a single screen. This game is a classic and any 4x player should have it in it's Library.Some special key aspects:- This game works great on Windows tablets (surface etc) without any touchpad or mouse. Perfect to play it on the go (train etc.)- The game scales really well on any screen sizes i've played it on.- Multiplayer by pbem is easy and great."

Having played a lot of hours of it I continue to be impressed by the gameplay. I've played a lot of 4X games and although many of them have some excellent features they tend to be a massive grind. I've found that to be a problem, mid-game they become less space! and more spreadsheet. I'm impressed by this game because it has a strong strategic component, it is very well designed  and a lot of fun.Pros. Gameplay is much better than I expected. Movement is unusual but excellent and the simple but effective flight range mechanic turns this into a proper strategy game. It has sufficient 4X meat on its bones to stay interesting. The alien species are numerous and sufficiently different to give replayability. There is actual strategy in this game compared to many more recent 4X games which can be simply economy sims or CIV inspired. This game loads and processes action extremely quickly on a modern PC. This is also cheap which makes it a low cost to try.Cons. This is an old game. Graphics are not what you would get in a 2016 release. There is no vessel design system (ship classes and upgrades only). It lacks the bells and whistles of a modern release.This is very much of the vintage of the original ""Masters of Orion"" but it is also a bit of a lost classic in the 4X genre. It is rare for me to find a 4x game that is better than I expected, this one is definitely better IMHO than many much more expensive alternatives. Try it!"

There's alot of the UI where that shows, such as ending turns in multiplayer games, ending your turn completely and being unable to act.Unit diversity could be a touch better as well in early game.That all aside, the game is deep...shockingly deep. There is a whole lot to fiddle with, and experiment here, from varying techs, planet and star system setups, even setting up migrations of population from one star system to another. Somewhere in the 50th turn I realized I was completely hooked, and my fledling 9 world empire (this is TINY compared to the total number of stars available, even in a ""medium"" sized map.) was just now barley starting to come out of the red and into the black.The sheer distance between stars, also makes you feel the sheer vastness of your empire, even when you have 9 inhabited systems (you end up with far far far more) it takes a very long time to get to your new planets. In early game, when your colonizable planets are far flung, you are gambling. it's inevitable really. Do you go so far out that reinforcements will be a LONG time in coming? Or do you take the risk for higher inhabited worlds to come up quicker, and be self sufficient before another empire decides to take them?There is depth in a great many facets of the game on initial impression, and the sheer scale involved is daunting. Highly recommend, especially as this game is more often than not onsale, 50 to 75 percent off."

It has a very well designed economic system, a clean unhappiness system, and an amazing diplomacy system, even with AI. There is, however, one MAJOR flaw. The game has a bug where : If you attack an enemy colony, and do not choose to auto calculate the battle, the screen goes to the desktop exept for a GUI overlay. Then, after the battle is over, and the screen will remain black with a GUI overlay. Any text or windows that appear on the black screen will stay there even after closing them. Furthermore, saving the game and rebooting it does not help. Unless you plan on victory without fighting, you simply cannot win."

Has elements of Masters of Orion 1 and 2 as well as the original Galactic Civilizations 1.One big weakpoint about Armada 2526, which it shares with GalCiv 1 and fails to match MoO1 and MoO2 with, it doesn't have ships that you design yourself. All ships within the game are all preset blueprints which only unlock when the appropriate tech is researched. This means individual weapon and ship components techs are also not used in this game. Eg the weapon tech tree doesn't open up exotic new weapon types like in MoO1 / 2, it just adds buffs to the game's few generic weapon types - all weapon types are there from the start to the finish of every game, no new ones get invented! All there are is a few bland ""Energy Beam"", ""Missiles"" etc. An example weapon tech effect is ""Increase all energy based weaponry range by 30%"". Ship types are often a bit boring too, just ""Cruiser I"", ""Cruiser II"" etc. Ships also have no armour or hull structure points, the shields are IT..... once a shield goes down even a .22 bullet will vapourise a Battlecruiser!!!!! (Anyone familiar with the mediocre ""Smugglers V""?)Despite shields being all there is HP-wise, there are no individual shield techs! Just a couple of small ubiqutious and generic shield HP buffs throughout the whole tech-tree! Obviously no armour or hull techs, as I said the game doesn't even accomodate such things, and ships have no ""size"" statistics taken into account.There's no engine techs, no targeting computer techs. In fact the whole tech tree is somewhat bland, and smaller than a lot of Armada 2625's competitors.Maybe the above is because Armada 2526 is allegedly a remake of a much older game, ""Armada 2525"" which predates even Master of Orion 1! It's believed MoO1 may even have took a lot of it's ideas from Armada 2525!Apart from all those weaknesses the game is fairly solid. Don't be fooled by the overall negative tone here, I'm just making sure you are aware of the game's major faults. Don't be put off buying this if you are space 4x4 nut like me, you *will* like it I assure you! And it is way way way better than the godawful ""Horizon"" (full price a RIP-OFF at well over £20)!DON'T pay the full retail price of £14.99 though. Wait for a good 50%+ sale!PS/ All those good looking screen shots on the store page ARE misleading..... you can get the 3d battle scenes to do this, but the game's UI makes it very tricky to do so, you will not often be bothering getting yourself the kind of eye-candy in those advertising shots!"
