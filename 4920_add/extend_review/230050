There is so much humour and jokes about the gaming industry. It's a joke about the big greedy companies that releases a huge amount of the game as DLC (downloadable content) after release. It's also a lot of internet language and hillarious references here. There's two small stories within this game, but it's still very short ( about 2 hours). This is however on sale a lot of time for around 1 euro, and for that price it's a steal. The game has some replayability, because of some challenges and achievements, so that's a nice bonus. I have a achievement guide of this game if you're interested to get everything out of this game.Overall, I'm suprised to see so much humour packed inside this small package, and DLC Quest easily gets my recommendation."

I'll not spoil what the DLC is, as this is probably the most fun aspect of your playthrough. Things are taken to extremes where you will not be able to progress until you've collected enough coing to buy the correct DLC.You'll defintely find yourself smirking at the absurdity of it all and you'll be pulled in by the uniqueness of a game that purposely blocks your progress until you ""buy"" DLC.It's good for a quick laugh but don't expect an expansive game that will keep you going for more than a few hours."

,Recommended,230050,7808497,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Bruh,"CAUTION: This game is only actually worth it when it goes on sale because it is a short and easy game, but it still serves as fairly decent satire.There really is not much I can say about the gameplay, replayability or graphics because the game doesn't need to look amazing considering it's puny length and you would already know what to expect from the gameplay. You cannot die, there's close to no physics and unlike the Stanley Parable; when you replay this game, you will get all the same things. However, this game does give an important message about DLC overkill in games. In most games, you will see pre-order bonuses, retailer exclusives, overpriced and stupid DLCs which don't really enhance the game so much as to justify the purchase of DLCs, they seem to serve as novelties nowadays.This is what makes this game important. Remember the days around the PS2 era where if you bought a game, you got the whole game and not just parts of it which will be filled in with DLC. That made games more exciting and more worth paying for. That all changed with the dawn of expansion packs for the big MMOs and Horse Armour (I'm looking at you, Oblivion!) but it isn't entirely for the worst from what I have seen. The DLCs for Saints Row: The Third have added many hours to the game and are of decent quality rather than being lousy 20 minute long stories which I thought was cool.The only real issue I have with the game is the fact that I, and many others already know that a lot of DLC is pointless on the PC unless a game doesn't have mod support and on PC, mod support is always expected and always demanded for it to constitute ""a real PC game"" which is fair enough knowing that mods are changing the face of the games industry, but this satire is very relevant for consoles, which don't have mods, so console gamers rely upon the release of overpriced DLC to get new stuff in their game.It's good for a laugh, the platforming is fairly easy and it can be quite entertaining, just don't buy it for full price."

,Not Recommended,230050,9888747,"Posted: 21 April, 2014",all,SirCrest,"At first I thought the jokes were kind of charming in a sense because it was kind of subtle, but by the end it was forced to the point of not even being funny. Sure, as someone who is involved in games a lot I recognized the reference, but it felt like it was relying on the puncline alone to be the joke.This game plays like a typical platformer like mario, except it doesn't do a good job. The entire thing is platforming and it's very floaty and slidy. For me, it was not really a pleasure to play. It was simply a game I wanted to finsh because people told me it was short.The concept of finding all of the coins is fine for buying the next item to unlock the next area but, but margins of what is available and what is not means you're searching the entire level of any single missing coins. This causes tons of worthless backtracking looking for hidden sides of walls trying to get that next amount of coins. The snow area was the greatest offender in this regard. You're playing it for the jokes and humor, but you have to get past all the annoying stuff to get to it.Sure, for the price on or off sale it's good value for the time, but even for maybe an hour or so of solid gameplay it's incredibly boring and full of filler. You're playing it for the references. Which aren't worth it. If you want a good experience, play the first chapter and uninstall it.If you want jokes about the games industry go read the hundreds of comics about games online. You'll be more entertained. An ironically annoying game is still an annoying game."

I'M A MESSAGE BOX, NOT A COP.""Game, which is adventure of Bobby Kotick and his Activision, EA and their rise of microtransactions, greed and illness of gaming industry, and publishers and their managers who aren't managers, but money-hunters. They are more like shephards whose sheeps are eating download-able content than green.Going Loud Studio shows us, and describes us, how nowadays gaming industry works, with the satire and humor and only with that, because there're plenty of articles, showing the truth, and we can't laugh about it. DLC Quest shows us the truth, and we can and we'll laugh about it so hard.Type of games, which's doing this and having hidden messages from devs and designers in-game, are halfway to be great rated. No wonders, it's like that.Dialogues are well-written, game-design is solid like Solid Snake, same goes with level-design. In game, we've got two modes to play - DLC Quest and Live Freemium or Die.DLC Quest is basically main campaign and LFoD is consequence, with way more interesting and gripping world, voyage and level-design. Wall Jump is more entertaining than Double Jump which's in main campaign.Game has full-controller support (1 stick and 1 button) and I'd recommend you using it, than keyboard.Game could be little bit longer (1 hour per each mod on the first run / speedrun can be done with everything collected under 20 mins) but sometimes less is more, and this game confirms it, and the whole situation in gaming industry was described here more than well.Bonus Point: Making Fun of DLC PolicyRating: 9/10"

After all transforming a joke into a game doesn't improve the quality of the joke; rather in this case, transform said joke into meaningless blabber that comes off as repetitive and obnoxious. Gameplay itself is lacklustre and generally shoddy. As for graphics, well retro graphics are no excuse for unimaginative and ugly design. We've seen many games use retro style successfully: Hotline Miami, Evoland, and Cave Story to name a few, yet DLC Quest fails to hit the mark. Perhaps the only redeemable aspect is it's chip-tune music.Had I reviewed this game years ago upon first playing it, I would have given it a positive review, but upon looking back, a mixed-negative review is far more appropriate."

It's essentially a sidescrolling platformer, with some jumping action and minor skills required (a gamepad comes in handy). Graphics and sound are minimalistic, even quite retro (I was reminded of the games of the 80's). But this serves a purpose: to make fun of the ever-growing DLC-habits (and sometimes misuse) in the games of, let's say, the last five years.So you start the game literally without anything. You can hardly move your character, there is no sound, even no menu. All of these have to be purchased as dlc-packs, to be paid for with in-game found gold. It's a simple but original idea, and it's very well executed, with lots of humour. I found myself laughing out aloud quite often. There is even a totally non-important sequel, so the sequelitis also gets a slap at.That's all there is to it, really. The game is original, funny, and - despite the tons of dlc's - very short. But for very little money, do try it, and treat yourself on some great moments. It even has Steam-acievements (which are also made fun of!) and Steam trading cards, so for badge-hunters this is a real treat.Gameplay: 21/30 (the basic idea gets done well, but that's it)Graphics: 10/20Sound: 6/10 (I liked the retro sounds)Replayability &long-lasting appeal: 10/20 (it's very short, but it's cheap too)Stability/patching: 18/20 (no issues whatsoever)Final score: 65/100"

Even the end of the game has poetic satire that mirrors the overall experiences of many long time gamers.The game is short, about 5 hours or so when casually playing. You might hop back on to tinker - or go for achievements - but nothing will pull you back for replay.No real technical issues or bugs found in the short run.In the end, there are far worse DLC's you could support than this one.

76561198123412640,Recommended,230050,15316416,"Posted: 11 April, 2015",all,Sam Lilly,"DLC Quest is a satirical 2D platformer that uses a retro aesthetic to poke fun at modern conventions. You start out only being able to move right. You need to unlock and purchase your way through the game via downloadable content. Don't worry, you use in-game coins to purchase the packs. You need to buy things as basic as sound, animation, and free movement as well as new abilities and cosmetic changes. I'd go into more detail, but explaining the joke would ruin the experience for you. Just know there are some very clever bit of DLC and dialogue that do a good job exaggerating the ridiculous nature of many greedy modern games. The basic plot is to save the princess in the first episode, and to save the town in the second. Most of the achievements are simple, requiring you to simply go through the quest. You can collect all the coins, find and purchase all the DLC packs, and beat the game. There are a few more difficult ones, such as the speedrunning achievements, if you're looking for replay and challenge. I like the music, the art, and the humor. It's a fun little game, but it does have a few problems.One problem with this game is that it's short. It has a lot of clever things to experience and a decent sized world, especially with the two combined campaigns, but it's still only going to take, at most, a few hours to beat. Also, while the humor hit me well, it may not be for everyone. That, and the fact that after you go through the game and get all the jokes, you're left with just the gameplay experience. This is a bit of a problem because, while it is a good experience as a whole, if the humor gets old then you're left with a short and very easy game. It coasts on the satire, perhaps to a fault. I'd like to see a larger game with this style because the controls, art, and music were all good... but this isn't going to be one you want to replay tons of times unless you're a speed runner. Also, I would've liked more music themes in the game, but the ones that are there are very catchy so I can give that a pass.Overall, DLC Quest a pretty fun little game that makes fun of ridiculous practices in modern games. If you like classic games, satire, and simple fun then you'll probably enjoy this little experience. I feel it has enough here to be worth the 3 dollar asking price, but if you're on the fence about it, just know that it does seem to go on sale now and then for less. It you want have a little fun with a retro style game that pokes some fun at newer ones, this is for you. Here's hoping we get more games with this nice kind of control and level design in the future. DLC Quest get a 6/10 for being a rather shallow game that makes up for its shortcomings in very clever design humor."

The included sequel is a lot longer and harder and just like the first one has two endings (or more), which plays out as two different games.Its a great game to play if your waiting to play other games or just want something quick that’s built like other games with pretty much no problems at all.

DLC Quest offers fun RPG that continually makes you laugh by showing you what is wrong with gaming companies.Story:The adventure begins as Player arises within the middle of 2D world. Only able to more right he must find currency that represents real money to buy DLC that unlocks all the basics the game didn’t come with. The princess has been kidnapped and it is up to Player to go and save her from a bad guy, who is like a wizard.Campaign:There is no difficulty for this game, in fact there is essentially no combat, and you can’t die. Yet you will continually fight on to collect as many coins as possible. You will meet NPCs that provide you with little to no information, and will continually joke about their purpose. As you progress through the game you will unlock DLC that is required to complete the game, and even have the option to buy DLC that just jazzes it up. The campaign isn’t very long, but it keeps you gripped and there are many little secrets that make you want to keep playing.Gameplay:This game gives you a weapon, and the ability to move and jump. You will essentially be running around collecting coins the entire game. There will essentially be no combat, and no reason you should die. In fact the game is a huge waste of time, but it’s hilarious and you will play it anyway. The game is simple and the mechanics are basic, but what makes this game unique is that every little aspect must be purchased with the in game currency. Don’t worry you won’t actually spend any real money as you will find the required currency to purchase the upgrades throughout the levels.Live Freemium or Die Hard:Funnily a game called DLC quest actually has no DLC. The second campaign is free and it includes all new levels and even the ability to die. There are traps and even some fights which pose all new challenges to the story. The game offers all new puzzles, abilities, jokes, and DLC that make for a riot. It’s definitely worth checking out, even if it’s not DLC.Results:This game is reasonably priced at about $2.99; realistically you will probably play this game for 2-hours so it’s about $1.50 an hour if you want to look at it like that. The campaign is witty and gives a new look to how the gaming industry has changed over the years. DLC Quest sheds a light on how most games today offer DLC that should be included with the initial product. It includes funny jokes, interesting level design, and a simple story that makes you want to actually beet the game. If you like simple platformers and enjoy finding secrets then DLC Quest is the game for you. I would recommend this game, especially if it is on sale.Pros:+Simple game mechanics+Two campaigns+Lots of DLC (none of which you actually pay money for)+Funny dialogue and game design+Amazing story (Where is the princess? What happened to all the villagers?)+You can totally complete the Grindstone without using the DLC XP Boost. You even get a special message for doing it, but no achievement.Cons:-Not as much DLC as promised (I want to give them real money so I can unlock a jetpack horse)-On Live Freemium or Die Hard if you buy all the DLC you may find yourself stuck at the last section (as there are only enough coins to barely get you through the campaign)."

,Recommended,230050,11374834,"Posted: 23 July, 2014",all,Olde,"I really enjoyed DLC Quest. It's fun to play, has a charming atmosphere, and is quite humorous in poking fun at lots of cliches and tropes of the video game industry. At its core, it's a simple, comedic sidescroller with an ostensibly generic storyline, yet it never hesitates to point out its own irrational logic, from its cliched characters to the seemingly bizarre aspects that are currently part of today's gaming industry.The premise behind DLC Quest is that a bad guy captures a princess, so obviously it's your job to stop him and rescue the damsel in distress. Heard this story a million times before? So have the developers at Going Loud Studios, so what they've done is put their own spin on this age-old premise. Your task is to first collect enough coins to buy DLC within the game world itself. A clear commentary on the cash-grubbing nature of the video game industry, these little packs are initially required in order for you to do the most basic actions, such as moving both left AND right and being able to pause the game. As you progress, the game gives you some nice aesthetic features as well as weapons/items.I was surprised at how good the control is. The jumping mechanic feels like the original Super Mario Bros. (where you can control height and momentum in the air), which I appreciate immensely. You move left and right at a reasonable pace, too. The controls are customizable and the graphics are vibrant and appealing. Aesthetically, the game's design gives it an NES feel. The dialogue is often funny, with characters acknowledging their ridiculous requests or their arbitrary roles in making you run off and do stuff with no justification other than that's how these games work. DLC Quest on a whole is very tongue-in-cheek that way. That being said, there were a couple things that I thought could be improved. To progress through the game, you obviously need to get enough coins to purchase certain DLC items, but a couple of times I couldn't figure out where to go, because I thought I had cleared out all the areas. Turns out there are some secret areas you have to look for where the walls are missing their borders, which are easy to miss. There are also some areas that you might not realize you can get to for similar reasons (boulders or bushes obscured by the foreground, etc.). Otherwise, I found the platforming to be relatively easy, simple enough for an old fogey like me to get through.Overall, I think DLC Quest is a very creative, imaginative, quirky, charming, humorous game well worth its price point. It pokes fun at itself and other gaming cliches, but even though it admits its own ""faults,"" it still kept me wanting to play. If you're at all into sidescrollers, I'd recommend giving this one a try."

We live in an age of almost circular mistrust and exploitation. With piracy and second hand sales apparently ever increasing and a CONTINUAL drain on the potential earnings of game studios, it's time for them to hit back. And they do this with DOWNLOADABLE content.DOWNLOADABLE content is the scourge of the consumer, a desperate grab for more money from the creators. We know you bought your game, but pay more! Pay more to see the ending, to see the plots, to improve your power... Pay more to complete your experience!Okay, that might be slightly unbalanced (and not representative of my actual views, that's for another time), but it was only an introduction. It is hardly going to be news to anyone that some of the practices creeping in to gaming are unpopular, or at best divisive. There are some thoughts that, with the birth of microtransactions and freemium set-ups, we are heading toward some sort of dystopian future for games.That's where DLC Quest comes in! An indie developed 2D platformer which pretty much bases itself in this vision of the future of gaming, where anything you could possibly want in a game comes...as an extra!Of course, this doesn't mean that the game becomes extortionately expensive, as this is done with tongue planted firmly within the cheek. It serves to ridicule not only the poor practices that are heading this slippery slope, but also other parts of the general gaming world.DLC Quest offers two separate, but linked, campaigns – DLC Quest and Live Freemium or Die, which are both provided in the package. Fortunately, the developers obviously resisted the urge to forge a bond with the ironic and hypocritical by making Live Freemium or Die into paid downloadable content.So what's the context behind the parody? Well, in DLC Quest, the player takes control of Player, a sprite-come-hero that is dragged into the the perils of the village, aided in his various quests by the magnanimous shopkeeper offering all sorts of goodies that are necessary for defeating the bad guy and saving the princess and all of the other gaming clichés you can think of. It must be said that DLC Quest is very short and to the point, with some (but not a lot) of exploration to be done before even 100% completion.Live Freemium or Die is a “direct sequel” of sorts to DLC Quest, and provides a much more fleshed out experience than that of the former. Continuing the rather contrived storyline to this point of DLC Quest, Live Freemium or Die CONTINUES following Player as he investigates a recent string of related deaths in the village, providing a much larger scale of map for exploration and a slightly more directed story than the first part of the duology.Gameplay-wise, the DLC duo doesn't really do anything to innovate, nor does it do anything particularly wrong. The game plays as a fairly simple 2D platformer, with each game providing a slightly different platforming mechanic to get around with. It must also be noted that Live Freemium or Die adds a little more of the challenge that DLC Quest was pretty much devoid of. That being said, it's hardly Super Meat Boy and won't provide too much of a headache to anyone. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it allows many people to enjoy the concept and humour within, but don't come in expecting to be tested.So if DLC Quest isn't going to win awards for its gameplay, what about the graphics and sounds? Well, once you've unlocked the audio and visual packs, it can be seen that it is a fairly basic affair. The 8-bit visual style pays good homage to the early days of gaming history, whilst the fairly catchy (albeit short, much like the game) chiptune background music also adds to the aesthetic. These provide a great contrast to the issues of modern and future gaming models that the game attempts to address.So, if you're wanting a AAA blockbuster that's going to provide you with hours of content and the complexities that come with it, then you are looking in the wrong place. If you're wanting a technical masterpiece or keyboard smashing difficulty, then your experience is not here. If, however, you are looking for a short and simple distraction, at only a fraction of the PRICE of a map pack, with plenty of satirical amusement (As such, it could be described as a much more concise version of what Duke Nukem Forever tried to be), then look no further than DLC Quest – and be happy that the industry haven't quite plunged to the depths that the game attests to!Unlock Final Review Score Pack: 8 coins"

There was a point in the game where I saw the reviews that said the makers drew the game out too long and the joke gets spent up and trying to complete everything becomes tedium instead, and I could see that they had felt the game had outstayed its welcome on its gimmicks.I could understand that perspective but not personally share it. While I won't try to get every single achievement (I've got all but two of them, and seeing what those two are I don't think I want to get myself out of sorts getting them)... I really enjoyed the jokes this game pulled and the bits of commentary it did. It turned its DLC jokes into actual gameplay mechanics in some cases, and each thing it had you 'buy' or do felt like a little unique bit of commentary under the overall DLC subject or in some cases actually ended up being things you would buy with in-game money anyway like better weaponry. I personally got a kick out of the guy who said he had nothing to say now but would be important later - I've seen plenty of RPGs that did just that, and were less upfront about it.Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is I personally enjoyed this game and the different DLC jokes it pulled instead of feeling like it outlived its fun like some other reviewers feel. At the very least, it's inexpensive enough that you can give it a go and walk away when you personally feel sated without breaking the bank, even if your experience doesn't mirror mine."

It was a dollar on sale.However I came away from this with my expectations vastly exceeded.This is a short game, probably four hours of content in all, but to be honest that doesn't bother me.What I got out of this was a fun tidy platformer with a sprinkling of humour that I enjoyed.That seems like good entertainment value to me.The original quest is quite short, but leaves a mark.  There is plenty to think over as you race through this colorful platformer.  What would you do for an achievement?  Are you really gun safe?And after years of living in the world of freemium have we really been programmed to play games like this?Is this game a silly prediction that creeps closer to coming true?Or you can just race about jumping around like a mad person looking for secrets.  Thats mainly what I did.And then there is the Game of The Year quest.  Its noticeably longer in length if you like your games that way, and creates a story that builds on the original game quite nicely.  Its also quite a bit of fun if you liked the first level, and has more of that sense of humour that I really enjoyed.  That said its definitely a game that brings you a lot more joy if you delve into the video game references.  I even found myself searching Justin Bailey, and learning Metroid lore I never knew existed.  Nice one Going Loud Studios!If you like short simple platformers with a sense of humour then give this a go.There is plenty of fun, and more than a few moments that will stay with me.I highly recommend this game on sale, even if you have to pay $2.50 for it."

Lighthearted and humorous, DLC Quest pokes fun at the ridiculous amounts of DLC in games these days, while also being a solid and enjoyable platformer. I had seriously planned to not like this game because ""yay! Another platformer where you collect coins!"", and based on the graphics I was expecting something like a flash browser game with horrible controls and an unfinished feel. My plans were ruined!You do collect coins, but that's as far as my expectations made it. I found the controls to be tight, with a minimal amount of slide after letting off a key. Any times I missed a jump and fell, I felt it was more my fault than any fault of sloppy controls. The graphics are retro-ish and very fitting for the style and atmosphere of the game. The sound also fits nicely. The satirical finger-pointing at the DLC market, and the humorous comments from the characters, round out a quick and FUN little platform game!OH, I will add that the first time I ran this game, I set a widescreen resolution in the options, and the first character I talked to, I got my first Windows 8 blue screen. I don't know for sure this game was the problem, but the BSOD was ""DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL"" and a quick google search told me this error happens with bad drivers or bad applications.

Buy the full version to access the reviewer's commentary, fully revealing his thoughts on the game!  $59.99.That joke aside, DLC Quest truly is a game which satirizes the practice of games using downloadable content to rake in the Benjamins, so to speak.  Now, if you're wondering, no, this game does not actually use downloadable content in it that requires you to actually pay real life, ""earned from your job"" money.  That would be redundant.No, rather, DLC Quest has you collect in-game coins to purchase DLC that is required to progress in the game.  Some of the ""DLC"" you collect is the ability to walk in a certain direction, and another one goes as far as to require you to buy it if you want to double-jump.  Along your journey to buy them all, you'll encounter several video game references as you stride across this land of imaginary paywalls.  It is a hilarious satire game, but as it stands, if you do not get or like the humor, it is pretty much not worth your money if a satire based on the practices of downloadable content are not up to your liking.But if you are intrigued, great!

I have to be honest; it ticks all the correct boxes.My first impressions were what have a just bought... you cant go left... you have to purchase everything in game (with in game coins) not really money like, but set my thoughts backwards a slight. Until the campain became to unravel.You have to collect the 'ingame' DLC as such to progress deeper into the campain. The tokens are simple to find yet seem ever-lasting-ly hard as you may need numorous attempts to conquor a certain section of the map. If that be in the 'Black and White' section, trying not to SPOIL anyhting here.This game opened a new platform for me as I'd never contemplate on purchase this genre of game. It's fun; addicitive I suppose and I'll grant you to BUY it now whilst it is only £0.65. I'll be honest, one of the reasons I bought this game.I'll try to keep this as short as possible. There are two campains in this game.1) I believe to be the 'tuturial' or 'how to' however has a great additional campain to the fact that you are learning and progressing futher into the gameplay.2) The main campain I think... this is your typical arcade type game therefore the sarcasm and surprise element is hidden away with invisible walls you can plunder through to the vast collection of coins and DLC collections. In my first go at completing the campain and only go before writing this review I collected a respectable 879 out of a possible 889. Not bad I suppose.I really hope the Dev working on DLC Quest bring out another real 'DLC' as the campain could be that tid longer. But overall this game is fun and one to think about purchasing. Epc when you are bored of playing endless ours on your other games you can step a side and play endless hours on beating your personal bests on DLC Quest."

You have to buy DLC to do literally everything in this game, including walking left. This said, the DLC purchasing is what gives it its charm. It is made to mock all these other free-to-play games that, under the technicality of the term, are free to play, but cannot be played effectively without buying some DLC starter pack. Of course, in this game, you don't actually have to use real money to purchase any of the DLC. The currency you use is the in-game coins, so all you will pay for the game is the initial purchase price. It even comes with a DLC Expansion of the story: Live Freemium or DIE!.

It's a new interesting kind of gameplay because its not all about combat but more about exploring the enviroment and the people in it. The NPCs are funny and there are lots of easter eggs and references to other games. It's about how games today use DLC for everything, so in the beginning of the game you have no sound or pause menu, you can just move left and collect coins. Soon you use these coins to ""buy"" the DLC like movement, music, clothing, etc. and the game evolves as you play it because of this. i'd say buy it whenever you can if you're looking for something quick and fun because it's funny, short, and easy"

You can always change this through the settings menu though. My Xbox 360 controller also worked well, and I would recommend using it over the keyboard, since you get the added comfort, and you don't lose any precision or actions since there's only two controls besides movement anyway.Story:This game doesn't really have much story, but at the same time, it's not really necessary, as the main pointof the game is to be satire against companies like EA, Activision, and pretty much every AAA publisher for their ridiculous amounts of DLC. The little story it does have is quite hilarious (as again the game is satire), and it's worth the $2.99 fir the humor.Final Thoughts:This game is a short satire game, making fun of a huge problem in the AAA game industry, and for it's small price tag, it's entirely worth the purchase, especially if it's on sale."

,Recommended,230050,11487260,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,viad,"DLC Quest is a satire of recent trends in the video game industry (based on the game's release) where companies are forcing more and more DLC and microtransactions on the players. Thus, this game is based more on its message and theme rather than giving a solid gameplay experience with story and impresssive design.This game takes a somewhat retro graphical style mixed with a typical fantasy theme. The music is made up of chiptune tracks to fit in with the retro visuals. The story is as simple as saving a princess or saving a village from a bad guy, which are commonly seen in other games that aren't parodic in nature. These things though are the not very important parts to be looking for in this game. They get the job done by looking good enough from a technical standpoint to drive the game, since these three things are parodies of commonly seen styles and tropes in other games.Even though this game is a parody and satire of video games, there is some actual gameplay to be had. The player runs and jumps to collect coins and somethimes kill things in this platformer game. To unlock new ""features"", the player needs to spend their coins on DLC and microtransactions, somewhat mirroring the real world with exaggerations. The gameplay ranges from easy in the first episode to a sightly more difficult, but not hard difficulty in the second episode.Does the game satirize the video game industry well? It does do so in a blunt, exaggerated manner which ends up being silly game expansions the player has to buy. If the game isn't poking fun at video game companies, it then has parodies of games, ranging from making fun of certain game genre conventions to referencing specific video games. Not all the humor will leave people laughing out loud, but it should give a small laugh or chuckle for the things DLC Quest parodies.DLC Quest should be taken as a game with a message, and it does bring some silliness when it comes to parodying the games industry. This game is definitely short, easy, and low priced, which should give a decent amount of time for the money. With a satirical and comical approach to DLC and microtransactions, this game is great for the humor along with decent platforming collectathon gameplay on the side."

,Not Recommended,230050,14602204,"Posted: 22 February, 2015",all,Wrath,"I've thought about this for significantly longer than this game deserves and have come up with a couple of conclusions on what I think of it.You're just not going to get Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in the 21st century, certainly not some type of work that makes people reevaluate what they're doing, what they're giving, and what they're getting in return. So a satirical game like this with seemingly good intentions, created to poke fun at a poor industry practice is likely the only way to make a strong political statement, at least one that gets any attention. The fact that DLC Quest came from Greenlight makes it all the better.However, I'm not recommending this game for several reasons.  The primary reason is that it's just not very good. Gameplay is very Super Mario Bros: Sidescroller, very rudimentary exploration, spend most of your time collecting coins, there's something about a princess. Part of the impact of the satire is more or less aimed at this similarity. There's an unspoken message that says, essentially, ""imagine this is the late 80s, early 90s and you can't even have sound because Mario was made by Ubisoft"". That's an amusing concept on paper and an arguably effective way to make your statement, but it's not all that enjoyable to experience.Quests in this game have to live within that Mario framework, balance simplicity, but also try to tell a basic story that further supports the dev's point. The result is endless hide and seek coin collecting and busywork tasks that prolong the time you have to play the game and delay the hour you'll put it down. Yeah, that's basically what all quests in all games do, but they're typically more interesting an involved than ""travel to the other side of the map and press E. Travel to the other side of the map again and press E."" When the top two rarest achievements in the game are ""do the entire thing again - but faster!"", you get an idea of what you're getting into. Ultimately, there are two ends you can reach with this playstyle. The first is that the dev doesn't know what quests are or how to make enjoyable ""meat and potatoes"" content for a game (which is likely), or the dev is making a larger statement that 90% of real life is collecting coins and busy work (which is naïve - look, I have time to both play this gameandcriticize it! :P).One other reason that I'm not much of a fan of it is that this is marketed as a full-fledged video game. In 1985, if it wasn't a satire game and had different theming altogether, it would still be decidedly short on content. You can finish this in two to three hours. Today, it's easy to make a game of this quality and spam them out on the internet. This is how Miniclip and other flash game websites are alive.Now, with that in mind, I'm going to list some of the top-rated reviews for this game:""You can buy more DLC than Borderlands 2 has. 10/10"" - Hammercorps""Download the Review DLC to access this review."" -GmCity""Had to spend extra to pause the game. 10/10"" - Fatal'z NutzThat's it. Those aren’t snippets, those are the full reviews. Indicated by the fact that these, among others,aretop reviews, the basic atmosphere of DLC Quest feedback is basically ""I agree with this game's premise"" and ""Gosh, I don't know, I just like it"". This is actually not far removed from how DLC, itself, is marketable. Notwithstanding publishers that pride themselves on actual expansions to a game, which introduces 30-50% of the initial content they originally didn't intent on developing, let's take more rampant publishers as an example.Let's take a game like Crusader Kings II, published by Paradox Interactive, which is a lovely game by the way, although it suffers from rampant DLC release. As of February 2015, there are 52 DLC items which includes four major additions, two ebooks (of all things) seven music additions, and 39 glorified reskins of ruler clothes or soldier uniforms. Why do people purchase these things? Basically, for the same reason behind the reviews for DLC Quest. They agree with the premise of the original game...plus a healthy mix of ""I just feel empty inside without it"".So really, by marketing a flash game as a full fledged video game, at a DLC price, with a satirical premise, Going Loud has actually (rather impressively) created a game that functions as DLC normally would. As a result, they've published very little content, but to an extraordinary amount of profit."

There are secrets in the game such as places where you can walk through the wall and gain extra coins. There is also a selection of achievements that enhance the game by adding objectives. Overall it was worth the few dollars I spent on it: a simple platformer with a twist. The one problem I had is that it's extremely short; I was lucky to even get a few hours in it, as most playthroughs seem to take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. It's short but sweet."

,Recommended,230050,18303310,"Posted: 3 October, 2015",all,Foxysen,"DLC Quest is a short parody platformer game released in 2011 on both PC and Xbox 360 service, made by Going Loud Studios. It would then get an expansion pack ""Live Freemium or Die"" in 2013 for both platforms. Which was free for PC, but sold on Xbox 360, probably because of Microsoft policy. Because you know, they dislike hosting free stuff on their servers, as you heard being the reason why Valve wasn't updating Team Fortress 2 for Xbox 360. Anyway, I think that this also came to Steam only in 2013 as well. Yep, expansion pack / sequel included, no worries.And well, as you see, it's a simple platformer, that parodies everything DLC and modern. And you have to purchase DLC through in-game money in in-game shop, which after a while may start to look no different from what you do in normal games. Hm, maybe it could be more funny if they actually sold DLC as DLC for the game for extremely low-low price of one cent or such? But nah.You know how it goes with most joke games: people say 10/10 for the premise but others start to hate them by the time they beat them. Such joke games must know boundaries and know when to end, as well as trying not to enrage people too much. Thankfully, DLC Quest knows them and ends when it should. It does seem short, but at least it kept fresh enough until the end and was enjoyable.Not to mentioning that game is enjoyable by itself for a very short time that it playes. You just explore small map, find some curious stuff, collect money, platforming is responsible and easy. Original DLC Quest campaign doesn't allow you to die and is shortest. Live Freemium and Die adds some challenge to keep players enganged after original, mostly by adding spikes that will kill and send you back to checkpoint. But they are still pleasent and nothing compared to flood of indie ""hard platformers for sake of hard"".So yea, game looks pretty enough with some 8-bit-like music that is enjoyable and doesn't try to do a horrible joke. It also makes you question many life-important things. Like, why Season Pass is called Season Pass? No, seriously. Or how much developers went insane with tiny DLCes. Even though you all probably just wait until game goes on huge sale where you buy bundle with all DLCs for dirt cheap anyway.But yes, it doesn't overstay the welcome and has enjoyable simple platforming, so you can spend a hour or two on it. Unless you try to do two hidden hardcore speedrun achievements or try to beat scores.Just try to get it while it's on sale. Not because game costs too much. Doesn't matter what discount. You just should be able to tell yourself that you got it during your crazy Steam sales impulses. Instead of asking yourself why you went so low into rabbit hole that you are fully purchasing joke games based on their premise and give them 10/10, while you could get some better proper game instead.AND HEY, ZOMBIE DLC!"

It's so infuriatingly pleased with itself that I found myself looking for a DLC that would remove all of the words from the game, and also reach through the Internet and backhand the writer for actually trying to sell the hackneyed tripe I kept being forced to read. I came to dread every new line of dialogue with the insipid NPCs, mashing the ""Get Through This Stupid Conversation"" button in the hopes that it would turn out to be story related and I could move forward. And then, of course, I'd hit it one too many times, and the conversation would start over again. Argh.The game, at one point, has a character that speaks entirely in old, unfunny memes. One of the ""DLC packs"" you are allowed to ""buy"" kills this character, and doing so is supposed to be some mixture of funny and cathartic. Then, the end boss casually tosses out that tired oldDark Knight Rises""you merely adopted the whatever, I was born in it"" meme.It acknowledges that referential humour is not funny, AND THEN KEEPS DOING IT ANYWAY.Music is alright though."

DLC Quest is a one-joke game, but it's a funny joke and it fortunately knows when to let it go. It succeeds where other similar satires fail (I'm looking at you, 2004 Bard's Tale!) because rather than drag on and on trying to milk that single joke into a full-length game, DLC Quest is - wisely - a very short experience As in, less than an hour long to get to the end. As such, it is barely worth it's price, especially since the gameplay is that of an uninspired platformer. Still, it's rare that a game gets me to crack an honest smile so even if it does seem a bit overpriced, I'll forgive it because it actually was funny."

It has a sense of humor, and the platforming is decent, but that's about all I can say for it. By far the biggest problem with the game is there isn't much game here. The standard story can be beaten in under an hour easy, and the following level a similar amount. There isn't all that much DLC either. There's the basic movements, and pauses, etc. but it never reaches it's potential. (SPOILER) It has 2 endings, which are surprisingly funny as well.All in all, it's a humorous platformer that get's the job done, but it held back by it's lack of content and replayability. It's a lot like the bargain bin comedy at your local blockbuster (or wherever you get your movies).

The kind of 'humor' that can sometimes sound more like a sarcastic rant. An NPC saying stuff like ""I'm a filler NPC. I have no purpose."" isn't really funny. Those things make the game look more like an interactive critical essay.The gameplay logic is more interesting, because it depicts the design flaw of the illusion of choice in an extremely streamlined progression well.The music is not bad.So the game itself is mediocre at best AND it is so short that after having bought it for 1 EUR, which is 67% off, I feel that's a bit too much.It has two 'campaigns'. (Not sure whether that was originally the case.) The first one I played through in a bit less than an hour. The second one in 1.2 hours, not with all achievements though.Some times I came up with better dialogues while playing because they leave so much to be desired.

Full disclosure: it has been some time since I've played my copy, and there may be some things I'm misremembering or skipping altogether.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

Indeed, the ""humor"" in it much resembles the comedian they put in the game to make fun of people making obvious jokes or gaming references.The ""DLC"" in the game didn't feel like DLC, and buying it didn't feel like buying DLC. On the whole, I felt like the game completely missed the mark, and indeed, most of the ""DLC"" in the game didn't even feel like DLC in the first place.I would love to say the game was one-note but it was really more zero-note; no matter how cheap it is, it isn't worth your time. Even if it was free, it still wouldn't be worth getting.And I say that even knowing that the game is only two hours long. It isn't even worth that much of your time."

Yes...  The game is just as bland as that statement.  There isn't any way to die, so it is strictly all about exploring.  The size of the game is incredibly small, so you'll be done with your first play through in about two hours.  The three things that some might find appealing is the humor (boring), the easy achievements to get (for achievement hunters), and the speed run competition.  This game is so dang easy that anyone can participate in a speed run.  Even if you don't make the fastest time, you can still land yourself on the board without much challenge.  All in all, it simply lacks in every part of what makes a game challenging, but it isn't completely broken.  I didn't care much for it."

In the end though, you are still doing Frick'in fetch quests.  That's like explaining to your friend that doing crystal meth isn't good, by doing crystal meth yourself and showing him disastrous results.Some of the ""DLC"" aren't humourous but just plain annoying.

From moving left to animations to jump and so on. The problem is, there really is no ""and so on"", it's an extremely short game and you can feel the creators have run out of ideas very quickly into the game. It doesn't take an hour to complete everything in the game - if at this point we can even call it that. Now, it is possible that this is only a segue into the next episode (undoubtedly coming as a DLC), but while I really applaud the developers for putting in the effort to create a game and hope they will continue to work on games in the future, at the same time I can't recommend it because when it comes to DLC Quest, they didn't really put in all the effort needed to create a game."
,Recommended,230050,1547311,"Posted: 27 July, 2013",all,noibn,"DLC Quest is a short game whose raison-d'etre is to satirize all the DLC practices you love to hate, along with a variety of other negative aspects of today's gaming world. The game features two main quests - the original DLC Quest, and a ""sequel"" titled ""Live Freemium or Die"". Each quest clocks in at around 1 hour or so (assuming you complete them at or near 100%). Gameplay is typical 2D platformer style. All you do is run around, jumping and collecting coins, which are then used to purchase ""DLC"" (missing game features that, when reinstated, allow you to continue progressing). You basically just repeat that cycle for an hour and you're done. The game itself is really easy, so this isn't really something you'll want to play for a challenge. Rather, it's all about the humor and satire. So how is it in those terms? Pretty decent, actually. Some of the writing is a tad heavy-handed, especially near the beginning, but overall I found it to be pretty well done, and even laugh-out-loud funny at times (well, maybe more like 'chuckle-out loud')... anyways, I guess my point is that the game got right what it needed to get right. It's hardly a challenge as a game, but the 2 hours spent playing does provide some interesting moments that you probably won't find anywhere else. If you're up for an experimental experience, and don't mind taking a chance at the low price tag, I say go for it. Just don't buy it expecting anything more than an interactive satire/spoof."

I had thought this would have been a charming platformer with decent satirical (if that word exists in this world) humor. What I have experienced was a very very average flash game in return that I took my time, AND completed in 40 minutes, a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor value for its base 2.99. Let's put it this way, I can buy a bottle water in my area for about what this game costs on a sale. I would rather have someone take that water from me, splash it over my face, and beat the hell out of me than play this game as it has no value whatsoever. I'm recommending this game because when you need to have explosive direahea, this game will help push it out."

I'd seen videos of it on the Internet, heard stuff on forums, one of my friends praised this game for the message on the Gaming Industry Marketing. So, I bought it, gave it a go, and beat it in a solid hour... This was a pretty shallow game, to be honest.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it when a game presents a message to people, especially one warning people of the dangers of such an issue, but when it is practically shoved down our throats how bad it is, the message looses its purpose and just becomes... there.DLC Quest sounds good in concept, a satire on Gaming Marketing during the time this was an issue, but it falls flat almost immediately from the get go. The humor is incredibly short-lived and not at all very funny, the game itself is incredibly short, it all comes down to it being a basic collect-a-thon platformer game, and wasn't all that fun throughout my entire playthrough.That is, I'm still not saying it's a bad game, but neither is it a good game. Just one that... missed a few patches and isn't doing well in the box office. So, I'm neither recommending or condemning this game, just stating that it could be better, but it definitely could be worse."

The developers may have thought that adding two campaigns would make the game seem longer and more packed with content, but unfortunately they didn't account for the fact that both campaigns are just uncomfortably short. Most of the ""DLC"" does little to nothing, and even when you get it all it seems as if the game has barely changed. They tried to make a comedy game, but the jokes aren't funny. They tried to make an adventure game, but there's not much to explore. Even on sale, I wouldn't reccommend buying this game at all."

Normally, I'm not a big fan of platformers, nor retro ones at that unless it has something enticing to it (a tie to another series, perhaps), but at the low price tag, I decided to try it out. Basically, this is a standard platformer with a satirical twist; You have to purchase DLC (in game, with in game currency) to proceed or do most of the actions of the game. Now sure this is funny at first, but after going back and forth to collect coins to buy DLC to progess (you need like 3-4 of them to ""win"") in a ""story"" that would otherwise take 2-3 minutes is more annoying than funny after a few minutes. There are a few little chuckles to be found with some of the NPC dialouge, but nothing to go out of your way to find. This game should take you no more than 30-45 minutes to complete (perhaps multiple times) and most likely 100% it, and even that is probably more than a generous estimation. There are two game modes, but I was offput enough from the first to forgo the second.  Unless you really really really enjoy platformers or you need an excuse to waste $2 and 30 minutes, I'm going to say stay clear. 3/10"

If the initial price is right when you want to get all achievements (considering 1€ for 1h), and even if it's said to be satirical, it doesn't goes really far enough for me.I'll start with the number of DLCs... 30 DLCs in two stories when ""What happens when DLC practices go too far?"" is the base, I think it's possible to humongously increase this ammount and making it really mocking. Movement pack could have been at least 2 different pack, one for turning your hero, one for jumping, and even add multiple jump upgrades and speed packs. Also, colors pack like ""Red pack"", ""Blue pack"" and ""Green pack"", and even add ""8-bit pack"", ""16-bit pack"", etc. . It could annoy the most basic player, but when going satirical, it must be 100%, and I find this game only half-ässed and deceiving on this point.Gameplay is quite blank. A simple platformer, where your ""weapons"" are only tools... I'm sorry to say that when I get a sword, I expect at least a minimum ammount of fighting, but it seems the sword is better for gardening... Even the boss fight of ""Live freemium or die"" is lame, there's spots where the boss can't touch. Even if buying your weapon from the boss to defeat him seems okay, it would have been more funny to buy a ""Toss coin pack"" before battle, throw some bucks... something more funny than the expected sword ending.2 hours when writing this review, used one single guide to find the ""cheat code"", only the two time achievements missing and I won't go for these. I expected something more difficult, funny and satirical than this."

You essentially take a journey through the slow progression of downloadable content practices. Obviously some of them are a little over dramatic (like needing to purchase DLC in order to pause the game), but some things are pretty common in today's gaming (such as the free DLC second quest ""DLC"" in which you purchase a day one patch to increase slow loading times). As a cheap game this is pretty fun, but I wouldn't go into it expecting a lengthy experience. You can knock off both quests fairly quickly even if you don't know what you're doing.

You essentially play a hero on a quest to collect coins to purchase in-game DLC, ranging from character animations to ad-removals. The story is goofy, but with a meaningful message underneath. Personally I found the humor in the game rather entertaining, a lot of nerd references are used in the game, so some jokes my go over people's head.Be warned that the game is very short and most people will probably beat it in a single sitting, maybe two. Took me about 1 and half hours to get through both campaigns, but it can be done even faster for an achievement.

DLC Quest does this by making you pay for the most miniscule of things like having an animation for walking or a pause screen ect. Don't worry you're not going to have to open your wallet and hand over money to the game to do all this. You use coins that you find easliy in game by walking over them so no real money required. The gameplay is also pretty good though their is not much to be said about it it's a side scroller like so many others not bad or good just average. Its not very innovative but not that that it has to be the humor carries it on it's own, so gameplay is not the focal point of the game. Story wise though its just your average typical, bad guy captures princess you must save her. Which makes it a very generic and over done story. I would have liked to see more of a funny backstory or something like that. It's a fun game with good  gameplay funny humor not to good of a story but one thing i have to give them a great deal of credit for is the developers way of making fun of the fat cat video game componies that like to screw you over.

What little it does have to offer are boring and simple obersavtions in the gaming industry that any one could have told you for free. The gameplay is as basic and uninspired as its sense of humor, bringing nothing new to the platforming genre. Both campaigns are at their core, the exact same game, but with a new skin.A game is not absolved of having bad design just because it critizes other games for having bad design. Just because the game presents a generic 'captured-princess' story while saying, ""isn't this generic?"" doesn't make it excusable. Its laziness, and makes the game appear to be as bad of a timely cash-grab as the DLC it wants to comment on.As a platformer, it fails to entertain. As a time-piece, it fails to provoke thought. With all that considered, what could this game have to offer? Nothing. A good example of the poor ""what did you expect from a $3 indie game?"" excuse."

I plan to attempt the last two but I've never been good at Speed run Acheivements. I most likely could have beaten both stories quicker but I decided to play it at work and thus was unable dedicate my full attention to the gameThat said, with a price tag of $3.29 CAD (Cheaper if you wait for a sale) that doesn't factor too much into my feelings on the game. I've played plenty of short games that were worth the price so the real question here is, was DLC Quest worth what I paid for it?This game is easy, it's short, the graphics are ok, the controls are simple, the story is almost non-existant and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Its a good way to burn away an hour and unless your looking for something with some real depth it's almost worth an hour or two of your life.Is it worth the $3.29 CAD? I like to say maybe. There is no ""On the Fence"" option for review writting but currently I'm on the fence with this one. I was entertained by this title and I dare say I may revisit it at another time and the game didn't cost enough for me to demand more but it wasn't so cheap that I feel totally satifyed with it either. Normally I like a little more bang for my buck but sometimes I don't mind settling for something a little less, as long as it entertains me for an hour or two."

Unfortunately, the end result is the same for most perspectives for this game: It's a parody of business practices nickel and diming their consumer base in order to rake in more profit. While understandable from a business perspective, its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business move in my opinion. I'm not gonna argue business when I don't have a college education and Ph.D in business, macro/microeconomics, or a weird combination of both, so I'll just keep it at that. These perspectives still stick today, unfortunately, but it's gotten a little better.That said, the game is fairly linear, not much plot, humor is dated but still earns a chuckle.

It definitely paints a grim picture of what we might see in games that are microtransaction based in the future. This game is more of an intellectual game and less of a game you'd play for fun, as the gameplay is pretty tedious. This is intentional design to drive home what the average DLC/Microtransaction ridden game is like, often times they dont add any real new content but just adds to the grind. For instance, there's one DLC pack you purchase to use a grindstone at 1000x capacity. So either you hit the X button a few times or thousands if you dont buy it.I dont recommend this for people that just want a simple and fun platformer, I recommend it for people that want to be aware of what some game companies may actually do in the industry in the future."

While it is a short game (complete with speedrun achievements), it packs a fair amount of platforming fun into its two short campaigns, DLC Quest and Life Freemium or Die. In both, you must (eventually with the requisite DLC) jump and explore the nooks and cranies of the world to find coins to purchase DLC. There is a bit of Metroidvania imbedded here and it displays it proudly with its solid platforming mechanics.There is a light story to each of the main quests: in one you must save Princess Macguffin from Bad Guy, and in the sequel you must save the villagers from a rampaging monster. Really, they're both flimsy and funny excuses for you to run around and collect coins for DLC.  Combat does not exist aside from a few sequences, and death only visits your character upon touching spiked pit traps. While Super Meat Boy it is not, the platforming is challenging enough for die hard completionists and speedrunners to enjoy.The game doesn't have much lasting appeal unless you want to hunt down every missing coin or you have a burning desire to tackle the speed runs. That said, for its low price,  DLC Quest will offer a fun look at what happens when DLC goes too far."

Not a big deal, but something worth thinking about if you're someone whom hunts achievements.Overall, I would highly recommend this game if you're looking for a game to play to kill time or get a quick laugh.I picked it up during Steam Summer Sale for $0.75 and do not regret it, at all.I would give this game a 7 out of 10 for the sake of a quick play and humor.Pros :- Funny storyline- Amazing attack on all games that ""live"" around DLC- Quick and fun- Pick up and go, kind of gameCons :- Too short of a storyline.

There are also DLC packs that simply add stupid things to the game, like putting all the NPCs in bikinis. The controls are tight and accurate, and you can play with either the keyboard or a controller. I used my Xbox 360 controller,  since I prefer to play platformers with it, and it proved to be very comfortable since the game doesn't use very many buttons and using the control stick for movement felt more natural.The game is split into two parts. The first part is a very simple, basic adventure with barely any challenge at all. It is exclusively a vehicle in which to carry the game's cutting satire about the games industry. The second part, ""Live Freemium or Die"", is an expanded adventure that offers more challenge (though not much), more jokes and more DLC packs, along with some NPC characters based on famous personalities in the gaming world. This second section is excellent; it makes the already amusing game much more interesting while maintaining the high quality of the writing and humour.How does it look?DLC Quest uses simple 8-bit pixel art style graphics with a straightforward background. The art style is charming and, because of its simplicity, it runs very smoothly with no slowdown to speak of. You could probably play this on an Apple Macbook with no trouble at all (I used to play on Macbook, so I know the pain...).How does it sound?The music in this game is actually pretty good. There are different themes depending on which zone you are in, as you might expect, and the sound effects are very much in vein of classic NES and SNES games.Long story shortDLC Quest is a very unique and entertaining little game. It's both a solid platforming adventure and a piece of satire greater than any Youtube pap. It's very short (I finished both stories in less than two hours), which may put off some so-called ""core"" gamers, but the injokes around every corner kept me smiling and laughing all the way. For the satire alone this game is worth the price. And it's a very good price: DLC Quest is going for £1.99 (or your regional equivalent) right now. I think that's a steal for a game this good.Good PointsCutting satire and spot-on writingGameplay is solid and enjoyableCharming art styleGood musicBad PointsVery shortHardly challenging at allRedWolf Rating: 7/10 - Good"

The game itself is very enjoyable for the most part and can be challenging in the right way. The game satires many video game tropes from NPC's to fetch quests. I found references to Mass Effect, Plants vs Zombies, and even what i assumed to be a Limbo reference. Unfortunately however, the game is perhaps a little on the short side, but I still felt comfortable with the quality of the game for the price.The DLC itself is used effectively throughout the game and as meanial as it may be, I always laughed when I had to buy something like audio or moving to the left. The insight into some of the DLC practices is clever and I had EA in the back of my mind while I was playing.If you enjoy humour then you will love this game. I tip my hat to you 'Going Loud'."

You were supposed to assume that ""With that said..."" would finish with ""go buy this game now!"" and you were supposed to have went to purchase it.  Instead of doing that, you decided to simply waste precious seconds, or minutes if you are not a native English speaker and you are taking your time to read this or you are copying and pasting this into a translator and using a dictionary for every 5th word including dictionary and still clueless on what ""5th"" is because its not in the dictionary, reading this instead of downloading it and playing it and enjoying its satirical concepts and small hints and jokes at various movies and games including, but not limited to, the bad translation of somebody that very poorly translated a line into English. Does, ""All your base are belong to me,"" sound familiar? Exactly, I just spoiled that one. I should have added a spoiler alert to that. That would have been silly to add a spoiler alert though because you shouldn't even still be reading this. You should be about 10 minutes into the game, or just starting it for all those non-English people having troubles reading this. Maybe I should just plug this into a translator for another language. But what language should I do?Divertido, divertido, y $0.75 hasta el 2 de septiembre. Dicho esto... Esperar, ¿por qué estás leyendo esto. Lo que debía suponer que ""Con que dijo..."" iba a rematar con ""ir a comprar este juego ahora!"" y que se suponía que se iba a comprar. En lugar de ello, usted se ha decidido a no perder valiosos segundos, o minutos si usted no es un hablante nativo de inglés y está tomando su tiempo para leer esto o copiar y pegar esto en un traductor y con ayuda de un diccionario por cada 5 palabras como diccionario y todavía no tenia ni idea de lo que se está "" 5a"" es porque no está en el diccionario, la lectura de esta en lugar de descargarlo y jugar a lo satírico y disfrutar de sus conceptos y los pequeños trucos y bromas en diversas películas y juegos incluyendo, pero no limitado a, la mala traducción de alguien que muy mal traducido una línea en inglés. No, ""Todos son su base pertenece a mí"", suena familiar? Exactamente, simplemente nulas. Yo debería haber añadido un spoiler alert. Que habría sido absurdo para añadir un spoiler alert porque usted no debe incluso estar leyendo esto. Usted debe ser de alrededor de 10 minutos en el juego, o simplemente a partir de todos los ingleses que tienen problemas leyendo esto. Tal vez me conecte este en un traductor de otro idioma. Pero, ¿qué idioma debo hacer?If you haven't figured it out, I chose to do my translation in Spanish. I am fluent in Spanish and was able to just read my English version and reiterate it into Spanish no problem. Actually, I'm joking. I only know basic Spanish from high school. I wish my school had offered Japanese. That would have been so much cooler. In fact, I used an online translator to change that to Spanish so chances are that it isnt even 100% correct. If you would like to spend more time here and not playing, go right ahead and check my translation, but I already told you it probably isnt right so don't go getting all weird on me because it may be off in some parts. If you have gotten this far though and you are starting to get mad at me for wasting your precious game time, (honestly, you could have beaten DLC Quest by now, what a pity) consider the fact that I am typing this recommendation for you and the only reason I'm still typing is because you won't stop reading.

I has minimal replay value unless you're achievment mining (you can get all of the achievments in one runthrough with a little care), but it was a worthwhile evening playing it. Overall the idea is that the gameplay is hampered, and even stopped, unless you purchase DLC. The DLC is all bought with in-game currency and is clearly there to make fun of the current state of the gaming inductry. I had more fun laughing about the DLC than I did with the mechanics. The mechanics are solid and you can find them several other quality platformers (after you get the DLC).I would recommend getting this during a sale due to the lack of replay value, but if you're willing to spend money to go to the movies, but don't have anyone to go with you at the moment then this might be a qualtiy investment - and will probably be more memorable than the movie you're eyeballing with the same time investment."

Actually, not even that long sadly.Its always nice to see a game delivering social commentary, but the main game was so incredibly easy that it felt pandering (I've yet to play the second part). And I'm not even into platformers all that much, I'd feel sorry for an SMB fan that stumbled on this. The difficulty isn't the purpose of the game I guess, but at the same time its pointless to satirise one aspect of the development process if by doing so you damage a different aspect. A good example is the second ending, a prime opportunity for a boss fight, what should be the epitome of the game, and yeah, it sucked. I restarted the game for a short, pretty lousy, cutscene. Yay. Maybe this was an artistic decision, maybe I was supposed to be let down by the second ending DLC. Well, in reality I was let down by the game itself.I suppose I come off as a harsh critic; I did genuinely, briefly, enjoy the game and appreciated what it set out to accomplish.

For me, I enjoyed it, I don't like DLC for most games (most). Plus, the other jokes they threw in the game had me smiling along the way. The game mechanics were simple and easy to follow; get the coins, buy 'DLC' rinse and repeat. This would usually irk me, as that seems boring, but the DLC you 'buy' has an effect on your abilities e.g. double-jump, or the areas.

If you disaggre with whole DLC crap, just like myself, this game is for you!There is really nothing to say about this piece, since it's basically a cynnical joke on all those ♥♥♥♥ing corporations. You buy stuff, which gives you the ability to play. Almost like modern titles. It's far-fetched and silly, but kind of true. Kind of because some games have great DLC's which adds hours into the gameplay. Not just an ability to walk left (yea, it's in).Graphics, gameplay and sound are all really basic (if not rough, game was made by one man) so if you like minimalism, there will be some eye candies for you.For laugh and for easy game perfection, also just to see how ridiculously painfull game market is, buy this game and after whole playthrou think for a second about that.

Want animations? Do you want to jump up those blocks? Then you got to pay gold (money earned in-game) and that’s how the game works. You control your character going around the game collecting gold to buy new DLC so you are able to make progress. Most of the DLCs you buy are pretty funny and if you have ever had problems with DLC, heard or read of the controversies it has spawned then you are in for a laugh. Other than that there is nothing more to it. You jump around, collect coins and use a small sword for mostly cutting grass.The game has two campaigns, the original which is “DLC Quest” which I recommend the most because it’s short and is the most fun out of the two in my opinion.  The second is “Live Freemium or Die” is kind of like the sequel to the first game and it’s more of the same fun DLC missions (It extends the story, many more missions and stuff to do). I had a hard time going through it though mostly because I got stuck a few times and because you have to do more Platforming which is not that fun in this game to begin with. If you laughed through the first campaign like me you will probably go through it at least once but it was too long and trying to be too serious for its own good. I play a game for it's good gameplay and it's not something that DLC quest has. Id say play it if you want a few laughs but not if you want a good gameplay experience."

,Recommended,230050,8385314,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,Grey Area,"A bite-sized chunk of satire, DLC Quest will make you laugh, question the state of the industry... and then cry a bit (in that order).The author pokes fun at most of today's trends in a very thoughtful and engaging way - from filler NPCs to ""necessary"" zombies, nothing is left untouched! Of course, as the title implies, the main focus is acquiring DLCs - this is accomplished by platforming and obtaining coins, then visiting the friendly shopkeeper. Everything from background music to the character animations is initially locked, so you have to work a bit before everything falls into place and you can finally start advancing the ""story"". Luckily, the progression is perfect and the platforming decent, with a nostalgic, retro feel. Controls feel responsive, the secrets are abundant, but keep in mind the platforming is just a means to an end. So, don't expect to be challenged, that's not the point.The game is split up in two parts (the second story was created after launch and is bundled for free and accessible from the main menu):- The originalDLC Questwhich tackles the subject of the landslides of DLCs made available for modern games, the morality of the practice and how we, as both gamers and game protagonists deal with the trend;- A sort of expansion,Live Freemium or Diethat continues the story and deals with other, current industry trends like day one patches, sub-par optimization and so on.Both of these are treated in a satirical manner and placed on an overaching storyline that left me, at least, chuckling.Throughout the game there isn't one moment where the 4th wall is left standing or when the game takes itself seriously (even the achievements and trading cards reflect that). Adding to the absurdity and humor are the NPCs you encounter and the situations you are forced into, all of them tropes from modern gaming trends, executed flawlessly. You fill find yourself saying ""I see what you did there!"" and having a laugh more often than not. If you're into game design, DLC Quest makes for a perfect dissection piece - it's fun and easy to understand how, why and when each mechanic is introduced, the map design, the intended game progression and so on.Overall, it's a funny, entertaining ride; a discourse on the modern gaming industry, a mirror for both it and ourselves to look into.Saying more or going into detail would spoil the experience, so you own it to yourself to try it out. Even though there's not much replay value it doesn't overstay its welcome, nor recycle its ideas - each DLC, NPC, line of dialogue or encounter reflects something very specific and it's up to you to recognize and understand what... and why. It will give as much as you are willing to put into it.The fact that it approaches a mature and so-close-to-home subject in such a hilarious way, all the while sparking dialogue and introspection is worth the entry price alone."

A lot of that is going back and forth across the map between the next trigger and the nearest shopkeeper so you can buy the next DLC that suddenly becomes available to advance the story.On the bright side, the whole game isn't long enough for the back-and-forth to really become grating.  The game itself isn't exactly difficult either; the only boss battle in the entire game is nearly impossible to fail, and you can't even die until part 2.  The point of the game is not to be challenging, but to tell a few jokes and mock DLC-laden AAA games (andone indie developer).  In that sense it feels like it would be more at home on Kongregate than on XBLIG or Steam.All in all, worth about a dollar.  Get it when it's on sale."

It’s a short title, with a full 100% play through for me clocking in at about 3 hours, but still worth the price of admission. It’s has some finely crafted dialogue and references to at least one of every game that someone, somewhere will get no matter what it is they’ve played, and isn’t afraid to make fun of some other questionable games. However, sadly, the gameplay is very dull and linear, and not very challenging to say the least, albeit probably intentional for the type of game that this is. It’s a good ride for the price, but holds no replay value for me at all. I’d recommend this if you want a good laugh, and some entertaining moments, or if you’re a fan of Evoland."

Even so, with this game I was done in under an hour, and the novelty wore off after half that time.  It's an interesting concept, but the game is just too short to be anything but a demo.  Some games are short but intense (Sands of Time, Portal 1), but this game just isn't engaging enough to be finished so quickly.The concept is sort of clever, but even that I'm not in love with.  Maybe a broader ""what's wrong with the video game industry"" game would be better, but this was just basically ""DLC is evil"", which just doesn't have enough material to make into a whole game.For $1 this is a fair deal (even then I'm on the fence), but the base price of $3 is a lot to ask for less than an hour of entertainment."

DLC as a concept deserves to suffer a painful death, or at the very least be changed into actual free updates. Alternatively, price the games from the start with the assumption that the game is indeed still unfinished. DLC is exactly the reason why I'm waiting possibly for years until I purchase games from -80% bundle sales, after they've released ALL the content. If no sales or bundles, then no purchases, either. Unfortunately, this also affects developers who don't take advantage of the DLC money grabbing.This game was from a -75% sale (0,74€), as well, which is quite a good price for this. Might have even paid 1,50€. But do note: while the idea is great, the game is indeed short. Then again, as a satire game, it doesn't need to be any longer. It has achieved in relaying its message.Also, the gamepad controls are tight and accurate. Very enjoyable to play."

,Recommended,230050,33295057,Posted: 5 July,all,Sorceror Nobody,"This game is an amusing romp through the world of DLC gone rogue, and it's quite enjoyable. It pokes fun at all the tropes you'd expect, and does it quite well. For a couple of quid, it's a decent game, and for that reason, I recommend it.There is a but, though. It does its thing quite well,but, perhaps too well, as I'll explain in a second. The first campaign, plain old DLC Quest, is fine. You can finish it in 30-40 minutes without overly rushing, and it's enjoyable for that time. But let me tell you a tale of Live Freemium or Die. That turned into, for me, an hour long play session that remained funny, but stopped being fun. The primary issue is that the second campaign plays on the Fetch Quest trope a little too well, and starts to run the joke into the ground pretty quickly. It's making a point, and I get that, but I'm sure there must have been a way to make that point without making the game quite such a tedious pain in the backtracking butt.The tl;dr of this review is that the game is generally fun and worth the entry price...You should just know what you're in for on the second campaign."
