This is one of the coolest paltformers I've ever played, because unlike other games of type you can't just hold down right arrow key and expect you creature to reach the end of the level. With every creature you have to sit down and figure out how to actually move it's body. I really annoyed making sense of the seemingly random movements of the more complex pre-made creatures.And let's not forget Incredipedes unique art style. You don't get to see animated wood cut illustrations every day. Thomas Shahan, who was the artist for this game, really deserves a giant bag of cookies. And the same goes for Colin Northway, who programmed this game in flash! I never would have thought that a flash game could look this well and still run at a consistent framerate.Note that the base game isn't all that long. It took me 2h to clear all levels(60) in normal mode(normal - play with pre-made creatures, hard design your own creatures). But there's always community levels if you crave more Incredipede action. So if length is a factor for you when it comes to this kind of games you have been warned."

I honestly didn't pay attention to the story, which involves 2 cutscenes or so I think.You basically have to solve each level with 2 to 4 buttons. While it sounds simple, it gets you thinking in some of the harder levels. Then in hard mode you actually have to create limbs and muscles to make your creation move through the level to the end.Each level is really short, and most of the time is spent just trying to figure out how to complete each level. There is also a sandbox / level editor mode that lets you create your own levels and share them online. You can also select levels and rate them from other users.Overall its a short cute little game with some replay value if you like tinkering with level editors.

,Recommended,230150,2153723,"Posted: 19 March, 2013",all,The Worse Player,"This is the exact definition of incrediphillia. One of the best indie games on steam without a doubt. There are no physic engine based games that can compare to Incredipede. I'm sure most of you have played some sort of flash game some place where the whole point is to create some sort of contraption, building, or any kind of construct. What I think makes this stand apart from the rest is the mere fact you create a simple character with odd physics, like some sort of construct, with movable parts. You are really only limited to your own imagination. You can create pretty gnarly stuff and get through the various levels. The game itself has some replayability as well. The game allows you to do the levels on Easy, which gives you a premade design to finish the levels, and then you have the Hard mode, which starts you off with the base of the character Quozzle, which is just her round eye. By the way, when you finish the game, don't fret. There is a level editor included in the game. You can create some fun levels and you can share them with your friends as well. I really can't think of any negative things the game has. It is a pretty solid title, and I believe the price is just right for such a game. With that I say, whatever you do this Summer, it won't be as fun as Incredipede. All bugs wish they could have as many limbs as the gal in this game. Every purchase of this game helps fund research for limb growth of bugs, so open those wallets to make their life easier."

You traverse through various levels using creatures made up of ""legs"" and ""muscles"".  At the start these are all creatures designed by the developer but later you make your own.  I found it to be a very interesting concept but the design was lacking.  Creatures just don't behave like anything you would expect and getting them to do what you want is a chore.  It can become quite frustrating at times.  Designing them sounds like fun but making anything with some complexity is quite difficult.  I really can't recommend this to the general gaming community but I still found it a worthwhile distraction so some small minority will likely enjoy it to some degree as well.

I honestly have never played a game as beautiful as this one.The concept is similar to QWOP, but this game is more smooth and fun; less frustrating. You play as Incredipede, a bizzare  creature who's had her sisters kidnapped by humans. She has the ability to infinitely grow limbs from her body (distance limited). Four kinds of muscles are attachable controlled by AS and KL buttons.The game takes about 13 hours if you play the Hard mode (in hard mode you have to create your own Incredipede for all levels, levels are harder as well) and probably 15 hours if you're dedicated enough to play player-published levels. At first though, the game can get pretty damn hard to control.Another thing is the achievements. The game demands you to go outside and explore the real-world nature and learn about it more. The achievements are not checked in any way but I thought this was pretty damn genius. Good game to get little kids'♥♥♥♥♥outside.Downside is that I actually expected each levels to be much longer than that - like an indie platform - it would've definitely been fantastic. Some players may also find the limb movements to be slow, but well, it didn't bother me.If you're planning on buying this game, go ahead. I bought this for $2 during the sale and don't think $10 is worth the contents (even though the game is superb-eautiful).Emoticon should be added!"

Anyways, incredipede is essentially a weird slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SNES platformer on steriods. You control the contractions of muscles in a creature with numerous assemblages of legs and hands and such. It seems simple at first, but what you quickly learn is that you have to think about force, and how the muscles and legs interact to pull off increasingly complicated, but never quite exact muscle movements to move your incredipede between the stages. He also likes fruit! Incredipede is straddled between the think a lot strategies of Briad and the sheer virutosity of Mario, it requires reflexes and brains and a little patience. I wish some of the levels had a little more explanation or gave you ideas on how to move your incredipede, because the solution is not always obvious and you might find yourself mashing buttons to get the right movement, but if you take a little time to figure it out, and a little luck comes your way it'll be alright.

I mean I've seen Dragonball twice if that dosnt speak for itself you haven't seen the movie...Still not convinced? I saw Avatar the last airbender not the good version. I'd recomend it over this game.
