The two bodies started to orbit each other very quickly, Jupiter slowly getting torn apart into little fragments, orbiting Pluto.Then, Pluto ate all of the fragments.But it didn't stop there.Pluto, even though it was leauges smaller than the sun, flew directly toward it.Upon impact, the sun exploded, creating a massive nebula. At the center of it was Pluto, unharmed.I kept slamming it into suns.Eventually, I slammed it into VY Canis Majoris.Then, lag.When the lag ended, I zoomed back into Pluto, still alive. But something was different.Instead of a supermassive planet/star thing, there was a small glowing dot.Was it a black hole? I don't know.It was no larger than the sun, and glowing a pleasant red glow, but distorted light near it like a black hole.I saved it, and put it into a stock solar system.It immediately ate the sun, and sent every other body flying out into interstellar space at 10000 km/s.I dubbed this cataclysmic object Pluto Nova.10/10 would make Pluto destroy the universe again"
,Recommended,230290,32643226,Posted: 22 June,all,SyzygySoldier,"After hundreds of hours of the Universe Sandbox ² experience, I say this with confidence. Universe Sandbox ² is truly one of the—if notthe—most mesmerising and beautiful space simulation game of recent years. The core aspect of this game spans so much more than just smashing objects together, fireworks and explosions. With the power to alter virtually any component of the known universe, it really makes you appreciate how fragile our home planet is and the immense scale of space.The Universe Sandbox ² experience is one of discovery and awe.Graphics & PresentationThe way in which the game and its various options are set out is user-friendly and does not require a significant effort to master. The UI is neatly arranged, smooth, and contains all the functions that allow a player to create or destroy. There really isn't much I think the UI is missing in terms of function and design.Generally speaking, the textures of celestial objects are excellent. Universe Sandbox manages a superb balance between realism and the abilities of your device. Textures look very neat and their quality will only begin to degrade once you zoom into a close distance. This is to be expected, as higher resolutions will be beyond what many devices' specifications are able to handle without lag.I can tell an exceptional amount of effort has been put animation. Collisions, explosions and other phenomena we love to see are simply wonderfully presented. Expect dazzling supernovas, particle jets of pulsars, and magnificent, arching stellar flares.Rating: 9/10.GameplayEven for a device not dedicated to gaming, the Universe Sandbox experience is generally smooth and devoid of lag, save for running highly extensive systems with dozens on dozens of celestial objects. If you do experience lag, an option to toggle quality to reduce this impact is available. Some bugs do exist, but the developers actively listen to community reports and opinions and provide aid to players, which I am glad to see.The greatest joy of playing Universe Sandbox is the immense freedom is offers you. Whether you're the type of person who smashes planets and stars into each other and sits back to enjoy the fireworks or the type who patiently and carefully designs intricate star systems, the spectrum of what you can do in this game is incredible. Do not be mistaken to think that Universe Sandbox is just about physics and orbits. Celestial objects are highly customisable: from texture to material to atmosphere and much more—all are controlled within the palm of your hand. Have a planet or star in mind you want to recreate? No problem!I notice many negative reviews regarding the game is due to players becoming bored of it. I am the type of person who builds entire solar systems, and so there is always something more for me to do. If you just want to see objects crash and burn, it's understandable you may become bored of it after some time. After a while, certain actions can become repetitious. I would say this is the most significant flaw with the game at the present point.Do note that the game is still in Alpha, and so a colossal assortment of features is on its way. There are plenty more directions for the game to develop in. Features like procedurally generated surfaces, atmospheric scattering, space megastructures and a simple life simulation have been confirmed to be in the pipelines. So, an incredible amount of potential exists in Universe Sandbox ², even if it may not have all the features to replicate some finer details of the cosmos yet.Rating: 8/10.VerdictPurchase if interested in the workings of space, or just for fun. Join the community and aid in the game's development.Despite still being in Alpha, the commendable features Universe Sandbox ² offers at present heralds the arrival of an absolutely wonderful space simulation game once it has reached full fruition. A little pricey, perhaps, but well worth it, especially if you have an interest in space and the workings of the universe. Once purchased, you will also be able to actively participate in the game community and aid the dev team in spotting out bugs, areas of improvement and beta testing to further enhance the Universe Sandbox ² experience for the future and help new features to arrive faster.Overall Rating: 17/20."

76561198080941626,Recommended,230290,28200352,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,megatruck,"The universe was created in 7 days by our holy entity Megatruck, blessings upon Him, henceforth to be named God.On the first day, God pressed the 'new' button, thereby errasing the Solar system from existence. At first there was nothing, and God said,""Let there be light."" He had to rummage through the star folder. An then there was light, to be more precise a small white star that God had destined to be named, ""Cheese Ball."" And God looked upon Cheese Ball and saw that it was good, made out of Hydrogen and Helium rather than powdered cheddar. God looked upon the area surrounding Cheese Ball,  and figured it to be desolate. And lo, a small circular rock was placed by our heavenly father that circled around Cheese Ball with great vigor. It had a sad existence, useless to life, and was christened with the title, ""Maxwell the firey spacedot."" God had thought it weird to have a perfect circular orbit, so God clicked on Maxwell the firey spacedot's tab and revealed a metric forkton of settings. After twiddling with them for a few hours, and finally stopping that infernal white trail coming from Maxwell the fiery spacedot for some reason, called off the universe and saved it away in a file named, ""srgblga."" On the second day, Maxwell the fiery spacedot's orbit was appropriately ovaloid. God then demmanded, ""There should be life here!"" No one was going to do it for Him, He was God afterall, the lazy trunkbasket.And He should stop capitalizing His pronouns, it's annoying. Stop it. So, he found out Cheese Ball's Goldilocks zone, placed a nice white planet down, screwed with it's orbit, decided the pre-generated name Rxnamien didn't fit this gift of his, and called it, ""Nimrod."" And so Nimrod was, for a few seconds, and then God added water to it's makeup. He waited. Then, God bellowed, ""Why snt there life? Water is the foundation of life as I know it!"" He then accelerated time by a few millenia, slowed it down again, and gave Nimrod a moon, because habitable planets all have moons, right? And this moon, oh what a moon. it was a golden yellow, a shiny, magnificent ball, worthy to a god such as he. Honoring it with the title, ""Dorfff,"" God wondered at the beauty of a night sky adorned by Dorfff.  He then commanded, ""GROW SOME LIFE MEDAMMIT."" and overwrote srgblga and closed the game in a heaveny furor. On the third day, God's still trying to create some life in dis birch. On the fourth day, he finally got an atmosphere, but jack anything else. On the fifth day, God is trying to BALANCE THE GREENHOUSE DEAR ME TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE WHYYYY. On the sixth day, God decided it would be nice to ploomp some gas giants in the distance. And lo, Garumpf and Smorgasbord were born. They were useless, but adorned with moons, ranged from planet sized to are-you-even-trying sized. Time to get funky with their orbits, or so.  on the seventh day, God FINALLY CREATES SUM LIL' CITIES THEY ARE SO CUTE. Despite being blurry dots of white only visible on the dark side of Nimrod, God feels an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. God saves over srgblga, and watches the cosmos he has created. He then gets bored and lobs a red dwarf at Cheese Ball,thus crating a cataclysmic event starting with planets losing their orbit and ending in a supernova, obliterating everything, including the framerate. God closes the game, and eats some pizza. And thus ends the story of God.TL/DR: Read it please unless you don't like short stories about me being a malevolent being creating life and destroying it.10/10 would cry in joy at the miracle of life and then meniacly laugh as they all burn to spacedust again."

,Recommended,230290,17977488,"Posted: 10 September, 2015",all,The Insomniac,"This game is a very good reminder of the precarious balance in which the universe hangs. I mean, all it takes is a red dwarf star to s̶p̶a̶w̶n̶  mysterously appear out of nowwhere and crash into the sun in order to cause a cataclysmic event that causes a b̶e̶a̶u̶t̶i̶f̶u̶l̶  truely awful explosion of the entire solar system. This game also makes you appreciate that the sun doesn't suddenly become a billion times more dense and turn into a black hole in which all life as we know it is killed most horribly. And we are most certainly glad the moon doesn't collide with an exact replica of itself and slowly destroy the Earth with pieces of debris; at least until another moon collides with the earth because the small pieces of debris were taking too long.And yet, amidst all this potential destruction, here we are. And I still can't hit Earth with golf balls fired from Mars.Edit: Though as it turns out I can hit Earth with Mars fired from Mars, and if fired with a weak enough force I can hit Mars, with Mars fired from Mars."

76561198029108324,Recommended,230290,20437979,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,Indominus Infernal,"First off I definitely recommend this game, but like all games it has downsides.This may be a bit of a read, but where is a good review without its detail right?One of the first things I noticed, when you buy this game that's it, you have the entire game, no special objects I have to buy, if I want to throw a football with the mass of a sun at a teapot the size of our earth, then I can do it as soon as I purchase this game. Which I can tell would appeal to most people.I'll go over my favourite aspect of the game now, but to save me rambling on about every little feature I enjoy, I'll make a list after this. The thing I love most about this game, is the creativity and curiosity this game brings. As I mentioned before; but who could imagine that you can make a football our solar systems apocalypse?! One things this game does  indeed do very well, is catching the interest and curiosity of people, but also allowing quite a fair bit of creativity.As I said before I will now make a quick list of all the other things I enjoy a lot about this game:-Black Holes (you'll spend a lot of your time, if not most of it messing around with black holes).-Watching what happens when our sun evolves.-Blowing up every item in the game.-What happens if's (with the earth especially).-Trying to make another earth from scratch.-Turning a teapot into a sun.-Creating a Solar System.-Creating a very small galaxy.-Messing around with the milkyway.-Making a potential universe descructing object.-Watching the beautiful simulations, with the beautiful music playing.Those pretty much cover what I'll be doing and you'll most likely be doing in this game, but the things is, I know there are some more things in the game I haven't started to look at yet, which I will do very soon; they also keep updating this game, so I am always on the look out for any interesting additions they put in.Alright, so like with every game, it has a few downsides. Here are a few.After about three hours of playing and testing things out, I started to feel a bit bored and I felt as if I had tried everything that is worth doing (blowing up the earth a million times, and putting a black hole at the centre of our solar system). So what I would say the developers is this, perhaps for a future game, or to just make a big update for this one, think about what more content could you add into this game, or how much more detail can you go into with what happens in space, just to add those extra few hours of interesting gameplay; that being said, I could probably play this for a maximum of two amazing hours, creating my own universe, and creating several apocalyptic situations, then a minimum of a week and a bit, of a break before wanting to play and do that all again. A small suggestion for what you could add; add or make a load more options of what if situations, and perhaps more interesting or ambitious what ifs, like what if aliens were real and invaded our solar system, or what if earth advanced space travel so much they were travelling around our solar system as easy as people can get on a bus now. Maybe too ambitious but you start to see my point.A final thing, only small, and not the most important downside, but something I certainly picked up upon, and thought, hmm, would have been better with this; is the whole black holes being the most destructive force situation. In this game, all they are, are huge slingshots. Now, I know black holes do something to do with shooting objects out at incredibly high speeds, but I'm no expert. However I also know, or at least have heard from people who are meant to be experts, that under the great force of the gravity a black hole has, objects that are pulled towards it are torn to pieces by the strength of the gravitational pull; and for a lot of people interested in black holes, this is one main thing they focus on; the destructive power it brings wherever it goes. In this game, as I said before, I only see a slingshot, a bunjee jump, to me, a black hole in this game is far from being as deadly and chaotic as they are said to be by experts. I'm almost sure this is to do with the design of the game, that limits this feature, or to do with the time it might have taken to make these extra small details added in; but considering the large majority who will spend most of their time playing around with black holes; I STRONGLY suggest to the developers, that again, either in a very future version of this game, or a large update later on, that there is some sort of design that let's us all see that truly great power a black hole holds, and how merciless it can be.Those are the two main downsides in this game for me. Although, in conclusion, I certainly recommend this game, it is still fairly new, and having regular updates, (mainly the little fixtures us gamers don't notice very much), but it can give a lot, answer a lot of your curious questions about space, and it is still extremely fun to play. Definitely worth it, and quite frankly, you can never get bored of tossing the moon at earth. Oh, and Developers, if any of you read this, of course, great game, very well done, so congratulations, but also take into account what improvements that I have said could be there in the future.Thanks!"

Simple enough but the vastness of the scale is overwhelming. While quite the fantastic computer program alone, I strongly urge that one would enjoy it with the HTC Vive.  One may spend a moment above the Solar system and marvel at the orrery precision of the paths taken by the planets revolving in the middle of your room, and then fly in on your favorite planet to scrutinize at a naturalistic scale as a true behemoth careens by at a dwarfing 1:1 perspective.  Fire a few asteroids here and there to examine the unwavering momentum of whatever hapless body pulled it out of a straight trajectory, but you will find yourself depositing stars nearby such as Rigel which consider the entire Solar System to be a mere morsel.  There are things out there that are truly and terrifyingly massive.I have always had a passion for astronomy so this game is quite the treat.  My 60-year-old father has also taken to the game with an astonishing fervor so I bought him his very own Vive so he would stop bumming around my place hogging my video games. Alas, I have shown many friends and family members this game, often as an induction into VR as I set up a gorgeous scene and put them game on pause to then have them put the headset on to blow their minds.  My favorite scenario is a few planets being vaporized as they rotate perilously close to a violent neutron star.  I find myself teaching others about ""what the ♥♥♥♥ am I looking at?"" and ""why is it doing that thing?"" and ""this stuff really exists!?"" and ""why is space so damn beautiful?"".  Dispensing moments of pure astonishment has become a past time. I've become the Carl Sagan of my living room as I take people on my Ship of the Imagination to show them what vast ocean teems beyond their small island of which they know.If you hold the beauty of the cosmos in reverence, I suggest you try this game out on VR. Nothing quite compares to having lunch in orbit around the Earth and then releasing a generous salvo of Moons at it and reveling in your wanton destruction. Then you add hydrogen gas until the Earth becomes a gas giant, then a brown dwarf, full star, neutron star, black hole, then grow that black hole until its more massive than the observable universe and then you win the game! Mwuahahaha!!  Who wants to be Space God when you can be Space Devil? The universe is your sandbox.Dad quit hogging my sandbox."

It's gameplay is deep and incredibly fun, and the graphics are surprisingly beautiful. I would reccomend it wholeheartedly. It does have flaws, but they are minor enough to not hamper my enjoyment.Pros --My favorite part of the game is the collisions, which look and feel amazing. It has never been this satisfying to launch the moon at Austrailia, vaporizing the continent and melting the earth's surface.-The soundtrack of the game is really nice, which is surprising considering it's not the game's main appeal at all.-There's more to do than just collisions. You can create solar systems, experiment with atmospheres, terraform barren planets, and much more. With enough imagination, you can do anything.-Lots of premade scenarios for you to play around with.-Easy to use UI.-It can even be educational, in some cases.-The developers seem to be great people, and communicate a lot with their fanbase.-It's very polished. The framerate is smooth and I haven't encountered many major glitchesCons--It isn't updated very often, but that's understandable for such a complex game.-The soundtrack, while beautiful, has very few tracks. Only about four or five.-The physics engine sometimes breaks down, but only if you push it too hard and often it breaks in hilarious ways.-You may lose intrest after a point, but only way after you've gotten your money's worth.Overall, it's a great game with one or two nitpicky flaws that aren't important at all.8.5/10"

Despite being fairly easy on graphics and the CPU (unless you go nuts with the amount of simulated objects, time scale, or try to zoom in on a supernova), this will accurately simulate the size, position, movment, mass rotation, general appearance, temperature, magnetic fields, basic composition, and gravitational fields of known stars, planets, planetoids, asteroids, black holes etc. In addition to being packed with pre-made simulations of the Solar System (major planets only, planets and major moons, all moons, or even every known object in the solar system - there is a surprising amount of them) you can change everything that is simulated at will. Alter the positions, rotations, from the size and mass down to the composition and temperature, everthing is adjustable. You can remove and place objects at whim, either standing still or with a predetermined vector. You can even mess with their mass and composition by manually adding material to them - add enough hydrogen to the sun and it will turn into a blue star! The game also simulates collisions between all the objects to a limited degree, considering the scale of the collisions.

,Recommended,230290,31282537,Posted: 21 April,all,freen,"The game Universe Sandbox ² basically explains what you'll be doing in its title. Well it is a massive sandbox in which i have yet to find the end of the universe. The game may crash when clearing your universe, but this is a minor issue in my eyes.Seeing as it is an early access game it is obvious that there are some rough edges which are primarily noticed when overloading the physics engine. This is done by spawning in multiple massive objects while sprinkling smaller ones in between and having them collide while the time is speed up by a significant amount. This may or may not happen more often depending on your specifications.When talking about the gameplay it is hard to ignore the fantastic visuals (i mean there are so many objects for them to look this good is incredible). The UI is easy to get used to while not forgetting the detailed mechanics. Me not being the most mathematically or physically literate person had to look up different options which i see as a positive, because it means they don't cater to a casual audience and focus on the simulation and freedom which can be accessed by advanced users.I had a lot of fun so far learning and seeing what i've learned unfold in front of my eyes.

Check. And all with an accurate representation of what would really happen!For new players, this game might be confusing at first, since, well, some players might not know how to load simulations.. launch planets.. etc., but once you get the hang of it, it'll be a bizarre experience. It may have some bugs, but what would you expect from a game like this? I know for a fact that it's hard to make a game like this, and while the game might be cool, there will be bugs here and there, and since the team is too busy doing other things, they might not fix all the bugs. So while there are still glitches and things that screw up the game, it is still very fun to play. You can create solar systems and basically do anything with the objects, planets, and stars you are given.Y   O   U         C   A   N           P      L      A      Y        G      O      D  .If you want to find a space game where you can.. maybe make some galaxies orbit an absolutely GINORMOUS black hole... make some of your own objects and save them to use in other simulations.... Then this is the game to fulfill those needs. This game definitely needs more attention than it has been getting, because it is basically the only game i have ever found that fulfilled my dreams to launch things at other things. All those other stupid iPhone space simulators ain't got NOTHIN on this, unless there was a game that COULD do the things in this game. Even if the game is still in development, i can't WAIT to see what they add next. So overall, i give this game aN  I  N  E     /   T  E  Nbecause of it's freeness... wait is that even a word?

And I've got to say, having played for only 1 hour, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think ""oh god I'm spending $19.99"", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent $20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other.For the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha.

While many Youtubers will throw moons at planets and call that fun, going much deeper takes a higher level of education. You can build your own solar system from the ground up, drop black holes into anywhere, throw random items into orbit or at planets as well as try to see what happens when you increase the mass of the earth by a couple of suns.  There are no campaigns as this is more of a purely scientific and enjoyable simulation.The control are simple to learn but the characteristics of the universe contents are vast.  Gravity, mass, density, oribtal configurations, rotational periods, atmosphere, core composition, luminosity, atmosphereic pressure, greenhouse gases, and about 500 other options exist that can be modified.  You can turn on or off realism for each individual object and there are about 50 scenarios you can fire up and watch and/or interact with.I really enjoy this game..I mean simulation program.  It's relaxing, the sound track makes it easy to study things outside of the game if you are trying to get something done i.e. learn another language, study a new topic in your spare time, etc.  I'm running on a 27"" iMac with a 3.4 Ghz i5 with 16 GB of RAM and a 780m Nvidia.  I have no issues playing this game and doing anything I want.  No slowdown, no glitches that I can find, nothing.  I'd also like to add I am on a Solid State so that also helps push things along.I highly recommend this for those that are interested in the universe, learning some things along the way, or just want something relaxing to do that doesn't involve hearing a 14 year old rage over a mic or throw his keyboard against the wall due to poor parenting and lack of social skill sets.  Remember, it isn't a game, it's a simulation, and one that is awfully fun too!  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."

We don't however understand it completley. knowing is only half of it, there is no reasonable way to compare our planet to any other without treading into the realms of obsertity or disbelief in the attempt to understand how big everything is. so while i was playing i compared a black hole to a sagitarius A another black hole and my zoom out was incredible. but when you see those numbers like how big it is in our human numerical systems you can't get the hole picture because the software is designed to let you see everything and sure when you go and zoom into the black hole and you see the larger one looming amously over the event horrizon you say "" hey cool that black hole is as big as 10 million of our suns."" but then you look at our son and all it is is a dot in our sky. we can never fathom how big it really is when all we see is graphs and illistrations from a human point of view rather than the real point of view of how big it is. we use numbers to measure how big things are, but we don't imagine how big things really are in the real world because we will never see these things. in conclusion, this game is very well made and extremely enjoyable  but numbers and comparisons to huge things are just not helping people understand how big it is. i give this game a 10/10 ign (sorry for the rant and boring read, these were just thoughts that were bugging me. so it might not be structured as arduosly as a regular paragraph)"

Unlike other games in the space genre, Universe Sandbox lets you metaphorically become god. The attention to detail is absolutely stunning. For example, increasing the sun's gravitational pull will draw earth towards it. As it gets closer you can see the oceans evaporating and the temperature of the planet increasing until it burns up and is destroyed. When earth isn't being consumed by suns, black holes, or teapots (yes teapots), you can see further detail in its rotation such as how all the lights of the cities turn on when facing away from the sun. It gives you a sense of life... before you cause a second ice age. I've just gone on about earth. There's so much more to this game. Want to decrease the suns mass? Go for it. Want to cause a supernova? Do it. Want to collide galaxies in real time? Well if you have the time why not. The game is one of my favorites. If you like space or generally just being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a cosmic level, do yourself a favor and get this game. It's well worth the money. As a side note, if you have a modern laptop, this game runs well on those too due to the superb optimization. My laptop is 7 years old and it still runs well. Alright, I'm going to stop rambling now, but don't leave just yet. Scroll up and click buy right now. Even if you don't have a credit card.

The mass of the star, 'M', was calculated above using the mass-luminosity relationship of stars. Finally, the mass of the exoplanet, 'm', in the equation can be ignored, since it is much smaller than the mass of the parent star. As an example, since the Sun is about three hundred thousand times heavier than the Earth, ignoring the mass of the Earth in this calculation woud introduce an error of less than 0.001%. The equation can be solved for the only remaining variable which is the orbital radius, 'a'. Once the orbital radius has been determined, the mass of the planet can be calculated using Newton's Law of Gravitation shown below. Here, 'G' is once again the Gravitational constant, 'm1' is the mass of the parent star, 'r' is the orbital radius (this was 'a' in the equation above), and 'Fg' is the force of gravity betwe-Oh, the game?

You can change basically everything about each planet such as material composition, mass, density, orbit, rotation, etc. and see all the effects it has on the rest of system.I changed Earth's velocity to zero and watched it quickly get sucked into the sun, which turned blue. Mercury got a wobbly orbit and Venus' orbit got slightly closer to the sun.

I LOVE the dynamic sound track, to me that made this game. Also, I suggest to anyone playing to go to the largest scale, set two rocky bodies on a collision course, zoom in to one of the planets surfaces, and in the final aproach, set the time to scale. Watching worlds collide from a first person perspective is awe inspiring.There are something things that could be improved or added. Like the ability to snap to objects and name or lable them. I had a hard time trying to set up a star/ planet combination. I'd ran into a couple of glitches that sent me across the universe, never to see my planet again. Also, it would be nice to be able to reverse time.Also this game would probably consume ALL of my free time if there was a way to set up or follow an ecosystem. Or have the ability to create life and watch it evolve maybe had a stats bar with the type of life and its progress or something to that effect.Overall; As is, the game is fun.

Lots of fun to tinker around with, explore different and fun experiments in space using all of the objects we're familiar with.  The experience especially comes alive in VR, since you can witness collisions in first-person and stand on the surface of all the great gas giants and whatever else you want.  Even out of VR this provides enough fun and content to easily justify the price.The best feature about this is that there are many pre-set loadouts, from individual planets, to the solar system, to dozens of collisions.  So you don't have to spend the hours to customize and make your own arrangement of things just to see ""what if"" or start experimenting on the solar system.

For others I want to say - the game is incredible. You can use various planets, stars, novas, comets etc. to build the Universe you like. You can also modify different parameters of objects, such as mass, density, angular velocity and many more. I was amuzed when I changed the mass, and it was automatically recalculated into a mass of a bigger object (e.g. mass of the Earth into mass of Jupiter). A challenging aspect of this game - you have to learn physics and astrophysics otherwise you will crash a model in seconds. My respect to devs, you've made a great job."

If I create a planet with a nice constant temperature, it'll have a effective temperature of like -270 degrees. Now this Isn't a problem while in game, but if I leave the simulation and reload it, the planet will be completely frozen, even if it's really close to the sun. I've sorta come to the conclusion that effective temperatures mean nothing, and if they actually mean something, I don't know what it is. It's just a little annoying that I have to set the temperature of each planet back to what it was every time I load the simulation. The weird thing is though, is that for the remainder of time im in the simulation, it'll stay at the nice life-supporting temperature, until of course I reload the simulation, to which It'll reset to absurdly cold temperatures. To be honest, I;m not even entirely sure if this even is a bug or not, but if it is a feature of the game, It'd be nice to know why it happens. Other than that, I don't really have any more complaints about Universe Sandbox, it's a great game, and I would definately recomend it."

It would also be brilliant if storms were to be seen on planets and moons with the correct atmospheres and surface composition. As well as this it would be interesting to see Earth change as the years move on, such as seeing the cities grow and seeing man made satellites around the planet - maybe you could introduce the eventual colonisation on other planets as time progresses, as a small, automatic event.

Tried to terraform mars -> difficult to steer objects, collisions don't really work because there is loss of mass because the game deletes fragments it can't handle.2. Not multithreaded, can't take advantage of GPU either which means this thing is SLOOOOOW on anything non-trivial.3. does not implement stellar evolution. (though planed for RSN, but its' not there yet so the game isn't worth money yet.)4. Does not treat gaseous bodies as being gaseous. ie, put a tiny black hole next to a giant star really close, -> the black hole should start syphoning material off the star and slowly consume it.

Destroy them. BUILD FREAKING GALAXIES! DESTROY IT WITH A JACK-O-LATERN!!!! I love the ""Do what ever you want"" genre of sandboxes, and this game is definately at the core of it. With that, let's get into pros and cons.Pros:Music is very nice to listen to while you playBuild planets, solar systems, galaxies, pulsar, and so much moreChuck moons into planets, planets into the sun. Planets also become deformed and if it has water on it... THE WATER FILLS IN THE CRATER!!!!Very nice turorial and extra tutorials.Much more, but you'll have to find out more on your own.Cons:Some room for optomization. I have a $2000 CPU and I seem to stress the program fairly easy. It is early access though so I'm not worried about optomization right now.Sometimes physics bugs out but for the most part its really solid.And thats really all for the cons. It's a great game, so if you love universal sandboxes, this is a game for you. I would just recommend a powerful cpu or low graphics."

Sure you can manipulate large objects, cause planetary collisions and such, but if you only came for the big explosions, then you're likely to run out of entertainment after an hour or so.Really, the great value comes from ... I suppose exploring how the universe is and works. This simulator gives such a awe-inspiring view into how grand the scale of the universe truly is. And the music! The music gives an in awe of the universe kind of feeling. It's so fitting and pleasant to listen to.The distance between objects is mind blowing, experimenting to see how gravity actually works, the time it takes for distant objects to complete orbits, just seeing all of it is so awesome. Create your own solar systems if you so desire, see how unstable multi-star systems can be, or drop in the largest known star into our solar system and see the damn thing be almost as large as Saturn's orbit (That's overwhelmingly freaking huge.)I remember checking the stats of a neutron star, seeing that it made 1 full rotation in 0.281 seconds.

I read through some of the reviews and blinked quickly  through the rest, I love what you have done and have read your ideas for further development.Now I'm not in any way adapted to the scientific understanding of how the solar system really works but it does interest me and the possibilities within each step we take to move that little bit closer, is very exciting. Within this experience there is a lot of technical understanding that I need to learn; but I do like this challenge.Some have given you ideas of what they would like to see within it's structure, I don't know if anyone has mentioned it but maybe you could incorporate information about the population on earth by clicking on it, how it is affected by the impact of a meteor/ meteor shower, depending on it's scale.Maybe you could incorporate a satellite system where you could analyse a planet that gives you feed back when you alter it in some way or just in general, I'm looking forward to the rest of your creativity, great work guy's."

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Its a pure sandbox- Lots of pre-made simulations- Beautiful. Great sense of scale. Slow music: Perfecto to unwindCONs- Even tho is very enjoyable in its current state, this is far from finished- Glitchy: planets disappearing for no reason, tutorial text covering the options, game refuses to close...- Tutorials are very limited. There are tons of variables on this game. Educational value is very low right now- No community simulations- No current ""known universe"" simulation available where you can zoom in and out. At least I didnt find it- Explosions are horrible: the planets either merge in a perfect brand new sphere or create a crater that is nothing but a 3d model of a crater on the spot of the collision. This means you cant destroy a planet little by little and that collisions dont ""stack""- Time only moves forward. No rewind button- They push you constantly to rate the game. I know this is effective in increasing the number of reviews, but is not okay in my book- Planet details when you zoom in is not bad, but is less that I would like"

And since the program otherwise is pretty much the same thing as a dumbed down Universe Sandbox 1 you sort of feel ripped off.Some things could probably be fixed in the future:Scale issues (probably IPD/AA issues in the engine) as well as terrible graphical performances from time to time.This is a title where scale should really be awe inspiring. Instead they added footballs and crap like that. Useless, annoying, childish and all the ""scientificy"" stuff were thrown out of the window. This is now, officially, a ""throw balls at other balls using artificial gravity and shoot lasers (!) on the Earth""-game. Complete with terrible textures.Unfortunately it doesn't really feel like the stuttering and issues are warranted since the graphics is pretty basic and underwhelming. Think: white blob moving slowly towards huge yellow blob with some orbital lines in the distance. It's nowhere near any Hollywood style effects. And STILL it stutters if you spew hydrogen blobs randomly around you.That the tools on the controllers reset to ""Spawn Moon"" is both incredibly annoying (let me set the default tool!) and descriptive of what the devs think you should do in VR: Throw tiny marbles at pool balls and go ""oooo"" at the rather terrible effects. The controls are also counter-intuitive and unnecessarliy hard to change.No. Give us a room scale planetarium with interesting scenarios. Fix the scale issues and maybe add more backgrounds and better textures.If you have Universe Sandbox 1 just keep it. It's better. Lacks VR but US2 lack meaningful VR too...US1 had a modicum of scientific intent and purpose. US2 has footballs.One word summary: Boring."

There's some crude climate simulation for Earth that is just wrong--even with 2C over current global temperatures, we have Europe looking like it did 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age.The collisions are vaguely entertaining for a while, until you notice that the larger colliding body essentially never changes--it just gets more massive with the same textures remaining.And to add to my bitterness, a refund was refused--so screw you too, Valve.

It is a toy, something for you to sit down with for a few hours and just see what it is like to destroy Earth, or the Sun, or the Milky Way.This is not something that would appeal to many people.  You have to be extremely interested in astrophysics to even want to buy this title, and those that are educated in astrophysics, you start to notice some issues with this right away such as the lack of space-time distortion near massive objects such as black holes or super-massive stars.  This game is very rhudementary at the simulation of basic physics and does not apply any theorethical rules that we have found to be true in the past decade which is disappointing.Orbits are innacurate, showing loss of velocity on each revolution just by having an abnormal or eliptical orbit.  While unstable orbits can maraculiously become stable (there is a reason they're called unstable, because there is a collision trajectory). This is not true to life and violates the laws of thermal dynamics.The show stopper, was having objects that can move as fast as the speed of light.  The current school of thought says that the more massive an object is, the expodentially harder it is to achieve speeds remotely close to the speed of light.  In essence, the fatter you are, the harder it is to run fast.  The universe has the same laws, which are violated in this ""toy"".Again, this is a TOY, not even a simulator, if this was listed on steam as such I would have gave it a glowing recommendation.  However, this is no game, and is decietful to market it as such because there is no playing field, no objective, no goal.  It is a sandbox with sand -- which is a toy, again, not a game."

I fully expect to change my review to positive when it releases.**Right now, its fairly limited. Setting up your own systems is much harder than it should be -for me at least- and usually ends in lots of explosions, getting objects where you want them just isn't very intuitive.I wouldn't say the game runs poorly, but it could run a lot better. However, After playing it again recently, I definitely noticed improvement, so I imagine the game will run quite smoothly by release.The number of objects you get to play around with feels a bit lackluster, but that should also be improved. They are also planning to add Steam Workshop integration, which would be more than enough.The game does let you edit a metric ton of attributes for every object in real time, as well as gravity and other such things, which is pretty sweet. If you want to run a simulation with 1,000x normal gravity and an Earth the size of 1,000,000,000 suns, you can do that.In its current state, I wouldn't recommend this unless you're really into astronomy, or just have a thing for blowing up planets.

After I changed rating to ""Very satisfied"", the game shuts down with no problem.I hope this is a design issue and the Dev can fix those two bugs.

This is not a game I would like to buy and play off of the summer sale. Instead of throwing planets at each other I would rather be shooting something or someone in the face, mutilating them and burning their remains.If you're into planets and space then this is your game, if you get bored easily and want a bit more action out of your precious gaming time then this is not your game. Lack of content and not very fun over-all. Its still a nice game but not my type of game.And especially not worth it at the full price of 27.99$ to change the colour and material of planets and throw them at each other and watch them orbit at different time speeds..."

One is stationary one comes in from the left and rams into the other. Nice graphics. The final object is the same size and for some reason is moving to the left. (???) That doesn't seem right.I don't see any way to set up a solar system with custom orbits. Sure, I made one system, but all orbits were round and in the same plane. That's not very natural. I don't see how to customize that. I went right through all the tutorials.I can make a pulsar! Ooh. big deal. I see a computer graphic of a magnetized white dwarf. Is that what they really look like? Maybe a bit.I'm quite an astronomy fanatic, but I don't feel I got $30 worth. Of course, it is an early access release and so it could still get better yet. Let's hope it gets a lot better.

In another, I gave the Earth another moon closer to the present one and then decided to explode it. this resulted in what looked like an ice age as most of the northern hemesphire was covered in snow/ice.

While SE is more of a space-exploration game, US^2 is a sandbox - you can twiddle with settings to see how things change. I guess it's kind of like playing God.If you had that sense of wonder when you played Space Engine, you can get that here too. You can see how planets change over the scale of centuries and millenia when you mess with their climates. You can change Mars' climate so that it has water.

Music is nice and low-key; fits the vibe of space. I'm not an astronomer or physicist but the simulations really do seem very believable; At least to my understanding.

I spawned a random rocky planet, then spammed in about 50 different small moons, all of the same orbital path. They, of course, exploded catastrophically, causing a large shower of fragments to be sent off into space, and eventually left the one true moon- Orde, as well as a somewhat dense field of fragments. Then I turned to terraforming. I had finally got the planet to look good, but then a fair amount of the fragments of the satellite field crashed into both the host planet and Orde, leaving large craters in both. Eventually, the Planet cooled down, leaving Orde (3.3x Moon) entirely bathed in fire. Couldn't figure out how to put it out, so I thought making it bigger might help. Nope. Orde crashed into the Planet, causing another large explosion and a shower of fragments. Eventualy settled into what I called the Orde Pseudo Star, hurdling through the void. Set it to 0 Velocity, and started over. Things progressed, and I had a nice system going. Then Orde began to move. didn't notice, but then it ate the closest planet, and so I was like, what the heck, might as well blow everything up. Turned all the mass into hydrogen, which turned Orde into a star, and it ate everything. Turns out solar systems are a lot bigger than I thought. This is why I don't have nice things. I turn them into stars and then they consume everything else in existence. Gr8 m8 r8 8/8 Would consume universe accidentally again."

Unless you are talking metaphorically like ""life is a game"".  This is a hardcore simulator, but made to be very accessible to the average user.  Truly well done.While the vast majority of my feedback to this game is positive, I do have one major complaint - There is no setting I can find to disable the music.  Which is fine if you are going to open this game, play it for a while, and not do other things by alt-tabbing to other windows.  Or if you are very picky about the music you listen to this might be an issue for me.  Not that the music isn't good - which it is.  It sets a certain Space-ey vibe and it works.  I just wish I had the freedom to turn off the music from the settings menu.Now back to the positives...I could go on for several more paragraphs about how wonderful this app is and what a remarkable aid it would be not only to astronomy students and Planetary Astronomers (they have had access to stuff like this for years to decades) but this allows anybody in the world, with no prior knowledge of astronomy or science, to dive right in and ""Play Dice with the Universe"" as Einstein said.The power of exploration and experimentation that Universe Sandbox 2 puts into the hands of - basically anybody on the planet - is truly a wonder to behold and I am so thankful to the developers to putting this into my hands."

When I first saw videos about this game - and its non-Steam predecessor, Universe Sandbox - I got a very general first impression: Explosions. Take a thing, add thing (at a collision course with a high velocity), get explosion. And from what I saw, the explosions were great, as were the collisions - especially in US2, the game I shall focus on. I was sold. I had to get it. And so I did.Of course I started with blowing things up. How could I resist? I started off with crashing Deimos into Earth, more precisely into the eastern US seaboard (thanks, Obama). I then proceeded to crash the Moon into the Pacific Ocean. Rest in peace, guys. But I didn't stop there. I threw what was left of Earth (a flaming ball, basically) into Jupiter. Then I threw Jupiter into the Sun. Then I threw the Sun into a bigger star, which also mumbo-jumbed the planetary orbits and sent Saturn, Neptune and Uranus into the deep unknown. I ended my destruction spree by crashing the largest star known to science into the second largest star known to science. The resulting supernova would have made Michael Bay ♥♥♥♥ his pants.And yet, I felt that something was missing. The destruction was fun, but it didn't feel like it had a purpose. So I left my pretty screwed-up solar systems behind and opened a new simulation. I added a Sun-like star into the centre, and then experimented a bit. I added a Mercury-ish planet which got pretty hot, a Jupiter-ish planet with many, many moons and an Earth with lots of water. The Mercury planet disappeared - it probably got destroyed by something that wasn't a moon, the Jupiter planet gobbled up its moons and all the water on Earth point 2 had all its water boiled off. So I tried again. I created a new solar system and did what I could to create functional orbits and planets with reasonable distances.What happened next was unexpected. As I finished setting up moons for my gas giant affectionately named Camillus after my crush, I looked at it's grand silhouette from the perspective of one of its natural satellites, decorated by the other orbiting moons. The sight filled me with awe. There are few games that can make me cry tears of awe, but Universe Sandbox 2 is a worthy candidate. This is not a joke.When you do what you can to destroy what can be destroyed, you feel a bit like a brutal god, and that is indeed very fun. But when you successfully create an Earth-like planet and watch its chances of life increase, when you watch the moons of a gas giant in orbit, when you gaze upon the mightiness of VY Canis Majoris, then you simply realize how amazing the universe is.And that is what this game succeeds at. It doesn't tell a complicated story, it doesn't give you a mission, but it gives you a beautiful understanding of our entire existence. And it does so beautifully.To make this look a bit more like an actual review, here's a paragraph on the things about this game that are good and bad. Good things? Very scientifically accurate (yes, I am a nerd), especially when it comes to physics. Great graphics, generally very beautiful when it comes to aesthetics. Very diverse when it comes to things you can do. Great randomization options for atmospheres, visuals, density and lots of other things. Oh, and all the other things I mentioned. Bad stuff? Only minor bugs, mostly related to sounds and mechanics. Could have some more minor objects like satellites, and more variation in asteroids. Oh, and I guess the black holes and ring dynamics are kinda screwed up at this stage. However, that is all which I consider bad about this game. And seeing as this is an Early Access game, I have full faith in the development team that they will sharpen the game to create a flawless experience.Essentially, this is the best sandbox i've ever played. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a star system to create (and hopefully not blow up).9.8/10"

The game not only goes along with how the universe operates, meaning that what happens in the game actually happens, but it just fascinates you with facts. How you are able to interact or just observe how other masses affect each other is also interesting to see happen.

Nothing changes in the selcted field for any keyboard entry, though on the fifth time restarting that lesson I was able to type ""1."" I had similar problems with the graphs and the time step (how fast the simulation runs). Exiting the game, one is prompted to provide feedback. That box consistently accepts text input, but it is not a large box and it overflows its interface rather than making a scrollbar. When it does so, both feedback fields become unresponsive and one has to start over. So I had about the same experience I could have had watching videos of the tutorials, though there I wouldn't have wasted my time fighting the interface for $25.

I got this to simulate a fictional star system, with a star and a number of planets that I'd pre-made, to see what it would look like and to actually be able to see my system. Generating planetary bodies and stars is very easy, with extremely high customisability. A nice touch is that with artificial planets you are able to change the planet and atmosphere composition, and it gives values for how similar the planet is to Earth and how likely it is for life to exist.A few quirks are that a few values that should be related aren't, for example I was playing with the mass and radius of a star and the density didn't change. I imagine there are a few other small problems that will pop up as I build my system but otherwise very good.Simulating fictional star systems: 9/10If you want to know what it's like to crash planets together look elsewhere.

It honestly is a fantastic game but I have to give it a negative review because for some reason unless I run alpha 15.2(which as of this review is like 3 major releases out of date) the game segmentation faults on launch and refuses to run. I've contacted the developers multiple times regarding the issue and gave them my logs and as much information as I could. The first time they came back and said ""well it's probably an issue with the unity engine"" and that I'd have to wait for the unity devs to fix it. I was skeptical since every other unity game I own runs perfectly fine. Then the second time I contacted them they told me it might be an issue with the native physics engine they recently implemented and to launch the game in safemode and without the steam overlay. I did that and still to no avail. After which they basically just stopped responding. I haven't contacted them a third time regarding the issue because I'm positive I won't get anywhere. I was hoping they would accidentially fix the bug with time because that happens from time to time but as of now I still cannot play this game without running a horribly out of date version.EDIT: The devs have since contacted me and given a solution that works so I can now say I whole heartedly recommend this game."

Getting a planet to a habitable tempurature is very difficult for me, and sometimes takes a long time 2. Needs something where you can create your own planet and/or control its tempurature and make it so that it stays that way. Now I KNOW there is a planet edit but what i mean is change the eleveations, and change what is on it. 3. This is the biggest one: Saving. Saving is very annoying, and when you exit the game it should remind you to do so. I have lost to much progress this wayOtherwise very fun and entertaining game!!"

The climate feature is amazing! The first game sucks! It doesn't even have climate!!! I love the graphics in this game! The cloud animations are so realistic!!! The stars are a bit too bright though. You can't even see the planets in the size comparision. The explosions in the latest update look so cool. I just wish you would improve the star evolution. It just turns huge and stays like that! It never goes supernova!! And sometimes you can keep adding mass to a star and it NEVER explodes. And please improve the framerate for nebulae! And sometimes objects can naturally go faster than light, which makes no sense. And I wish the premade solar system came with moons and rings, but less dwarf planets. It should include the sun and planets, 5-8 dwarf planets, and a few major moons for each planet. The solar system that does come with moons is missing lots of Saturn's major moons, and the one that comes with ALL the moons doesn't even have any dwarf planets, not even PLUTO! And even if I place a planet in the habitable zone of a star, it still freezes for some reason! And if I try to make the gas giant with moons, the GAS GIANT starts disentigrating from tidal forces!!! How does that make sense? And you should also include a mass transfer system so we could have type 1a supernovae! That would be amazing. And you should also add an animation for when a black hole collides with a planet, it just looks ugly how the planet disappears instantly. Overall, this game is really impressive!Rating:7/10"

What i like doing is creating random stars out of planets, then putting another star next to it and see what kind of object they create, this leads to weird gas giants and pulsars. Then after that i usually discuss the object's physics with other people. (usually on sience discords) If i was a teacher, i would use this as a little treat for my class, and discussing the physics behind these objects. 8/10 and thats only because of some innacurate weird interactions, they are super annoying but they only happen once in a while."

If you are interested in space, or like creating blackholes and watching planets of every and any kind burn, this game is for you."

76561198125809811,Not Recommended,230290,34743476,Posted: 4 September,all,IdoshoGaming,"I wouldn't recommend this game for multiple reasons: The Actual ""game"" is very nice and well built; unfortunately there are too many reasons to not purchase it. First of all you can get a similar simulator for free which already makes this $24.99 more expensive. The other drawback is VR, I couldn't figure out how to play this game in VR, the controls are so confusing and this game doesn't really fit VR. If you want to get this ""game"" as a simulation to help you in Science than this game is great, but you can still get something similar for free. As for VR I will not recommend this what so ever."

If your reading the reviews to Universe Sandbox 2 than you obviusly enjoy science as much as i do, in which case you are going to love every second of this simulator. Even if you dont have a love for science or astronomy anyone could sink hours into this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who want to mess the universe and solar system."

,Recommended,230290,34567751,Posted: 28 August,all,ঝStormড়,"This game is really good and shows me the  universe isnt big. I feel like a god when playing this as I can crash two planets or maybe hundreds and created a new world never seen before. I can take existing worlds, and create them into something unholy, or godly. I just wish there was an option to go down and explore the planet (no not like what you can do now), but able to ride vehicles, and sit down and enjoy the alien beaches and what not. Other than that I love the game :D, and hope to see even more features being added."
