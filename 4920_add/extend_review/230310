,Not Recommended,230310,12882508,"Posted: 10 November, 2014",all,[GANK] st△rrifyx.,"Tl;dr: It's a decent hack 'n' slash game with good artwork, can get repetitive, made primarily for mobile devices, DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM SINCE IT'S FREE ON DESURA. Read below for more info.I bought this game months ago (during a sale, phew!), and at first I remember I loved it. I loved the artwork, I loved the hack 'n' slash. I simply found this through browsing Steam, not their Kickstarter. I used to love just hacking and slashing, one downside was that to get better loots you have to do the same missions a few times with higher difficulty, just like other games, but this one doesn't make the higher difficulty more fun, it's rather boring to do it again and again in fact. (Which it still is now.)As of writing this on November 11, 2014, yes, this game is free on Desura. Yes, there is micro-transaction, which is because this game was supposed to come out on iOS and Android as well. However, reading the comment section of their Kickstarter, there isn't any news on the phone versions yet. The weird controls are a result of this game being primarily a mobile game. You only use mouse left and right clicks which can be extremely irritating if you normally use WASD to move around.The developing team is literally 1 person alone, and he had 2.7k people back the game with a total amount of 200k USD. Despite that, I didn't have high hopes after downloading it again today. In August, 2014, in which he replied comments on Akaneiro's Kickstarter, the developer explained the slow progress was due to him being alone in the whole development, HOWEVER, after the Kickstarter success in February 2013, he had since 1 failed and 1 successful Kickstarter campaign, both on different projects, with the latest successful one in August, 2013. So is he slacking off on developing this game?I was fine with just going along and playing the game like I used to. However, I couldn't even load the one mission I wanted to play... I'm sorry but for now, I cannot recommend this game, especially since it's made for mobile WITHOUT controls for PC players, and its horrible development."

This game is ""that one game"" for many people. Spicy Horse has essentially abandoned the development of this game (they posted that the development team has been reduced to 2 members), leaving out many features such as Co-op (They have been claiming that multiplayer will be implemented since 2011), yet still left in the general chat box that connects to no one. They also mentioned that even though this game was a complete financial flop, they will leave the servers open to people (As even though there is no multiplayer, you must still log into their servers to actually play), which they claim they are ""Taking one for the team"" and losing money keeping the servers open for the handful of folks who still play. Honestly, I figure that if they closed the servers there would have been a much larger backlash from people still waiting for this game to enter its full state.They even had the audacity to leave in their Cash Shop along with the cosmetic items that cost real money. I am aware that some people do still play this game, but the original concept of this game has been completly gutted and trimmed into a shell of what it was promised to do upon initial release"

Was cool to have the option to summon a random character to help you out a bit, at least. I was shocked this game brought little to no profit to the developers. After the big changes that were made to the game, like changing the control keys (they used to be very well thought out, now they're confusing to use), I don't mind if a game is difficult, but the character is suddenly extremely weak physicaly and I have to heal every few seconds and constantly runaway from even one monster to avoid getting killed.. aaand ofc microtransactions.. I don't mind it as long as it's actually worth it, but here, it's not. Looked through everything and even though I was open to buy some of the karma crystals and/or shards, there's actually nothing really worth spending money on. Shame.. It used to be such an awesome and fun game in the beginning. *sad face* :("

If you buy this, you're just an idiot like me. Don't be an idiot.As a free to play game, it's pretty bad. F2P usually means MMO. In this case it means barely functional. The UI is terrible and hard to figure out. The camera isn't controlled, so melee tank classes are highly favorable. Levelling up is a mystery (does it do anything?). Coming from having played many ARPGs, this one is definitely different. And not really in a good way."

I regret buying this product, and I've seen them adveritising and kickstarting other games. I don't think they care for this game anymore, now that I've heard they lost like $2m of what they put into the game when the kickstarter campaign was only asking for $200,000. I sense a little corruption here and I'd stay SO FAR away from this game before you think about buying it. Try it when it has come out of early access, when it does become an actual free to play game. Or alternatively, I think there is a legit browser-based version of this (same content) that you can play FOR FREE.- - - -Parts of my original review, some edited.I also disapprove making this game free to play and having it ridden with in-game stores, in-game currencies, bypassing gameplay and easy leveling/gear acquiring. I will be really disappointed if they stick to this because in my opinion it's very corrupt, and I'd rather pay full price than to have store updates, store discounts, and other cash-related ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shoved in my face. This game has a lot of potential if they would just leave this out of the game. It reminds me a little of The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, and the in-game currency system pretty much ruined the 'fun' and 'drive' for me.The only issue I've had with the game is that, once you get the starter pack, you need to claim your items from the in-game mail system in the village ON YOUR FIRST EVER CHARACTER and put your items in your stash if you ever decide to delete the FIRST CHARACTER. Making a character, then deciding you want to delete it BEFORE acquiring the exclusive items, will delete them. I know this from experience, and I'm now awaiting a reply from Spicy Horse support regarding this awful situation. I'm sure it will be resolved, however I don't think I could recommend this game with out warning others first.*****NEW EDIT************* It never got resolved, and my hope was diminished. I actually messaged them and a few weeks later after the incident - they finally got back to me and said that they couldn't give me the shards, they could only give me the items, like the food, Steam necklace, etc, BECAUSE since I bought the game and had the problem and WAITED for a reply from their support, their Early Access starter pack changed it's meaning - but they still advertised it on their store page. I was extremely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at this. They couldn't give me the red or blue shards (these are used to purchase things, and blue shards are extremely hard to come by, unless you pay for them for in-game currency) so, I basically bought a FREE TO PLAY game, because I don't use EXP boosting food, or any♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. I bought a free to play game!!! For £6.99! Outrageous.- - - -Hugely disappointed in Spicy Horse, I loved the hour or so I had on Alice Madness Returns (double check your origin version of the game, there are bugs, I hit a massive glitch and I can't get any further now with out rebuying the game on Steam cos I'm guessing you keep that up to date) and I had high hopes for this game. I even made a video about it and expressed why the micro transactions and the whole free to play state of mind will crush any chances of this game being good. I was right. I can't recommend.Hugely disappointed.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off I paid money for it, and I refuse to stick up for it just because I did. Spicy Horse get your act together please!!!!"

A bit grindy at times, but not too bad, even for me who usually get bored with a game when I have to grind can deal with it and go through with it.The art style is beautiful and the music doesn't become bothersome.

So I thought ""Yeah a Diabloesque beat'em up that looks like Okami, but with Little Red Riding Hood as a demonhunter instead of the goddess Amaterasu as a wolf.""   So I forked out the money......And that's just the start of where this game falls apart.  This game should have been free from the start, as the game relies heavily on IAP.  Enemies escalate quickly while upgrading for equipment is a joke.  As well, it costs currency to add new skills to your character.  Nor is the character selection balanced, enemies will tear through your defensive character because of their heavy damage and the ranged character is simply too weak at everything to do anything other than get mobbed to death.  So only the slayers worshipping Little Red Riding Hood...oops I mean the Maiden in Red are effective in this game, so instead of hitting a wall at 3rd or 4th stage of the game - they might go as far as 6th.The game is also ridden with bugs and crashes a lot.  And the makers of this game have essentially given up on this game and say they have gutted their Akaneiro crew to two programmers spending time to deal with the huge problems in this game.  Yikes...considering how much difficulty they have with their new games elsewhere, you can expect a patch for this game a decade from now.This game has beautiful artwork and a nice if rather empty pseudo-Japanese styling (I've seen larger and more active town populations in old SNES RPGs and the first Diablo than this game).  That's the only positive to this game.  Otherwise this game is mired down in a ton of problems and isn't going to improve.  I have only one purchase regret for Steam and it's this game."

The game itself was pretty enjoyable and things were working well, in addition it was a sort of different take on the game style (in terms of the character options and enemies).  I though the game was sure to be out within a short time.  Since then if anything the games seems to have fallen into disarray, things that did work no longer do and strange archaic systems have been added.

I simply cannot move my character toward myself easily, as there is so little ground to click on with that view. I was expecting a view more like what I see in the village or the gameplay videos that made me decide to buy.I cannot reccomend this.

It will inevitably be F2P, but the starter items you get with the purchase will hold you over for quite a while. The art style reminds me of Japanese paintings, the traditional sounding music fits the atmosphere perfectly, and the pacing has been good.I was surprised to hear that the game has a lot in common with Bastion, but after seeing how they did the town I can see it.At this point in early access the game is designed to start sending you back to the earlier areas at higher difficulties to allow you to grind xp and items. Enemy variety has been good for the early part of the game, but the maps appear to be static. I have always felt that randomized areas help give dungeon crawlers longevity so it'll be interesting to see what they do.I suggest starting with the Fortitude character, currency is shared as well as the stash so if you decide to have multiple characters it's easy to pass stuff between them.It also appears that you can summon an ally, even if offline, and they will get rewards for it. Very cool concept."

I bought a game that is probably going to simply sit on my account.  It has features belying it to an MMO, but they're missing all three letters.  Massive - The game seems rather small, in what I can figure are up coming areas I've yet to be. Multiplayer - It certainly WANTED to be at some point, but it fell short in the fact that... you play by yourself.  Sure the character creation screen is limited due to them wanted to be online, and sure they have a number of purchasable features in game, but I came into this expecting a single-player action-adventure rpg.  What I got was some kind of purgatory between a Multiplayer game and a Single-player campaign.  Online - When you first get onto the game you're greeted with a ""Connecting to online"" screen briefly.  This surprised me as nothing I had seen said anything about it being online.  You then go to your typical MMO character creation screen and, subsequently, build your character.  Then you have to create a name, and anyone who's played an MMO before knows how arduous a task this is... I digress, but after several different tries I got one that worked. Then I connected to the game.And I was alone.There was not a soul to be found, save the NPCs that eventually show up in town.  The little chat box at the bottom lay barren, devoid of any purpose as there was nary a soul to talk to.The game-play itself isn't bad, it plays a lot like guild wars.  The story seems to be there, but the awash of MMO features seem to render it bland and leaving of a bad taste in ones mouth.  Purgatory seems a good way to describe it.  Like a sort-of Limbo, never will you feel more isolated and alone than if you were to play this game."

As it stands now though, the game feels like nothing more than a Free-to-Play MMO, quality wise. The stages follow the mobile method of finish one numbered area then move to the next which you will be scored in with gold and exp. Each single stage has three levels of difficulty which is unlocked when the previous difficulty is completed.While this system works in mobile titles, it suffers here because it severly hurts the games ability to tell a story. Right now, before each stage, you are only given a small slideshow of pictures explaining the events leading to it.

Exactly i wouldn't.I really wish Steam would enforce a policy, where publishers have to openly tag their offers as Mobile games be they ported or multiplatform.I am a Windows PC custommer and Thats the platform I want to buy games for - not simplistic mobile ports.On top of that this game is the prime example of a failed Early Access/Kickstarter/Whatever.I understand that a Early Access purchase is not the promise to deliver a complete game later, but rather the promise to try - and many will obviously fail to do so.Problem is, many tiny dev companies do a Early Acces without any realistic chance to ever successfully deliver, biting of far more thean they can chew.This game is why I almost never buy Early Access anymore, unless I feel strongly compelled by a product or devteam."

The fluid dicipline system is a good bonus. Being able to go through a 'hunt' or dungeon once (before I had to grind in order to gain enough in-game money to continue) and get gear I could use was refreshing. I first tried the standalone client, then the browser and eventually switched to Steam. This game has a lot of potential to break the norm. I  have experienced some bugs that did not totally hinder my game.What I found dissapointing was finding out that the game has been abandoned by most players and that an active community does not exist. Upon first deciding to try out the game I was banking on it being an MMO only to find out it will have a co-op feature in the future.I thought overall the game was good, still needs fine tuning and attention. I don't know if after this long it's going to succeed unless somehow enough resources are accumulated (through Spicy Horse or a different company that potentially takes it over) and it's really given some TLC.Some suggestions I thought of while playing:-Bigger inventory or base storage.-The option to use they keyboard to move and fight.-More character customization.-More tutorial/walkthrough in the beginning on more complex concepts than moving and attacking.-Make dropped items easier to see and/or pickup, perhaps with an auto-pick up option.-Be able to preview multiple pieces of armor at once (esp. with special items.)-Because the game is dungeon-based make some aspect of that more in-depth, original and unique. Somethingdifferent from all the other dungeon-based games out there.I'll hold onto the hope that development begins soon, it being 2015. However, until then, I don't know how much longer I will play.Finally, I would reccomend the free versions of this game for first time players, if any. If you like it a lot, buy it on steam. Otherwise, wait."
