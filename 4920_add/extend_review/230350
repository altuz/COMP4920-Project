76561197984295728,Recommended,230350,8278676,"Posted: 25 December, 2013",all,reaper_g,"I just picked this up a few weeks ago (having considered it a few years earlier), it's good for what it is but you will need to read up and be prepared to solo for a few weeks.As I'm seeing lots of unfavourable reviews, I start with a few warnings:Initial Account registation is confusing, you have to make three, one square enix, one play online (using your CD Key ) then you need to add subscription details including a subscription for every character you want in game (you can play all classes on 1 character, alts are used only for increased inventory space)This game is old:the default graphics settings hurt (they're at PS2 quality) you will need to change settings before you play.The default control bindings are really odd, you will want to look at the manual.You won't have your hand held through quests (you need to read the quest text and will likely need a wiki open at all times).The economy is not freindly to beginers, you will find no items suitable for beginers on auction (although good leveling gear is available through other means).The patcher is awful and updates (especially after instal) will take AGES.What this game does offer is a very old style MMO, in which progression is still reasonably hard and in which you won't be gifted with gear all the time (after lvl 50). You still have real choice in how you gear and will need to learn your classes.If you like the mechanics of MMOs 11-7 years ago and want one that's still active pick this up, it's also got decent storylines if you chose to follow the mission chains.Some other points:The game has made soloing and leveling much easier very recently, addtion of a system where you can get a party of up to 3 NPCs means you can level at a decent pace when solo and exploring all the content of the first 3 expansions (sure they can do stupid things but there are failsafes, like they can't pull).The break point for content that's actually run by endgame players is around lvl 75-80 (this will take a few weeks), note that the quest to raise the level cap from 70 to 75 is very hard for some classes and you may want to main a class that finds it easier."

World is still beautiful looking today and the amount to do in the game dwarfs any other game I can find. Classic FF jobs, great people, and still getting content and missions. If you haven't tried it you are missing out on probably the greatest Fianl Fantasy ever."

,Recommended,230350,8483837,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,Wholesome Shipposting,"If you came here looking for accessibility, turn away NOW.With that said, even though this game is difficult to get into, once you've got it working, it's a great game.The graphics aren't great - PS2 Quality - but you'll get used to them. Unfortunately, the registration is a mess, but after your first-time load of the game it works perfectly (At least, on my PC, and my PC is...crap to put it bluntly, so it should work well on most PCs)Also of note - the game is locked to a 30 fps cap. This can be a massive deterrent to some, so I feel it's necessary to note here.Summary:+Enjoyable gameplay and sensible level progression system.+Whole game accessible on a single character.=Graphics are...acceptable.=Might be a little complicated for some.-Registration is...♥♥♥♥ing horrible. Took me 4+ hours to get the game working.-30fps capVerdict: 7/10"

,Recommended,230350,8538814,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Monasterysu,"This was the first MMO I picked up late in 2005, so the game was already a cpl years old back then. I remember how pixelated it all looked and the days of getting a ban for using a 3rd party windower programme.Now SE made and placed their own windower function and the graphics are really not that bad on a high end gaming computer of this era.To this date I still keep returning, because it is the game that taught me never ever to whinge about grinding. Getting 10 factions to exalted in WoW's MOP..pfft easy. This game showed me a community of gamers, mature, fun, friendly and being able to change classes without changing character...a dream.You may moan ""why has this game still got a sub?"" The way YOU SHOULD see this is...""The game has been running successfully for 11 years, it has no need to shut it's sub down because IT WORKS.""I spent many nights playing with the NA community as well as the JP community early morning, the auto translate function is one of the best things I have seen in an MMO and I am glad they carried that over to FFXIV;ARR. With new content came new areas, challenges, beasts and classes. I still think to this day with all the mmo's I have played, this one has had the best line up of class variety.Yes ok, it is based on the Asian mmo tradition of xp party grinding, no xp from quests, a death penalty (we've all had that problem..ding..mob pull..death...de-level). You moan this game sucks, it's too hard..I suggest the game isn't designed to be easy, to hand you tier gear earned from doing a few dungeon runs, no. This game either makes or breaks you.SqEnix always bring great lore and story to their games, and FFXI is no different. I have noted changes since returning for example, it feels more soloable in areas, though it seems Red Mages have been replaced so for this RDM I will continue to dabble every now and then and look forward to more new content they bring to the game."

Only purchased the Steam copy purely so i could leave a well-deserved thumbs-up review for what is without doubt the best MMO RPG to date.  Cannot recomend this game enough.  Mechanics, lore, community, interface, depth, challenge, humour, performance.  Everything 10/10.Still going strong with a paid subscription delivering a solid product tried and tested for over a decade.Has a reputation for being hard to set up, but this is only a problem for people who have trouble keeping track of multiple usernames and passwords.  I feel that the rigorous security procedures are worth it and as i keep good records, i never had a problem.FFXI still needs some steam achievements and trading cards/badges ! This game deserves it after so long."

I have many, many more than 0.4 hours clocked by now.In true SE style, the installation and account creation is an absolute mess. It is for FFXIV:ARR/HW as well.But once you get past that, and if you can look past the 2003-era graphics, it is an FF MMO as it was meant to be. If you find that XIV is too easy for you -- legit complaint, since most hardcore raiders have Alexander (Creator) Savage on farm with 4 months to go until Stormblood is out -- then maybe the no-hand-holding, butt-spanking brutality of XI might be right up your street.XIV gives you an essay and a map.XI gives you a set of coordinates and a pat on the bum. Best pray you've bought the map for the right area, and you don't aggro some random mob 20 levels above you on the way.Awww,what a cute little le--- ONESHOTKILLGAMEOVERGGKTHXBAI11/10 would trek for an hour just to get killed and then return to homepoint again"

All in all its fun annoying can solo or party , and with a lot of new exciting stuffs in development this old game still has a lot in it.

,Recommended,230350,11491287,"Posted: 31 July, 2014",all,jamie havok,"Now is deffinitly a good time to return to ffxi with a new character, you dont need to rely on abyssea leech parties anymore to gain xp, you can level quickly in the old areas solo using trusts (like npc mercenaries) while still not completely gimping your skills so you dont have to spend any time in skillup parties, Any skills which are a bit low you can now buy books that skill them up! Also if you liked the old mission content, chains of promathia and the like, thanks to the trust npcs you can now solo these missions not too far above when you'd do them in a group in the old days, eg promyvians can be done at lvl 35 with trust npcss and are still quite challenging, maybe lower with 1 friend and the rest trusts! Havent delved into the new end game level 99 content yet but apparently end game is more low mannable than before, which would suit more casual players. (more 6 man content than 18 man content)  So if your looking to return to ffxi on a new character especially its a great time to do so! in comparison new characters at the start of the level rise from 75- to 99 were at a severe disadvantage a few years back"
,Recommended,230350,29914459,Posted: 13 February,all,Elfezen,Final Fantasy XI is the first Final Fantasy MMORPG and one of the first games that started the MMO genre. Its still a very successful mmo with really good story and gameplay which is definately worth playing just like every Final Fantasy title.

Still for a new player there is tons of content available, over 10 years worth of content and most of the misions can be done solo for anyone who is interested in the story, COP being my favorite, for £25 it really is not too bad for someone wanting to indulge in the story line. Most worlds still have around 1000 people + on peak time so there is still a community. Overall you get what you pay for."

The story is solid but the control system is a little clumsy and you seem to get very little direction in where and what you need to do in game.In truth though I would not recomend this game to anyone who comes to it new because of previous comments and because the difficulty I have had in just getting the game loaded and working. Nearly 2 months after buying the game I have finally got to a point that almost got me into the game. Its taken several e-mails (Most ignored) to Square Enix. They think they have it figured out now but I'm not holding my breath.UPDATE:I have gotten so frustrated with the lack of customer square enix that I have asked Steam to refund the product. It is not worth the hassel and certainly not worth the amount of money that Square are asking for it."
