,Recommended,230650,7824093,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Charon,"I'm a big fan of games that try to do something different. Lords of Football attempts to marry the football management experience with a sims-lite player management experience. How successfully it manages that seems to vary on a person by person basis. It may not be spreadsheety enough for the Football Manager fans and not Simsy enough for Sims fans.Personally, I love it. The unlicensed football-lite side reminds me of Sensible Soccer and the Simsy side... well yeah obvious. The point is, the resulting gaming experience is pretty unique and great fun. What's more, the dev team is taking the usual indie route of listening to players and working hard to improve aspects of the game. Consider the newly released database editor allowing you to fully customize all the teams and players to your heart's content.Ultimately, I like this game. I think the IP has potential and the developer has potential. I've clocked up 63 hours of playtime and I'm not done with it yet. Your mileage may vary but if you want to try something different then give it a shot, you might just find yourself hooked."

The managment styled training portion of the game is the best thing about it, where once a game starts it is a different story.The games are slow, and come with a stratagy focused look to them, but there really is no stratagy, you command some players to do special tasks, and you have a limited amount of times you can command your players before it recharges, it would be just swell if the commands weren't the only way to score goals in the game, but sadly, that's not the case, as the AI are so astoundedly stupid that leaving them be without any commands is pointless.Overall the game is brilliant at first glance, but after spending some time with it you realize issues, and those issues pile on top of each other, and really make the game unpleasant to play.3/10- Would probably play here and there again for the concept, but then realize how undeveloped it feels, and put it back down."

Its about managing the players, keeping track of their progress and their addictions and making sure they are good for the real match. Different players will have different personalities, some will like to party, some like to get drunk, some like to gamble etc. The match play is not bad, You can choose to watch and give commands or simulate the match. Once you achieve some objectives set by the chairman, you can build additional stuffs or upgrade. Controls are quite easy however tending to each players, controling their addictions and to reduce their addictions are not very user friendly.Theres no finance aspects to take care of, transfer market only available in the open period, you cannot scout in advance or sell players by setting the price, everything is done by the chairman. Theres not much things to do except tending to players, training, building and playing match etc.Overall, unless you have spare money to try something different, this game does give some creative sparks but will not be able to keep your interest long enough. If you are looking for more in depth game play, players and such , Football Manager will be way up there.5.5/10 (If you really have some spare spare money wana try something different or take a look)Shineshine logging out."

Gameplay develops for several in-game seasons (depends on how fast you get achievements and your position in league), opening new facilities to make player training more specific. Evolving of bad habits of players is also fun.Matchday simulation has unique and very addictive control system. Much like Bioware games you can give instructions for certain players (sprint, pass, kick, etc.) on pause and then look how they play it.

This plays a little like Sims but without much control.In the day time you train your footballers.  The simulation is not very deep as you assign to each individual task (such as passing, shooting, strength and endurance)At night you assign each footballer a task that they enjoy and hopefully they will not come back symptomatic.The game lacks depth in all of the areas described above.https://youtu.be/cpuqtIAb-nc"

And the controls for when you play the actual matches are janky, to say the least.Obviously if you're after a proper football management game, well, you're already playing Football Manager, aren't you? The spin on this was to give it a bit of a Sims feel, but there's not really enough of that. You never really feel it's John Terry running around with his philandering."

It's a bit difficult to describe this game. The football side is not as overly detailed as Football Manager for instance, but then again, that would take the fun out. Here, you aren't just constantly looking at numbers. Not to say that the life simulation is all that. It's not on the level of The Sims. It is what it is. It's just... Different. Fresh. It's not for everyone, but I certainly enjoy it. Even though it might not be the best in either of the two genres it tries to combine. For instance, I see people complaining about how managing all the addictions isn't easy. But it isn't supposed to be. They're supposed to be humans, not mindless drones. The best moments in this game are when you just let loose a little bit. Sure, my main striker was staying out late pretty much every evening, not showing up for practice, starting conga lines in the streets or sleeping on the sidewalk. But he kept banging in goals and ended as the league's top scorer. So who am I to judge? I hope this game gets a sequel. Because there certainly is enough to improve on. But this game is also one with great potential to build upon."

I thought I'd set the team to play fast passing football with fairly high pressure to hold possesion. DON'T TRY THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK. When I told my players in the in-game instructions to pass a short distance, they would run that distance, stop, and then pass the ball. It was not uncommon for an opposing player to sweep in in this time and steal the ball away. I wouldn't have to worry of course, because the floaty physics means that I can walk back and catch up with play again. Not that it matters, because even when I ask my players to man-mark, they just keep doing the same thing.Despite all this, I didn't lose a game.For people who don't like football and don't like the Sims."

They're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and they get drunk and they're lazy.  Just keep playing FM20xx.  It's way better even though they're totally different.  This game is not very rewarding like FM tends to be.
