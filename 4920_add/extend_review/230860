,Recommended,230860,12183023,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,Xemu,"Very fun, highly recommend for same-screen competitive battling.  Sort of a light RTS mixed with tower-trajectory style gameplay.  It's not super deep but I easily got my time and money's worth."
,Recommended,230860,19682190,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,RockstarCRO,"I will recommend this game but cautiously. It is fun, it does come with a large selection of tower choices, has controller support, it is local co-op (with controller support) and it does have two parts to it's campaign. It does fall a bit short in keeping the gamer's attention.Cannon Brawl brings a new sort of game style to the table. Similar to Castle Storm (which is also a good game), Cannon Brawl's purpose is to destroy the opponents castle. Unlike Castle Storm (which has it's own rooms to upgrade weapons), CB doesn't allow you to see into your castle or upgrade a javelin like device to take out your opponent. What you are working with though is a hero (of your choice after completing a bit of the campaign) where each hero have their own special ability (such as one hero heals towers when in proximity). The approach the game has taken towards commanding ones towers is quite admirable.In fact, it's what probably separates the game from being another boring Castle VS Castle type game. Unlike Castle Storm where you can summon and control your hero, you are ALWAYS in control of your hero. The hero flies through the air to either build new structures or command a tower. Before building anything, the hero needs to grab territory VIA using hot air balloons. When these balloons are placed, the player may build within the vicinity. The balloons also provide extra protection as they can take a hit instead of a bullet or bomb hitting your tower. Gold is the currency used by the game to build new towers on the landscape. To acquire gold (or diamonds), the player must build a gold mine on top of either element. Diamonds may not be available to build on and the player may have to shoot away at the ground to properly expose them. Upon acquiring enough currency, the player may build a tower. These towers (to name a few) come in form of a simple cannon tower, a rocket tower (which shoots out a grouped rocket which then spreads out), a shield tower (to protect from nasty air assaults), a laser/rail gun tower, a bomb tower that launches a walking bomb, and a bank tower that can bribe one of your opponents towers to take it over.I haven't mentioned all the towers but there are quite a bit to choose from. There is a key combination I found that usually leads me to victory using the gold mines, shields, rocket and laser tower accordingly. Some towers have adverse effects such as using a laser tower against a shield tower. If the laser does fire onto a shield, the shield will rebound the laser in another direction. If you fire in the wrong direction or angle, you can expect a shot going back your way eating away at the ground and dropping your tower from an obscene height leading to destruction. All towers are available for upgrade and make the game even more interesting. I have mentioned that the ground can be blown up as seen in Worms Armageddon. This is a great feature to the game and really makes you think of the locations regarding gun placements.Visuals are suited to the games cartoon atmosphere. The effects after something blows up or when something hits a shield is visually apparent. The sounds are equally as good as they reflect exactly what you are doing whether it's flying, shooting, or defending. The music is enjoyable and the menus are presented extremely well. If you can find local co-op easily, you know you've got a good interface. Navigating the campaign mode is done on a giant map. There two levels to choose from as you progress : the next mission and puzzle levels. Puzzle levels can be survival to trick shots.Overall, a good game but not worth it's stated price. Even when it was on sale I was still on the fence. I do enjoy the game and come back to it here and there, but once you've had your fill or have beaten all there is to beat, you may not like it anymore. I definitely enjoyed my time playing it.RATING : 7/10GameplayBStory / CampaignB-Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallB-"
,Recommended,230860,32553619,Posted: 18 June,all,Pantabulosin,"I had been interested in this game for a long while and I finally bought it when I saw it on sale. I've only played single player modes so far but I've had a lot of fun with the game. At any rate, let's provide some more details.Cannon Brawl is a light hearted RTS where you have to pick a pilot and a set of tools before entering battle. two opponents sit on opposite sides of the terrain and the person that destroys the enemy HQ wins. Each pilot has a unique skill and does better with certain weapons and the weapons are fairly varied.What I liked most about the game was that it took RTS elements and made them applicable to a 5-10 minute match, so I feel like I can play a few matches here and there without having to make the kind of commitment games like AoE require. I also enjoyed that you don't really know what the opponent brings to the battlefield, so you have to try to adapt somehowI haven't tried online, but I understand it is mostly dead. However, I still think the game is worth 5 bucks on sale and I personally bought a 2-pack to play with a friend down the line.In terms of negatives, the game plays best with a controller, so if you don't have one you'll probably not get as much out of the experience."

This game has a lot of charm, and a neat little mechanic of having to travel to the turret in order to operate it.  It also has pretty good use of a variety of turrets.While the game started well and was quite enjoyable, the game's mild annoyances for me become too annoying in the later levels; I completed up through Level 13 and accomplished some of the Puzzle levels.The Good:+ Charming game and I really liked the early levels+ Good graphics, art style, and animations+ Nice campaign and looks like quite a few levels+ Nice twist and adds something new to the ""artillery"" games+ Has multiplayer  (I've only done the solo player campaign, but seems like a great option)The OK:~Tower selection Cooldown.There are cooldowns even before you can select the next tower to build from the Castle.  Why?~""Actions Per Minute"" Star Rating?I understand and agree with beating a mission by a certain ""Time Limt"", but that's a different Star Rating, and I like that one.  But if I beat the mission in a certain time, why does it matter how many actions I did or DIDN""T do ?   APM simply measures how ""busy"" you are; which has nothing to do with how well or effective you played.~Tower Placement.The placing of the buildings to be built which dangle beneath your airship as if you are transporting them to where they go.  This isn't intuitive for placement selection and is mostly problematic when trying to place ""territory expanding sky-balloons"" which I kept having to settle for ""close enough"", yet end up NOT being close enough after all...~Every level is something new.A new tower this level, another new tower next level.  A dozen levels into it there's just all sorts of stuff -- just seems too quick; no time to enjoy the turret you just got.  It's like they couldn't decide which towers to include in the game so they through them all in, or they didn't want to make enough levels to support gradually introducing them.  They should either remove some tower types or create more levels so as to introduce them at a better pace.The Annoying:-I apparently stink at this game.I shouldn't have to TRY this hard to complete some of these levels...on NORMAL...and I don't mean ""complete with a 3 star rating"", I mean ""just-crawl-your-beaten-down-carcass-across-the-finish-line"" complete.  I'm clearly doing something wrong.  If I wanted a greater challenge that's what higher difficulty settings are for, and puzzle/challengs maps, and getting all Star Ratings.  Not simply trying to complete a level and having my ""castle"" handed to me...   again, I'm clearly doing something wrong on this game.  (My point is, I shouldn't have to watch 'How to Beat' youtube videos or strategies or anything...that might be for playing harder difficulty levels, or finding easter eggs, or seeing how people beat challenges, etc...not just for simply how to get past Level X on NORMAL)Overall this is one of the few games I really want to like but can't recommend because it got annoying and frustrating for me to play.  6 out of 10."

The beginning is easy on you as you learn the basics but it's still fun because it's gameplay is just inherently fun. The campaign gets a lot harder as you progress and the enemy has new buildings you have to fight against before you get them yourself. It also has an XP system where you finish challenges and can compete online to obtain the XP which buys updated buildings and new pilots. All I wish is that more people (such as yourself) buy this great game so I can fight you online. I've never had trouble finding a match but I seem to play the same people a lot and get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked and I want to kick some♥♥♥♥♥myself so go ahead and buy the damn game.

,Recommended,230860,11785421,"Posted: 19 August, 2014",all,gamelord,"This game is real-time Worms with a ton of strategy.  Like most RTS games, you gather resources and build things.  Unlike most RTS games, each individual unit or structure will only attack if you directly control it, unable to be used again until its cooldown expires, but your enemy has the same limitation too.  Land is destructible, so you might choose to destroy that rather than attacking the enemy directly.  You get to choose from a selection of commanders that have different buffs or special abilities.  The campaign is charming, but fairly easy.  The ""nightmare"" campaign afterwards is where you'll have a real challenge, but mostly because the computer cheats.Multiplayer is where this game really shines.  Get a couple friends over and alternate playing some 1v1 matches (the only kind that the game supports), and that will keep you occupied all night.  This game is so accessible that after only a few matches, a new player will be able to compete with someone who's been playing for hours and hours, and the various strategies you can use keep it from feeling stale.  I love this game."

You basically use offensive buildings to try and shoot your opponent's buildings and ultimately blow up their HQ. There are also non-offensive buildings such as mines (mining income) and shields. For each game you get to choose 5 building types and 1 pilot.Positives:Novel and fun.Feels pretty well balanced.Fairly complex gameplay.Negatives:No mouse. It's designed to notneedit, but I still think it would be better.Needs more and bigger maps.Non-aesthetic upgrades are bought with XP (not real-life money thank god).

It is a fresh take on the RTS genre that removes all the layers that usually distracts the players from focusing on the strategy aspect while giving you very precise, direct control of the units. Jumping into the game for the first time, or even just watching it, you *get* the game very quickly because the art and the sound do such a great job of communicating what is happening. You can see literally everything that is happening in the game with one glance. The game is elegantly designed to allow FUN for all skill levels ( even for a filthy casual noob like myself ) with depth of complexity that I will probably never unlock. The art is also spot-on and helps to make every action feel almost tactile and satisfying. I get bored with games in general pretty quickly but this is a game I never hesitate to play when I have the chance."

To put it bluntly, it was worth the money.Instead of the Pro/Con list that most make, I'll put up my thoughts on single and multiplayerSingle:The story is easy to follow and the gameplay keeps it engaging; unlocking new weapons and figuring out not only how to use them in battle but in conjunction with other weapons is incredibly fun.I have to say, my favorite weapons combo is shield and laser beam, coupling them, although at times I prefer to use my own shields to deflect my enemies lasers and destroy their stuff with them.The main campaign will probably last about 2 hours (depending upon your ability to pick up the game) but there are puzzles which can be played but don't need to be to complete the main quests of the campaign.Anything you unlock can be used in single and multiplayer which is a great idea, it makes it worth the time to earn xp and unlock select items.Multiplayer:It's fairly straight forward, same combat as single player but against a person.My experience was one that involved learning and it helped in my single player campaign as I tried multiplayer early on when I had few items and lost because of it.I would definitely suggest this game to anyone who loves strategy or just a fun game to play with friends."

The multiplayer is dead, and you'll only get 3 to 5 hours out of single player unless you want to play the levels over again.  It is one of the best tower defense games I've played.  There is an economy to manage and a fairly large variety of towers.  The game throws new towers at you constantly, and I'm not sure I would call that a positive.  Many of the later towers seem completely useless.  The frustration factor for some of the stages can be high, although all the levels are easy enough to beat if you keep your wits about you.It is fun, but pass unless you can get it for an amazing price."

Cannon Brawl has improved upon both. I haven't played much more than an hour but its experience has immediately brought to mind Swords & Soliders, Worms.... while already securing a place for itself in my memory.The game is quick but that is part of the charm for anyone who doesn't have time for lengthier or more competitive RTS games; the actions-per-minute goals (APM) attached to the early levels are easily attainable and pragmatic. That is, when the game says it expects at least 13 APM, you find yourself nodding in agreement instead of shaking your head in exasperation that anyone could play that fast and not be a professional gamer. There are smart details in user interface as well, with cooldowns being explicitly shown, and previous flight paths of your artillery being logged each time you come back.$14.99 might be a bit much for some people for the length of game you get - on sale it is an immediate must buy.

The game itself is fast paced and has an intuitive and easy learning curve to it. There are multiple viable strategies, however, they are mostly based around the terrain of the map and every strategy has unequal chances different counter strategies. Overall, it is pretty balanced though. The only critique point I have is, that it takes way longer to unlock all towers and characters than it really should.!Important: If you want to enjoy the full game experience, make sure you have at least one friend who has a competetive mind set and is willing to play the game with you.
