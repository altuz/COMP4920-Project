I'll warn you, it can be pretty hit or miss, but if it's a hit, it's a unique experience that you don't want to deprive yourself!  I wish I could tell you all about it, but I can't.  I can tell you plenty of things its like, but I can't really describe it except for in the very abstract.  And my abstract description is that it is a game about learning.  There is little in the way of obvious instruction.  It's up to you to figure it out.  When I first looked at screenshots, I saw random squares in patterns that were aesthetically pleasing.  Now I look at them and see order.  I see several levels of order.  To tell you more about the game would be to rob you of the experience of transitioning from seeing order to seeing chaos as you play this game.As for things its like, I would say it is like...* Learning a new language* Getting lost in a maze, and that joy when you finally find your way out* David Bowie's song, ""Moss Garden""* Discovering that the world is round, firsthand* The NES game, Wario's Woods* Your first kiss* The ""Aha!"" moment that you get when figuring out a puzzle* The 11th Hour, by Graeme BaseIf you play this game, I can't promise you you'll love it.  It is the sort of game that resonate with some people, but will just not be everyone's cup of tea.  What I can tell you is that if it resonates with you, you will REALLY enjoy it, and might find it the most worthwhile game you've bought in a long time."

Because this is such a polarizing game, I can't simply tell you ""TRUST ME AND JUST PLAY IT NOW WITHOUT READING ANYTHING ELSE!"" That isn't helpful at all, so I'll tell you what I can.It is a platformer. You are taught the controls at the beginning, but it is left up to you to learn the rules of the game's world.This is a game where you have unlimited lives, and you will die many many times, but as you get better at playing the game,  your attempts will be spent making progress toward a greater goal, assuming you make it far enough to discover a greater goal.The big downside is that it can take hundreds of deaths before you feel you've made any meaningful progress, and most people won't have the combination of patience, interest, skill, and luck to actually make it that far. By that time, you might not feel that the payoff is worth it. I've gotten impatient several times (and even ragequit on occasions), and I've found that coming back to the game every so often is much better than playing it nonstop to the point of frustration.It's a shame that this game gets so many downvotes. It's reductive and unfair to say that people only dislike the game because they ""don't get it"". You don't even have to consider what the game is saying (or what you think itmightbe saying, if it's saying anything at all).There are people who don't get it, but who more importantly feel that any game thatwantsto say something is inherently pretentious and therefore bad.There are people who think that any game that costs more than zero dollars should have endless unique content baked in and they have therefore been cheated.There are people who only want games with instant gratification.There are people who see square tiles and a ""puzzle"" tag in the digital store and think they're buying a Bejeweled clone.The game looks small, so people expect it to be short and sweet. The assets are fairly minimal, but the game asks you to spend hours playing with the same pieces over and over.If you're the kind of person who cheats at Solitaire because you can't bear the thought of spending a few minutes and not winning the game, then you should probably skip this one.Treasures / 10"

The mechanics are straightforward and quickly discovered, with minimal (though satisfying) variation as the game progresses.  And yet, the endgame demands a mastery of these mechanics which combines split-second precision with frantic fore-planning.Thematic elements draw a lot of ire, and perhaps rightly so in the early game, where they may obscure the depth of the core platforming mechanics.  As the game progresses, these elements grow into a pleasant ambience which complements rather than obscures.The ending is one of the most fantastic I've ever encountered, where mechanics and thematic elements come together unexpectedly to produce a truly unique experience, a disruption of the sense of attachment and satisfaction accumulated over the course of ""mastering"" the game.(At slight risk of spoilers, the reward of Starseed Pilgrim is the journey of learning how it works.  If you prefer a cutscene and a pat on the back after pillaging a game for achievements, you'll hate it.  Go play something with a progress bar.)"

I first played it for the entire length of a three hour web conference and it transformed that waste of time into a mysterious daydream.The game is about exploring the unknown, and it successfully creates the tense feeling of that exploration by refusing to explain itself. The game's mechanics and goals must be discovered, and the rewards of the game are in that discovery. So patience is required, but players are rewarded with a real sense of accomplishment, which creates a powerful player narrative that stands in contrast to the effervescent visual design."

This is a game about discovery.""To which one could reply, respectively:> I can actually see where the ""this is artsy-games-snob-bait"" people are coming from. Please, tell me, tell me about the gameplay, about the story, about how big the discovery element is. Tell me...Many of the above replies were or could have been mine, as I was trying to decide whether or not to buy this game last summer. It has been quite a while since - I have now finished the whole thing -, but I can still remember how lost I was. To put it bluntly, all the other reviews for this game were - and from what I have seen still are - trash. I hope to do a better job and present as much actual information as possible.With that bottled up frustration being finally out of my system, let us begin._The gameplay_- Core gameplayThe core gameplay can be described as such: you are building platforms and jumping on them. You have to think about which seeds you plant where and when, or the platforms will not grow in the right way and you will get stuck and die. The seeds I mentioned are a resource to be carefully managed.If that does not seem fun or challenging to you, I would advise you do not buy this game.- VariationThe way seeds grow, how fast your 'enemy' (not going to spoil that part) goes and how fast you go are a bit different in each level. There are 10 levels and thus 10 variations on the simple mechanics.- ContentAs you can see, I have spent quite a big amount of time playing this game. It is not entirely representative, as some of that time I have, for instance, been trying to count all the levels. How much time you will spend on this game can depend on if you are just going for getting all the levels as fast as possible, how good you are at planning and how good you are at platforming.The 10 levels each have two 'stages', as I have decided to call them. When in the first stage, you can just decide to quickly gather some seeds and get out again, or you can decide to go a bit further and try to get to the second stage. The second stage is often quite hard to reach and on itself also poses a challenge.- The hubworldThe place where you spawn at the start of the game, which I have decided to call the 'hubworld', gives you access to all of the levels. You need to go into the level to be able to get further in the hubworld and reach more levels. Traversing the hubworld can be quite a pain and it often takes a while to get from one level to the other.- RewardsAs mentioned, you have to go into a level to get further in the hubworld. As such, the main incentive to play is, I suppose, the discovery of new levels and thus new mechanics and more challenge. You can also go into a level without having spent all the gathered seeds in the hubworld, which will make the level easier.Furthermore, completing the second stage of a level is rewarded with some poetry.- DifficultyThis is not exactly an easy game. It requires you to think quickly and plan ahead a little and it is surprisingly easy to get stuck. However, the fact that you can adjust the difficulty a bit yourself means that you can take it at your own pace.- Session lengthIf you go into a level just to quickly get out again with some seeds, I'd say you can do that in less than 5 minutes. If you try to get as far as possible, you can go on for a while, as you should, if you manage your seeds well, be able to never run out. Completing the second stage of what I would say is the hardest level, took me hours. At any rate, this is certainly a game that makes you think ""Okay, ONE more go...""And you will spend a lot of time commuting in the hubworld, sadly.- RandomnessRead my reply to poor Chury's review if you want all of the details (do note that some mechanics are different on a level by level basis), but the gist of it is that the randomness can sometimes screw you over, but that it is entirely your fault if it can.- OriginalityIt is a refreshing experience that forces you at times to think outside of the box. I do not know of a game quite like this._The discovery element_It is true that this game does not have a tutorial - except for text telling you how to move, dig blocks and plant seeds - and that rather a lot of things that you need to know to be able to play the game properly are things you will have to find out yourself. To some people this may be offputting, to some an appreciated extra challenge.The way the world is presented is quite mysterious and may, for some people, be a drive to keep playing._The story_- PoetryA story is toldby this mysterious gameabout all the wrong waysto deal with pain.Most of the story is told through poetry.> Ha ha, was that supposed to be poetry?>> Shut up.As one can imagine, the story is rather vague. It is open to interpretation, which, honestly speaking, is quite freaking refreshing. In my experience, story in games is often very direct and to the point. This is the exact opposite of that. In this game, you have to put some effort in to get the message. It forces you to think about it and I cannot fathom why people are condemning it for that. This is exactly what makes a story interesting, right? Some people, however, thought at the sight of the first of many verses, ""I do not recognise this. It is weird... I do not get this, so it must be meant as some kind of personal insult to my intelligence. I hate this game!"", or perhaps they were simply reminded of a few traumatic English classes.[it seems to be the case that there is a character limit. review continued in comment.]"

It's the kind of game that gives you virtually no direction, it just throws you in and expects you to experiment. That kind of game isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy it. The initial confusion does a wonderful job of promoting the themes of exploration and discovery that are at the core of the game. The gameplay itself is very basic: plant blocks that do different things to escape the growing darkness. As you slowly grow your garden of blocks and explore the world, the game reveals that there's more than just your little slice of sky. As for what is out there... well, you'll have to find out for yourself."

First, the player must discover the control scheme and, soon after, interpret the arcane interface. Second, in the existential vein of game design, the player must determine their purpose and chart the course of their journey. If that journey involves discovering the story and reaching the end of the game, then the next step is to develop the skills needed to outrun the encroaching darkness and satisfy the requirements of the 'challenge levels' in the game.If by this late point in the game you understand the control scheme, GUI, have mastered control of your seeds and have discovered that there is, indeed, a story and challenge like levels, then take a moment to step back and realize that this is a game not about gardening, but colonialism.You are escaping from an encroaching darkness, but by upsetting the already existing balance of the new world, you bring that same terrible fate upon a place that would have been better off without your existence. Your constructs, your plants, may seem beautiful, but they are merely decorations, fleeting attempts at meaning and growth which simply provide a foothold for the darkness.With that alone, you should be able to predict the end of this game and the overall message Starseed Pilgrim conveys. What is the historical outcome of pilgrims, fleeing from persecution and slaughter?Pilgrims bring the same darkness with them and, regardless of their noble intentions, spread the same disease they tried to escape.In Starseed Pilgrim, if you can somehow initiate yourself into the esoteric knowledge base required to play and enjoy, then you will not be rewarded further. Knowledge, in this game, is its own reward, and once that has been gained, then the remaining game is very much the equivalent of the Baby-Saving minigame in Stanley Parable: a tedious grind that does indeed become more potent in meaning with time, but spending the required time and effort (and at the time of this review, $5.99) to reach that false 'nirvana' results in self-destruction.Recommended to those who would appreciate Starseed Pilgrim as a piece of fascinating artwork, the kind of person who wants games to travel the route of James Joyce into oft-inaccessible academia. Definitely not recommended to those looking for a fun romp in an indie game: go play Terraria or Minecraft instead."
