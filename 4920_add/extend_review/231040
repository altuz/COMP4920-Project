It is an excellent addition to your library if you like a very casual slow paced puzzler or if you have kids. I got this game thinking it was more music driven ""crazy arcade adventure"" than it really is. The music is more of an ambiance thing than the driving force it is presented as. Don't purchase this for the music or the platforming (of which there is none). I would consider this more of a puzzle game than anything else."

Fun for the first couple levels, then gets tedious and repetitive.  Several level breaking bugs on the last couple levels of the game that require complete restarts, buggy controls (using xobx 360), final game breaking bug that doesn't fix even with restart on last level keeping me from being able to complete the story.  The soundtrack is good, along with the level backgrounds, and overall aesthetic but I found myself just trying to finish for the sake of finishing rather than because I was having fun.  Couple this with the numerous bugs I ran into and I can't justify $10.  Pick it up for $2-$3 or less to have a little fun.  Other than that save your money.  Mediocre at best.  3/5"

While it's got a lot going for it, I just can't get past how buggy it is. Although I did manage to complete it, it wasn't without some serious issues. Several times I got stuck in various ways that prevented further progress - sometimes it was a matter of a game event not triggering properly, and sometimes it was due to going some way the game wasn't expecting me to (apparently). I also encountered issues where the controls would just stop working for no reason. Restoring to the last checkpoint sometimes fixes the issue, but this is rarely the case. Most times, there is no choice but to start the level (or entire chapter) from scratch. Do you know how annoying it is to have 30-40 minutes of progress wiped out, have to start over again, and hope you don’t make the same game-breaking mistake again (whatever it was)? Let me tell you - it's really f%@*&g annoying. I ended up having to do that multiple times. And would you believe, as a final bug-ridden cherry on top, the very end of the game also glitched out on me as well? Well, believe it. So on top of all the other frustration I experienced just getting through the game, I didn’t even get to see the full conclusion of the story.Now, putting all of that aside, what’s actually good about Beatbuddy? Quite a bit, actually. The hand-drawn layered 2D graphics look great, the controls are responsive, the puzzles are generally well-designed, and the music is decent. And that’s a good thing, because the music plays a large part in the gameplay - the environment works in time with the beat of the music, requiring specific timing to pass obstacles or solve puzzles. The first couple of hours are great, as the basic mechanics are introduced. Unfortunately, it starts to lose its luster a little bit after that, as most of the subsequent puzzles are pretty much variations on things you’ve already done several times. So you might start to get tired of it after a while (or maybe I was just burned out from having to replay several areas). I would estimate the overall playtime to be somewhere around 4-6 hours.Overall, the game is not bad, and I enjoyed it while it was working properly. The frustration from all of the technical issues I had just ended up being too much for me to give it a full recommendation. If you enjoy action/puzzle sidescrollers, music-themed games, and/or games with pretty 2D artwork, it’s definitely worth a look. Just be aware of the potential issues. I suppose it could very well be possible that you'd encounter no glitches at all… but I doubt it (several posts in the Steam forums seem to corroborate my experience). At the very least, don’t buy it at full price unless the developers hire more QA people and/or release a patch that fixes the game-breaking issues."

It's a puzzle game about finding your way through labrynth-style caverns and dealing with various timing based boundaries as well as some enemies. It's not a bad game by any stretch but within the first hour you will have a very good idea as to whether it is ""your jam"". The artwork is absolutely sublime but the gameplay is excessively repetitive and the controls can be quite unwieldy at times. The vehicle sections are particularly obnoxious but are thankfully beaten by force alone.I would not buy this game on it's own. If it's in a bundle or extremely cheap on sale and it sounds appealing then you should give it a shot. It's a short and unique game: with even a little bit of patience you can probably finish it in about four hours and not feel robbed."

Snare crabs, bass flowers, etc. When in the submarine, the music sounds pretty good as all the sounds are put together however it's on such a short loop that you'll tire of it quickly. The game moving to the soundtrack was a cool concept but it's execution leaves me wishing that it did more with the actual music.The objective of the game is to solve puzzles and get from one point to another on a 2D plane. The puzzles are boring. They are fairly simple and are pretty much the entire game. The stages are extremely long, about 30 minutes  a piece with the same 3 minute track on repeat.Unfortunatly I cannot recommend this game at 14.99. A fair price is 3.99 or lower."

They just become part of the challenge and I feel you can master them without being too irritated about it.

The scenes of undersea here aren't dark and quiet but lively and bright. The design of the stages with the concept of the beat sound from objects which are interative and those which aren't have their own styles.Second, the puzzles here are simple. However, the standard about difficulty of puzzles is different based on players' different gaming experience and the experience they're seeking from thie game. To me, puzzle games don't have to be hard to challenge but simple to relax myself.So, in my opinion, if you don't want to beat it one day after playing several hours but just relax yourself by playing games, it's good for you, too.Last but not least, the game will be around 2 bucks on sale, which is pretty cheap to get. If you're pretty sure that this game is your type or at least you won't hate this game, I would say it's worth the price with the hours you spend enjoying youself."

The fact that this is an indie game but is still finely made amazes me. Beatbuddy is a beautifully crafted indie game that satisfies your senses with stunning environments and an incredible soundtrack.
,Not Recommended,231040,8948525,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,Sadface,"It's a pretty game at first glance, but there's nothing really going for 'Beatbuddy Tale of the Guardians'.As a little blue dude, you are summoned to go talk to your sister, an 'Etherial' who is one of the main caretakers of the world (I assume). You work your way through worlds that react to the rhythm around them, and by interacting with things, you can progress. But sadly, it's just a glorified platformer that doesn't bring anything new or fun to the table. Nothing even FEELS music based - it just so happens that things pulse to the beat, but you're not really rewarded for good timing or anything - you just move through a world that plays music.The first level took me half an hour to complete, going at a reasonable pace. In that time, I could see that the game was trying to be funny and trying to have intriguing plot elements, but by the end of the first level I was bored, nothing had me hooked, and I quit the game without caring where the story was going.I sadly cannot recommend this game, but to try and give a positive outcome to my review, I would recommend that you, the reader, try playing Aquaria.Aquaria is a slightly similar game with underwater platforming metroidvania-style play, some musical aspects to gameplay, and a great plot. I had loads of fun playing that game, and would happily recommend it instead."

You hover around in beautiful, hand-drawn environments and solve various puzzles to progress through the story. Most often, the puzzles are synced to the music, which really gives it a nice twist of rhythm gaming. The soundtrack is really, really good, the songs are groovy and hypnotic. At certain points in the game, you'll experience situations where environment, music, puzzles and player movement just click together, it's awesome! Definitely recommended!"
,Recommended,231040,8398930,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,internisus,"Pretty cool game.  Plays like a puzzle platformer but without the platforming, since you swim about freely.  Kind of like a simpler Aquaria without the Metroid structure.While a lot of the gameplay is governed by the rhythm of the music, I don't find that this sets the game terribly much apart from platformers with timing-heavy challenges, such as Donkey Kong Country.  Rather, the main draw here is Beatbuddy's personality and soundtrack: every time a character speaks, the text box is backgrounded by a different beatboxing track, and, as you move through the stages, the music changes in complexity depending upon what's happening around you.This sense that features of the level design are actually creating the music doesn't seem as potent or as 1:1 as in some other games that have done similar, most notably 140, but the music itself is good.  Beatbuddy isn't going to blow your mind, but it's an enjoyable experience overall and well worth picking up at a sale price."

In a nutshell, it does have a funky take on mechanics and the music - and the sound bumps - are really pretty cool (though it grated on me after a while of playing it - it's relatively constant). When I started playing, the first thing I noticed is that the bumpity music part of the game really isn't as ongoing as you might think. You bounce off ""bass drum"" bumpers, you have to time yourself to move through tom-tom-like globes, you have to hit high-hat-crabs. To an extent, it does work, but it just doesn't really get executed quite perfectly enough.If you do pick this one up, force yourself to watch through the introduction story, at least half way. It's more evidence of a pretty cool idea."

This isn't a music game either.This is the one and only game where music is a complete part of the gameplay. Enemies and environment create the music. The music is literally played by the objects you see on or near your screen, and the volume increases as you get closer. Your character moves at the rhythm of the music. Most objects and puzzles beat, like the music, and your actions are tied to the beat you're hearing.Plus the music is great. Even more so in-game. Especially level 5.Praise the music. Amen."

,Recommended,231040,9445574,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,Masem,"The concept behind Beatbuddy is smart - it's a platformer (taking place underwater so you have free-form of movement) where there is a constant beat of music where by doing certain actions on the beat makes your progress through the game much easier. You don't need to have the precision of a musican, fortunately, as the game is very generous with beat-matching mechanic as well as frequent checkpoints and health drops. Add in that mst of the music is from the emerging Electro Swing genre, and the game works in concept.  Puzzles are generally of the right amount of effort and complexity, with a decent learning curve to all the various moves, enemies, and obstacles in the game.The major problem I had with the game is that the levels are on the long side - 30-40 minutes, and while the backing song does change with the various sections of each level, you're listening to the same basic music over and over again.  And as this is a bass-heavy track to keep that beat going, it does wear on you over long periods.  The graphics for the levels also get a bit weary.  But as noted, the game wisely has lots of self-saving checkpoints so playing brief segments is possible.  The game is definitely worth your time to play through, though the type that you should keep your eye out for a sale to get."

,Recommended,231040,8422686,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,Serphius,"Bought this during a Winter Sale and was pleasantly surprised by this little gem of a game!Beatbuddy is a rhythmn platformer in which you play as a little dude swimming through a world where music is (literally) life. Nearly every moving object on screen has a set sound, which all combines into a really cool beat that plays throughout your adventure. You must dodge, remove, and blast through many of these objects in order to solve puzzles and clear your way through each level. Think the swimming sections of the old Ninja Turtles game, but without the electricution every two seconds.The world created here is absolutely gorgeous, with smooth animation and vibrant colors. The puzzles themselves aren't typically too difficult, but it will take a little over half an hour to clear each zone with numerous auto-saving checkpoints along the way. You'll run into various other characters, and there's quite a bit of humor and charm with this.The main draw, of course, is the music. The way the various ""creatures"" and objects in the game combine to make a solid rhytmn is marvelous. It's not like a lot of music games that claim objects fit the beat; here, you can see everything bobbing and moving in time with the song. Crabs become hi-hats, jump platforms pulse with bass, snare bubbles open chambers, and lasers are, well, laser beats. What results is an incredibly chill experience that will leave your own head bouncing in tune while you play.I really can't recommend this enough as a hidden diamond among Steam games. During Steam Sales, it tends to dip below $4 and is worth every penny. It was an absolute steal at $1.75."

It's interesting that you can play it with keyboard and mouse (sometimes only the mouse) and with the controller, because you choose how you feel most comfortable with. The story is very interesting, and the gameplay isn't hard to get, since as you play you receive information ""on demand"", that is, when you really need it.

It's an explorative puzzler of a game that will have you dodging obstacles like the conductive hand of the Hi-Hat crab, or bouncing your way through the water on Bass drum plants on the quest to stop the evil prince attempting to take total control of Symphonia's music.Each stage of the game hosts its own unique tune, and it's incredibly fun seeing just what part of the environment is playing each instrument in the composition, with parts picking up or slowing down depending on where you are in the map. They've got all sorts of genres in store here and you're sure to find a favorite or two during your time playing.The art style is also gorgeous, with several layers of hand drawn visuals across every inch of the screen. Every new level hosts  a barrage of eye-popping visuals. From giant coves of crystals, to wide open expanses of sunset colored anemones.I do have a few complaints. Portions of the game that are more fast paced and on the clock can be a bit tricky to maneuver with the underwater controls, as you'll sometimes find your little Beatbuddy drifting in another direction or bouncing off the walls from trying to move too fast. I almost find it better just tapping the fast movement button for a quick burst as you're first taught in the game, rather than holding it down.Another bit of an issue can be the combat. It's not too often at the start, with just a mere enemy or two to smack. However when a multi-targeting system is introduced about 3-4 stages into the game, it can be a bit dodgy to use when 5-6 targets are constantly moving about. Thankfully there's usually enough health pick ups to make up for the health loss when I resort to spamming the punch button on everyone in the room.Gripes aside, the main pull of this game is in it's core mechanic, rhythm based puzzling. And that is where it definitely succeeds. There is an incredible charm to seeing the stage move in perfect harmony to the musical score as you solve it's mysteries to move to the next area.I also do enjoy the story and characters dollaped on top. This sort of game could've easily been done with no plot tying it together and more abstract environments, but the plot adds just enough without being too serious or overbearing to affect any enjoyment you'd get. All the characters have fun designs and quirky dialogue to carry it all along, and none of them overstay their welcome or take away from the gameplay. (Even if the character's various beat-boxing voice boxes can get a little jarring to hear after the 12th time that it's looped)I'm getting a real kick out of it, and as of writing this review I happened to pick it up for a steal at over 75%, so it's MORE than worth the money if you catch it on sale. It has it's quirks, but not enough to completely ruin the fun you're sure to have."

So let's take it from the top.The environment is underwater. The beautifully made areas are hand painted, and filled with rock formations, plants, and cute sea creatures. It is all very pleasing to the eye, and generally forces me to smile throughout the whole experience. Also, the environment is not motionless, it is all vibrant, pulsating, bouncing, and swinging to the soundtrack.The main character is called Beat Buddy. It's a small, blue, bubbly creature with big eyes, and... earphones. Whenever you stop to figure out a puzzle, he floats in the water bouncing his head and swinging his arm, like a real DJ. Did I mention it is adorable?The game is basically an action-adventure with loads of puzzles, all focused around the music playing in the background. Each obstacle, element, creature has it's own unique sound which always incorporates nicely with the music, creating a beautiful, energetic soundtrack. From jazzy oldschool sounds, through clubby electronic, and even funky-rocky sounds.While you can solve any puzzle and go through any obstacle without even turning the sound on, listetning to the soundtrack gives you an advantage. The beat, the sounds actually give you small tips and clues, when and how you should move to go through a challenge effortlessly.The puzzles slowly progress from absolutely obvious to very complicated. It requires logical thinking, timing, and a good ear.For me, the game is very relaxing. As I traverse the underwater environment, searching for my friends, hoping to save them.. as I bounce, float, punch my way through complicated labyrinths, I feel myself unwind. The music, the soft but vibrant colours, the sweet personality and feel of the game have a wonderful, positive impact on my mood.So if you would like something gentle, soothing, and adorable. Something that will make you smile, but will still challenge your gaming skills, try ""Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians"". And don't forget to wear good headphones or turn your speakers up."

I have a lower end computer, and for most of the game the fps was fine, which worked for me. I loved the music, and at first worried that I would get sick of hearing the same song for upwards of 45 minutes or so, but it was always just fine, seeing as how it would always play differently depending where in the level you are. The songs are fantastic, no doubt about that. The problems with the game are all in the final level. Many of the puzzling elements are quite forgiving, and moving around each level is relaxing a majority of the time. Not so for the final level. It was buggy (I ran into three bugs within a half-hour), ridiculously hard (most puzzles in the game I cleared on the first or second try, for the final level the last puzzle took me twenty minutes alone), and the game wraps up in a cliched ridden and unsatisfying way. It could have been so much better, had it been anything like the previous levels. The worst part is, it leaves you on a sour note. The last level makes me bring the game from a 9/10 to a 6.5/10. I still suggest you play the game. Just set your BS tolerance on high for the final level."

Lemur,"In a way it's sort of a puzzle platformer, except it's hard to be a platformer when you move around by swimming and there are no platforms. Even though that's where it loosely gets lumped by genre, it already gets a head start on not being just ""oh no, another one of THOSE"".For one thing, the underwater theme allows the levels to wander off in arbitrary directions and be designed around exploring them and using the game's other unique mechanics, rather than the usual focus on precision running and jumping. And those mechanics? That's where the ""beat"" comes in. Nearly every interactive object and enemy makes a sound that's part of the (pretty groovy) soundtrack of the game, and even things that don't make some kind of instrumental sound (e.g. swimming into a wall makes a nice, percussive drum-thump). Fighting/evading enemies, zipping past barriers, and solving puzzles in general ends up having a flow to it that matches the feel of the song used in that level, but without being as restrictive about it as an overt rhythm game is. Kind of like the same basic musical interaction concept as 140, only taken in a completely different direction.The art's rather nice, with enough little details thrown in to give each level a different tone and personality, but clean enough that everything's immediately identifiable. Lots of deep colors going on, which is nice for a change. The characters and story are amusing enough and keep the game moving along. Probably most importantly, the music is good and actually works for what they're doing. They actually pulled off creating a world around half a dozen electro swing songs and stuck a game into it. It keeps making me think of the animated Mr. Scruff videos from a decade or so ago and how someone created a whole world about pies and stuff (it's been a while) around a few songs, only this takes it way further and lets you play around in the world they made."

Follows every concept of good game design.The way music is used to both create and let you create the world, atmosphere, and story, is so simple, so basic, but executed so effectively. It's simply too enjoyable and immersive!The difficulty scales really well until the last level, which feels a bit less difficult than the level before it, which was kind of disappointing.The story is really engaging due to how your actions affect the world. The game is extremely linear, but you really do feel like what you do in each level is determining your progression—uuuuuuuuuup until the game's climax, which was really unsatisfying. Despite that, though, the gameplay picked up the slack.All in all, I highly recommend this game. It kept me engaged throughout the single session I played, in which I completed the game.

It's a beautifully executed casual game. The music is enjoyable to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out after listening to it for 10 minutes.A lot of the controls/environment effects are themed, of course, around the beat of the music... and timing according to that. Though I don't think it adds anything particularly ""unique"" to the game, they implemented it well... and it fits in with the world and story.Pros:-Very beautiful game, the hand drawn environments added to my enjoyment.-It's really fun. When you aren't stuck with a bug.-Not entirely unique, but it puts a good focus on timing your movements with the beat of the music.Neutral:-Controls are a little looser than I would like when interacting with objects, not enough to be a con.-Puzzles, they aren't too hard.. and they arent too difficult.

You're free to go where you want, but the enemies and various obstacles are all based on the rhythm of the soundtrack (which is great, try to listen to it in iTunes). So if you're not fond of this kind of gameplay, maybe you'll not like this game. Plus, the puzzles are not really that hard. It's not an easy game, but it's not really hard either.Because what I like is this kind of ""flow"" you feel when you're playing, your actions matching with the tempo, that feeling that everything is going well, you're ""in"". I don't really know how to explain it, because I feel it, but you got the idea I hope.Pros:- amazing OST if you like electronic music (electro swing and stuff)- easy controlling- the graphics, not really the quality (it's good though) but the atmosphere you know?Cons:- not really hard- low replay valueThose are not really cons if you can enjoy the game enough the first time you play. I think it's worth its price."

In the first few level you might be able to brute force it, but then you’ll hit a road block. So enjoy the game and listen to the music. The better you do the more complex and complete the music gets, and what a good music it is.It’s a good game and a good experience, so give it a try."
,Recommended,231040,29233926,Posted: 13 January,all,TrojanThighs,Beatbuddy is a fun little puzzle game witha  rhythm element. Each of the 6 levels is <1 hour and so a good short experience - Can already see myself going back to this to 100% it and see if maybe there's a speedrtunning community for it.For a game which is so music lead I personally loved the electronic music - especially worth the Sountrack purchase therefore! Very fun and a good example of an indie game worth a playthrough. I picked this up on sale (as I do most things) and whilst this isn't going to blow your mind - it's certainly a fun experience so worth a sale pick up if maybe not quite recommendable at full price. Despite being a good looking game the feel is very much like a retro game. Definitieyl worth a look if you're a puzzle or rhythm gamer.
