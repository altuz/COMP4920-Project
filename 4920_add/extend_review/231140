76561197993263142,Recommended,231140,7759036,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Daemus,"This is one of the best city simulations out there, especially when looking strictly at games with good graphics. That said, it is not without its flaws.The Good:- Lots and lots of replayability. You could get lost in this game on just a single city for weeks.- Your cities interact with each other to an extent. You can trade things like water, fuel, industry, and office services amongst the cities you create. This allows you to specialize your cities, such as creating an industry giant that feeds industry goods to your cities where you want to avoid polution, such as a resort town.- You can point and click your way through everything. Given how many options you have for roads, buildings, etc, the menu is easy to use and allows for quick access to everything.- The game feels like a semi-sandbox during normal play, as there isn't really many restrictions in place (and you can switch the building restrictions off in the settings).- As you build up your city, you get to a point where you realize it isn't just about building anymore. Management becomes a much bigger deal. One of the biggest management challenges is transportation, and that adds something to the game that I find quite enjoyable, making it a bit deeper than it might look on the surface.The Bad:- Some of the mechanics for laying out streets (especially bridges) and buildings can make things a bit frustrating.- The whole Cities XL series are just reboots. They look the same, play the same, and feel the same. This makes for a bit of a hidden ""good"" I guess in that you shouldn't feel the need to own them all (I do and don't have any reason to play any of the previous ones).- They removed the online function that the original had, rather than making it work. The idea of being able to have cities existing in a ""truly global"" world definitely had an appeal.- The developer is lazy. The failure to make online work, some small problems and unfinished features, and the mechanics that are still issues still unaddressed after so much time just speaks to the lack of care the developer has for its work and reputation. They did ""fix"" things to a point where they weren't really game-breaking, but it still sits in my mind that they seem to want to skate by at this point (especially given how much effort they put into trying to create a great alternative to another ""CitySim"" game).If you really like city management/builder games, this gives a good balance between the two and should be able to keep your entertained for quite a while. If you can catch it on a sale, then great! If not, you just need to decide what your dollar is worth. As far as putting a dollar value on fun, you have to do that for yourself, but even with the flaws, the value was definitely there for me given how much entertainment I have gotten from it. Decidedly beats spending the money on gas, a ticket, and some overpriced popcorn and soda at a movie theater for me."

While Cities XL Platinum clearly fails to surpass SimCity 4, it does offer a unique and fun take on the city building/management genre.  If you can put up with the late game slowdowns or don’t care about creating larger cities, then I can easily recommend Cities XL Platinum to you.  If you expect more, you will be disappointed.  Don’t spend more than $10 and you’ll likely be happy.Update 9/7/15:  Buy Cities Skyline if you want a city builder.  This game is no longer worth considering."
,Not Recommended,231140,7905054,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,iToaster,"This game has the potential to be far greater than SimCity ever could be, considering EA's corporate greed holds it back so much these days. It features enormous cities and very easy-to-use interface systems to create a city EXACTLY the way you want it to look even with road-following decorations and multiple ways to plop out zones, then zooming in and ""walking"" around if you so desire - the level of detail is astounding, and I've personally been playing this series since it's predecessor, City Life, came out back years ago. The game has a major downside though - it's outdated 2005 graphics engine is a 32 bit engine not optimized for multi-core. No matter how good your PC is, the game is limited to only using 1 core and up to 4 gigs of ram - 2 gigs by default, editing the config file is needed to crank 4. This means large cities on even the toughest PCs will lag like all hell, while your PC shows virtually no sign of wear, often running far below 20% of max capacity. Community guides even state you have to quit and reload the game every hour and possibly even change your graphics settings far below what your computer should be able to support just to keep it running in larger cities.Specs arent the issue for those of you claiming I have a bad computer - I run a hex core 3.5 ghz intel i7, have 64 gigs of ram, and 2 nvidia titans, and yet I clock as little as - well, 0 FPS at times. I have also tried it on a laptop running a quad core 2.7 ghz i7 with 32 gigs of ram and a GTX 680M with the same issues."

Despite the hardware you have. It just will lag. And nothing can be done with it, nobody plans to patch it. Every year this game is sold with great discount, and naive customers throw out their money. So I highly warn you against purchasing this game."
,Recommended,231140,12888300,"Posted: 11 November, 2014",all,AlyRuth,"I will recommend this game, but be cautious. This game gets insanely difficult, and fast. Once you get access to basic utilities, like water, power, and oil, it can be so easy to bankrupt your city by trying to offer all of these to your city at once. This game runs on supply and demand. If you're producting a lot of oil, and your city can't pay for it (not that your city won't demand it; they just won't be able to pay for it), your city will lose money by extracting more oil than what it can pay for. This goes with about a dozen different resources the game takes into account. You can also have not enough resources. This makes things rather complicated, because you will always run into a scenario in which your city needs more resources than it can pay for, even if you trade with other cities.Your city will always be plagued with problems once you get to a significant population. Traffic is always a problem. Always. There is no way to really mend the traffic problem. The tourism also really doesn't make much sense to me.However, I recommend this game because it's kind of realistic. You can't make everyone happy. You can't ""pre-plan"" your city by making interstates in a town with 200 population. You have to build your city up and then create those, causing you to have to re-route traffic and demolish structures so you can work on your interstate system, which is a headache I bet most leaders in transportatioon have. You will have to have a ghetto and also a rich population. Your citizens will get bored. The game is also beautiful and zooming into ground level gives a lot of awesome views."

Where do I begin?CONSSo the game will work fine for the first hour or two but after that you should have a pretty good sized city the problem is this is where the framerate drop begins. Where this game does justice is that it calculates EVERYTHING unlike sim city which will take shortcuts. Unfortunately this means the game is very CPU intense and WITHOUT multithreading this game is a total mess. Once you use up that first core of your CPU that's all you get. It's like a trip back to 1998.Despite the new name and repackaging the game doesn't incorporate much more than it's previous installments. The same 5  pedestrians and the same buildings with very few added on.Lack of any map editor or terraforming option means you are stuck with the same maps over and over again. The only terraforming option you do have is flatten ground wich can be next to useless and won't let you do much.Roads are very picky on their placement and highways are buggy as hell (tested them out using cheats). When cars get to an on/off ramp/section they stop moving. this creates conjestion on highways when you should be none. Bridges are difficult to create in a way that looks appealing and can take several tries and much wasted time.PROSLarge open maps of which the only limit is how fast your processor is.I could say more but if this didn't convince you to spend your money elsewhere nothing will.

,Recommended,231140,10223594,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,ThroatRipper666,"This is a city builder you'll have to adjust to. I'm a Sim City die hard; So I naturally like drawing my own zone sizes and knowing what will deveolp and what size they will be. This game has pre-designated zones/ blocks. So everytime you want to place one home you will place the same size block over and over (no zoning). But it does allow you to drag and drop the size and quantity of blocks you want in a zone. It also has a nice road building feature where you click to start a build point, click again to anchor, click for another anchor point, then  double click to end.Plus when it comes to building your city, you must unlock all of the features per city in order to build as you wish. You start out with very basic zones and access to all road types.My biggest annoyance about this game is the achievements. While you play, it will pop up achievements, in a huge gold bubble right across your screen. And if you've earned many at once, they're all listed at once so you can't see anything. And these achievements are repetetive and are unlocked per city you build.It's still an enjoyable game, though. Less difficult of the city builders."

,Recommended,231140,12606749,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,OmniMoron,"TLDR: A great city building game that could've been the best for years to come. There are too many issues though.I still rate it 3rd for me after Simcity 3000 and 2000.Beware of the compatability issues, performance issues, bugs and illogical things (the save menu WTF).The city building is solid and all the info you need is available. Sometimes the city's management information is a bit hard to find, but it's there. You don't have to lay down power lines or water pipes, which I didn't like at first, but got used to. The roads can be curved in any way you want which is really cool.The game is easy at first and the tutorials are good (not voiced though), but there is a big difficulty jump when your basic utility facilities aren't enough for your city anymore. The city will start to demand more electricity, fuel, water and waste disposal very suddenly. Also when you start building high density stuff the demands go up quite a lot.The game also seems laid back and fun instead of taking itself super seriously. Just like Simcity 3000 did (And Simcity 4 didn't). It doesn't mean it makes the game any worse as a simulator, but more fun to play.Graphics look really nice and are freely rotatable and zoomable 3D. You can tilt the view upwards/downwards with only 2 presets though.I can't really get why some people complain about the graphics.You can zoom in to see the details, which I didn't really care at first, but I found it's really cool to see your cities from the street level in the ""postcard"" camera mode.Sounds are what you'd expect in a city builder and music suits the game nicely. The intro song does play a bit too much though.I have not run in to any compatability issues with Win 7 64bit, but there are many people reporting them on the forums.And the to the negatives:The game runs fine when building a small city, but when the city size reaches 500k people or so it brings any computer down to below 10FPS in some situations (like making bus lines or zooming way out).It runs only in single threaded mode, but also must be optimized poorly. Some tweaks to the game files help, but not enough to make building big cities fun.There are some bugs like sometimes the trading does give or take more money than it should, some special building names or descriptions not showing up properly and one or two sounds not playing properly (police station is one).And then there are these logical issues. When you click a diskette image in the menu that is labeled ""Save"" and in the following interface click a save thumbnail, it LOADS the save instead of saving (there is a confirmation dialog, but it's too easy to just click ok). Also it overwrites the autosave instantly at that moment.There are more of these issues, but they're just annoyances, not wasting hours of city building!"

It has tons of nice features, different buildings, good details, a decent engine. BUT, it lacks one very major feature: management. You don't need to manage your financials in this game as time isn't a constraint. Once you make a few houses and industries your flowchart turns green and you can skip forward to get tons of money. You don't lose anything by doing that. Just like the first Sim City from 1990.Unlocking some buildings over time and making some old ones obsolete when time goes by would easily solve the issue. There can easily be diminishing tax returns from old houses or you might have to renew buildings over time. Unfortunately in its current state the game is not challenging at all.I don't want to give a negative review because of only one issue and there are no other city sims playable but they definitely have to solve this problem."

Its a fantastic game, don't get me wrong, but there is a massive deal-breaker. The game's engine has been the same since the first Cities XL, and it doesnt utilize Multi-Core, and it can only use 3 gb's of RAM. Once you get a large city going the game will start to lag, and then it will get worse and worse.

I put dozens of hours into the 2012 edition and got this for about three bucks.Now then, that said.  Is this game anywhere near as good as Cities: Skylines (my 2015 Game of the Year)?  Of course not.  Not by half.  But there's more to it than that.See, XL has one thing Skylines doesn't; a beautifully interconnected resource economy that makes building specialized cities so much more rewarding.  You can build a breadbasket city on a map with a ton of fertile land, an oil town, a manufacturing center, a tourist paradise...and the oversupply in one city is demand in another.  Is the trading sim as robust as Grand Ages Medieval or any of Gaming Minds' maritime trade sims?  No, but it's not supposed to be.Skylines is the builder I reach for when I'm after a ""classic"" SimCity-like experience.  I go for XL when I want to build something on a bigger scale, more like a nation than a city (in that sense, ""XL"" is an appropriate word for it.  Extra-large, indeed.)As I write this, it's on sale for four bucks.  Anything from about $7 downward is a good value proposition for any game in this series.

Day or night, it is very entertaining to check out all the wacky goings on of your inhabitants. You can select a car, pedestrian, truck, or train and follow it around the map. Travelling along the train tracks will allow you to explore the world of tunnels and underground stations you have constructed.There's a lot of micro-mangement of all aspects your city (including trade between other players and cities youve built) - some may not like this aspect of the game but I find it quite enjoyable and challenging. This is a massive game with lots to do to keep you entertained for endless hours.There are plenty of gigantic maps and hundreds of buildings to choose from. Additionally, the Cities player community is quite extensive and there are countless mods to help you construct the city of your dreams.I bought this game on special ($15) long before XXL was released. I hear there is little difference between the two games, bar a few bug fixes, performance improvement, and a couple of new buildings.

It does not inspire you, it isn't imaginative, and the game has bad controls overall. Comparing it to other city builders like sim city and cities skylines, it definitly lacks in many aspects. First the graphics, the two I previously mentioned are made by a big company and this is relativly indie. But, even on a indie budget the graphics look dull and dark there is no color to the game. Secondly, there isn't much to do in this game it's wrinse and repeat the whole way through. There is a 2:2:1 ratio for housing, commercial, and industrial, and if you keep this ratio throughout the game you can't fail. There aren't any challenging enviromental factors to deal with. Yes you have to have oil fertile land and water, but if you don't have any of these resources you just click a button and you buy them. Lastly, the controls are complete garbage, It changes the regular controls for a city builder and puts them on random keys. So, you and build a city while stuck in an akward position you dont know how to change and at the end of the game finally find the key and you think to your self why would the developers put it there?Pros-Many locations-in-dept organization-large mapCons-terrible controls-bad graphics-not intrestig-no events-easy gameplay- bad interface-repeating concept"

Numerous bugs followed each version, including:Alt tab crashes the game even in windowed or fullscreen windowed modeIncorrect income/expense statsUtility buildings not working at all after being placedAbsolutely stupid traffic issues, like cars not moving at allThere was originally going to be a fantastic and innovative multiplayer system where player's cities would be able to negotiate trade deals for resources and different education leveled people from their cities to fill jobs requiring workers, and players being able to communicate with eachother on a global map screen, seeing the cities expand without having to go through loading screens like the newest SimCity.They quickly attached a Pay to Play wall on it where you paid a minimum of 10 dollars a month to access the multiplayer features, and then removed the multiplayer aspect completely after 2 months of release for the original game.They kept the trade negotiation system however, but you only trade with an AI that has an unlimited amount of resources which you trade for your monthly income, and vice versa with your own resources.The first 3 versions of the game had absolutely no road building assistance if you wanted to make straight roads or squares quickly, and relied completely on the tools and putting a lot of time and effort into it creating straight lines properly.I had very high hopes for a next generation City Building simulation from Focus Home Interactive and this the was complete opposite.

This should not be a surprise, however, as a city wth 250,000 citizens with jobs and traffic requires more caculations then an empty lot. That being said, there is some ""work"" that needs to be done to work around a few known issues where the game becomes really slow and choppy when left running for extended periods of time. (A quick google search will resolve those issues.)Also, as with any city game, if you have an older graphics card, a slow processor or a lack of RAM, you will have troubles with a sprawling metropolis of 250,000+ citizens.Though it does lack the ""driving mission"" feature of SimCity 4 Rush Hour, this game is a superior rendition in almost every sense of the word to SC4, is highly moddable, gorgeous looking and comes with a solid sound track to boot. Resource management, city-to-city trade, a very diverse and yet easily managed Supply and Demand system, traffic concerns and the need for things like Holidays, Hotels and Food makes this a more detailed and realistic Sim City without the old technology and feel of Sim City 4 nor the various drawbacks of SimCity 5 (or Origins or whatever the hell they called it.)A great pick up for a city building enthusiast.Coupled with the fact that I got platinum for dirt cheap because I owned CitiesXL 2011, it was a must buy.Suggested Purchase Price: $10 or less."

At the time of its conception, Cities XL Platinum was a decently good city builder comparable to SimCity. The huge maps and tiny details were fantastic aspects of a mostly bugged game, however.Frustrating? Yes. Industries are very difficult to balance, not impossible, but nevertheless challenging. Cities XL is not an easy game by any standards, which makes it satisfying to overcome the ingame struggles. Every move requires thought. Expand too fast, your entire economy may just collapse, people will be dissatisfied, and you'll be left with blocks of vacant homes.There is a plethora of selection when it comes to maps. Each having their own resources and physical features that can make or break your soon to be sprawling metropolis.The UI is awfully buggy and quite confusing. There is a bit of a learning curve to be had which is a good thing, in my opinion.I purchased this game years ago for 10 dollars on a Steam sale and I think that was a fair price at the time. However, with newer and more refined city builders like Cities Skylines, there's no use in buying Cities XL, unfortunately.With regret and disappointment, I cannot recommend this. I want to so badly, but it's too filled with bugs and unresolved issues that I simply cannot.~Krystal~"

I didn't experience this because I stopped to play before that point, as I got enough of the game after 10 hours.Review :Interesting & decent city building, although with less charm than the old Sim City 4 (2003) ; it is however more realistic, as planting a couple of trees between your industrial zone and your residential zone isn't enough to clean the air, so it requires a more thoughtful approach to build a functioning city.But there's a big issue : most companies require high ""quality of life"", but neither the tutorial, the manual nor the in-game heat-maps explain nor show what it is ! Looking on Internet, I found a guy theorizing it was a mix of air pollution and noise nuisance.Nonetheless, I'd still recommend the game if you can get it with a discount (if you check the other reviews, it seems the concurrence is better, but a bit more expensive ;-) ), as it's pleasant enough for a while.Pros :- Decent visuals- Can build non-orthogonal cities- Advanced planning required to build a functional cityCons :- I started to have some slowdown with my city reaching 300'000 inhabitants- Different buildings that do the exact same thing and need to catch the tip during loading to know that- Very perfectible GUI usability ; eg: the road selection always go back to the cheapest road, instead of showing your last selection ; some description text missing ; etc.- In-game Ads for a famous french supermarket chain... :-/- Crashed a couple of times in 10 hours of play- A lot of things lack of clarity, and it can get hard to understand some aspects ; eg: the silo enhancing the farms efficiency requires freight ; but shouldn't it actually create the freight it needs if the roads are there ?- It's hard to build a polyvalent city, as the game is designed to make you create several cities that will trade with each other (and I don't have that kind of time ! ;-) )"

The layout at first is promising but then unfortunately it is a slippy slope downwards. You start of with huge areas to build cities on, which other games namely sim city could do with looking at. But after that it is mainly negative. The game itself is easy enough to plop things down, but the unlocking and class system is ridiculous. It isn't clearly mapped out who works where, and you spend half of your time trying to make sure a factory is operating normally. The class system could work if it was thought out better. The tourism etc falls in the same plan. The game becomes clunky, and to start with you have to build farms to produce food to eat, these are often out of the way of your peeps and have to be rather large, and it costs a fortune in building the roads to them.I have played this for enough time to say it warrents a thumbs down.My advice......buy cities skylines, it's easier to use, more fun to play, and more importantly it has mods to make the game stand out. the people in the workshop make some truly outstanding mods, and the best of all, you can edit the in game assets yourself to make the game as easy as you like."

Seeing the negativity around the latest Simcity, I was hopeful when trying Cities XL, but it just frustrates me in a lot of little ways. For one, it plays like it's in beta: text on the UI gets cut-off awkwardly, there are weird texturing issues with roads fairly regularly, it feels like it needs more polish. And this is a game that was first released in 2009, and has had 3 re-releases including this one! I've no idea what they've been doing all this time.For all the efforts at making you vary-up your cities, with different resources available in different areas, specialising is difficult - I needed fuel, so decided to start a second city just for that, and found that oil-extraction isn't unlocked until you have a fairly large city built.There was nothing pushing me to expand, and no real consequence to failure. My man city has nowhere near enough power, with -5 electricity tokens, and yet it doesn't really matter, and things carry-on as normal. It's trivial to make a city profitable.I'm also not a fan of the art style - the lighting makes everything quite grey, and it's hard to tell different wealth levels apart. It all just ends-up a bit bland.I'm sure if you're after a game that lets you be creative with building, you'll enjoy it - you can individually decide exactly which building goes where, and the curved roads are nice.

However, since they will not fix the issue anymore, we might as well do it ourselves. The good news is the hard part is already done by the excellent community. Do some digging, and the results will make this game well worth it. With these problems fixed, CitiesXL the most fascinating, complex, and impressive city builder out there."

The graphics at times, may look nice, but then, the city look lifeless most of the time. That changes when switched to night mode, as then, it gives it at least a bit of life. The unfinished transportation system is disapointing. The game will lag up and become unplayable, when you hit over 200,000-300,000 people in one city. The game does not focus a lot on actaully the goverment, but more or less building the city it self.

Much larger maps than SC2013, better gfx than SC4, and plenty of community mods out there (though not anywhere close to what SC4 has).I really was gung-ho into this game... and then that's where the problems started.  What problems?  I don't know, it wouldn't tell me.  It just told me people were unhappy... so I gave them things to do.  Industry wanted offices, but the offices didn't want to build, citing quality of life.  My quality of Life info-graphic in the information overlay panels, said it should have been fine.  I even had a modern-looking industrial park surrounded with parkland like IRL.  I don't know how I could have improved things at this point, so I opened more roads out of town, where it'd allow me to.  I also started trading, exporting goods, figured as with any REAL city that'd spur industrial development and hence income... nope.  It sure made the city some money, most of which went back into funding infrastructure and city utilities like POWER, WATER, and FUEL.  My cities, every one of them, seemed to start to fail at around 890,000 residents.  I provided bus lines when traffic got too bad, that cost a lot of money for my city (as it doesn't provide any income due to bus fares, I found that quite aggrivating and unrealistic by itself).  So I looked into other options, to build alternate roads... that option was out, even with all the park-space I left (up to 20% per development, and reverse-frontage lots didn't save me even with new-residential-construction work in my IRL past) to save space to add in larger roadways.So I looked into other options such as trains and high speed rail... OOPS, THERE ARE NONE.  FAILURE... FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE!  Alternative transportation IS OUR FUTURE!  WHERE IS IT?   There's a subway, but it was telling me I had to knock out any building or park land that occupied it's path, so it was next to useless, having to knock down the whole city to build a subway that there'd be no one left to use it!  That was aggrivating to the point where I gave it the alt-F4 salute and haven't played it since.  It was such a nice breath of fresh air to be free of the simcity 4 grid once and for all, but it does not come without it problems.  There are road mods, highway mods, and other cool things available to help you with this game - even a no pollution mod to help fix some of the quirks that break your cities... but they could do nothing to save me from being traffic'ed to death.  I never hit a million people.  Maybe I just stink at this game, but I came away knowing that while this game will be loved by many, it needs work, a lot of it.  For the price they charge, you should opt for the new XXL version if you don't own this game already, as it's pretty much just a re-build of XL (this game) with a few new features.  Could I recommend this game?  No, no I cant, go get XXL if you don't own this game yet, as it supports multicore (which EVERYONE can use by now, it's 2015).  It's a good game don't get me wrong, but my biggest issue with this game is that I couldn't figure out from what it told me beyond who wanted to move into the city that I should be building housing for, is that what problems needed tackling.  Why is my industry vacating and leaving 50% of it's space empty, and not wishing to build, no matter how far I knock down taxes?  Why are the people truly unhappy?  Why are they unhappy with the commute, it's a CITY, it's going to have congestion, no matter how well you do on it.  I can cram over FOUR MILLION people into a large tile on SC4 (and am quite proud of it), but I can't seem to crack a million on this game without pulling my hair out (and getting lagged out once or twice, but that requires only backing out to world-view and going back in, easy enough and seconds on a modern SSD raid setup).  The new game (XXL) is said to improve on these lag-facets and some of the bugs, while some remain, I'd much rather send you along to the newer XXL version than to spend money on last-year's model (XL, this game).  If you already own this game, XXL is not worth the upgrade unless you're a die-hard that wants multiprocessing and a few other options.  Some of the pros if I haven't listed enough of them are decent size maps (XXL has even larger ones, reportedly), and abilities to build off-the-grid if you want, and blueprints to adhere to if you choose to...My biggest issue with this game is the lack of trains, the lack of high-speed rail, and the difficulty of building a subway system.  I am sure that many people may criticize my feelings about this game... but honestly, while I really want to love this game, the first two dozen hours brought me much pleasure, the last several hours (maybe another dozen), brought me only pain and discomfort I can only liken to a stomach virus.  It takes the fun out of the city-building/management challenge when you're playing blind - not knowing what is killing your city - not knowing what is wrong and how to fix it appropriately before your city vacates.  I want a better excuse than quality of life... that's BS.  Take quality of life out of why my offices won't build where they're needed, and maybe you'll have fixed this game 50%.  I want alternate transportation... THIS ISN'T ROME!  We have trains/bullet trains/monorail/maglev is coming out now... let's look into the future, this is a game, not real life, DEVS - USE YOUR IMAGINATION!Also, When I start my city, or even before, Why can I not make my own map?  Why is the terraforming so limited... it does not even change the gfx of the map overlay (e.g. if you flatten out part of a ravine, it'll still LOOK like a 2d ravine is there even though it's flat)... we want more terraforming options and better map-feature-change feedback.This really IS deep down inside a GOOD GAME, unfortunately, the enjoyment of many is cut short by a lack of good positive feedback, as I might as well be having all the read-outs in GREEK, or be playing a racing game with the monitor off until the race is over.  Focus interactive is on the right track on the new game (XXL), honestly, they're getting better, but the mere fact that to fix this game will require re-doing it from scratch pretty much, I'd hold out and see what lies in store for the future."

Then you better start looking right now for mods for SimCity because this game isn't for you. The Cities XL franchise and series has such great potential‎ to become on of the greatest city building games in the world, possibly outruning SimCity 2013. However the navigation in the game and the complex system in this is just to much. Sadly not very many people know about Cities XL. So what this means is that there really is no helpful tutorial for the game on Youtube or any website. I went through the tutorials (no joke) ten times and I still don't understand 1/4 of the game mechanics or how to create a successful city. No, I'm not terrible at games, but instead of learning from the tutorials, they seemed like they where just telling me a story, rather than focusing on telling the player what to do and why and other ways to do it.How could this be fixed?1) Add a sandbox mode. Sure, there are the built in cheats, but you are still limited.2) Just make a simple navagation system. AND cleary label stuff like: Heath Services, Police Services, etc.3) Fix the tutorials. Don't make people suffer through a story like that.4) Possibly get rid of a few items, like only 3 classes of people rather than 4 and tell how to get them to stay in the city.5) To much stuff, like luxury items. Just have stuff like parks.6) Better information. I don't know what half of the stuff tells me. ( I guess 4-6 count as #1)Now for the grades.Graphics: 4/10 Crap, nothing more to say.

This game is beautiful.  It is thoughtful and more complex than similar games like simcity.  You can make some amazing cities and there is a vibrant community of modders adding new content to make the game even better.So what's the downside?  The game slows down very badly with larger cities.  It's not that I have an old computer than can't handle modern games.  Nope.  My computer is top tier.  Maybe the games designers got too ambitious.  I don't know the cause.  Some say it's a memory leak and others deny this.  Whatever.  When your city gets up in the millions of people the game will get so slow that it is barely playable.  You can mitigate this a bit with the configuration settings.  Restarting helps also but only temporarily.  Thats the worst problem but it is a major one. So why do I reccomend it?  Becuase despite that crippling fault, this is an excellent game for people who love to build cities and see them work.

The building types are also difficult to discern from each other.

Build a city, balance the economy, provide power, water and other resourses to your city. You also have to keep your income bigger than the expenses.

This can become a problem as a population booms.  So many calculations per second that even eight-core AMD processors simply can't straighten it out.  It's a programming flaw that has been in the Cities XL series since the beginning, and the programmers haven't sorted it out.

For such a beautiful game, the people, and cars, that they are filled with are more reminiscent of team America puppet dolls than real people.-whilst we are on the subject of up close and personal, when you get down to the ground level of the game, the failures of the game become that much more apparent, to the extent i will have to create another sub level to this review:1) The buildings. whilst the genral view of the city will be nice, some of the buildings just dont make sense. some are horribly out of place, like a snowy resort in the middle of the desert, whereas some are more of the ""what the f*** inspired you yo do that?"" type. i am spekaing, of course, about the futuristic building that pops up at random, and completely ruins the suburbia feel i had going on. its poorely drawn and makes me think the creators were high when they were designing the game.2) The landscape. yes i know i said it was nice to look at and yes, it is nice to look at....... from a distance. once you get up close, the ""hills"" become more irregular, and turn out to be weird bumps in the land that you cant build on. seriously, it completely puts me off and since there is never 100% flat land, you'll always find those hideous goosebumps around and about.Another problem i have found about the game and people on youtube have mentioned this aswell, is that when you zoom in on the road, no matter what type or whether or not there is a single car, you will always hear the doppler effect of the cars going past, or the horn being honked at nonexistent drivers, by nonexistent drivers. again a sloppy mistake, but considering the grand scale of the game, it's okay to overlook something like this.something else, however, that everry city builder should have nailed from the beginning, is terraforming. whilst you do have the ability to flatten the landscape, it is expensive and often makes the problem worse, making me wish there was a undo button, which there isn't but would make the game so much better. so i tend not to use that when building. fortunately, the placement of buildings does flatten the landscape somewhat, so that you are building the item on a level area. unfortunately, this doesnt change the landscape around your building, and so i have been left with houses surrounded by huge slopes of earth or a jagged drop to the street. all of which makes you again, consider why the developers havent done something about it. but i am not a developer, so i dont know if thats something that possible to do, only that it's something that needs adressing.once more, there are rather basic things in the game that are missing. for example the notices that appear. whilst helpful at identifying what i need to do like ""more housing for skilled workers"", sometimes its general like ""something is wrong with the hotels"" right okay then . what ? and it wont tell me. and sometimes it starts to tell me what to do, but then runs out of space and cuts of the message half way through. this is one of the most blatant and unforgivable failures, that the developers couldnt be bothered to extend the boxes for one or two lines, and really annoys me. and i dont know if there is any way to see it or im supposed to guess.so you might say: But then why dont you go through the tutorial and find out. i did and i didnt find out and it was nightmarish. the tutorial is a shoddy excuse for  a guide, and left me no better than before. the crap attempts to be funny with their stage directions and childish humour makes me really just want to get stuck in and find out for myself, which is shame becuas that is bloody difficult to do. there are so many complex things to work out like bus networks and trade that i feel arent explained in the tutorial to an acceptable level, leaving me to painstakingly trial and error with cities until i figured out how to make money properly.Conclusion.as odd as it might sound, i actually enjoy the game , with its quirky music and beautiful skies. there arent many citry building agmes out there, so i commend cities xl for attempting to make such a complex one, even if they do fall short in some areas. as far as improvements go, i would like another cities xl game as  i feel there are definite ways they could make an even better game which would be well worth the £14.99 on steam (hint. wait until it's on sale). for example, weather features like rain or cloud, more detailed forests, not just some sporadic woodland.NOTE TO ANYONE NEW TO CITY BUILDERS. IF YOU ARE, LIKE ME, UNFAMILIAR WITH CITY BUILDERS BUT WANT TO TRY THIS OUT, GO FOR IT. IT IS A FUN GAME ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, AND THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE WHO DO  GAMEPLAYS OF IT FOR HELP.

You have some fairly basic goals - keep new citizens coming in, while also offering enough jobs to keep said citizens employed and happy. You'll also need to set up retail shops and various leisure outlets to keep your citizens happy and keep the money flowing in a positive direction. Traffic is also a fairly important factor, as everything needs to be moving smoothly to keep things effecient - this is something you'll need to bear in mind as your planning your city!Of course there is an economical aspect to the game as well. You're given free reign to create new cities all across the globe and trade freely between them, as well as with a rather large - and neutral - corporation. Some regions will be better suited to producing specific resources, thus allowing you to eventually set up trade routes between your cities to quickly speed up progress down the line.All in all this is a really fun game that offers hours upon hours of near-endless entertainment for its listed price."

All the roads in those games where straight and not really as good because they where straight. I enjoyed curving all my roads and bridges. It added more realism to the game instead of just plowing through the world you can actually go more with the terrain. Curve around a hill or just softly turn through soft rolling hills. It was useful to build highways in a loop around my cities. Get this game if you love city builders. Enjoy Cities XL.

You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole  array of buildings.There are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).Gameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.Performances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.City size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.AI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.OVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.6.5 out of 10 for me."

What I mean by that is that in Sim City I can build a massive and beautiful city the way I want and do so fairly quickly.  Cities XL makes you really work for your creations.My other complaint is performance, on a fairly high-spec PC it still has performance issues.

We all Know sims was out for years and made a sequel which many fans loved but most agree that the last one well wasn't up to par what it use to be. However people loved the animations and the graphics. Cities XL I had it since release non steam and I had a crap laptop. But it rank ok till I had a pop. of over a million and then I had performance issues. BUT the SCALE and the stats and that you can build an actual farm and an actual industry, i truly liked. Graphics not so much but the tokens made up for it  A LOT... If you don't know what tokens are and hate the game already then you're an idiot. Skyline is the baby of Sims and XL honestly, HOWEVER the scale of the map/cities on a full built map still is way smaller than XL. Max pop of Skyline is way smaller than XL AND you can't trade between any maps WHICH i find to be ♥♥♥♥ing stupid in Skyline. BASICALLY a non-player driven game which is stupid asf. Skyline graphics compares to sim obviously because the release is about 3 years later so no♥♥♥♥♥♥it's going to look better but the animation/scale/traffic is horrible in Skyline even after mods. So is Skyline the best? Sure... But if you want to get a BIG♥♥♥♥♥city and an actualy realistic city get XL/HOWEVER after 1million pop. Goodluck LOL restart the game it works. Sims looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. Skyline is not the best of Both worlds it just took the ideas and made a decent unfinished graphical, non realistic statistical.

I have a feeling Cities XL Platinum is just a unprofessional, fast production and cheap ripoff to point out the flaws of the latest SimCity 5. And in itself, there are many flaws such as weird controls and a lousy interface. What's more, lag increases as more zones are built.Lastly, it's not value for money even at the Autumn Sale.

If you learn to adapt to the flaws, and look at it as a positive, odds are youll probably find yourself spending many, many, many hours on this game, perfecting your city step by step and shaping it into the city of your dreams and imagination, just like me.The large map space available to build your city on is a great asset and the game mechanics is generally easy to master and understand. Perhaps, the best thing I like about this game is the fact that when you put into your city, your passion, your time, your efforts you'll see that reflected in your finished city, and the subsequent feelings of intense pride, inspiration, and satisfication is quite something. And even then, you'll always finding yourself going back to your cities and experiencing the awe-inspiring realism that is your created masterpiece!!In short, I would have to say Cities XL Plantinum is without a doubt, one of my all-time favourite games and would recommend it enthusiastically."

Sure the game has really bad optimization, I was always closing and restarting the game every half house because at least that made it less laggy. There's always mods for better roads/intersections/light effects.Basically, I would recommend this game:- if you just want to build a city without actually trying to manage it.- if it is with mods- if you don't care about restarting the game every 30 minutes to reduce lag- just to ♥♥♥♥ around in.You probably are better off buying Cities Skylines instead.

Not just in a slightly annoying way, but in a major chunks of functionality are just not there. It's only after a while of playing you realise that things like the leisure buildings and education buildings are either horribly out of balance for the game or just entirely non-functioning.Examples:* As far as I can tell, only one of the education buildings has any effect. There's no concept of levels of education.* Water is derped. If you want to place water towers, pause the game, place them in a bunch, then unpause the game. The water vanishes if you place one tower while the game is running, but if you place them while it's paused the towers work. Which one was the original game intent?* Roads clag up horribly. Since the roads have slightly different widths, you'll have to demolish vast swathes of city to replace them with wider roads, which don't add that much more capacity and then clag up again. I can't even tell if having busy roads affects the sim at all anyway. Everything seems to work fine even with most of the roads over capacity.* You notice more and more buildings with mangled or missing titles and descriptions as you unlock them.Recap: Water, transport and education appear to be borked. Pretty basic items for a City builder?So that seemingly complex balance of budget vs city needs? .. Forget it.Basically it's just houses for 3 types of people and jobs for 3 types of people. That's your main task to juggle for the entire game (yawn).Add a bit of class X housing, add a few class X jobs. Wait for them to fill. Do it again.Occasionally, add more power, and maybe pause the game, demolish your water towers, wait for the water to reappear, then pause the game and put more water towers back down ..That's it.That's the game.Fun huh?I've seen one guy say he just totally ignored leisure in his build and it all worked fine.A few fans point to the mods available to try and save it. The main one is a UI overhaul which seems to add back in to the interface some elements that should have been in the off the shelf game. Not good. And there are things like the CLM patch (Crime Leisure and something) that try to fix the incomplete areas of the game.The bad news (and a good indicator of the games ""buzz""), is that the mods are now mostly very old and haven't been updated for ages. Two major suggested mods (PlazaXL and XL Nation) appear to clash in what they try to achieve and there's little forum advice on which one to go for because ... *nobody seems to play the game any more* < There's a big hint for you.Also I've had it crash to desktop on me a couple of times now. The entire game just vanishes in a blink. I think the computer is trying to tell me something. Maybe it's bored.This is sold as a complete finished game. It's not in Alpha or Early Access.If you utterly love city builders and dream of nothing else? Maybe try it, but expect to have to figure out various patches to make it playable, and then expect it to crash on you fairly often.Ok so... Even if you love city builders and dream of nothing else, this one might annoy you a lot.Everyone else should stay as far away as possible."

It is WAY too confusing to build a metro line. Also, the terminuses are not needed in my opinion.-HORRIBLE OPTIMIZATION!! i5-4690K and a GTX 970 and this thing still lags like crazy! I swear enabling anti-aliasing broke the game! Also, with graphics not that good, you would expect it to run better.-Leisure. Leisure. Leisure. This is one problem that will never go away. I feel like a Six Flags every block would not satisfy the citizens.-No free-flowing traffic options. I did my best to make an interchange, but nope. It looks like crud. I wish I could install a mod to fix this, but....-No Steam Workshop support. The game you get is the game you get. Nothing to add on to it to make it optimized for modern machines or for a McDonalds in your town. You get none of that.-Towns can be slow to grow. Not a huge problem for me, but it just takes a little longer then I would like.-OmniCorp. F**k you, OmniCorp. Trading with them is like selling your soul to the devil. Unless you build another town to trade with, but then they have to trade with someone, right?-What is this ""Can't build below the water table"" crap? I can't make any tunnels in my downtown because of this, which leads traffic to just suck.Overall, just get something better. Cities XL Platinum is a decent game, and it has fine gameplay. However, there are too many things wrong with it to justify paying $20 for it. It is fun and runs smooth at first, but upon advancing to 250,000 population, you will see many graphics problems, many leisure problems, many problems in general. Of course, I could just be bad at the game. But I think not.Fair warning: If you do decide to get this game, it will not run well on modern machines. It doesn't matter whether you have a GeForce 8800, TITAN X or Fury X, performance will be the same crap across the board.I would recommend Cities:Skylines. That game is a city builder done right.5/10"

You can easily spend 100 + hours on this game and still never explore the whole thing.PROS:1) Easy to Learn2) Great Graphics for an older game3) Fun tutorial... creatively funny4) There is a TON TO DO!5) Trade with other cities that you have built! You can have one city be a farming community while another has industry.6) Hours of enjoyment7 ) Definitely SATISFIES your desire to be a CITY BUILDER , MAYOR, and Planner in a similar but yet different way than SIM CITY.8) Direct relationships with class of people and business's success is interesting.CONS:1) Graphics engine does not run as well as SIM CITY.  Your computer will BOG down the closer you get to a million plus citizens2) Road systems are a little screwy and VERY EXPENSIVE.  You will be paying 1000 credits for just a small patch of EXPRESSWAY.3) Citizens are NEVER HAPPY - at least not for very long.  They will either always not be able to find a job or you will not have enough housing to contain them all.  THere is always an immediate shift even if just one business goes bankrupt.4) Businesses will go bankrupt for different reasons that just POP UP even if there have been no changes.  It makes it interesting on one hand ... on the other it is a little aggrevating that a balanced city only stays that way for a very short period of time.5) BUILDINGS - The buildings do not change over time like in SIM CITY.  Rather than the businesses growing to towering mega structures because they are so successful, they are what they are when you plant them."

Today it froze yet again and i just cannot take it anymore  Every trick to get around its issues, its a game with potential, but glitches with the trading system, road to building connection take away from it.  But its main issue far and above anything is lag.  I have a high end PC i built myself running a:AMD FX-959016GB of ramNvidia GTX 750500gb SSD2TB HDDThe game itself is running off my SSD.  Every other game i own runs perfectly smooth, i have to really beat on this thing to get a trace of lag and its usually due to the software not the hardware, but manageable for the most part.  But this game no matter what you do or try, no matter what settings you run it lags and it lags bad we are talking about ATLEAST 5 secs worth of just lag every single minute the game runs.  Buy it at your own risk but i think the developers owe people who have bought this game a complete refund and apology for never addressing nor fixing the issues this game has."
