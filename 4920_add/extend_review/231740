It doesn't hold much brilliance in terms of either story or gameplay but makes you play the whole campaign with a persistent smile on your face anyhow. If you have spent your fair share of Saturday nights around a table, creating characters, passing each other various snacks and rolling the dice; you'll find the core concept of the game relatable and fun. If not, most of its content will be lost on you, so you could prefer avoiding this one. Being a chronic RPG gamer myself - both on tabletop and on PC - and still DMing for my various groups at age 30, this one hit the spot for me. It was all too familiar and successful in bringing tabletop humor to a PC game. So if you are an actual role-player - especially familiar with Dungeons and Dragons - go ahead. It's like someone decided to make a hotchpotch out of your regular Saturday night content, and even though you know it’s not the greatest dish in the world, you'd eat it 'cause it's familiar.I do bear a tradition of presenting an outline of the story in my reviews but here, there really isn't much to tell about - a bit of a disappointment, coming from a game about tabletop RPGs actually. Basically it's Saturday night, and a group of noob players huddle around their Dungeon Master and start a campaign. For the remainder of the game, your table will be the only constant between the game world and the real world. You'll be experiencing constant passages within these realities, as players constantly break the forth wall to comment or criticize the DM. Anything and everything within the game consist of RPG or Fantasy references and parodies, presented both during many out-game squabbles and relevant plot displays. As the storyline progresses DM will constantly bend the game world for it to fit into various RPG clichés. If you are familiar with the fantasy genre even remotely, you'll recognize at least a handful of given references. The baseline of the story is ""big baddies are cooking up vile plots, so we gotta beat them and get their loot"" pretty much. No depth there, but character squabbles and DM's commentaries on gameplay are funny and relatable. Thus, you keep playing the game even though it is a grind hell. So, this is what all this is about: spot on FRP parody.The game being a port from the mobile original, graphics are not demanding. It's a pixel run in a fantasy world with 8 bit music, coming from the same three tracks running in the background. It's fun and charming for a while, but kinda gets tiresome by the end. Still, there is some nostalgic spark in monster designs, that much I must agree with. With each new mob monster you'd come across, you'd catch a new reference. Would like to battle a gremlin? A doppelganger? A mimic? A dragon? Or even the Dark Knight? Do not look further.What about the gameplay? Well, this being a parody it certainly does its job on criticizing the power mechanic of many tabletop games. Everything is really, really basic. During battle, characters do bear 5 simple choices: attack, defend, use skill, use item or flee. That's it. The dice roll is not determinant during battle at all. It is presented only as a way for encounters to appear. There are a handful of classes you can pick, each having four skills which could be upgraded once at each level up. You attend quests - which are basically escort, slay or travel - to get exp, grind on monsters to do so, and pass for the next one. Yah, that's about all. It all boils down to gold, loot and exp, boys and girls. As the game progresses, mobs will get resistances and immunities, but combat mechanics never change. It is simplicity itself. Accompanied with the same 8 bit music over and over again, battles become really repetitive too. Once completed and the humor itself experienced, there really would not be any reason to revisit the game. So, there really isn't that much of a replay value, either.Well, I haven't shared any grand plusses about the game so far, did I? Mostly, I would say that it appeals to the common experience of tabletop gaming and parodies the DM/Player relationship based upon it. On doing so, the humor is successful, presenting you with many clichés, references and even some laughs. For someone who has never played a tabletop game? Nah, not so much. I would highly recommend for you to grab the game on sale if you are interested with the said humor, 'cause after going through the main game for 20 hours or so once, you won't be revisiting it. Enjoy, nonetheless!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

There is a lot of hilarious commentary and for the most part character development is nice. I know that the dialog is all pre-set, but it makes the characters pretty funny and sassy. One of my favorite aspects is the ridiculous dirty jokes made through-out the game.There's a ton (I mean A LOT) of characters and classes to choose from. There's a nice little upgrade setting that lets you have a few different moves and upgrade them.It's just like any other turn base game. It's fun, it's cheap and the developers are extremely nice and enjoy interacting with their fans; which is always great. I would definably get this game while on sale."
,Not Recommended,231740,7834907,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Ryebread,"This has the appearance of a nostalgic D&D tabletop setting, but is more like a poorly-translated turn-based JRPG, where tactical positioning and well-timed skill choices are not the focus. Instead, players find themselves killing hordes upon hordes of monsters to make numbers go up so they can kill bigger hordes of scarier monsters. The story tries to be humorous about a D&D group finding the line between fantasy and reality blurred with numerous shoe-horned cameos, but the writing itself is unnatural to the point that it feels like a high-schooler's fan-fiction. In fact, if you're looking for a game the emulates the D&D experience, I recommend Cardhunter, a free-to-play tactical game with better writing and more involved gameplay.Even if you're in the market for a mindless grind-a-thon, don't buy this on the PC. Opt for the mobile version instead, since the game also constantly puts you through miniscule but unskippable animations that would be more bearable if you could look out the window while they play. Hell, I'd recommend other mobile games entirely, but some people like their skinner boxes and this is one of the skinneriest boxes I've ever seen.P.S.: This game *had* micro-transactions, but those have been removed. According to an anonymous source (see comment), the microtransaction was originally forced on by a publisher. A sad case of publisher overruling developer control. The game is still a terrible grind though."

It took me 20 hours to complete, which includes a restart after some hours when I had unlocked more interesting characters than the starting lineup. I'll have to go back and finish it with the ones I missed in the future.The game was a lot of fun, and definitely worth the asking price. It made me smile many times, what with all those wacky references to other games and developers. I bought the Deluxe edition to support the developers as much as I could, as I had researched the game prior to buying it, and I'm glad I did. The extra gold you start with is nice (but doesn't provide any sort of advantage other than when you get a full lineup but let's face it, it doesn't matter).If you're on the fence, then just go ahead and spend the 10 euro or whatever the price is in your region. It's a fun throwback to the golden ages of gaming, and it's just well done through and through. I doubt very much you'll regret it. Don't worry about the ingame cash shop. I never used it, and NEVER had a reason to. You earn redicilous amounts of gold in this game just doing the main quest line, and the extra gold you can buy for real money is so useless, I'm puzzled why they added it at all."

There's a solid dose of fun pop culture references (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Super Mario Brothers in the sewer dungeon, to Pirates of the Caribbean and the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the seaside areas). And it's not just gratuitious name-checking either -- all of it is properly statted out and integrated into the gameplay.The Bad: Admittedly, it's hardly ground-breaking stuff, especially if you're partial to comedy/parody RPGs. It's not quite as witty or clever as its web-based counterparts likeKingdom of LoathingorCard Hunter. But even as someone who liked both those games, I wasn't disappointed -- I'm now at 10 hours play time and counting.The Ugly: Less-than-ideal game balance. It definitely appears to favor particular player/class combos over others, to the point that it's damn near impossible to last the higher levels with certain oddball party compositions, which kinda takes out some of the fun."

However, it has both condensed and distilled the core elements of pen and paper gaming to a level which is far too simplistic for me to enjoy. The combat is shallow, the quests are repetitive, and the stats and perks are shallow and hardly feel like they matter. The UI is also highly simplistic and does not even provide important information efficiently or at all.I am sure that this is a fun bathroom game on a mobile device or something on the go, but the flaws of this game impeded my enjoyment of this game and cannot recommend this game to people who want an enthralling experience."

,Not Recommended,231740,30763880,Posted: 26 March,all,AbominableAbdominal,"I really liked the design concept of the game. Ideally it gives you the freedom of exploring a vast, magical world and design your own adventure. It has the potential of becoming a tool kit for creative story telling with its pre-existing mechanics, however, that being said, all the stories within the game are all pre-written and quite limited. The game does a nice job in trying to replicate the feeling of being both in a real world and an imaginary one when playing DnD by allowing the player to purchase object in the ""real world"" with the gold you get in the game world while these items would aid you in games. The downside of this is that the game gets extremely grindy after some hours of playing. The characters of the game are relatively diverse, yet they only have 4 moves each, which makes the combat pattern repetitive.The style of the game is an 8-bit pixle art type, which is fine ---- gives me a feeling of Pokemon Leafgreen. The soundtrack of the game becomes really loopy, and seems rather limited.I would prehaps give the game a 6/10 as a decent time killer. A good game if on a discount (say for 3 or 4 dollars), but would not recommend buying for 10 dollars."

Unfortunately, the novelty wears off fairly quickly, and the actual gameplay just doesn't hold up. Traditional jRPGs are carried by their characters and story, because the combat and mechanics thereof are so one-dimensional and stale.So Knights of Pen and Paper has the same boring combat as any Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy/etc game, but all the writing, charm, and polish has been replaced by easy jokes about RPG tropes.If RPGs are played for the story, where's the story? I guess the gag is that there is no story, that this is the RPG stripped down and laid bare. I can buy that. But since there's no gameplay worth noting, does that joke really carry a game for 5+ hours?I don't think it does. The premise is done a hundred times better by Half Minute Hero - which has all the same lazy RPG ""observational humor"", but uses it as a fluffy coat to the solid framework of fun, interesting gameplay. I recommend you pick that up, instead. Knights of Pen and Paper isn't worth the time it takes to finish it, much less the asking price."

You set your own pace on everything, like choosing which enemies you want to fight and how many, so the game never really suprises or challenges you. The quests are boring and all feel like sidequests (kill this many things, go here, collect this many things, blahblahblah). They've taken microtransactions out of the game but you can tell a lot of the mechanics were set up with those in mind.They do have some neat things like the ability to buy upgrades and powerups for the 'real life' players, and these upgrades carry over different saves, but there isn't enough of this and you'll have most the things you want rather early on. The graphics are pretty nice as well, if you like the 8bit style.This game is probably better played on a phone or mobile device, this isn't a terrible port but it shows it was made for a touch screen in mind - for example you have to select the enemy to attack every time. I'd recommend buying this on a mobile touch screen device, it'll prob cost less - also it'd be easier to play it in short bursts like it is prob meant to be played.In short, they botched it."

I’m not entirely sure but I feel like the game tried to balance out the absence of micro-transactions of its mobile game counterpart by dumping all the gold in the world in my pocket and calling it square.If this game has anything going for it, it’s the sprite work which is very pretty and the music is pleasant but everything is massively let down by how unstimulating the game feels.

Without using cheatengine or a similar program to give gold, you will find yourself spending vast amounts of time in the farm area obtaining it.  Then seeing the same quotes played repeatedly going back to town to buy grindstones and upgrade the blacksmith before returning again.  The system itself would be great for a normal turn based rpg similar to Dragon Quest, but the terms of grind versus receiving spartan bits of plot makes investing the time to complete the game not worth it."

The quests lack any distinction(the game breaks all quests down into a few archetypes), the progression system deteriorates into bland stat increases(each character has only 4 abilities), and the game's pacing entices the player to utilize the game's microtransactions to level quicker or buy better gear.There are unlockable characters, but to use them in the current playthrough you would need to spend some time leveling them from lvl 1 or use them in a a new playthrough.After a while the game slows to an almost literal grind.

On top of that, nothing in this came off as original at all.If I ever had a GM make a campaign that was 100% references and forced us to battle everyone we met? I'd tell him he sucked and then leave.

I love turn-based RPGs and this game is an excellent one that has a solid mixture of gameplay, humor and replay value that took me by surprise. To start off with, if you enjoy turn-based RPGs then this is worth buying. Read on for a more in-depth review.In Knights of Pen and Paper you play as some friends sitting around a table and playing a Dungeons and Dragons-like game. You pick out your party and set up their class before the game begins which I thought was pretty cool. Typically new characters are introduced throughout the game, so it's interesting that we get to create our own dream team to play with. That's not all. You'll still find more characters throughout your time in the game. They'll offer new classes to use which you can switch out whenever you're not in combat. I found the cast of Knight of Pen and Paper to be nothing less than diverse and clever.The gameplay is pretty basic at far as turn-based RPGs go. Each party member and enemy will get a turn, and you're given a bar showing who's turn is when so you can plan out your turns accordingly. Leveling is a lot of fun as you get to unlock new abilities and see how each of these characters evolve.For me, the true appeal of Knights of Pen and Paper is its presentation. The story isn't groundbreaking--it's about as generic as any quest in Dungeons and Dragons could be. However, the characters themselves are entertaining as the story plays out. The developers did a great job of portraying all the party members as human beings who with personalities. Sometimes someone will question the logic of something absurd happening and is quickly told to shut up by the game master. I also remember one character being jubilant in defeating a boss and the text-based dialogue was perfect. Whenever I saw the speech bubbles appear I got a little excited.Knights of Pen and Paper is a solid game. It's got a classic feel to the gameplay, it has amazing presentation and it doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Even if you've never played a turn-based RPG, this is a game that would be the perfect entry to the genre."

I personally don't class this as 'difficulty' as such, and you can cheat the system by setting the enemies closer or further apart to suit your teams attack.. Though, even with 7 enemies sometimes it can be 'easy'.. This is a slight downside, but still isn't much of one and you won't be choosing 7 enemies to fight until you become stronger anyway, as it is generally too much (when matched against similar levels that is).But generally speaking this is a great game with tons of great moments!!

It's a turn based RPG, but it's not hard for noobies.You can balance it yourself by starting with more or less characters. I would strongly recommend starting with 5 players because the endgame is very hard otherwise.Other then that you really need to play it for an hour or two to find out if it's for you. I like the dry humor and pop culture references. And how it doesn't take itself too seriously. But some people call this 'lacking in depth' and I guess they're right too. They do re-use certain backgrounds and let you grind from level 32-37 and 1 mission later 37-45 at the end of the game, so they definitely rushed through the end trying to add some 'gameplay' without putting in work sadly. That level 50 mission is optional btw. Throughout the rest of the game there is rarely a need to grind though. Do note that the game has some large bugs. Some achievements are broken, some missions are broken, DLC doesn't work for some and there's graphical glitches. This seems like a hasty port honestly. And then there's the fact that if you want the Deluxier Edition you have to buy it at once. You can't upgrade. If you already have Normal edition or Deluxe edition (extra's, but no DLC) you're screwed. Also they just wiped everybody's saves trying to emplement the (not fully working) cloud save. Then wiped all saves again when reverting to the old build.So the game is very fun, but beware that this game is published by Paradox. As long as you're lucky enough to be in the 90% for whom most things don't break you're good. But if something goes wrong there's no support and dealing with Paradox is like talking to a 3 year old and when they realize you're right they just ignore you.I only recommend this game because it's unique. It's very money-grabby, too expensive and the publisher is unethical and clearly doesn't care about it's customers, but the game is so much  fun and most people don't care about what happens behind the scenes.

I thought it was actually worse than it is, and I'm glad I ended up buying this title and playing through it's 9 hour-ish campaign. The basic premise is, you are a group of friends that are playing the much known fantasy tabletop role-playing game, and your adventures are depicted both through pixelated landscapes/characters and from what the D&D players are actually saying, or actually the dungeon master. Much like in the main idea from the movie Inception, you are playing a game in which the characters are playing a game. So, gameception?KoP&P (Knights of Pen and Paper) is an RPG, and most features you expect from one are available in this title. Leveling up your characters, giving them new items, armor and weapons, upgrading your character's abilities, questing your way through until the very end, or until New Game +, in which your able to replay the whole game, with the same characters, but everything is harder. It didn't really attract me, since the main campaign features a bit of grinding and I didn't want to go through the same. It's useful for completing the achievements, though.Soundtrack fits the theme of KoP&P, but can actually become boring after a few hours of gameplay. Another interesting feature is the abundance of references to tv shows, movies, etc.You eventually find a character named Nabe Gewell, which lives in Steam Island, which I found amusing.The 4th wall is also broken lots of times.In conclusion, do yourself a favor, and purchase KoP&P. It entertained me for a couple hours and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Alas, if you actually don't enjoy D&D's concept, steer in the way of another game."

Alright, a few more quests -- we are having day 500 by now -- andthenthe campaign must be over any time soon, because there's that achievement that says it is doable in 365 days and I haven't done any side quests.Another five hours later: I fought my way through hordes of enemies who somehow start looking all the same to me. It's the same old drill, every single fight: Power up the paladin's shield, let the druid send a few to sleep, let the cleric and warrior weaken the rest, and let the mage finish them off with meteroids. (""Rocks fall, everyone dies!"") I'm starting to consider writing a bot for clicking these same old buttons over and over again.

Leveling up consists of upgrading one of your four skills, and weapons/armor upgrades require extreme grinding to level up your blacksmith to get a CHANCE at getting a straight upgrade.

I found an exploit though that makes it easier to double the amount of grindstones you get. When you start the game to the east of the starting town is a cave where you can mine grindstones. When you click on one and the dice rolls up you need 6 or higher to get the grindstone. The key here is after clicking on the ore deposit just start pressing spacebar because once the dice stops rolling and you do or don't get the grindstone the act of pressing spacebar triggers the dice to reroll giving you another chance to get a grindstone. I went from getting around 10 grindstones every minute to around 20-25 grindstones in the same amount of time.

The basic idea is your a bunch of people playing a game like dungeons and dragons in a basement. You choose your characters race (Pizza guy, jock, nerd etc) and class (cleric warrior paladin mage etc) and start playing. As you level up you will unlock and upgrade your different skills. There are plenty of fun items to find and equip, and I also joy at leveling up. Not only can you  buy ingame items, you can buy furniture, new tables, and snacks and drinks for the basement that your ACTUALLY playing the game in for buffs in the game. Pretty funny if you ask me.

Had I been aware that this was an iOS app before it was a PC game, I might've been more wary. The first couple hours went by relatively nicely, but after that, not so much.If you buy the Deluxe Edition DLC, you get the Magika Wizard, a character with a better passive skill advantage than most other (see next point) characters. Around level 15, you unlock the Developer Player Characters, self-inserts that have even better passives, making whatever current party you're using seem feeble in comparison.Also around this time, you'll notice your strength isn't getting you as far as it did in the beginning, so you go to buy gear. Only, the blacksmith, by default, has a 30-some percent chance at actually crafting the item you pay him for. So, either you toss bags of money at the him, praying that he succeeds (because of course he doesn't reimburse you), or you get grindstones, items that let you ""level him up"". It takes around 2000 grindstones at 25 gold apiece to have him reach 100%. That's 50,000 gold. At level 15, you might gain 200 per fight.Oh, but what's this? You can buy gold in-game for real money!

The experience opens strong, with a humor-rich premise and an uncomplicated-but-fun combat system. Unfortunately, the game leans too heavily on these, and it quickly gets repetitious. Just as important: Because the repetitious combat takes a long time, the game becomes boring.To see if the game would let me, I decided to take a level 30 quest when my party was level 8. I completed the quest, but it was the last satisfying experience of the game. Every fight was a little grindy: Sleep/stun everything, then focus fire on one enemy. Turn order is the same round after round, so there was no chance of me missing a lapsed sleep or stun. The stun-immune boss required a little more strategy, but it was still repetitious: paladin soaked; druid and witch kept paladin alive; wizard and rogue dealt damage (and occasionally stunned minions).When I got done with this quest, I thought, ""Ah, my party can beat level 30 content. Surely I'll burn through level 20 content like an acetylene torch through butter, so I can quickly advance this light, humorous storyline."" Not so. It turns out that I still have to spend a dozen rounds whittling down level 20 fights. The only difference is that, if I let a sleep or stun lapse, the consequences are lower, since the monsters don't hit as hard.Bottom line: I got some decent entertainment value out of Knights and Pen and Paper. I'm probably not going to finish it, though, and I can't say I would have missed much if I hadn't played it."

The second strike is that the massive amounts of heat are going to waste doing nothing at high speeds - the game is irritatingly slow at times, and I used CheatEngine to double KPP+1's speed to get it to a tolerable level. In-app purchases are the third strike leading me to conclude: KPP+1 is a bad game.

At first it was interesting in the simplicity and style, yet as the game progresses it feel immensely tedious.  There will be quests where you are required to go from one location to another and have to fight at each step along the way, sometimes up to five or six battles.  Then once you arrive the quest is to slay a number of monsters repeatedly.  The endgame seems almost unfair, requiring a lot of grinding unless you spend a lot of time exploring sidequests.  Based on the price, I think the game has a niche in the category of game where you advance through it periodically while taking a break from other games.  Could improvements be made? Absolutely, but for an indie title with some creative 4th wall shattering, it serves it's place decently."

But the play time is so artifically padded that you probably will not complete the game.A sequel has been announced and I hope and pray it addresses the flaws this game has or even just does away with the excessive grinding for the inevitable PC port.I know some smartass will reply that this is an RPG and you are supposed to grind but this isn't 1997 anymore.

,Not Recommended,231740,11790539,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,Sutalffa,"KPP+1 seems like an interesting concept, but it's really not. The theme is you actually roleplay players in a roleplaying world as characters.  You get the impression this is going to result in lots of humor and a diversity of environments where the players goof around in-character, but it doesn't happen.  Instead, you just end up picking a party of characters, optimize their performance with player personalities, buy add-ons for your gameroom that give character bonuses such as a better table or door, and meander through a roleplaying world which has little plot in itself nevermind the lack of out-of-character plot among the players.There isn't THAT much grinding if you do all the quests and use your items and gameroom bonuses appropriately to multiply the amount of experience and gold you get from battles, but you still have to complete slayer quests which are like how in MMOs you have to kill so many monsters for a reward.  The battle system is rather repetitive too.  Basically, you just get a taunting tank, heal it, and disable opponents while bombarding them with a magic dps and melee dps.  This goes on over and over with no change in tactics.  I say this despite how you can ""choose the difficulty"" by picking how many monsters you want to fight.  It's either you pick too little monsters to bother, pick just enough to repeat over and over, or pick too many to handle.  On the plus side, you can grab revive items in the shop in case your party dies out rather than paying the revive cost if you pick too many to handle, but it still doesn't make up for the repetition.This is compounded by the ridiculous investment needed to level up the blacksmith by buying ""grindstones"".  Each one costs 25 coins, yet the optimal levels of upgrading require around 100 grindstones.  Basically, that means you have to earn 6-7k coins, and when you're earning around 50-100 coins per fight until about 75% of the way through the game where you start earning 250-300 coins per fight, that means you're not going to experience using the blacksmith for a very long time.  You also need to buy enough luck amulets and great molten rings to make the optimal level cost effective, and you have to buy gameroom items to accelerate your income, so that's another 2-3k.  This ignores how you're spending coins on other things, so it really takes a long time just to unlock better equipment for your party.The campaign ultimately feels like a tutorial sampler of what the game has to offer.  Had the game included a custom campaign editor, this would be awesome since players could make their own material and share it in the community.  Heck, the campaign even feels like it'll unlock this towards the end in saying how the gameworld is much bigger than what you can see, but it never gets unlocked.  Also, the new classes you unlock are mostly pointless.  They're effective, but you have to level them up instead of being able to introduce them into the game right away, and that's a huge timesink.  Even if you play ""New Game+"" you still have to level them up.  This really stinks since it'd be nice to immediately jump into using a barbarian, knight, shaman, bard, and necromancer instead of a warrior, cleric, druid, mage, and rogue.  The game however just says, ""NO.  YOU DO HARD WAY OR NOT AT ALL!  GRRR!""On the other hand, if you start a plain old new game for the party, then you have to go through the hassle of upgrading the blacksmith all over again!  Don't forget the great molten rings or luck amulets too!  To be fair, you don't have to buy the income earning gameroom upgrades again, and you can technically grind out the income with your previous party in your other game since coins pool from all saved games, but still, you're talking about a good 8-9k in coins just to upgrade the blacksmith again. At that rate, you might as well just buy experience potions for 100 coins a pop to give everyone 6500 experience, plus you can buy the potion upgrades in the game room and use Ronaldo for the potion upgrade......but still, it's just more repetition.  This is supposed to be a roleplaying game instead of a railroad shooter.If the devs just spend a little more time on writing a plot, this game could have been awesome, but they didn't, so it flopped."

The enjoyment value in this game is pretty inadequate.1) Clicking fiestaYou basically just need to click when you want to do almost anything. Just click the shop icon to buy item, just click the map button to travel, etc. You have control of the dungeon master. You get to choose what and how many enemies you want to fight with the limit of 7 (after unlocking it) same type of creature (combination is not possible). The combat system is pretty much lacking, and no brainer. There are only three damage type, physical, nature and magic. It doesn't matter if you hit enemies with ice or fire. The only option you have in organizing your party is pretty much who you want to include in the party (max. 5), no formation whatsoever. The ""threat level"" system is at best vague and unclear.2) Unclear storyline and boring questAfter playing this game for so long, I still have no idea what the story is about. Comments from the ""players"" range from boring to cheezy at best. The variations of sidequest are too little. Collect certain item from certain monster drop, kill certain amount of certain monster, escort someone (and 100% encounter at every place when you do this quest) and go to certain dungeon to fight with the developer. There ain't a puzzle for me to solve.3) Character creationCharacter creation is pretty much simple. Every ""player"" have his own bonus and you might want to make use of this bonus for the most fitting job. Each have 4 skills and set stats built. Everytime you level up, you have one skill point to spent. At first this seems okayish but as your level goes up, balance issue will be a slap on the face. Physical attack easily overpower magic skill. Leaving spellcasters as useless ragdoll.4) Bad economy and MicrotransactionThe main argument in the forum dwell on this ""innocent"" button on the top right corner. You can buy in game gold that you can earn by slaying monsters with real money. Why the heck it is there in a paid content anyway? Let me skip that annoyingly long argument. There are a few things that make people upset with the economy of the game. Firstly, the blacksmith. The only way to have better equipment is to go to the blacksmith (that can be found in some places) and have them upgraded for a fee. This process involve probabilistic element with success rate proportional with the level of the blacksmith. There are ways to reduce the cost and leveling the blacksmith without risking your gold but those are pretty much grinding. Secondly, you ""buy"" ""players"" with gold to start the game. There are ""players"" that are so expensive that it is impossible to start the game with without buying gold (on your first run). Thirdly, the gold is tied to your account, meaning that after your first run, you can start a second run with that amount that is left. This make second run pretty much broken as you probably have too much gold.5) The music is bad and annoying. It is getting on my nerves after a while."

You play as a group of roleplayers sitting around a table, going on an adventure led by a dungeon master. No, really. The DM is actually there, narrating the quest. It’s a really unique RPG in its presentation, though not so much in its gameplay, which is a rather simple turn-based battle system.The simplicity owes to the game's origins on mobile platforms, and this is why recommending KoPP is complicated for me: It still plays exactly like a mobile game, much better suited for playing in small intervals. Understandably, a lot of people don't expect that from a $10 PC game. If it was the same price as the mobile version ($3), maybe it could get away with its lack of depth. Not for this price.It's also worth noting that there are microtransactions in the game. [Update: Not anymore. As of patch 2.09 (2014/02/14), they have been removed from the game.]. Also, some achievements are broken, and won't be fixed for a while. [Update: Also fixed in patch 2.09, I was able to obtain all of them.]You may be wondering why I recommend the game after all. Very simple. I still enjoyed it. I'd play it while watching a stream or something, when I wanted to unwind and avoid ultra-complex games. In a way, I went through it with the mobile mindset, and this is the case in which I'd recommend KoPP, if you want a simple game.Just don't get it for full price, even if you really want it.

If anything, this game is an intimately-crafted love letter to all things nerdy (D&D, sci fi, etc.). The game does have microtransactions but, if you play it right, you don't need to buy anything beyond the game itself. The only other things that I've spent money on are trading cards (which is par for the course on Steam). If you're looking for a decent roleplaying game with hours of replay value then this is the right one for you.

However it boils down to very shallow RPG that's comparable to some of the original GameBoy's launch titles.You select a premade character, there's no way to customize their look but you do get to distribute points to their character sheets. Each of the 10 classes only has 4 abilities, and that is counting their passives. Damage is either magical or physical, no breakdowns within such as fire, slashing, holy, etc.  You'll quickly find others to join your party and unlock new classes to choose from.An interesting feature is that when a battle starts you choose what type of enemies appear and how many there are, you're the dungeon master as well as the player. You'll probably want to have a tank in your party to taunt, and at least one area of effect damage dealer, along with a healer, and maybe a single target damager to mop up the rough edges and elites. Extremely basic tactics here.The unlockables were nice (they were previously microtransactions but changed in this mobile to Steam port to be bought only with in game gold), but they make the game far too easy. Even with the cheats off don't expect a challege here. But you'll probably get some laughs and have fun, especially if you've ever put hours into any RPG.

In the game, you play as a group of friends, getting together to play Dungeons & Dragons. You're not just picking classes, but picking which ""real life"" person is playing the characters in game. Want grandma to be the paladin on your team? No problem! Think your little brother would be best suited as a stealthy rogue? You can do that too. Although the character creation is as simple as matching an archetype to a class (like Hipster Mage or Pizza Guy Druid), it's pretty fun and gives the game replayability as you want to experiment with different combinations.The storyline is light, but definitely will bring back memories to anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons in their lives. You travel through towns like ""Journey Village"" and battle monsters to save missing kings in a world full of pop culture references. It might be a bit silly if you're looking for a serious RPG, but if you love the classic turn-based battle style of the early Final Fantasy games, you'll at least appreciate the simple awesomeness of the gameplay. It's also hugely accessible and easy to learn for those who've never played that kinda game before.You'll get the most out of this if you're just a huge RPG fan, because Knights of Pen and Paper relies a lot on nostalgia. Still, it's a really fun RPG that can eat up many hours of your life in a very satisfying way. It's a really good example of what indie game companies are capable of.

With the pixel art style and humors in story it brings you back to 80's when you sit with friends and roll some dice. Gameplay is quite casual and easy to pick up when you've got some time to kill.You can create a 5 members party, every member only have 4 skills, (some of them are passive skills) and there's no positioning. So there's really not much space for tactics, you'd probably be using the same way against all types of enemies. You can create a new member and exchange someone in your party to have some variety. But trying to level  up that guy is another long way to go. There are only limited amount of quests to do, after completing them all you can do is battle with some EXP/gold efficient monsters again and again.I stopped playing when find myself stuck at a boss and have to farm some money. To me, Knights of Pen and Paper = RPG in a nutshell. It shows me what I like and dislike in RPGs, without having all those fancy graphics, cut scenes, complex battle systems, large amounts of items.

,Recommended,231740,34026126,Posted: 4 August,all,agriba,"Knights of Pen and Paper is a simple, stream-lined rpg in the style of a table top rpg (ala, Dungeons and Dragons).This game is a barebones RPG, you have five characters with four abilities to level up and then you fight in turn based combat.  It's a tad slow, a tad simple, and highly repetitive.  Despite this, there are two good qualities: experimenting with all the classes and combinations is quite fun and the game takes some time before becoming grind-y.In addition to the base gameplay, there are a few other things going on.  A variety of quests which essentially all end up being just fighitng thigns over and over.  Different environments and enemies with a fun style.  A bunch of  flavor in the text.  And a ""crafting system"" that ends up just being collecting items to upgrade the blacksmith and pouring money into him to upgrade your characters in a very ineffecient method.With all that said, it may seems like this is a bad game, but in reality rating this game is hard.  It is cheap and the base gameplay is satisfying in that it is rewarding on a very simple way (much like incremental games) combined with almost brain-dead gameplay.It's definatly not for everyone, but Knights of Pen and Paper has its audiene.  Fans of Rpgs could get a few hours out of it before it beomes too grindy.  Those who enjoy incrimental games would probably get the most out of the game.  In the end its really just a question of what you expect for the price.  I'm giving it a thumbs up, but only for the right audience."

Thankfully, this can be countered with Cheat Engine and some patience** = More on this later, if you're serious about buying the game.Here we have a short, but incredibly cute and fun game that's at least worth a shot to anybody who is a fan of DnD, JRPGs and tons of meta humor. To my knowledge, it's the only Dungeons and Dragons Simulator on Steam right now, at least to my knowledge, and the idea of being able to simulate a DnD game without the pain of finding people interested is EXTREMELY cool overall. As somebody who loves tabletop RPGs by seldom plays them due to the effort required to set them up on a regular basis, the very premise of this game was enough to sell me alone.And overall? It's a very good game. The story, which cliched, revels in it's clichedness, making tons of wisecracks at numerous genres, other games and making enough pop culture references to almost drown it it - and given the nature of this game, instead of being aggravating and forced, the DnD Simulator idea actually helps it work, overall making a stupidly enjoyable game that knows how dumb it is yet manages to make the best out of said idiocy.With solid gameplay, fine-tuned performance (then again, it's pretty damn hard to turn a retro RPG into an unplayable, buggy mess, but it happens) and a hilarious cast of zany characters, the game's only real major flaw is it's implication of microtransactions, in order to get more gold to buy more stuff. Normally this would seriously hurt the game since it demands some spending to be truly rich, but it backfires hilariously with Cheat Engine, as an increase from one penny to another means that you'll be able to use Cheat Engine to maintain a reasonably-fat wallet in-game.Overall, this is a fun, zany and stupidly enjoyable RPG with good writing, though I recommend you use Cheat Engine to enjoy it at it's fullest. Otherwise, give this game a go if you get the chance.For those too lazy to look up Cheat Engine:http://www.cheatengine.org/"

Gameplay is solid and funny, dialogues and overall plot are nice and have some cute references to the geek culture. Art is very very nice too.+1 Edition has an addition to the main plot like it was made in Fable: The Lost Chapters. Just a couple of extra quests which take place in extra locations. Nothing special.I have completed this game in a couple of days and I liked it. It has some replay value due to many possible character combinations, but I didn't bother with replaying it. Maybe sometime in the future.P.S. Do not mind the microtransaction system so many people are raging about. It's just a little gimmick, not a Pay2Win feature. You can comfortably play without it and still do not insanely grind mobs so you can buy some crucial stuff. No, you can complete the game without any payments and without breaking a sweat (as I did).My score: 8/10."

Unfortunately, they left out the game part of D&D.Essentially, this game is trying to be a humorous game. It's not one you play for a challenge or for fun, but to laugh at. Unfortunately, there are only so many jokes, and there's lots of battling that must be done to go forward. Typically, you'll spend at least ten minutes battling before the next joke or reference, and there's still no guarantee you'll even find it funny.That might be acceptable if battling was any fun, but unfortunately, it isn't. Every enemy in the game (at least those that I saw) does the exact same thing: Attack on their turn. There is literally nothing to react to except damage. To make matters worse, once you reach level 5 and unlock each of your skills, you can kiss any sense of progression goodbye, since every subsequent level only grants more stat-ups and numerical upgrades to said skills. As for loot and gear, the fun is sucked out of that too; while loot often drops, you have access to a store that sells pretty much any gear you could ever need, so if you're halfway intelligent about visiting it, any loot that drops will always be inferior vendor trash.Lastly, the game is OBSCENELY grindy. This is the level of grind I would expect from an poorly-made free MMO. Doing almost anything in the game costs coins; often a lot of them. And there are two ways to get coins: A) Win battles, or B) Buy them with real money."

Super addictive little RPG game that has a great angle with the way you are people playing a D&D campaign.  Love the retro graphics and all the homages to pop-culture. Worth $3.00 for the +1 version? Absolutely.Here is the caveat; this game is broken and has been since June 2013.  Developers are to busy making a new game to fix the unattainable Steam Achievements for KOPAP+1 so if you like/don't mind having a half empty achievements list this is the game for you.  Personally I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they should remove achievements from the list if they just don't work in the current version of the game.  Also there is some sloppy dialouge skipping.When I played this I always felt that no matter what classes I chose that the combat was still on the simple side.  This game will never be able to shake the feeling that you're playing a micro-transaction based iPhone/Andriod game because that is what it is, just now on Steam.  There are a total of 3 interesting dungeons but the reward for running them isn't nearly where it should be.All in all it's a great time killer and for the price you can't go wrong.

While the premise sounds promising, it doesn't exactly follow that format which would have turned this game into a sim of sorts.  What it does present is an amusing Turn Based RPG game of the old days, from classics like Dragon Warrior to D&D.As someone who actually played D&D for a few years, this game was rather appealing.  Select your team of generic players and their class (and will wear a matching hat for said class) and start an adventure.  The game provides you what most RPG games tend to have: a sense of direction.  You're provided with the main storyline and a few side-quests to pick up some extra gold and exp.Be warned, this game has micro-transactions.  It is not a vital aspect of the game as you can earn gold by farming but it's only optional.  I personally do not approve of it but that should not stop other people from doing so.

Newer gamers may not appreciate it, but it is right for older gamers with busy lives. It is sprinkled with pop culture and various references throughout the game. It may get repetitive at times, but there are various classes to keep things fresh.The game doesn't do a very good job in explaining that you can mine rocks in caves for grindstone, and then take the stones to a town to raise the XP of the blacksmith.

The sense of humor is mildly more down-to-earth, the battles are turn-based RPG style (with no tile-based / movement aspect), but the character progression is similar and the visual style reminds me of it in a good way.  The actual game mechanics are heavily simplified, and seem to be based as much off of japanese computer RPGs as they are off of any particular tabletop game.  The players for your party bicker and banter at eachother with one-liners now and again, I've found at least one quest that seems specifically designed to encourage lateral thinking (""why go to the area ten levels higher than you, when you can /buy/ the quest drop at a store?""), and there seems to be some kind of over-arching storyline that I haven't really gotten far with.DoD is on my computer as sort of an equivalent / replacement for solitaire -- Knights of Pen and Paper is happily getting added into the same category.[Edit]  On later reflection, it also reminds me of MMO's with the get quest / kill X things / get next quest / move to new area dynamic.  Unfortunately, they roam all over the world map and you can only hold one of them at a time -- meaning it's impossible to prioritize what order you want to do them in, particularly when many of them are multi-stage with each step in a different place.  There is very little strategy.  That said, it's still a good mindless game if you like the combat style."

I beat it on my phone twice, then saw it was on steam and immediately scooped it up and I'm well into my third playthrough. My only wish is that the PC version took advantage of the platform and added some improvements.The main one I'd like would be seeing the numerical life totals of the enemies. If I know a spell deals 30 damage...that doesn't really help me a lot when I have to guesstimate how much HP the enemies actually have, and guessing becomes even more difficult when you realize that the damage of attacks is randomized slightly (or in some cases, a lot).Another I'd like is very minor, I'd like it if windows such as your character screens were closeable by just clicking outside the window, instead of needing to click the x. Or at least move the x to the top right instead of bottom left, it only makes sense down there on a phone game for ease of clicking, on PC it's just needlessly different.The last thing I can think of is at least a couple keyboard shortcuts. If the bottom row of buttons were assigned to 1-5, combat would be at least 2 or 3 times as fast and way less tedious, instead of clicking 3 different things for each attack, I can just type 1 2 and then click, for example.All in all though, despite these minor PC-specific annoyances, I highly recommend the game to anyone on any platform.

It's great fun, and the game-within-a-game structure makes for some funny moments in the main quest. While the gameplay can get a little stale after you've maxed everyone out (not hard to do), it's still a fun diversion from time to time. I can wholeheartedly recommend KoP&P, but at the same time ... it's game that's also a tremendous missed opportunity for something greater.My big complaint about the game is the lack of additional content. The one DLC, ""Haunted Fall,"" is a mere sliver of addtional content, and hardly worth the price. This is the kind of game that SCREAMS for a rich set of adds ons and expansions, particularly for high-level gameplay. After two years, however, we have one lackluster, overpriced expansion that would have been a free upgrade from most other publishers.If it had Steam Workshop support, it could easily become one of the best pick-up-and-play RPG games out there. But, again, we have nothing like that. Just a great core game and some tantatlizingly untapped potential.That said, at $10 it's a touch on the pricey side. I picked my copy up on sale for perhaps $5, and when the DLC was maybe $3. It's a great deal at $8, but I'm not sure I'd feel the same way at $20 for the Deluxier version.

Now, I'm going to go ahead and say that I like the style of this game, so I may be a bit biased. However, that does not matter as I will still be honest with this game.My reviews are typically divided into parts. Story, Gameplay, Music/Sounds, and Graphics. So let's get started!Graphics:I decided to start with graphics as they are the LEAST important when it comes to this review. This game is featured in 16 bit (I think) and looks quite good. In fact, you basically don't notice how old the graphics look after a while.Story:The story of this game is very simple. You are a adventurer. More specifically, you are a D&D player playing a character. You get to create your characters in this game, so you can mix and match until you find the ultimate party! You start with only two members at your table. However, you can pay gold to add three more party members. Each class has a different role. Paladin is the tank. Cleric is the healer. Mage is the support/dps and rogue is the 100% pure blood DPS. After you select your party members and their roles, you start by having your DM tell you that you are in a dark dungeon with no recollection of what happened to you previously. Now, I really don't want to spoil anymore, as fans of D&D (myself included) will have a very fun time with this game.Gameplay:This game features a turn-based system using ""initiative"", a real D&D mechanic. Initiative is rolled to see who gets to attack first. Say your character and an ogre were about to have a fight. Your character rolls a 15. The ogre rolls a 9. Therefore, you would get to go first, as you have the higher number. Not only is this game ROLLING in D&D references, it has it's own unique style. Locations are intresting, characters are hilarious and dialogue kept me laughing the entire time. For example, early in the game you have to kill some rats. The DM says a girl walks up to the party. One of your party members will ask, ""Is she hot?"" and your DM replies, ""Fine. Her charisma is 19."" See what I'm saying? So many tabletop references! I guess that's expected. You can upgrade your characters stats using ""table items"" like food or drinks. There are permanent table items, including a BK crown (which allows you to fight 7 monsters at once) and the Holy Grail (which allows you to have 5 members at your table). There are also ""room upgrades"". For example, on the left side of your room, you can have a suit of armor, which gives you +20 health on every character until you change it. On the right side, you can have a fridge, which makes your table items last longer. You can change your tables too. The gold table gives you more gold. The rock table gives you a larger crit chance. This game is full of customization!Music/Sounds:Music and sounds are, like the graphics, designed in a 16 bit fashion, delivering some tunes I've been humming since the day I got the game. The title screen is my personal favorite though!OVERALL RATING:This game is a fantastic game with a lot of comedy.

Simple battle style, but plenty of mobs and heroes to choose from and lots to explore. I'm a big fan of anything with upgrades, and this one has many, as well as little easter eggs to unlock. It's not meant to be taken seriously like a lot of fantasy turn-based strategy, which is what makes it so spectacular."

You have a dungeon master that sits at a table along with your party.  He tells a story and provides quests for you to do.  It's a pretty easy game and fun too.  You can determine how the game is played.  You want to just solo it, bring 5 different classes along, fight just 1 monster or 7.. it's your call.All in all if you dig the graphics and of course like rpg's this game is a definite play through."

The second is the pixel art, which is sumptious and extremely well done.This is a light and amusing game, paying homage to tabletop RPGs and early 90s cRPGs. If you have reservations in respect of the gold buying facility which is apparently a feature of the tablet versions, it is disabled in the PC version. At first I found the concept a little too meta and self-referential, but the humour grew on me to the point where I found myself laughing and recalling real pen and paper sessions where the GM and players said almost exactly the same things the characters in game were saying.If you are trying for full completion of achievements, keep in mind that your gold is common between all your saved games, so you can accumulate a good amount of reserves to equip the uber party you create for the 365/465 day completion achieve. This is probably the most elusive while the similarly rare 50 dungeon complete achieve requires no particular strategy except an appetite for doing the same thing over and over again. I've found resetting or upgrading a party which has completed the game and replaying the content at a higher level to be the best way of accumulating gold for such an attempt.Wait for a decent sale price and you will get at least 25hrs of entertainment for a reasonable sum."

This opens up possibilities for excellent 4th wall breaks and humorous diolalogue, something the devs took full adventege of. The retro styles is pleasing to the eye and, just when i though i had beaten the game, a ton more suddenly opened up.The open endedness of the game was a huge selling point for me. There are clear idicators letting you know which way the plot lies, but you are free to explore wherever the heck you please. Suggestions are given for how strong you ought ot be before you go to different locations so you aren't unduely surprised when your two level ten boys are jumped by a level 25 wraith.There are cons of course. Items and items drops in general are poor, but gold is very easy to get ahold of while still making you work for it, so you can purchase the good items with moderate hassle.

The new items aren't really worth the price tag, because they're all just variations on what was already available (health, mana, etc) but the witch class is interesting and the new content is fun. It looks like the DLC isn't installed because it's integrated into the story, so it only opens up at a certain level, but it's there.

The game's major weak points are as follows:-The combat is very very repetitive.-The quests are repetitive, the only goal of any quest is to kill monsters to obtain their items, to kill monsters to clear a path, or to kill monsters to protect an npc. All quests are to kill monsters.-Grinding is slow and is not stimulating at all.Combat is this game's only real game mechanic and it is boring!While this game gave me nostalgia and a warm feeling in my heart, I lost interest fairly quickly. I feel like it's hard to recreate the pen and paper feel of D&D without other human beings, and this game simply doesn't do it for me.Summary: Maybe if it goes on sale it would be worth some nostalgia induced smiles, but this game is not engaging enough to keep me occupied for hours on end like real D&D with friends is."

The PC Version has increased features, some added monsters, adventures and etc and will keep you playing for hours.Knights of Pen and Paper is as the title suggests a pen and paper kind of game like Dungeons of dragons, where you roll a dice and depending on the number you can get good or bad results. For example, ingame you are camping in the woods and you have to get between 5 and 10 in order for your group to rest without being attacked, if you get lower than 5 and 20 your group will be attacked by an enemy equal to your Level. When you travel you roll the dice and same as before you will either get good or bad results.The characters in this game range from a Jock, A Rocker, Teen girl, Alien, Little brother, Grandma, and many more, each character has a different ability that will make you think if thats the right character for a class. Another example would be the Grandma who has extra Threat so if the gradma was a Warrior she would be the Tank of the group being that the monsters will attack her more than any of her group. The Story ingame is completely up to you, you make choices and the characters follow them.

For about 90% of the battles,youdecide just how many monsters you face, whether you make it easy on yourself and just take on one small bat for minimal but easy exp, or whether you take on a horde of Invaders for major risk/reward exp/gold - a concept which I thought is pretty damn neat.

I have only played the game for a couple of days, but loss of save files seems to be a persistent problem. An update definitely cause a loss of save, but my save file was again lost several hours later. The story and progress of the game are consequential enough that a save loss is significant. This game is not worth playing with a broken save system.EDIT: After making an account with Paradox Interactive, cloud saving does work. If you do not want to have to make an account, don't buy it.

Each of them can attack and then each class has 4 upgradable abilities, but some of them are passive. The problem here is that with a small margin of exception, there's no strategy to the fights. You either hit attack or you use abilities until you run out of mana.The problem with the skills themselves is that the level scaling is frankly horrendous, so if you don't focus on one of the 4 skills, you'll quickly reach a point where you can't play the game anymore because you'll just get trounced during every encounter. This means that you really need 4 characters for each class by the end of the game because if you have a level 20 fire mage and you're up against fire resistant creatures, then you're probably going to get your party killed.Another problem I have is the grinding. For a game that's supposed to be just a short cute DnD knockoff, there is an obscene amount of grinding. Example: ""Collect 20 green apples"". Well, green apples only drop from venus fly traps that take off half your health per attack and killing one isn't a guarantee that they will drop. So to get 20 green apples, you'll probably end up playing 12 encoutners against 3 venus fly traps. And that's just the beggining.The upgrade system is also based on grinding. You need to visit special areas where upgrades can be found (usually caves) then you need to roll a 20 sided dice and hope you get lucky just for the chance of getting an upgrade item. Once you have about 5-10 upgrade items (for your first upgrade) you then take it to a blacksmith who gives you a %chance that your item will be upgraded or he'll just waste your upgrade items. You can upgrade the blacksmith himself so that you're more likely to succeed, but that requires double or even triple the number of upgrade items you already needed, so now you need go to back to grinding in the caves. Plus, each character has 2 items (clothes and weapon) and when you remember that you need multiples of each class, you understand that you'll need hundreds and hundreds of grindstones just for a chance of upgrading your party. You'd think you could just ignore the upgrading, but because the level scaling is so unbalanced, you have to upgrade to proceed.Its just an awful time waster with no sense of progression and I'm glad I bought it on sale because this is literally a ported mobile game."

The combination of the two forces kind of creates a whole new class in most cases, fully capable of being stronger within their respective classes or at the very least more interesting.In fact, you can change everything including the toys on the table, back pieces, dungeon master himself, and so on in order to modify various bonuses, buffs, and the like.

The mechanics are extremely simplistic and imbalanced (very little choice in levelling your characters, and the rogue will do most of the team damage while the paladin will show epic useleness). I don't think there is a scenario to criticize. And the humour ""look, we put a reference to a game you know!"" is not quite enough for me. Overall, prepare to be bored to death."

The controls are obviously made for tablets, so on a PC they can get tedious at times.Gameplay is fun, but becomes repetitive quickly. After a single playthrough I'm quite sure that I'll never touch it again.That said, the price is usually pretty low and on sale it can be recommended. It's more style over substance though, so make sure to love the charme of the game, otherwise it's just a repetitive shallow game.Slight recommendation.6/10"

Char-build is quite simplistic, but in a good way.

As such, it's overpriced (twice as much as the mobile app), but I would still recommend it.  I've played it on the phone and on the laptop, so I've played much more than the 13 hours it shows.Imagine a D&D mod for a Final Fantasy game, and that's largely how Knights of Pen and Paper plays -- D&D feel, FF-type mechanics.It has a great variety of traditional D&D classes (though simplified and somewhat reimagined for the FF-type mechanics), and each class really does play differently from the others.  Sure, you have your traditional D&D roles that each one fits, but they're not just strikers, glass cannons, rogues, etc with different skins.  For example, even though they are all traditionally tanks/strikers, a paladin is not a warrior is not a barbarian in this game.You also have classes that excel verseus single targers, excel versus groups, and some that can do both fairly well.  The true variety between classes is probably the game's greatest selling point, in my opinion.  No two parties will feel the same, giving the game great replay value.You also RP as the DM, as well as the players.  This lets you do things like decide exactly how hard most battles will be (with more xp for more/harder enemies).  It's a nice little touch.Overall, buy it on sale without even thinking about it! Seriously! Pounce on any sale at all!For full price, you probably need to have some D&D nostalgia to make it worth the $10."

Sky is the limit. Not the case here guys. You are VERY limited.:PROS:Cool Idea:CONS:You never touch A single Dice in Knights Of Pen And Paper. Every so often the game will suddenly role for meaningless nonsense, or role when clicking on location to location to determin if an enemy will spawn.Think NES game with FAR LESS story content.You CAN'T interact with the dungeon master at all.Your About as close as you can get to being locked into a set path without ""technically"" being locked into it. You do not make any choices in this game.There are A bunch of clsasses, which is awesome, but guess what? you can't use 70% of them unless you take the time to unlock them. So you can not even use the classes that you want to. The unlocking thing would be fine if Knights of pen and paper was A good game and engaging, but it is not. Instead you are left feeling bored/stuck with meaningless grinding, attempting to unlock your preffered class.Story telling is crap.No replay value.Not challenging at all.You never-endingly click on the map doing fetch and escort quests that are so far BEYOND boring they make me want to pull my hair out.Gold system is flawed.Farming for XP is not fun, and feels more like work. Fun is the reason we play video games.Could possibly be the shitiest RPG (wannabe) I have ever played.Gear crafting is joke.Pixel art is not very good.Music is even worse.Contains no creativity.No interaction or choices between other characters on table and DM.Very little customizationBoring Dialog, and very poorly written.:VERDICT:In no way is it A solo player D&D experience. Or even A decent rpg experience. All you do is click on sh-it with your mouse, hoping that the game will get better, but it never does.There is nothing special or unique about this game.Knights of pen and paper is not worth buying even if it is on sale.Do yourself A solid; grab some snacks, invite some friends over, and play some REAL D&D.To hell with this epic fail, wannabe, turd pile of A game."

I found the combat system to be more Final Fantasy, (which I've played even less,) than D&D.There's no apparent plot, which was even less than I expected, but not actually less than advertised. Of course, I like being at least double my opponent's level, so I wouldn't be following the storyline at the proper pace anyway. I only just found where the blacksmith is, perhaps now that I can improve my weapons & armour, I'll dawdle less. Just as soon as I get my gear leveled up sufficiently.Some reviewers have complained about the boring dialog. In my experience the dialog rarely displays for sufficient time to properly notice that it's even there, let alone read it. Maybe that's why I haven't caught the plot.Pretty good for filling a few unallocated minutes, or hours of meaningless hack-n-slash. Not recommended for when you want a strong story."

That said, after playing it for so long on here, I really enjoyed it enough to consider getting the phone version as well.  It has a lot of replay value due to its insanelygrindyRPG features and its humor.The game's content is often based on external references, including Half-Life and Steam, but the base concept of the game's plot and visuals is that you are a party of Dungeons And Dragons - or a similar table top RPG - players trying to enjoy a night of role-playing.The plot starts to unravel into a quest to save both the pen and paper universe and the real world when a mage starts to cross into their dimension from the game.The overall plot is very humorous and filled with nice cameo appearances by both the game development team and a variety of real world influences.  My personal favorite cameo wasNabe Gewell (Gabe Newell) on Steam Island.Overall, the gameplay is like something out of RPG Maker but ultimately more streamlined and customized than that.  The battles are turn-based and involve up to five player characters and up to seven enemy characters.  The battle system also involves status effects, including stun, sleep, poison, bleed, weaken, strengthen, and other boosts.  Each character/class acts differently in battle, allowing for a lot of strategizing during tough battles.  Battles are fun but also sometimes tedious.  There is a major grind to this game that some people may not appreciate, but I enjoy having long-term content, even if it's just a grind of stats and a bunch of high-powered enemies."

I think its a common thing as well because in the games ""Deluxier edition"" description there is a line that says ""farm experience efficiently"" which makes me think that its an implemented game feature. I don't like it, others may. Now, I think its a good game to buy during a sale, because I dont think it would be worth the 10$ price tag. I would be happy to pay 2-5$ for this game.I am recommending this game because its fun enough to make a little party, enjoy the meta-banter, and experience all the work the devs put into the game such as the locations and monsters.

Unfortunately for those who haven't played D&D, it may be a little hard to understand what is what.

It cameos or references various topical humor bits liek Gremlins, Scooby Doo, Star wars, TMNT, Short Circut (the list goes on amazingly and would probably be the main reason to keep playing when the gameplay starts being a bore: Just to see what else they show us).But it doesn't really keep your interest too well as a game. The classes don't branch out or anything. Every class has the same 3 or 4 moves they started with. It also suffers from ""FF7 status effect syndrome""; where only pure damage and buff moves matter as anytime a debuff would be theoretically useful the monster is immune to it anyway - usually a boss, but not always.It's a cheap game though so you can't really go wrong if you just want to goof around and mess with something that doesn't take itself seriously. In small doses it's fun."
