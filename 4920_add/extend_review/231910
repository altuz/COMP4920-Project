,Recommended,231910,7758310,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Happymartin,"I bought this originally because I watched Danny Sexbang, and Ross play this during their PC focused version of Game Grumps, Steam Train. It was the early 90's remake, but obviously this isn't that version (which you can pick up on GOG by the by if you're interested).It's a short but enjoyable game. There are no dead ends in this game, but you can die, although it's relativly cheap, but funny.The funniest moments in this game are when you just use certain things on other things. For example, use the zipper icon on ANYTHING you can find. It will draw hilarious lines from the also very funny Narrator.However there is some negative here and there. For starters, this game loves to let you know that it got Kickstarted, Alot.Also the humor can be hollow at some points (I'm looking at you Comedian at the Casino, you're not funny.) The game also adds some things that feel kinda unnecesary and pads it out.Reguardless, if you want a funny remake that knows the best kind of humor is juvenile, then I'd grab it.Otherwise I would just go play the original, or something else."
76561197974793815,Not Recommended,231910,32918786,Posted: 28 June,all,theafrochiapet,"A fun nostalgia trip, but a lackluster effort.As a big fan of the original series (I think it's criminal that Larry 7 doesn't get mentioned in lists of great old point-and-click games), this remake does not translate well into a fun game.  Yes, Larry 1 is the lightest in the series in terms of pure gameplay, but many aspects of the game could have been better than what we're given.The 2000s weren't kind to the Leisure Suit Larry series as other developers tried their hand on continuing the franchise.  However they made the mistake of resorting to raunchiness as a go-to source of laughs.  A risque joke, like any joke, is only funny if it's timed right, and the older games were a bit better at picking their spots.  That's not to say the series was consistently good, but when it got things right, it was hard to resist Larry and his quest to get some tail.  Unfortunately this game follows the trend of its recent predecessors, and a lot of the original's charm is largely gone.Land of the Lounge Lizards came out in 1987 and was remade in 1991.  But I honestly can't say this reboot did anything better than the '91 version.  One of the biggest draws for me was the return of the always great Jan Rabson as the voice of Larry.  He's still good, but it being the first Larry game as well as relatively weak writing by the new producers, there's not much witty dialogue to deliver.  The other VAs are serviceable, but none really get a chance to do much as NPCs are only given a few lines and in some instances via a bare-bones dialogue tree.  Also as a matter of personal preference, I did not like the narrator this time around.  Rather than being a teasing side-kick like older Larry misadventures, he comes off more condescending than amusing.The other obvious change in this reboot is the graphics.  And well, they work in some instances.  A lot of time definitely went into the art for the women Larry gets to have extended dialogues with.  It can actually get kind of disorienting in comparison to other things in the game.  The game seems to cheapen out on other aspects.  Transitions into animations are obvious.  Lost Wages has some added details on their map, but they're just there for looks.  The addition of a new girl is kind of nice, but feels tacked on and rushed.  There's a new buffet with a hidden gimmick, but it is hardly logical.  Oh and death scenes?  Gone, you just get a black screen and get to reboot to where you were before.  This game was created via a kickstarter, and I would definitely be upset if this was where my money went to.There was some talk about Al Lowe being upset with the direction the company was going with the reloaded series, and as of present date it looks doubtful the other games will be remade.  If this game is any indication of what was to come, I think we dodged a bullet."

It's more of a nostalgia kind of experience and i don't think everyone will appreciate it. It has a ""Hey remember me?"" message all along the way and that's the main reason why it will fail entertain some people i think. I don't remember the original game to be that short or is my memory playing tricks on me? But if you're the kind of guy who think the price tag should reflect the time you will spend playing then this game will feel like a rip-off. It's short, it's really really short. I really dislike how Al Lowe is playing ""God"" in this game. He really thinks that he's a big deal or something. No you're not famous and no you're not hilarious. This game is called Larry not Al so no one cares about your likes and dislikes.It may sound like a negative review but in overall it's a good game. It's just not made for everyone. I hope they will remake them all but in a more professional way this time."

I was willing to end it all there but then one night, while I was sleeping, Larry Laffer came to me in a dream and he told me ""It is okay my child, I can show you the way""And then, at that very moment, my PC roared to life and then on my monitor was none other than Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards! ""This is what Larry was telling me about!"" I told myself and then, at that point, I was never the same. The true me awoke. For days I trained, learning the moves, the pick up lines, the style. I had to give up my personal routine in order to learn the secrets of the Louge Lizard. On the last day of training, Larry put his hand on my shoulder and said ""You're ready to fufill your destiny""The next day I went into college in my very leisure suit, armed with the knowledge that Larry taught me. And there, at the door was the girl who I was dreaming about for months. With my swagger I slided up to her, moving and grooving and she looked at me with an intrigued look in her eyes. I moved my glasses down my nose, looked her straight in the eyes and said these words:""Hey baby, you must be tired, running around in my mind all day""I finished with a wink and a smile and without warning the entire campus was flooded with female pleasure juice. Neckbeards, weebs and bronies were trying to find safe haven in this river of sexual erruption. And amongst it all was me, drowning in so much ♥♥♥♥♥ you needed to call the lifeguard.Thank you Larry.

Perverted Humor (The comedian from the Hotel's Cabaret doesn't count)2. Sexy girls well except for the hooker3. Hilarious Narrator (I heard that the original narrator from the 80s version of the 1st Larry game is better but I still liked the narrator from the Reloaded version)4. Good puzzle solving5. Hilarious Deaths6. Good Art7. A few references like for example an arcade machine called Angry Broads (Doesn't that remind you of a popular bunch of birds?)8. Good Music9. Good Voice Acting10. Great Tutorial (Al Lowe Made Himself A Cameo In this Game)11. This Short Game Has A Lot Of Replayability If You Want To Gain Some AchievementsCons:1. The game likes to talk about Kickstarter a lot (I understand it got a lot of support but don't remind me all the time I get it)2. The gambling in this game kinda annoys me since the slot machines are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Black Jack is a cold ♥♥♥♥♥ too)Overall If you want some dirty humor in your games then let Larry Laffer teach you how to score girls (I'm kidding don't take his advice)."
,Recommended,231910,2226788,"Posted: 18 September, 2013",all,Paikia,"A cool and impressive remake to the classic point-and-click adventure game, Leisure Suit Larry. This game is a lot of fun, especially thanks to the great work done and time spent on this quality remake.The only drawback, in my opinion, is the exagerated use of the narrator in the game. Wherever you go, whatever you do, everytime you click the left button of the mouse, you get a long and well-acted presentation from the narrator. Why is this bad, you ask? Because the long speeches get boring and tedious and kind of hurt the gameplay. At a certain point I started cutting the narrator mid-sentence, since I wanted to move on, thus missing some important information.All in all, despite the tedious narrator, I had fun. Definitely worth buying if you like point-and-click adventures, and especially if you've played one of the previous versions (the original from the late 80s, I think, and the point-and-click remake from the early 90s)."

If you have a dirty sense of humor, you'll love it too. It's a point and click, with a few women you can interact with, but there is nothing like a nudity sex scene or anything crazy. It's humorous, punny, and dirty. The narrator is fantastic, and reminds me of the wit from the stanley parable. I have not played the original, but I love this game. There are a few moments where you might get stuck, I did and used a walkthrough, but it wasn't too hard. ALSO, if you don't usually have patience in games, I wouldn't get this. To really immerse yourself in the story and the humor, you have to click on A LOT of stuff. I have never played a point and click with this much dialogue on random items and scenery. I liked it, but if you are bothered by that sort of thing it might ruin it for you. Overall I thought this was a fantastic game. I would get it, definately."

(for some, even before your parents were born)What you see on TV etc, not even close to what the '80s were like. (and don't get me started on the '70s <grin>)At the time the game was hilarious.  You had to type in what you wanted to do, and you got killed a lot trying to figure out what to do.Yes, it's shallow, sexist etc. WELCOME TO THE '80s!!  That's how it was.  (and Vegas was for ADULTS not 'families')The remake stays very faithful to the original, so those of us who bought the game for our original PCs, running from 360K floppies, it's very nice trip down memory lane. BTW, I still have said floppies in a box somewhere.  :)If you can take a joke, want to see what your parents (or even grandparents) had in the way of games after hunting sabretooth tiggers, then take a look.I'm actually going to replay it next month on the 30th anniversary of buying the original.(30th anniversary??

Since Larry 1 also got a revamp, this game actually borrows heavily more from the first Larry 1 remake than the original game. Most noticably, the interior of the casino has the double helix elevator that was in the remake as well as alot of the exterior look to Lefty's was also lifted from it. However, even if you've played all three previous versions of this game, alot of the puzzles are updated or changed so as to keep the game fresh.Voice acting was actually pretty good. Some old Sierra alums came along to voice some of the characters, which is a nice audio easter egg.Overall, very fun for a few hours, and a few more playthroughs to unlock all the achievements."

It's also pretty unforgiveable to have characters whose mouth animations don't even try to synch up with the dialogue in this day and age.

So much time has gone by and so many new mechanics have been introduced into games over the years yet the old recipe was used again. It does give you a sense of familiarity, but it felt far too linear, bland and static to be honest. I don't think people unfamiliar to Larry will take a shine to this game.
