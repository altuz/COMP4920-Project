76561197974877837,Recommended,232010,7785543,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Spalls Hurgenson,"I originally purchased this game around the time that the sequel - Euro Truck Simulator 2 - was getting rave reviews. So why not buy the sequel? Because it was priced ten times more and - reviews aside - it seemed doubtful I would enjoy a game where I tediously drove a truck down highways avoiding traffic hauling cargo. At least, I thought,  the first game would give me an idea if I could even stomach the genre. And if it did, well only then would I consider paying the price for the sequel.I was surprised out how engaging this game was. Perhaps because it stood in such stark contrast to all my other driving games (the Need For Speed series, Burnout Paradise, and similar), but there was something very relaxing  and enjoyable about driving between the lanes, making a point not to speed (much) and slam into other cars. It was almost zenlike. The graphics might not be particularly impressive but they got the point across, and the AI of the other cars was pleasantly non-aggressive. Figuring out the best routes to take and what cargos to deliver was not particularly challenging but it was relaxing, and a welcome change from the ordinary.Sadly, that's not enough to sustain the game, at least not for me. Having advanced three tiers and played over twenty hours, the lack of variety is increasingly noticeable. All the highways and cities more or less look the same and the challenge is flat throughout. So while it was a wonderful ride up to this point, it wasn't enough to keep me playing until the nominal ""end"" of the simulation. However, it /was/ enough to get me interested in the sequel, which apparently adds extra content and gameplay. And since that was the whole point of my playing this game in the first place, I consider it time and money well spent."

,Recommended,232010,29574343,Posted: 29 January,all,JDubz,"What is Euro Truck Simulator?Well to put it in perspective, it's more of a huge downgrade from Euro Truck Simulator 2. Although it maybe a downgrade for what Euro Truck Simulator 2 has, this is the first and older version of this game from SCS. These are also the makers of18 Wheels Of SteelSeries.What do you do?Well, in a nutshell you just drive, and deliver cargo to point A to point B to make cash.Is it the same as Euro Truck Simulator 2?Honestly, if you have a computer to runEuro Truck Simulator 2, you would be better off getting that, than rather this.Euro Truck Simulatoris more a downgrade as it's dated at this time and age. It  was the first European based simulator for trucks. The map is less detailed, but not where it's terrible, it was good at it's time when it got released. There are no custimizations for your trucks, and less trucks to buy for yourself. The map size also is cut down compared toEuro Truck Simulator 2Is It Really Worth To Buy Then?I'm not saying this gameISbad, it's just very dated. It's really based on how you like your games. I got this game in the past because I used to play it when I was younger, including the previous titles that SCS have made. I was also unable to runEuro Truck Simulator 2with my old laptop, but now I've upgraded and have not touched this game since.If you were like me in the past, having issues runningEuro Truck Simulator 2this could be a good alternative for you to get by. It has the key features to whatEuro Truck Simulator 2has, but it's just less detailed and minimal.For a rating scale 1-10, it's a solid 8/10For a direct link to ETS2, this link:http://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/If you want a Review based upon ETS2, Please feel free to read my other review:http://steamcommunity.com/id/coo400/recommended/227300"

( I cut my teeth on a green screen IBM bootleg copy of Pilot trainer circa 1988 )  I have often been skeptical of the 'ground runners.'  Trains, racing cars and boats all have the same singular fundementle flaw on the virtual stage.  Primarily that no matter how much you REALLY want it to be true, you are NOT going to get a realistic perspective view of ... well ... ANYTHING.  Land and city scapes will always be a generic  reflection of what you just saw and are about to see again.  SO; having established my rational for skepticesm, what am I doing here?  To put it plainly.  I'm cheap and my entertainment budget can be bought.  In short for $20 I got the whole euro-truken-paint joben collection.  You should too, hopefully here is why....Pro # 1.It's Europe and there isn't a freken war going on.  Well okay...  Actually about 2 thirds of Europe.  Sans the Balkans half of Italy and 1/3 of Iberia.  If you like Scandanavia.  You are officially S.O.L.  Rather Ironic in fact, considering that no less than half of the riggs you use in this series are models made in either Sweden or Norway.  Back to the point.  See something of the great old country without having to shoot it, dog fight over it or deal with Hitler or Napoleon.# 2.Beautifully simple.  Elegantly addictive.  I honestly went into this game with little if any knowledge of truck driving and after 6 hours that passed by like 30 minutes, I not only know something about the actual life style, I can also add that it was fun doing something curiously different than trying to beat a bunch of crazies to a finish line.The one and only con I can come up with, is that the technology of it's day DOES let it down somewhat.  However; as I mentioned before I got the collection so I expect the second edition to be a bit more advanced.  Not only graphic wise but the over all control experience.  This first one is the best to learn on.  If you can get comfy with this one then you can graduate to more complicated challenges.Jim"

Although there is less cities to drive to, I still enjoy it. I love the feeling to be able to drive properly, and have played 20 hours within 2 days due to being obsessed. I'm not saying the game is perfect, hell, the second game might not even be perfect (can't buy it since I have a Mac) however it still is fun.I am quite big on graphics, and I have to admit this isn't so bad. The trucks/cars both look great and so does the interior of the trucks. You can either drive on manual or automatic which adds realism, and so does the various types of weather, time, and the rules of the road. Sound doesn't seem to be much of a problem, it has realistic car, weather, truck and engine noises.Having to deliver more and more in order to gain more money, does take a lot of time. But this leads to the game being more addictive and actually worth it. However, if driving back and forth for a while isn't really your thing, this can become a problem, though I ensure it wont be when you actually try it out, and even better, unlock more places.One thing that has annoyed me while driving around on here is how stupid the other drivers are. They either go the wrong way, beep at me when I am not doing anything wrong, and/or randomly brake when there was no need to which leads me into hitting them, which leads to me having to pay for hitting them. Adding pedestrians or animals would also be something which would make the game better (no I do not want to run them over)Another thing is how the cities are extremely small, and only have up to 5-6 roads, which is bad for when you want to explore other places other than the highway. The sound is good, but not so great. It sounds like I'm driving ontop of the truck rather than inside (might be because the windows are always open for some reason) and the radio does not sound like it's actually coming out of a radio in the truck.Honestly, I love this game even though it has some flaws which I have to live with, however those are probably fixed in ETS2. I recommend this game if you either have a older computer, have a Mac and cannot buy the second one (which is my case) or have a few cash left or is low on cash to spend it on this. An overall 6/10 from me."

From then on in, it concentrated on the American theater with its successful 18 Wheels of Steel series. This game, Euro Truck Simulator is the first of its kind hauling cargo throughout Europe and whilst it has the same feel as its cousin 18 Wheels of Steel, the simulation experience is not quite there as it does feel a little arcade. And if it wasn't for the career objectives, I probably enter this game into an early retirement.The gameplay length is pretty much unlimited as there is no official ‘end’. You can literally go on forever however even the most dedicated truckie sim fan will eventually want to give up. However the game cleverly designed career progression chart, where you need to complete certain tasks to raise the ranks from being a novice to the master trucker. Five ranks in all and designed in a way to get the maximum usage for this game however it does take some considerable time to become the master. And because there are many feats (achievements) to earn, it provides you more reasons to play it so if it wasn't for those I'd probably give it a flick a lot sooner.Full review here -http://www.gamespot.com/euro-truck-simulator/user-reviews/2200-12543344/6 / 10"

I'm guessing people don't like the name on the side of my trailer. Either it's that or people just feel the need to crash into trucks.Eventually dropped the trailer off, and this occasion took me only about 30 seconds to disconnect the trailer.To be honest, about 6 months ago, I wouldn't have thought I'd be reviewing Euro Truck Simulator in a serious manner. But really, these first 45 minutes of gameplay have been pretty decent. There is a realism to the game and it truly reflects how badly British motorists drive. Let's just hope I don't come across a similar amount of bad motorists in France or Portugal.+ Hilarious and surprisingly not frustrating, even though I worry if a lot of the motorists have eyesight problems.+ The graphics are good for the time the game was produced, in my opinion.+ The game has a sense of realism (which I've previously mentioned).+ Engaging and a little atmospheric, too.- Being cut up and sideswiped all the time.

It has some nice music as well, especially when accessingthe game's map.The only real complaints I have about ETS1 involve the flawed physics engine; the engine itself can be fairly glitchy.I would recommend this game, especially if you can't afford ETS2 and still desire something similar. I'd also recommend it if you're interested in seeing how the series itself has progressed over the years."

Instead, buy Euro Truck Simulator 2, or American Truck Simulator. Here are the places where the game shines, and when it flops in execution:Pros:- It is a good insight to where the series of Euro Truck was going.- Consists of Europe, which is quite large on its own.- A variety of trucks, almost similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2.- Cheap- Easy to obtain the game- Easy to pick up, easy to put downCons:- Poor sound engine- Poor physics engine- Overall confusing option menu- No modding scene- Lack of multiplayer (TruckersMP)- Lack of proper Workshop support- Cheap- You get what you pay for- No radio station connectivity, as seen in Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.If you are genuinely curious, try it. This review shouldn't stop you from wanting to try it. But I advise against it, due to ETS2 being $22 and ATS $20. There's already the bulk of Europe in ETS2, and the rest is available through DLC, which isn't wallet burning, and ATS is still being developed, which I find very interesting as time goes on.Personally, I bought this game out of morbid curiousity, due to not owning ETS2 myself. It became extremely awkward as there was no sound apart from the truck/lorry I was driving. I do only have 0.5 hours on this game, but that's all you really need to experience it. Any one is better suited buying ETS2 or ATS.Play it or don't, your choice."

You will then begin to make deliveries for the local industries to earn money which you can spend into upgrading your truck (like better fuel consumption) or buying trading agreements for additional countries as well as obtaining certificates for being egilible to transport specific wares.If you don't like games where nothing spectacular happens then this game is nothing for you.

Things like truck upgrades, unlocking new territories, and hazmat licenses are expensive relative to the amount you get paid for driving. You will be doing a lot of time-consuming long hauls to get a halfway decent truck and open up a few countries.My recommendation would be to load some music files or even audiobooks into the game folder so that you can listen to them through the truck radio, or at least have something going in real life while you play. Otherwise you might get bored before too long just sitting there forever keeping your truck in the lanes... since you're not actually getting paid for it and all.

You go ahead and do a certain task and you have money to buy another truck.Has a decent selection of trucks (As far as I can tell).Cons:Pretty dated graphics (Even for 2008).Pretty dated in general.The map is not as detailed as the other two games.Conclusion:I recommend this game if you are short on money in your steam account and just want to enjoy a classic! Honestly if you haven't played a Euro Truck Game and you're not the type of person that has steam cards flooding then this is a great game to pick up!

A good option if your computer can't run Euro Truck Simulator 2, otherwise just get ETS2. No need to waste your time with the first."

The easiest way to play is with a USB steering wheel, but it is OK with mouse and keyboard. It's a nice way to just calm down after a tough day, because you don't have to have your full focus on it. This is really nice because you can do something else while you are playing without loosing anything from it. I recomend this game, although I have heard that Euro Truck Simulator 2 is much better, so I would check that out too."

You need some kind of wheel for nice smooth turns, otherwilse curves will just be a bunch of corners. It's also difficult to drive a straight line. I am using a vintage UltraRacer PC handheld wheel and it works great.Graphics are very good, and the game doesn't miss a frame on my system:i7 6700 4GHznVidia GTX 960 using DirectX32GB RAM4K resolutionThe challenge of this game is having patience. You have to make quite a few runs to advance your certification and to expand into other countires. I don't mind this since I prefer games a bit more on the relaxing side.While realizing that most drivers are idiots, my only wish is for a little more realism on the part of the AI traffic. A car or truck will stop short in front of you for no apparent reason. Don't tailgate and you'll be ok.I recommend this game if you are into simulation. I must emphasize again though. DON'T buy this game if you have no intention of using a WHEEL. You'll only end up complaining and writing a negative review for a game that deserves better."

You pick what job you want to run, connect the trailer, and drive to the city given.  The drives inbetween cities usually take 10-20 minutes (depending on where you start,) but are relaxing and casual. The only thing I don't like is that if you are playing on a keyboard you usally have to make a lot of fine adjustments to the steering which is why I would suggest playing with a controller because I feel that it would be easier. Would definetly reccomend this game. Although if you can afford it, go for the second one. I just got this one because it was on sale with the Summer Sale."

The map is huge however the places you go almost all look the same. Also after a while it gets repetitive and very boring. It takes a long time to make money and unlock more of the map to exlpore and even when you do it feels like a waste of time since the places look similar. The only goal in the game is to make deliveries, explore new places, and get new trucks to upgrade. In my opinion thats boring.

Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.Here is what I think of it.The controls aren't greatIf you perfer the inside view and have it on low graphics you can't see anything when the sun is shining your wayIt's extremely hard to not crash into anybodyIt's pretty hard to control all togetherYou can hardly see what you need to on most of the camera views (ie, Red lights, other cars, ect)And In the one place you SHOULD see the important things (gas, speed ect) you can't. That being the inside view. I myself perfer to have a simulator feel like you are actually in the scenerio, this game being truck driving I'd imagine you would be inside the truck when driving it. Maybe it was just because I had low graphics on? I don't know.Sorry for going on a minor rant at the end but yes. Thats my review. What I'd rate it? 3/10. Isn't the worst I have seen but in my opinion, still pretty bad."

However, with this game when I hit the breaks, it goes into reverse.  I did not like that at all.  Hit the gas and its auto shifts, which is fine but still to stop the truck from reversing you have to hit the gas.  Ok. that does not seem right and its completely unnatural to drive.Please transfer the ATS control information into Euro Truck Simulator so I can give this a thumbs up.  Unless I missed a download.  Please let me know.  So far I like the game and really wanted to try it out."

But this game has none.  Everthing seems the just same. Details are poorer than driving games 10 years older than that. Different places are hardly distinuishable, cities are really sparse (ie, in Switzerland there is only Bern, in Italy just Rome and Milan), and when you visit them, they just look like small villages in the middle of nowhere. Perhaps that's what a truck driver sees, visiting only the industrial areas of citiies, but, even so, not once I experienced the magnificence of observing a really large city from a distance.Music is inexistent; still no radio stations available after 4 hours of playtime, so I had to open an external music player to listen to while driving.Controls are not satisfying either (quite clumpsy), but perhaps I'm using the wrong truck.To give you an idea about ""role playing"" part, I have to repeatedly drive between Bern and Rome about 15 times, just to unlock a new area, in the hope of seeing something barely different.From the trading aspect, there are no real choices: Just sort the missions and take the one that gives the most money. Taking short missions is not a clever choice imho, due to the time lost during long manuevers inside ""cities"".Besides the relatively prototype idea, nothing interesting."

76561198084903515,Recommended,232010,34119753,Posted: 9 August,all,GarySiniseFan87,"Mission: Space (stylized as Mission: SPACE) is a centrifugal motion simulator thrill ride at Epcot in Walt Disney World. It simulates what an astronaut might experience aboard a spacecraft on a mission to Mars, from the higher g-force of liftoff to the speculative hypersleep.The attraction opened to the public in a ""soft opening"" mode in June 2003, and celebrated its grand opening on October 9 with a ceremony attended by Disney CEO Michael Eisner, HP CEO Carly Fiorina and NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, as well as several NASA astronauts from its many phases of human space exploration (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle program and two crew members aboard the International Space Station).The attraction was built on the former site of Horizons, a dark ride that offered optimistic visions of what life might be like in the future. Horizons closed permanently in 1999 after a few years of sporadic operation; construction began on Mission: Space shortly thereafter. Industry estimates put the cost of developing the new attraction at US$100 million. The pavilion, like others at Epcot, features a VIP lounge for HP employees called The Red Planet Room.Initially it was sponsored by Compaq, which began working with Disney Imagineers on the design in April 2000.[1] Hewlett-Packard assumed the sponsorship upon its merger with Compaq in 2002. The simulator hardware used in Mission: Space was designed and built by Environmental Tectonics Corporation of Pennsylvania with a nearly $30 million contract awarded in February 2000. Environmental Tectonics sued Disney in 2003 seeking over $15 million US alleging failure to pay the full amount of the contract and sharing proprietary design details with competitors. Disney countersued alleging the company failed to deliver according to the contract and increased the cost of the ride by nearly $20 million US. The companies settled in January 2009.[2]The attraction was completely closed for a refurbishment on June 5, 2017.[3] During D23 2017, it was confirmed that the Green Mission would be given a new video simulating a flight around the Earth, and the Orange mission would keep the Mars mission, but with updated graphics.[4] The attraction will reopen on August 13, 2017.Contents1 Ride1.1 Experience1.2 Mechanics2 Controversy3 Statistics4 Tributes to Horizons5 References6 External linksRideExperienceMission: Space in the Future World section of Epcot.Mission: Space is meant to simulate astronaut training for the first manned mission to Mars aboard the fictional X-2 Deep Space Shuttle in 2036, right after the seventy-fifth anniversary of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human to enter space. (The year 2036 can be deduced from plaques in the attraction's queue celebrating 75 years of human spaceflight, including two faux milestones in the future.) Riders are ""trainees"" at the fictional International Space Training Center (ISTC), where they are arranged into crews of four before watching an introductory video featuring actor Gary Sinise, who starred in the space dramas Apollo 13 and Mission to Mars.Before boarding the simulators, each rider is assigned an on-board role (navigator, pilot, commander, or engineer) and given two tasks to perform during the mission (pressing a specific button when prompted). For example, one of the commander's buttons initiates the rocket's first-stage separation, and the other activates manual flight control. The spacecraft's on-board self-automated pilot will perform each task if the rider does not respond to his or her prompt from Mission Control or if there is no one to perform the task. Also featured are various labeled buttons and switches which the rider may play with but do nothing; they are only there to add to the realism aspect of the ride.The mission includes liftoff from the ISTC, a slingshot around the moon for a gravity-assisted boost, a brief period of simulated hypersleep (to pass the lengthy time required to reach Mars), and a descent for landing on the Martian surface, where riders manually control the vehicle with a joystick. As a training exercise, the mission contains several unexpected situations that add to the drama.The futuristic X-2 vehicle is a three-stage rocket which is said to use several technologies in development today, including aerospike engines, solid hydrogen fuel, an aerobrake, and carbon nanotubes.The attraction queue contains several items and commemorative plaques from past, present, and fictional future space missions. Among the items on display are props from the 2000 film Mission to Mars, including the rotating ""gravity wheel"" from the predecessor X-1 spacecraft, a model of which hangs from the ceiling, and a replica of a NASA moon rover from the Apollo program.Upon conclusion of the training exercise, guests are invited to participate in activities at the Advanced Training Lab, a post-show area containing a group game called Mission: Space Race in which players perform tasks as Mission Control technicians aiding two X-2 spacecraft racing to return to Earth; a space-themed play area for toddlers; a single-person, arcade-style game in which an astronaut explores Mars via jetpack; and a kiosk where brief video postcards can be created and sent via e-mail.MechanicsThe attraction is a multiple-arm centrifuge that achieves the illusion of acceleration by spinning and tilting sealed capsules during the four-minute ""mission."" Fans blow air gently at riders to help avoid motion sickness, and a magnified display in front of each rider simulates a window to space with high-resolution computer-generated imagery. Mission: Space comprises four separate centrifuges, each with 10 capsules holding four riders.The attraction exposes riders to forces up to 2.5G, more than twice the force of gravity at the Earth's surface (effectively multiplying a rider's weight by 2.5). A few months after the ride's opening, motion sickness bags were added within easy reach of riders.[5]ControversyMain article: Incidents at Walt Disney World ResortThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The minimum height requirement for Mission: Space is 44 inches (112 cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution that people who do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to motion sickness should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to motion sickness, or who have a headache or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head flat against the headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause undesirable effects such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.Several people have been taken to local hospitals for chest pain and nausea after riding. Most who complained of these symptoms were over 55 years old. Two people have died after completing the ride, although due to pre-existing conditions — one, a 4-year-old boy, with an undiagnosed heart condition, and the other, a 49-year-old woman, from a stroke due to high blood pressure.On May 19, 2006, Disney began offering a less intense version of Mission: Space (called Green Team, also known as Less Intense training or no spinning), where the centrifuge does not spin, thus eliminating the forces of lateral acceleration for riders who choose the more tame experience. The cabs themselves still pitch and pivot, providing some motion. The normal ride is s"

Even the main cities such as Berlin or Amsterdam all look identical; just a few roads (which some of them are locked anyway) leading to a freeway. Graphics are not too bad for a 2008 game. Another bad thing is the trucks, from what I can remember you have 4 truck brands which are not even licenced trucks so they have a fake name and you can't even customize them, all you can do is just upgrade the engine which will make the truck a bit quicker or upgrade your fuel tank so you can drive for a longer distance. would not recommend, you'll be better off getting the second one which is actually really good"

Choose a brand, go deliver some goods, earn money, buy better truck, unlock other countries. No need to hurry, just drive decent. The cruise control is awesome...Nice virtual Europe (i really miss Scandinavia though, being from Denmark)But I like this...It feels better to control, than ETS 2... More arcade... Easier, I guess... I like the navigator better, the trucks are steady, there are lots of little things that I enjoy more than in ETS2. I love the simple way everything is handled, and gives you a good overlook. The message-log is awesome, miss that in ETS2. And you can visit Rome and other cities that are not in ETS2...But ETS2 is prettier and bigger, and you can hire drivers to work for you ... And it has a Scandinavia DLC - So I bought that too ;)Graphics in ETS1 are descent though... Perhaps a bit too much copy/paste, some roads are too alike. The countries and cities could also have been more different looking. I would have liked a few more (and bigger) cities ... I could NOT find any mods for this? The interior of the trucks are bad, you can't see the speedometer when turning the wheel, realistic, perhaps but annoying.First I got tired the first few hours of the game, but it gets exciting once you've done a few runs, and can upgrade. It is difficult trying to get enough money... It can be very repeteative, and the first trucks you can afford are very slow... When I ALT-TAB, I have to save and load to get the game to work.With steering wheels, the game is twice as good :)The short review: More arcade than ETS2"

But what I do have a bit of an issue with is the AI...  The AI in Euro Truck Simulator drives aggressively.  They honk if you're not going top speed the moment a light changes, they constantly want to pull in front of you (and then apply their brakes), they want to apply their brakes also if you happen to change lanes and are now behind them.I was driving southbound from Belgium to Paris, and checked my map, I needed to make the next right turn.  But there was a merge from another highway onto the same highway I was on before the right hand turn.  Oh boy.  So another truck hauling wood turns in from the right and for whatever reason doesn't merge, but he makes sure to keep SAME SPEED.  I speed up, he speeds up.  I slow down, he slows down.  What an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  So I brake rapidly and pull into the lane behind him at 60, he slams his foot on the brakes, and bam, rear ended him because this guy did not want me to get where I was going with my cheese.Yelling profanity and quit the game.10/10, will truck drive again later."

I personally enjoy the first ETS(Euro Truck Simulator) versus ETS 2 & American TS. What makes this game really great is that it's not overpolished. No stupid Speed violations every mile. Not really graphic intensive which is a plus for me. The only thing it lacks is a few bugs in the AI vehicles and Lack of time constraints to make it fun. Overall it's in my top 10 games! Would suggest this game to anyone into realism and quality.
,Recommended,232010,25575238,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,ThePCGamer101,"DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mineEuro Trcuk Simulator is a driving simulator game developed by SCS Software, the same people behind the 18 Wheels of Steel franchise and the Bus Driver game along with many other simulation gamesA bit of history as to how I knew SCS Software and why I love their games, I orignally discovered SCS Software's games with 18 Wheels of Steel, a trucking game which took place in countries all over the worldI loved the game so much that my family relatives would always get me an 18 Wheels of Steel game for Christmas or my birthday, all the way to the last game in the series titled: 18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker 2 which ended my love of the 18 Wheels of Steel seriesI also played the bus simulator game known as Bus Driver and both the 18 Wheels of Steel games and the Bus Driver, I now own all of them on retail, however you can now buy them digitally on SteamNow with the history lesson out of the way, let's go onto Euro Truck SimulatorEuro Truck Simulator takes place in the lovely continent known as Europe where you can drive and deliver items to all sorts of companies across Europe. From the United Kingdom to Germany and from Italy to France and so onThe game is extremely relaxing as you just drive on long highway roads travelling from one country to another. However, the game does also penalize you for driving incorrectly such as going the wrong way, through a red traffic light, driving on the wrong side of the road, hitting a car or a truck, no indicators, speeding and so on. So it's not all relax on the busy streets of EuropeYou deliver all sorts of items from food to livestock to hardware and big bulky things across the European landscapes and deliver it to your next port of call. The game is extremely easy yet oddly satisfying, relaxing and a huge time wasterThe game's graphics are okay but do show their age. Euro Truck Simulator came out in 2008 and uses an older engine that SCS Software uses on their games. I know because some of the graphical options, sound effects and even music is recycled from SCS Software's other games of the time such as the 18 Wheels of Steel series and the Bus Driver game which came out a year before in 2007This may put off some people but for me I don't really care for graphics, however, if you want prettier graphics than I highly recommend the sequel, Euro Truck Simulator 2 or it's American counterpart, American Trcuk Simulator which has prettier graphics and better A.I.When it comes to the recommendation of whether or not Euro Trcuk Simualtor is the game for you, if you like games that are simulation games and likes games where you just drive around and deliver stuff, then Euro Truck Simualtor is the game for you, otherwise, don't even botherIf you are going for graphical fidelity, I would highly recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator as they have prettier graphics, better A.I. and more content. If you want to have the SCS Software collection of games, then by all means, start with Euro Truck SimulatorDRIVE SAFE!RECOMMENDED :)"

The steering controls when using a wheel are a bit more complicated(but still achievable) and the economic system can be more challenging...(I keep running out of fuel and don't have the funds to call for emergency services). Still it's one of SCS software's earlier projects so it's not exactly as polished as ETS2 ..for example two major drawbacks are the inabilty to set the FOV or adjust your seat to get a better view in cab view and you cannot tilt the camera down in exterior view like you can in ETS2 making driving in that camera mode just as challenging.

For me i like this game because of the mods! The maps of this game are lot of them and i really like it because they were so long especially Mega Mix Map v5. The graphics got a little bit improved than 18 WOS Haulin and 18 WOS American Long Haul. Also"

I wonder if this will help me later on in my life? Well the rules of the road will, if you are an adult and you think your child would like this game, well they will, its really enjoyable to travel around europe! I am thinking aout buying the second game but i dont know, its £15 the most ive spent on a game is £10.99 which is stranded deep, i may wait until the game goes on sale. A great game though, i bought this for £0.80, it was on offer i sold an item from team fortress and i got £1.20 so i bought this game and im very pleased!"
