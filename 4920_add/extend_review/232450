The heroic and legendary cards completely overwelm the other cards by a drastic amount. Even after months of rewards you won't be able to compete with someone who paid. In ranked play decks may be filled with over half of these types of cards. If you have a decent amount of money to throw at it then get it, but if you're just a casual gamer then it will cause you a great amount of anti-fun."

Competitive ladder and casual mode. Timed and untimed turn queues. Pass-and-play mode, to play with ur friend on 1 device. And even ""asynchronous turn-based"" mode, reminiscent of ancient play-by-email games, when both players do their turns independently (though, sequentially) whenever they come online. And.. ""Play Random Deck"" button, dammit seriously, how often do you see it in card games, think about it?? :DHalf of the features above were unreasonably cut on later stages. Or reasonably; does it matter though?.. (find me reason to cut ""Play Random Deck"" function btw)SolForge spent in beta ridiculously huge period of time - playable state was around 2012 afaik, so 4 years after kickstarter finished, at least. (If this isn't obvious hint, than what?..)Card art is wonderful and 300% deserves permanent place on my harddrive. Looks very professional, especially among hoards of these Hearthstone-wannabes. To remind, conflux arts require separate talents, at the very least 1 for each setting. All creatures here are drawn in 3 evolution levels (or 4, if OP :D), like your pokemons, normal->Cooler->SUPERCOOL. Girls are hot, undead are sadistic, mechs are heavy, giants are brutal, etc.It will be remembered by me personally as a card game with most generous business model ever seen. For long time they were giving 2 boosters + currency + tickets EVERY day - just for playing couple games vs AI. After huge game rework, daily boosters were reduced to 1 (with small chance of getting 10) and AI games were no longer counted, but still. I heard veterans talking about tournament rewards being overgenerous as well. The fact should speak for itself: without giving a penny or actually playing ANYTHING except dailies, ever - my collection as of today contains: playsets of everything except last 2 rarities | 5/7 expansions with playsets of penultimate rarity | at least 1 of each ultimate rarity, 2/3 of them are playsets or 2 of. In the game with 7 sets and ~770 cards of 4 rarities total. I don't have a single alt art card for bragging though, for reason above (most aa don't even look cool though -.-). Regularly (once in couple monthes), a special version of draft mode was made available - 'Guaranteed Legendary Draft': with entry fee of 7 tickets you were given 1 booster full of legendaries to choose from. And a booster as a compensation prize at the end as usual :D. With 3 tickets given as daily rewards, it sounds like 1 free ultimate rarity card in ~2 days.. and not even random, you could choose it like in marketplace :D. No wonder people were hoarding tons of tickets just for this event. Huge business model mistake, if you ask me.Another reason for remembering - the record amount of boosters I opened at once - 1111. Not in one sit, accumulated amount was opened in 3 days with pauses. Could be little more, but yeah, for the cool number. And anyway I don't think I will ever reach that number in any other game, physical or digital. Total amount of SolForge boosters was ~1500, plus couple ""Legendary Chests"" - big boosters with guaranteed ultimate + penultimate rarities inside.And the last reason, I will remember it as a game I used to continuously collect, and never got to actually play it, even once. Except for campaign and AI skirmishes =DSolForge is OPD as of today, January 31, 2017...and... Nope! Good Guys at Grinding Gear Games ('Path Of Exile' developers) heard about the tragedy and saved the day by willing to maintain server costs!

Delayed releasing the new client for about half a year, then came out with a client that didn't work, only fixing it to be a bad client that does somewhat work a week after their release.Making daily quests only doable against real opponents also made it virtually impossible for newer players to complete their dailies.

,Recommended,232450,7864484,"Posted: 1 December, 2013",all,Athravan,"SolForge is an interesting take on the digital card genre. It's a fairly simplistic card game, but with a suprising amount of depth / theorycrafting to your decks once you've unlocked some cards. It has the unique aspect of your cards levelling up as you play them; adding a depth of strategy that other card games haven't really explored. Not only do you have to think about what card to play right now, in order to damage your opponent, or save yourself from damage, but you also have to think about the future - and which cards you'll want then and how your deck will evolve compared to their deck.The starter decks are playable, but I would strongly advise you to buy some packs (you can use silver which you can get from logging on daily and from winning matches) and get a custom deck going. You will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked taking your cheap/free decks into PvP, but you can win your silver rewards playing against the AI - which is beatable on all difficulties with the starter decks, although the higher difficulties will be a challenge. If you do use real money to purchase packs, you will have a higher chance of getting the best cards, ultimately people should remember that card games are about spending money and RNG, but overall this is very playable as a free player too.One of the big advantages of this game right now to me is that the Ipad app is extremely fluid and responsive. You can play untimed games with friends and the push notifications are accurate - meaning if you have a lazy day with 5 minutes to spare here and there, you can have a good duel with your friend from anywhere. (Untimed) games save despite the application being shut down; and you can start a game on the ipad and continue it on the PC, or have the game running in two locations at once if you so desire. A lot of digital card games right now have promised this sort of cross platform interactivity, but few have competently provided it yet. The android app is sadly not out yet so I can't comment on that - but they have said there'll be one in the future.I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend."

If you have a sensitive ego, you will be crushed - You WILL lose ALOT!  The campaign will take you through various playing styles, and how the factions fair.  If you get discouraged, maybe knowing that I lost over 20 - 30 times before finding a suitable deck to beat some of the mid - late levels.  Daily quests, draft, and packs are given quite generously.  You can easily rack up 10+ packs in a couple days.  Drafts are awesome since you keep the cards (to a point).  The battle mechanics are what makes this game - engaging, evolving, and dynamic."

,Recommended,232450,8057151,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,Zan (bearsman6),"SolForge is another entry into the recently-full group of Collectible Card Games, but it takes a fresh and unique approach to the otherwise-tired genre. Gone are the typical Magic:the Gathering clone features -- it removes the single card draw at the start of the turn, the 60 card deck slot, and even the concept of a graveyard. Instead, you get an incredibly deep, strategic system that demands you plan ahead, but flexibly (since RNG is still going to determine which cards you see).The most interesting part of the game is also its core: the cards you play level up each time you play them, to a maximum of level 3. Each time you level a card, it gets more powerful, sometimes exponentially so. But what makes this more strategic is that every 4 turns you reshuffle your played or discarded cards back into your deck. Since you draw 5 cards a turn, you're seeing 2/3 of your 30-card deck every 4 turns. It adds an insane level of consistency to your draws, if you plan accordingly.All in all, it's a game that's got a lot more depth than your typical CCG, and it is entirely Free-to-Play if you're willing to take a beating at first. (It takes about a month to really build the card pool based on the current daily rewards, but they're working to improve that too.) Definitely worth looking into!"
,Not Recommended,232450,7809803,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Winter Wolf,"I signed up for the Early Access for Sol Forge but ended up being unable to play it on my PC unfortunately because it runs into a DEP windows error which I have been unable to solve and the DEVs said they would look in to it but never got back to me. I can only assume it isn't common enough to be worth their time to figure out what it is. After trying a bunch of different things on my own I gave up in mid  August which is when they went gold with it.Full disclosure: I do have the game installed on my laptop too and that works fine but I rarely use my Laptop at home (where I have a guaranteed internet connection) and when I do go out with it I usually have other things I need doing instead. Sol Forge seems like a fairly basic game but I can't really say whether I like it or not since I've never played a person with it, only the bots which are predictably bad.My ""no"" is with the caveat that is you like simpler CCGs and don't want to really think too much during play then Sol Forge might fit your bill. But Caveat Emptor. There are no refunds (if you buy packs and then find it suddenly doesn't work for some reason) and no one will care if it doesn't work for you.My initial reason for getting Early Access had less to do with what I knew about the game (not a lot) and more to do with who was making it. Brian Kibler, Justin Gary and crew have been involved with CCGs for a very long time indeed and have some amazing credentials between them. I've never gotten a chance to play their other big game Ascension but as I understand it, it is quite elegant and powerfully fun. Sadly Sol Forge didn't strike me that way though it has its charms.The 5 factions are I assume just the beginning of the diversity as I am sure many sets will be produced eventually. I hope someday I have something more positive to say about the game."

76561197971968181,Recommended,232450,11953292,"Posted: 1 September, 2014",all,Keyboardwarrior,"A Review after a year in Solforge(from someone who's not a prior TCG player)Summary right at the bottom.After having played SOlforge for over a year now(having started during early access in August last year), I would to say a few things(good and bad) and hopefully new players can decide if the game is for them and whether they would want to spend more money and contribute to the development.For those who are not familiar with this genre of games, Digital card games(DCGs) or Trading Card games(TCGs) probably first gained prominence through Magic:The Gathering some 20 years ago. Most have a system where there are multiple colours/factions/races and there are some differing mechanics to how you can construct a deck.Ok, onto the game itself. The first thing will strke you about this game is the ease of learning it. I remember learning the mechanics in maybe 15minutes after playing the tutorials and a game or two - something not even remotely possible for more complex games like M:TG. This is actually good for players new to the genre, so as not to build fustration before getting into the game. Play on a bit more and you will also learn that learning is not mastering, and to beat other human players(and the hard AI as well), you will likely need to build a decent deck -- which brings me to the concept of deck building and building the collection of cards(because you obviously can't build a deck without cards).Deck building in Solforge is super simple, with less things to ponder about like lands and the other myriad of card types in other card games. In Solforge, there are only two card types -creatures and spells- and no consideration of off turn acitivity like counterspells and such. Your deck can comprise of up to 2 factions(there are 4), and must have a minimum of 30 cards. That's pretty much it, but as I said if you are new to the genre, you will probably need some time to build a good deck. Along the way, you will realise losing is part of the process of deck-building-- what works in theory may often not pan out in actual games.I will imagine new players having a little trouble getting some decks up in the first month or two while they build up their card collection. I started with 20 blue packs(some early puchase deal of sorts) as well as having the early access benefit of having access to all cards to experiment(just to play, not own them). However, the one BIG plus about the game is the speed of earning rewards. In solforge, there are 3 daily rewards(login, 1win and 3 win reward) and 1 for winning an online game. You may get boosters or individual cards, and will always earn silver, which may be used to buy any card which you already own. This system is especially useful if you dont wan't to blow like $10?(not sure how much exactly) on a single legendary which you may need more copies of to play around with.I recommend new players to play the easy/normal AI for a week or 2 to earn some rewards and build a deck before playing the hard AI or humans.Overall, having recently tested a couple of other games, I will say the rewards system in SF is pretty generous.The gameplay mechanic revolves around the ""ranking up"" system of cards where often cards that are weaker early on are more powerful at rank 2 or 3. There may be a few exceptions to this balance, but these are almost always legendary cards. Actual turns consist of 2 actions - either a spell, or a creature played down to one of the 5 lanes. Creatures in a lane fight against the opposing creature in the same lane every turn, so no tapping or assigning blockers needed. Despite the relative simplicity of the game I feel like it remains relevant and fun.I came from being in the chess club back in school and my only gripe is the RNG factor of drawing the big rank 3 cards during the first turn of rank 3, but coming to a card game you have to accept some random luck factor will be unavoidable. Overall, for players like me who may not want to spend hours everyday figuring out the next meta-defining deck, combining generous rewards and simple gameplay makes Solforge a good 30minutes-a-day to destress type of game. For more experienced card gamers looking for a complex challenge, I'm not the right person to give you an opinion - however, having dabbled with M:TG like 15+ years ago I'll say that M:TG definitely feels more intense to me.Lastly, I would make some suggestions which would make the game enjoyable. First, would be to slightly lower the prices of the cards. I'm not sure about the rest, but the only time I've spent money on this game is during sales. I have spent $100, which for a year isn't that much but not that little either, but overall I think the prices on decks/packs as well as tournament tickets to be a little too high. Regarding the gameplay and game types, the developers are currently working on a campaign, but if they are reading this, I would really like to see downloadable AI decks. These decks could be from online tournaments held,etc, but for players like me who mostly only play draft format online and are not competitive enough to play tournaments and all, having a chance to see these decks in action may be fun. Playing against the AI(using my own decks) can be tiresome after a while, and not everyone can afford to spend that much time waiting around for online opponents or human players taking their time etc.Overall - 7/10. For a free game, worthy of spending some time on it.Pros: Easy to learn, generous rewards, very low time commitmentCons:Expensive cards, limited game types or preconstructed decks to play against"

You still can't even tell what card the other player cast when they do spells, especially now there are more cards so it's alot harder to know. Seems the game still requires memorizing all cards. The new draft type I tried was also lacking (IE no way to view levels that was apparent)Close, but no. Keep working on your game solforge and you might just get some more recommends (not just from me...)Long and short is the interface actually works now, and now that it does I can see how crappy the interface really is..... It deserves going from a 4 to 5 just for the sheer miracle of improvement/bugs removed and the fact that they have some visible progress/effort.

You can build decks and play an AI that has reasonable skill. SolForge has a depth that can really only be directed by the player. You can play with a simple deck or delve into a hidden depth with the deck-builder. I like SolForge because its a fun TcG that doesn't need to overwhelm the player to be enjoyed but offers the option of engrossing the player in creating custom decks and strategies. I can speak from experience when I say that earning new cards without investing lots of money like a tabletop TcG is another great feature. I try not to compare SolForge with games like MtG because it's not and it doesn't try to be and I can enjoy it equally.I didn't like the Tier four cards they added, they are very unbalanced and ruined what was a decent casual TCG."

From what I can gather, it's like Magic: The Gathering you can play without sitting in a hot room filled with sweaty people.Edit: It was a good start at first, but then it started to get overwhelming.The concept was good, the balance was acceptable, and it was just fun to spend a few hours to play it. Simple and effective.But you look away for one day and suddenly: Boom! Another expansion or more cards show up and you just can't catch up with the power creep and you just give up.That's what it feels like to me, anyway."
