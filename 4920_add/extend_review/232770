But I've been taking a higher dosage of Risperidone, so the voices don't tell me many things anymore.At first, the controls on this game made me want to stab someone in the eye repeatedly and tell them to stop staring at me, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly easy to play. The variety of weapons doesn't really matter to me, many of them are too impractical to use. If you played Postal 2 first, don't expect to take a leak on people or beat them with a shovel.When it comes to the setting and the atmosphere, this game makes Postal 2 look like Secret of the Magic Crystals. The soundtrack is very unsettling, and it doesn't help that it keeps playing in my head after I close the game. I even tried restarting the computer, but it just won't stop. Somebody help me."

,Recommended,232770,11010312,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,JakkelR4psc4llion,"Having played this games series to completion (well, almost: what, you mean to tell me that you actually got all the way through  Postal 3?!), I feel that reviewing them all is necessary. This game, however, is going to be difficult to review. It's not that it's a badly made game or that I hate it (on the contrary). The problem is that it's such a disturbing game that I may end up on a watchlist for recommending it. Whatever! Here it goes.The first installment of the Postal series is of humble origins, provided that your definition of ""humble origins"" involves being banned in 14 countries, being blacklisted by most major retailers and being mentioned by Senator Joe Lieberman to the Senate as one of the ""three worst things in American society"" (the other two being Marilyn Manson and Calvin Klein underwear ads). Postal is a game about a guy (the Postal Dude) being bombarded with demonic mental images and voices convincing him to murder society as a whole. Each level is a neighborhood, truckstop, air force base, shopping mart, etc. of innocent people and hostile people (""hostile"" being cops, government agents, well-armed vigilantes and other people who are merely trying to stop a madman with weapons from murdering everybody). You are instructed to kill at least 80-90% of the hostile people before progressing to the next level. Unlike the succeeding two games, the only morality choice you're really given is whether you want to kill only the people trying to kill you or kill everybody.The gameplay is a third person isometric, much like the first couple Army Men games that 3DO had, only with much more gore, suffering and people pleading for their lives. The weapons in this game are strictly military grade, unlike the succeeding two, and you don't have animals to help you, like the feral cats or your dog, Champ (although his doghouse is in the first level).Now, let's talk about the content. At the beginning of each level, you are treated with disturbing artwork of screaming people, corpses and evil humanoid entities with the soundtrack of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" kinds of experimental percussion raging in the background. At the bottom of each of these loading screens is a diary entry of the Postal Dude, which usually reads like ""The city is a refuse pile, and I come to exterminate the bugs. Clean the wound with more blood!"" Afterwards, you start the level, where you murder people. While you can definitely perform much more sadistic and demented acts of cruelty in the sequels, they give it to you in a very zany, silly and whimsical manner. Whereas, with the first game, you're told to shoot and kill everything in a very serious manner. While the Postal Dude does give an occasional quip, there's very little hilarity in the game. Also like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the game is a very demented piece of work, that although goes far out of its way to make you uncomfortable, is strangely appealing.Anyway, the game is entertaining and worth a playthrough in my opinion, but be very careful as to who you play the game in front of."

And while the pixelated characters certainly look aged the game's hand drawn levels still look good. In the roughly 2 dozen levels (in various locales such as farm, factory, shopping center, industrial complex, airport etc.) we control the so-called Postal Dude (do note that this Dude appeared before Lebowsky - they are not the same) who causes mayhem and destruction. We can kill everyone - all bystanders and even ostriches (?), but taking innocent lives is not mandatory in order to complete a level.

Without this I would have definitely given it a thumbs-down. I do not know how its ""remake"", the so-called ""Hatred"" fares but I do know this game's content is not that extremely violent by default.

It's a game where you can actually immerse yourself in playing a psychotic shooter.And that's a goddamned in-human feat in todays market.To make a long story short, Postal is a isometric shooter. The goal of each level is to kill a certain % of ""hostile"" npcs to continue to the next level (Press F1 you ♥♥♥♥ing new kids).That's the only goal. Kill. Did I mention you can also kill civilians? Because you can do that too. The eerie journal entries at the start of each level, the atmosphere, the ambience.It's all ♥♥♥♥ing psychotic.And it's one hell of a blast to play.In a non-serious point of view, this is RWS's first game, and as RWS is based on the ideology that games should be fun and challenging, that's what this game is. It's fun, over the top violence simply for the sake of it.

,Recommended,232770,25113570,"Posted: 24 August, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Review for Postal Redux:Here.They didn't know it then, but back in 1997 the developer Running with Scissors created a game that would become not only a landmark PC title, but one of the most controversial video games of all time. Little did they know the act of violence known as the Columbine Massacre committed two years later would be endlessly tied to both the POSTAL and Doom game series'.The antagonist of the game is a schizophrenic man, known iconically as The Postal Dude, who has been evicted from his home. Being a conspiracy theorist, he believes that the United States Air Force has been releasing a mind-altering substance within the town of Paradise that has affected everyone but himself. Of course, the only way to solve this problem is to slaughter all of the humanoids and cleanse the earth of their infected presence. This more elaborate plot is not conveyed well within the game itself, despite the short dialogue in the loading screens that appear each time prior to progressing to the next level, rather it relied on the box art and manuals from back in the day to fully understand.I won't spoil the ending for you, though I will say that it's not just the amount of killing that garnered this game such controversial fame; rather the very morbid subject matter, and dark humor-filled quips from the antagonist himself as he shows no mercy or remorse for his actions. This is a game that, while the plot is kept deliberately vague, taking the story and mental state of the main character into consideration makes it all the more disturbing and gruesome.There are a total of 21 levels in POSTAL, most of which can be completed in just a few minutes each; the longevity of this title is not its strong point, clocking in at 1-2 hours for a full playthrough at best. Beginning at his home, The Postal Dude works his way through a truck stop, parade, trailer park, all the way to the military air base. This version does include the extra content from the Special Delivery expansion pack, which includes four new levels and the Gauntlet Challenge; the latter being a survival mode. Beware, however, as all of the co-op modes that were featured in the original release of this title are not available in this version; this is a single-player experience only.The visuals within the game haven't aged incredibly well, but they're nothing to scoff at either. The backgrounds in particular are noteworthy, as they're completely hand-painted. The buildings and environments are wonderfully dark and morose, making way for an incredibly evil experience as The Postal Dude spills gallons of blood onto the ground. The character models are really what have aged terribly, as they're mini-verisons of models that would be found in games such as the original Resident Evil title for Playstation 1, and there aren't many different ones either. As far as a soundtrack goes, there's not one to speak of other than a looping set of guitar chords during the credits, although there are some subtle ambiances to be enjoyed; POSTAL is a game that plays better if you throw on your own ""Mix to Kill By"".What will probably feel the most aged for modern gamers are the controls, this title no longer functions like any top-down isometric shooter of the current era. While you can set the game up to utilize your mouse, the mouse control becomes inverted at random intervals and becomes more frustrating than anything. It's best to stick to using the keyboard, where WSAD is used to move and the arrow keys are used to shoot. There's a decent guide in the forums for what's the best control set-up, so fear not if you need help.With all of that being said, the original POSTAL still stands as a landmark game almost a decade later. For any fans of over-the-top, pointless violence, this is the game for you. The Postal Dude, despite not having a name and only having a small set of sarcastic, witty quotes, has become one of the most iconic characters in cult-classic fandom. Except for a few achievements, the game doesn't have much replayability or longevity, which is its only true downfall. However, at the price of $2.19 CAD, that's not extremely devastating. Still a classic, still dark, still blood-soaked, still fun, still worth buying. Long live The Postal Dude!Rating:5.0/5.0- An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Recommended,232770,26192789,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,cyan0s1s,"Postal is an isometric shooter with a horror-esque narrative developed by the infamous Running With Scissors and originally published by Ripcord Games in 1997. RWS were founded a year prior to Postal's release as a new company that would devote themselves to creating extreme and mature entertainment products, with some founding members having been previously employed at Riedel Software Productions, which focused on developing children's games. The Postal series has been panned by critics yet adored by fans for many years, with its dark satirical humor and graphic violence (contrary to the title, this is a series about seemingly unmotivated mass murder, not mail sorting). Postal was compared to Pulp Fiction by the late Bill Kunkel, veteran game journalist and game designer, as being just as much of a shock to video games as the Tarantino film was to the world of cinema. RWS definitely expected to attract some attention once the game's website went up but Vince Desi, CEO of 'the world's most dangerous software company' said the reaction to Postal and RWS had been overwhelming, sometimes funny, and even a little scary. The website(gopostal.com)had drawn over 100k hits in less than a month, and while the numbers would be impressive for any new software-based site it's virtually unheard of for a game that was still in negotiations and not even available yet as a downloadable demo. Vince confessed losing his voice one week as he was on the phone constantly, talking to TV stations, magazines (both print and online) and all these incredibly interested users. 'Everybody wanted a Postal/RWS t-shirt' Vince reported, 'You don't see this much interest in games that are already on the shelves' he observed. 'Obviously, something about this product just hits a button with the public.' As for the response by the U.S. Postal Service and various media outlets, well, there's more to this fascinating history than I can fit in this review so if you're interested take a spin on the wayback machine.The backstory according togopostal.comgoes like this: Postal casts the user as a nameless surrogate character that is brought to the breaking point when his newly purchased home in the small desert community of Bisbee, Arizona is repossessed due to a trivial error in the escrow filing. However, when he comes to believe that the repossession is merely the tip of a demonic conspiracy intended to dominate humanity, he loses his sodding mind. The manual nor do the in-game intermissions between levels that consist of diaries and war journal entries by the Postal Dude (as he's been coined) himself ever state his personal background or what truly motivated him to go over the edge in the first place. But if the website is anything to go by, it definitely shows how satirical and over the top the game was always intended to be, despite the dark subject matter. Like Carmageddon, which might I add also came out that same year, in addition to the first entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. What a time to be alive as an adult gamer! What is speculated about the Postal Dude is that he's a tin foil-hatted paranoid delusional that thinks there's something in the air or water that's caused the population of this once peaceful fictional town of Paradise to turn into crazed killers.The goal of the game is simple enough: kill or be killed. There's a percentage of hostiles killed on each level that must be reached in order to move onto the next scene. Hostiles consist largely of authority figures: sheriff, police, SWAT and eventually the military. Volunteers have also participated in the madness in the form of rocketeers, muscle-bound baldies and miners that throw explosives at you. And a bunch of weird turrets. Needless to say the cast is pretty 90's and rather cheesy at times, but that was probably the intention. It can cause a strange contrast between the unnervingly realistic portrayal of a mass shooting and the absurd things that happen throughout, like torching a marching band or ostrich farm. There's a number of defenseless civilians that populate most areas but these are never required to be killed in order to complete the level, only counting towards the population. There's a fair supply of health, Kevlar, weapon and ammo pickups littered throughout that will keep you going and even some minor secret areas. There's also an element of strategy to the gameplay, as enemies are often setup in defensive positions waiting for you to make a move and the whole guns blazing approach will not always suffice here. Plan your attack and divide and conquer or consider hitting the suicide key because it won't be much different if you just rush things.Postal's world is unique looking, instead of 3D geometry with a limited set of textures the levels are all 2D backgrounds of highly detailed, painted scenes from an isometric camera angle (and sometimes a top-down perspective), which ensures every level doesn't look the same as the last. Low poly (very) 3D characters, weapons and objects are scattered about these scenes, complete with real-time lighting effects. An X-ray effect allows you to see through buildings you're behind, and there's a number of small details for things like spurting blood, bullet casings, and translucent fire and smoke effects and of course pools of blood that pile up quickly. Bodies also don't disappear, and people won't always succumb to their injuries, often dragging themselves across the ground leaving a trail of their life fluids while they moan and cry out in pain, quickly leading to some very macabre scenes of genocide. It's all very crude looking by today and it wasn't tipping any heads even back then either (well besides the violence), but for what they worked with as a small team they did a convincing enough job and managed to create an atmosphere, that to this day I still find very appealing. Incredibly disturbing and very raw in tone.Weapons first consist of an unidentified assault rifle with unlimited ammo, a sawed off shotgun and some grenades and branch out to rocket launchers with heat-seeking missiles, a napalm launcher, flamethrower and the most deadly ballistics weapon in the game: the Spray Cannon, a fully automatic shotgun that turns even the most well armored foes to red swiss cheese. Throwables and more tactical options include Molotovs and three types of mine. You can also execute downed victims that are suffering and put them out of their misery with your machine gun or share the pain with others if you're on fire.Visuals as stated earlier aren't pretty, but for what they are they capture a bleak look that I feel was kind of lost in the transition to more defined HD artwork in the Postal Redux released earlier this year. Loading screens have an acidic looking piece of abstract art that look like they'd burn your hand if you reached out and touched it, with eerily written dialogue by the Dude himself. Audio is a bit of a mixed bag admittedly, with some silly and often annoying voice-overs that play far too often, but everything else sounds pretty good, especially the screams. The voice for the Dude's 'demon' by Rick Hunter is well done and appropriately psychotic, but I wouldn't go about quoting his mean-spirited lines in public. The music, while limited and only playing on loading screens is very creepy and surreal, well composed and adds to the dark nature of the game excellently.The downsides include the short length, antiquated controls, low quality visuals and some bizarre hit box detection at times. Grenades are hard to use properly and rocketeers can sometimes loop you in a neverending cycle of air time until you're out of their effective range, of which by then may be too late.Postal's a flawed, underrated and sometimes truly scary game of the mid-to-late 90's before the world as we knew it changed post-Columbine. I recommend it to any open-minded action gamers. Just remember though, it's only a video game.3.5/5"

To fix this, press Ctrl, Alt and Del, to bring up task manager, then close task manger and then click on the postal application at the bottom to go back into the game. The menu should then appear.What I liked about the gameI really liked the art style of the game.The gameplay is addictive. In fact I would say it's more addictive than Postal 2, probably because of the games style.A good selection of weapons to choose from; from your M16 to your Flamethrower.Steam achievements; which gives the game some replayability.What I disliked or was disappointed withThe player and the NPC's look really naff. This is a shame because I really liked the art style of the environment.The game is short. Took me only 3 hours to complete.It takes a couple of missions just to get the hang of the controls.ConclusionA fun and addictive game. Don't expect this game to be like Postal 2; it's more arcadey. Postal Dude is an all out psychopath in this one. The game also doesn't have that sense of humour like postal 2 did. It's just; kill a certain number of enemies and then progress to the next level. I really enjoyed it; wish it was longer.78/100"

One thing that irks me are the controls, it really feels awkard to play on all-fronts control speaking.

,Recommended,232770,28337760,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,Baphomet,"Postal is the ridiculous kind of game released in an era where activist groups thought Doom was a murder training device and mocks said activism with its wanton violence and campy humor. Each level is simply a free-for-all where you try to kill a percentage of hostiles and incidentally a few hundred innocent bystanders as well.Gameplay-wise, Postal holds itself together very well. The controls on gamepad are quite fluid and the twin-stick style aiming system works good enough for a game made in 1997. The difficulty out of the box will probably be a bit too easy for most players and IMO the only way to really experience this game is on its maximum difficulty, where you will have to carefully plan your movement across each level to avoid a quick and surprising death. Since the viewable area is locked to an isometric perspective, and weapon ranges exceed the area from the player’s location, you will need to be very careful when moving up or down and zig-zagging across each level is an absolute must whenever possible. Enemies tend to be a bit spongey to bullets but go down in a single hit from incendiary or explosive weapons (and can kill you just as fast).Postal’s graphical and audio shortcomings are typical for a game made in its time and haven’t aged particularly well but that’s to be expected. The levels also get repetitive after the 6th or 7th map and clearing them becomes more memorization than reflexes and skill. Yet for a retro game that you can easily get for less than a dollar these days, Postal still manages to squeeze out enough fun to make it worth picking up."

Earth quake""The earth was hungry,so it ate some people"".[PROS AND CONS]Here are the PROS and CONS of POSTAL,Lets start with pros-PROS-1.The game is pretty fun,For a game that came from 1997 its really fun2.The art in this game is great and it still holds up3.The dark humor is pretty good the dude would say something like ""You must be cold let me warm you up""and the he burns the person with a flame thower4.The games price is 1.995.If you want a game that makes you uncomfortable at night then this is for you.-CONS-1.The game is unfair at times.2.The AI is not the greatest.3.The game is short4.Once you beat it there is no reason to come back to it,Unless you want to play on the hardest setting.[POSTAL vs POSTAL REDUX]POSTAL has1.Really fast load times2.Cheaper price (Redux is 10 dollers)3.Also its the origial game.4.It has a rampage mode5.It also has updated controlsPOSTAL  REDUX has1.updated graphics2.fixes the problems of the first game3.rampage mode4.new weapon,The revolver5.miltiplayer modeBoth of them have there pros and cons Redux has a  long load time and POSTAL is pretty cheap at timesIF I had to choose between POSTAL REDUX or POSTAL I would choose REDUX,I love the Original game as much as the next POSTAL fan but POSTAL REDUX is great.I know REDUX doesn't  fix all the problems with the original but its really good.[CONCLUSION]POSTAL is a great game and I enjoy all the other games in the series,Its a shame it was over looked by other games at the time like Quake but many people like me considered this game a gem back then.But what was your message?Was your message saying that,Voilence and the media can cause one to go POSTAL.Or you just wanted to make an edgy game and cause controversy.So in conclusion POSTAL is a dark and disturbing game that got people like Bill Lumbergh fired up and saying violent video games make people evil.Also......SCREW LUMBERGH!That is the end of my review leave a comment and tell me what you think and RWS if you reading this,I just wanted to say thanks for making amazing games and listening  to your fans.I will probably review POSTAL 2 and the two expansions apocalypse weekend andparadise lost soon.Also can we be friends on steam?REVEIW BY-HenryCats4LIfe.  ;3"

Definitely worth $5, but if it's on sale, even better. If you liked those games, or perhaps the old Death Rally game, you'll probably like this too. Also similar to Hotline Miami (although that game is certainly better).The controls do not take long to get used to; my advice would be to just stick to the keyboard.There's no music in the game (just ambient sounds) which gives it a bit more of an ominous feel to it (hits close to reality); much like its sequel. Still, this just means you can make your own soundtrack to the game, if you so desire.Basically, this is a ""stress killer"" kind of game. If you need to take a break from work or what have you, play this for about 15 minutes to an hour. Obviously, this is a matter of taste, but if you're a ""sick ♥♥♥♥"" like me (I suppose), it can be a lot of fun! If you try to marathon it, the game may start to wear thin.

,Recommended,232770,13944293,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Vic=HKC=,"I know, I know, I should have rewritten the review in October 2015. But hey, I only decided to retry Postal now that the devs changed the controls, so that it's easier for people to play it. And indeed, it's better.And as to be clear, I'm not doing it because my negative review seemed to be not helpful (6 people on 9 downvoted it) at all when it was clearly constructive. I'm doing it because the change the devs made allowed finally to appreciate Postal like I should have if it wasn't for the controls.Another thing: I don't mind old games. I didn't write first a negative review because of that. Like I've said in my old review, having played on PC, NES and Game Boy in more or less 1989-1990, at age of 6-7, I've seen a good part of the video game history. And I don't mind games like Postal. I could play them (or an old GTA) without problems. I don't mind Postal at all. Now that I've played enough, I can finally say more.You have to understand that when you can't play a game because of a control layout, you can't fully explain it. Postal, it's a game where you kill everyone, hostile or not hostile. Well, you can choose to spare innocent lives. Anyway, the hostiles are mainly cops. The view is an isometric one, that's probably why the original layout for the controls didn't match my own pattern in these games.True, pressing ""right"" for me is equal to going right and not anything else. Back then, it wasn't doing what I wanted. The mouse wasn't easy to use. Now, there are several layouts. I don't remember if there were so many options, but now, when I press ""right"", I go to the right! I don't even use the mouse anymore. I've still yet to adapt some stuff, as I fire in the same time when pressing the arrows, but it's a matter of keys. Two actions are binded with the same key, I've just to change it, because I'm currently killing everyone and if I want to spare innocents, I need to stop firing.The result was immediate. Now that I could move more freely, I've reached the fourth level, I've unlocked more achievements and I'm finally appreciating Postal. I'm finally appreciating the run in the levels, ducking under the rockets, when I remember that I can duck, executing people still alive, though it's just not my style to do it, I prefer to run and to spread bullets everywhere.True, I die a lot because I've no strategy apart running wildly around. And I don't even use the other weapons, don't ask me why I'm willing to use the infinite ammo one, though I suppose it will be hard to keep that strategy in the next levels. But hey, I'm willing to try.The only downside of this is that I still need to find the best layout for me and that I read about an achievement with Mac and Linux and that I'm sad to see that the 100% completion can't be done for many of us. Well, yeah, I'm too lazy to install a virtual machine. Anyway, apart that, because the devs made the effort for the controls and that this was a saving update for the game for the players, I can't keep the negative review. That's how a game can go from a negative to a positive review: by listening your players and by improving the game to make sure that the majority can get fun.Sorry for the lateness though. This update is around since October 2015. I wouldn't have tried the game again and rewritten this review if this update wasn't in my head somewhere. Good job!"

In my opinion this is one of my favorites in the series, infact it's one of my favorite top down shooter.The story isn't that incredible and is just there because there needs to be one, basically life in paradise is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you are being evacted from your own house, you (The Postal Dude) believe a disease is going around, and you are the cure. You go on rampage with your shades and memorable one-liners to ♥♥♥♥ up Paradise. That is basically the plot, although there's a diary entry in the manual, showing the character's thoughts and feelings through his madness.The aim of the game is simple kill all the hostiles, and kill all bystandards (if desired and if you want to get 100%). You are told to kill a certain amount of people, however it's best to kill everyone for the 100%, after you kill everyone you press F1 to proceed, this is what confused a lot of people who didn't read the instructions, but funnily enough you get a achievment!The game can become difficult as you progress, so it's good to take you time, however not only does the difficulty increase, so does your roster which become very useful in certain situations. You have a stock standard weapon roster, but you'll be using the SMG the most since it has unlimited ammo. Although some weapons are utterly useless like the mines, grenades are made frustrating however by the co-ordination of each grenade throw.As I said this game can be very difficult at times, which is why the gameplay becomes very strategical making you want to plan your moves, the game isn't as frustrating as for example: Hotline Miami, the game is the sort of difficulty you would expect from Quake, a game that influences POSTAL quite a bit and was definetly the type of game RWS were aiming for.If you were a fan of the sequels, then you may be disappointed with the game, and I wouldn't see any reason to play the first, if you're expecting the game to be like the second, which is a overall better game in every way. But if you're curious, or want a fun top-down shooter get Postal."
76561198028769894,Recommended,232770,20615521,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,Shuvack,"It's an old and also a painfully amateurish game. For a top down shooter it plays wonky, looks downright ugly and has way too many repeated sound clips. The RWS's first game is definitely not a masterpiece; even for its time it was just bad in terms of gameplay and visuals. Its price however seemed ok for me- based on how much fun I was able to squeeze out of this game regardless.It offers something under 2 hours campaign, with some really cool ideas for building up the creepy atmosphere with cutscenes, menus and notes; it's a shame that that atmosphere is quickly shattered with so many identical npcs, with identical shouts (they're more tiresome than in bethesda games, and this thing is only 2h long), and identically stupid AI.The weapons offer some variety, but not all of them are viable during shootouts; the first weapon is often the most useful one- thanks to the unlimited ammo, high fire rate and no need for staying still.And the whole combat seems to revolve around the idea of damage trading, as a lot of bullet type weapons are not reliably avoidable; and whilst staying still the game becomes way too slow for its genre- especially when running and gunning is already nowhere near as fast and frantic as Hotline Miami.It's a good thing that this pretty weak game gave a possibility for something like P2 and P2PL to happen. And despite its flaws it costs barely anything (during sales especially), so it could just be worth your money.As a side note: RWS had announced that they are making a complete remake of this game, hopefully to make it better than  the original, and also better than a rather bland and more recent Hatred.God speed RWS, make this one right."

At the time of this writing, I just got to The Mines, and the game plays better than it ever did before.This is *not* a slapdash Steam retro release cash-grab. RWS did an excellent job, not only porting it to run without a hitch on modern operating systems with 16:9 aspect ratio, but adding controller support, cloud saves, and hilariously taboo achievements. You can tell RWS loves this game as much as the fans do.I always felt like the series got too silly as it went on. Postal 1's atmosphere is gruesome and cruel. Postal Guy isn't a slapstick comedian peeing in people's mouths and shoving guns up the bums of cats - he is a terrifying serial killer, who sardonically mocks his victims as they beg for mercy. That is how I'll always remember him.If the world ever makes you feel the urge to go on a murder spree, Postal is nothing short of therapeudic. It's also a lot cheaper than anger management classe.Do yourself a favor, skip Hatred, and play the OG repugnant, abhorrent, disgusting masterpiece of video game violence for only a fraction of the price.Many gamers might want to get Postal Redux in lieu of this, which is understandable given the added features.

Can't belive my parents let me play this when I was 10!? The strongest memory I have of this game is the outhouse where someone was farting each time you knocked on the door -not the violence. :^) Great humour and THE KILLING PART IS NOT SO BAD EITHER.10/10

I have the radio running the whole time whenever i'm alone so I don't feel like somethings behind me.Anyway, postal is an old 1997 game based on ""the postal dude"" who is evicted from his home and going on a rampage of murdering people is sadistic fire and countless waves of lead. Oh, that woman didn't die from your clip of gunfire? execute her.Features several weapons, from shotguns and machine guns to rocket launchers and incendiary grenade launchers to molotovs and flamethrowers.17 levels in which to murder dozens of cops, rednecks, vigilantes and unarmed civilians, each different and unique in several ways, from camera angel changes to how many explosive barrels and pick up are on the map.Game is simple to learn and easy to pick up, and offers easy restarts when dying. Played using AWSD for movement and arrow keys for firing directions.Oh, and if you aren't doing too well go ahead and kill yourself whenever with Q.So, 17 levels, crazy weapons and the rage to murder people, thats what your getting into.Its cheapish and well worth it when its on sale.Personal Rating: 2.5/5"

However, once you play around a bit with the control setup (I HIGHLY recommend clicking the ""use old defaults"" option and enabling the mouse btw) and acclimatize to the feel of the game, it's actually pretty fun.It feels A LOT more demented and twisted than its more popular successor, Postal 2, but it still has a sly undercurrent of dark humor lying under the surface. In fact, I'd say comparing Postal 1 to Postal 2 is kind of like comparing Carmageddon 1 and 2; the sequels both have overall better gameplay and controls, but the originals deliver a lot more in terms of atmosphere and gleeful sickness. Games like Postal 1 and Carmageddon 1 just have this amazing grittiness to them that hasn't really been seen in games since the late 1990s.Anyway, do I recommend Postal? Yes, but only if you can stomach the disturbing content, and you have the patience to withstand archaic controls and graphics as well as semi-frequent bugs. If you don't like old games with weird controls, or are disturbed by anything more violent than Grand Theft Auto, then I wouldn't recommend it."

The controls are challenging at first, but after level 1, you oughta get over it. The graphics are solid for a 3/4 top down shooter like POSTAL and even though most people find the screams of terror obnoxious, the most satisfying part of the game really is to gun everyone down until all the screams have been silenced. A game like this that doesn't need big flashing '+100' signs that pop up as often as a zit on an unwashed face. After each kill the reward is the added silence, imo.

But for the kind of game that Postal is, it doesn’t really need one. It’s just mindless fun. And you know what, that’s okay. The game is played in a top down, isometric point of view (kind of like Sonic 3D Blast or Command & Conquer). This is actually pretty cool. The camera is neither too far away or too close. You have a good sense of where you are and where enemies are. So it’s not hard to plan things out. It’s best if you play the game tactically. There is however a drawback to the whole bird’s eye, isometric view. It’s a bit hard to line up your shots with an NPC. And it can get frustrating (especially when the NPCs move which they will do by the way). But it’s forgivable seeing as that it doesn’t take much to kill an NPC. You have a selection of about eight weapons. Your default weapon which is a weak assault rifle, a stronger assault rifle, a shotgun, a grenade, a missile launcher, a molotov cocktail, a flamethrower, and an RPG. You even get a few specialty weapons such as land mines.You play as a character called The Dude. No, not Dude from The Big Lebowski but The Postal Dude. The only way I can describe The Postal Dude is that he’s a smoother, less muscular version of Duke Nukem. He also shouts catchphrases like Duke. Catchphrases Like “Buttsauce” and “don’t be a sissy”. Though, he can also be described as a more tragic version of Duke Nukem as well. If you are following the games (almost non-existent) plot, it turns out that The Dude has gone insane and is under the impression that everyone in the city has a madness disease. So he takes it upon himself to exterminate everything that moves. I won’t give away the ending. But I will say that it is pretty satisfying.So in conclusion, all I can say is that Postal is mindless fun. It’s really just a pick up and play game. It’s also a good way to relief stress after a grilling day at work or school.  This game gets the official Redneck grade of G for good."

,Recommended,232770,24551063,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,TheMysteryPigMan,"The original POSTAL is a classic. Despite being the most controversial game of the 90's, it still managed to be a very entertaining take on a shooter game. Instead of being first-person, it chose a different route of being isometric. POSTAL opened up a new thing that had never been done, which included relentless killing of innocent people, and those that are hostile to you. This game takes you in the shoes of The Postal Dude, or ""Demon"", as he goes on a self-deployed mission to destroy the plague brought onto the citizens of his city. This includes ransacking the whole city, killing everyone in his way. Violence never felt so good until you've played POSTAL. But, if you'd like a more grusome take, you should also play Hatred. Furthermore, released in 2016 is the re-make of POSTAL, entitled: POSTAL Redux, an updated version of the game. I would reccommend both, although POSTAL is completely uncut, and is basically the same game as it was in 1997. Unlike the Re-make, this game is not toned down at all. If you want more violence and more grusome energy, play POSTAL. If graphics make or break a game for you, then go and play Redux. Either way, POSTAL is a classic that will never get old, and it's a great game despite its content."

Really!?How am I suppose to start a rampage when I can't blow up anything around me?Postal dude has a really bland personality for a psychopath.RWS should look for Caleb in Monolith's Blood (which has also been released in 1997).Play HOTLINE MIAMI instead !!!P.S.RWS's logic : if a game is sold for 1$ then it should deserve a great review.If I should base all my game review on the price then all free-to-play and gifted games should be reviewed as a masterpiece... RWS's logic...Rating:4.0

Most importantly, it actually feels fun to ""outsmart"" the dumb AI by shooting enemies that are stuck in the scenery or cannot see you and to trick them into blowing up and burning each other. It's a bit weird thing to say, but, as it turns out, the game's biggest appeal lies in its shortcomings.Despite the fun factor, I would not recommend the game to myself, had I not played it a long time ago. The reason for this is that I'm not feeling comfortable with such level of violence anymore. I'm OK with some cartoony murder of faceless low-poly clones, but when the police ladies you have to kill start screaming in agony for half a minute and the game has a dedicated button for putting dying people out of their misery, that's a bit over the line for me.On top of this, the game crashes quite frequently, which may be very frustrating when it happens after nearly completing a level. I don't recall this being a problem with the original game, so there must be something wrong with the revamped Steam version.If the excessive violence, low resolution and general instability do not turn you off, however, you may have some good fun with the game, especially on the hardest difficulty (which is really not that hard, once you get used to the controls and the pacing)."

You have to kill a certain amount of people without getting killed, and if you end up getting killed you have to start from the beginning which is a real pain.

Your main goal of the game is to kill a certain percentage of hostiles in order to progress to the next level. (You press F1 to go to the next level once you have enough kills.) Though, you can also kill innocent civilians, which you are neither helped nor hindered by killing them. The controls are pretty simplistic and I don't why everyone complains about them, WASD to move, to shoot, press the arrow keys in the direction of your target, number keys to cylcle through your weapons, and Q to commit suicide. One thing that I really liked about this game and RWS, is that this 18 year old game features: ACHIEVMENTS AND TRADING CARDS which I found to be quite funny in such a dark and grim game. Another thing about this game (And the main reason why it disturbs me) is the music and ambiet sounds, Jesus are they creepy. There's also sometimes chanting in the background which adds to the scary factor. My final rating for this game is a 9.5/10.      (Word of advice, beware of guys with explosives.

,Recommended,232770,13705417,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,Raskolnikov,"In early European gothics--Ann Radcliffe, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Mathew Lewis--monsters and ghouls were a way to vent or exploit social, economic, political and cultural phobias. This was mostly due to the fact that in early Europe, science and medical knowledge was not so present as they are today.When the United States was founded, it was at a time of Enlightment. Science and medical advancements and discoveries gave psychological and biological explainations to those ficticious vampires and ghosts, casting them away into the shadows. This paved way to something unique to American phobias, and ultimately what came to define American horror--human monsters. The American boogeyman is not a vampire, a stitched together corpse, or any other monster of the sort. It's Michael Myers, Leatherface, the hillbillies from Deliverence. Most of all, it's the crazy guy with the gun, and that's what makes Postal unique and brilliant. It takes that concept, and also takes another part of American culture--the second amendment--and perverses it into our wildest nightmares.Postal 1 is a brilliant horror game, and I'd rank it up there with the likes of Silent Hill or Amnesia. It's discomforting, disturbing, exploitive and most importantly, real. I'd highly recommend it, but only if you can handle it."

,Recommended,232770,12988869,"Posted: 17 November, 2014",all,Thristy Dog,"Well, I certainly love the second Postal game, and the third one might as well be a guilty pleasure. The first one? Well...The first Postal, released in '97, has not aged well, in it's original release. Which is sad, because it's almost good.First off, the actual content in the game is not the reason I think this game is bad. Even if the content was off putting (It's not for me, because you can beat the game without killing a single non-hostile cpu), the Postal games really have a blurry continuity, so weither anything in the games outside of P2 is canon is up for debate. Enough stalling, let's get to my review.Graphically, this game is interesting. The contrast between hand-drawn enviorments and 3D models is certainly a unique style, I like it. It's a little primitive with the 3D models, but I've seen worse.Sound design was not too kind to Postal. The effects need to be manually balanced out, some stuff is too loud, but YMMV. The droning music tracks (mainly in menus) actually work well for the games concept though.The real problem, which is a huge one, is the controls. Yeah, you can adjust them through various means, but the fact is, I shouldn't have to. Aiming is a complete chore, and so is running through tight passages. They take time to get used to, but even then, the control is pretty terrible. It's killed all enjoyment the game has for alot of people.Lastly, I wanna briefly mention the actual concept of the game. On one hand, it's a needlessly violent (implied really, the action on screen is pretty tame by today's standards) isometric shooter. On the other hand, it's an interesting isometric shooter with arcade-y gameplay. Either way, it was RWS's first game, and it shows. It doesn't hold up very well today. I'm glad it exists though, because it paved the way for a PC masterpiece, and a TPS that's fun despite its many bugs.Overall, I wouldn't recommend Postal 1, but it might be worth checking out on sale for those who are curious enough. Seriously though, the controls are♥♥♥♥♥What I do recommend, however, is the upcoming remake Postal: Redux. It fixes the controls and updates the graphics, but otherwise is the same game. I'll review it when it's released.Now, that's my review of it's orignal release. However, the Steam version has benefited greatly from RWS patching the game up. The controls have been alterned, no longer confining to tank-controls. Instead, it controls as a top down shooter should control. Another change related to controls is proper support for controllers. I plugged my Xbox controller in and everything was already pre-configured, and comfortable to boot. Strangely, fire wasn't assigned to any button, but it was a quick fix. With these control fixes, (plus a crosshair for easier aiming) the game plays alot better and now, I'd consider it an underrated classic alongside it's amazing sequal."

,Recommended,232770,21536019,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,FreeCore_DATA,"IntroductionBack in the 90's, some elements in gameplay, art and level design were a huge impact in the video game industry. On a  early stage, some video games were backlashed due to incidents related to specific titles based on violence. POSTAL is a video game whose purpose is to understand the madness of a person, and it does great.SypnosisIn POSTAL you play as a man who thinks the world is infected by a outbreak of violence which is not identified, therefore he goes into a massive rampage looking for exterminate anyone infected.Gameplay AnalysisConsist in a top-down camera feature that let you see any NPC visible on your perspective. The pattern system is pretty simple,you must defeat them in order to progress the game. There are some items which can help you to improve your rampage:ItemDescriptionMedkitIt's available in specific parts of each map and some NPCs can drop it. The amount of points for each of them is 10 (The maximum of Health points is 200).Bulletproof vestThis item isn't droped by any NPC in the game, it's only available in some parts of each map. The amount of points provided is 5 (The maximum of protection points is 10)Ammo boxThis item has an interesting behaviour, if you're full of ammo, the items that you can't collect just blow away from you like confettiWeaponsAccording to your progress, they'll be unlocking and can be use in the next mapsIn addition, POSTAL provides 17 maps (plus 4 additional maps as an expansion) regarding single player including a game mode calledThe Gauntlet Challange.  In this mode you have different tasks which make the game less repetive. There are 8 weapons and 3 tactical ones.Audio Design AnalysisRunning with Scissors (the developes behind this project) did a good job here, some audio effects such as Ambience sound, machinery noises, vehicles and animals were design in a way that fits the environment in the story, at some point it looks like an horror game (keeping in mind the intentions of the man known as ""POSTAL Dude"" has).Level DesignDue to the game engine rendering the game in a 2D enviroment, sometimes will be difficult to see some elements such as hostiles, pedestrians or items (despite that exist a mechanism which let you see through some buildings, vehicles and trees).The artwork design for all maps looks like concept art, whether is good or bad is totally subjective.ConclusionI recommend this video game for anyone who likes some old arcade violence, it's entertaining and the main story is worth it."

There is no real narrative, but the game is darker and more menacing in tone in comparison to its infamous sequel. It also features a top-down isometric view instead of a FPS style view. The game is solid enough; the sounds are very clear, and are probably the most impressive part of the game (say, for example, you walk up to a light on a building, there is a buzz from the fixture there; sounds of nature are well placed; people's screams and terrified shrieks sound real at times and sometimes just silly). The graphics are surprisingly hand-painted, which add somewhat of a depth to the game. The journal writings of the Postal Dude are relatively disturbing, demented, and dark, and are a contrast to the witty yet sadistical Postal Dude in Postal 2.This game is also a game you didn't want your mom to see you playing back in the 90's, but today some of the violence is pretty tame as there really isn't any gore to speak of, just blood.

Esentially, this game is nothing like POSTAL 2. This game's goal is not to entertain you, but to disturb you. In my opinion, it suceeds. This may be a negative for some and positive for others but I thought it was just, sort of,  a thing.Plot SummaryTo keep this as spoiler free as possible, The Postal Dude has presumably been evicted from his home, as shown by a moving van near his house in level one, this (again, presumably) has driven him insane. As shown by the journal entries at the beginning of each level, he belives everyone ELSE has gone insane from, something... It's never shown if he's actually right or not.Overall, the controls are okay, the plot is also fine, and gameplay is fun too, it's an isometric, although some levels are top down, shooter. But, please note, this game could be a bit too disturbing and violent for younger players.

There's many risks this game takes and a lot of it is deeply horrifying. The experience of portraying a fictionalized serial killer with little to zero likable traits or an explanation of his madness aside from creepy diary highlights is more alienating than exciting. It's as if the developer wanted audiences to truly experience being a heartless murderer while leaving slim reasonings why the seemingly corrupted society the protagonist lives in should perish.The game deliberately descends into paths that would disgust and infuriate individuals that are struggling to cope with actual mass murders, loss of beloved ones from serial killers, or being the victim living their final moments facing their killer. There's certain sequences that are outright presented in ways that may appear uncanny or grotesque even the lowest denominator of society would have many questions about. It's an experience that tests your moral values with limited survival tactics, recycled stages, tedious difficulty settings, and moderately fulfilling replay value upon completion. Whether this game was intended to be a satire, or the ultimate test for an individual's personality traits, there's no doubt that it will forever be known as that classic arcade murder simulator that literally had more guts.Even with all of the chaos, whether it'd be openly senseless or darkly comical, I only recommend this solely for its honesty."

76561197984765152,Recommended,232770,12046835,"Posted: 10 September, 2014",all,DarthPostalDude,"Postal is an isometric/ top down shooter and is one of the most depraved and controversial games of all time.The tone in this game is quite confused to say the least. You have what would become the ridiculously over the top violence of setting loads of people on fire and blowing people up seen in Postal 2, though for the most part this game is slow, joyless, and humorless. You have the creepy loading and menu screens and music, you have the uneasy tone of no music during gameplay but the sound of slaughter with people’s ear bursting screams and people suffering, but then you have the text during the load screens which are just too edgy to be disturbing, there are different texts from the manual that fit massively better with the original idea of the protagonist being a person who is extremely paranoid and schizophrenic who believes everyone else has been infected with a madness disease or he’s killing deformed monstrosities (seen in some of the load screens) and he is the only one left. However in this you  play as The Postal Dude that everyone knows and loves, who is joyfully going around and killing everyone, and spitting out one liners. Another thing that doesn’t quite work for this game is that half of the lines do sound like a voice inside The Postal Dude’s head, whereas the rest are lines that you would expect to hear from Postal 2.  There is even more confusion with the ending where he tries to massacre a school, only to find out that none of his weapons have any effect and none of the children react to his presence. He then has a mental breakdown, later to be captured and locked away in an insane asylum. I think it’s left to your own interpretation e.g.: Is The Postal Dude so upset about not being able to kill kids? Or is he upset because he just realised he killed loads of innocent people for nothing? Or is it just meant to really shock and appal you…well obviously part of that.The gameplay is that you have to kill a certain amount of armed people to progress to the next level to do the same (by pressing F1 by the way) The game does not discriminate if you don’t kill any civilians or if you kill “EEEEEEEEEVVVVEEEEEERRRRYYYYYOOOOOONNNNNEEE” It doesn’t even matter if you die because you can still progress to the next level if you’ve killed enough people. If you screw up the way to restart the level is to kill yourself by pressing the suicide button where the dude (if you killed someone on that level) will say “I REGET NOTHING” and blow his head off. Compared to Hatred, Postal feels a lot more strategic due to that you have health pickups rather than regaining a lot of health by executing people, also because of the weapons you are given, since in Hatred it doesn’t really matter all that much what weapons you are using. In Postal each weapon has its use. You have start off with a machinegun which is quite weak, the rate of fire isn’t very high, and accuracy is good enough and pretty good range and infinite ammo. You also get a shotgun which is very powerful, however the rate of fire is a little slow, it has a pretty short range and it restricts your movement when firing. You have an auto shotgun, which has the highest rate of fire of all of the weapons in postal, same amount of damage as the other shotgun, slightly better range than the other shotgun, though it shares the same ammo and chews through it very quickly. You have grenades which kill anyone instantly in the blast radius however it does take some time getting used to the range since you can’t control it. You also have a rocket launcher which can also fire heat seeking rockets, kills anyone instantly, however ammo is rather scarce. You have Molotov cocktails which function the same way as grenades but cause a spread of fire of course. You have a napalm launcher which fires a petrol take which causes a long line of fire which is good for a large crowd of people however ammo is very scarce. Lastly you have the flamethrower, which is the deadliest weapon in the game since it kills instantly, it has fairly good range, though ammo is rather scarce and you don’t get the weapon until later on into the game. There are a few different types of enemies in this game: you have the standard grunts (police officers) armed with either handguns, machineguns, and shotguns, you have the people with rocket launchers, you have people that throw grenades, Molotov’s and napalm, and you have turrets that fire rockets. The difficulties have a huge effect on the game since it changes how accurate the enemies are, how much damage they can deal and it also determines what they are armed with, for instance; on the highest difficulty labelled masochist mode the majority of enemies are armed with auto shotguns, the people with rocket launchers are exclusively armed with heat seeking rockets and the people who throw stuff sometimes have flamethrowers and you’ll get killed in seconds if you’re not being careful.The only downsides to this game are that the controls much like old school survival horror are rather clunky and finicky at first but you do get used to them, and the subject matter of this game gives it a very limited appeal. (Though after a certain amount of time you'll get used to it, and it isn't so shocking)The controversy:The controversy for this game mainly comes from the premise since this game isn’t all that violent even for the time, this game was banned in over 10 countries and the developers were ever sued by the American postal service but that case was dropped when they found out that the game isn’t based off real events.This is a fun game to play if you don’t mind killing innocent people in games and its worth checking it out to see the real dark side of video games, and I just find this to be an interesting game, even though I’m not the kind of person who has a fascination with serial killers."

POSTAL, an isometric game from the late 90s, controls like a twin-stick shooter. Keyboard controls are easy to pick up, gameplay is intense and amazingly fun, and the level design is varied enough to remain fun throughout. The game's plot is barebones, though this doesn't really take away from the game as a whole. Definitely recommended!"

After you have reached that ammount you will press F1 to move to the next level and basically do the same again. There are some weapons,armor, medkits around and sometimes even a fuel can that you are able to blowup. The biggest issue that i have is aiming. It's soo bad and hitting an enemy is pretty difficult and it looks awkward too.Wonky aim.Has some secrets.Enemies are able to hide behind pixel or structure.Repetitive.You can save the game.There are ingame options.Game is very old and 2 bucks seems okayish for this game.Game is okay.Other things.You are able to get chain rocketed. They shoot a rocket into your direction and you get hit. You will fly into the air and fall back onto the ground. The flying duration is pretty long which could give the enemy enough time to shoot another rocket. If the rocket hits you again you will fly again as you might not have enough time to avoid the incoming rocket. You are stuck in an animation.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10"

I have not tried the remaster/HD version.gameplay is fun, and definitely a product of its time. i haven't finished it, but you basically mosey about killing everything that moves. i'm popping out achievements and taking in the pre-rendered pixel graphics which serve as backdrop to polygonal citizenry shooting or throwing grenades or bleeding out on the ground.it's surprisingly unflinching in its execution of indiscriminate violence and benefits from the staple of one guy with body armor and an infinite-ammo m16."
,Recommended,232770,33495549,Posted: 12 July,all,Frisk,"I first played this game only a few years ago. However, I did know about this game's controversies before then. When I learned that Postal 1 was coming out on Steam, I had to try it.Postal 1 is much less humorous than Postal 2, focusing more on disturbing violence. Not only do you go on a shooting rampage, but your victims' screams and moans sound a lot more agonizing than in other games. Despite this, I didn't think the game was ""trying too hard"" to be shocking. The shocking, disturbing parts of the game don't feel like filler, and fit into the overall feel of the game.Also, the game can be pretty challenging; it's not just a mindless killing spree game. The people who shoot back can be difficult to deal with, especially when there's a lot of them and they use explosives. You'll have to make use of your wide arsenal of weapons and use cover wisely.Postal 1 was updated a while back to support Xbox 360 controllers. This makes the game so much easier to control; you don't have to stick to the tank controls the game used to only have.This game is violent, shocking, and disturbing (especially for 1997), but it's done well, and it's a shining example of what you can do with art. RWS wasn't afraid to put their vision out, and I'm glad that they did."

Two actually. There’s an overall population count and then there’s a hostile counter.4.Graphically, the game’s visuals are rather dated now, so the game doesn’t have as much impact."
,Recommended,232770,30159920,Posted: 24 February,all,GoldSkula,Postal is an old third person shooter from the 90s. I wouldn't recommend this game for fun but I would for curiosity. It's the 90s version of Hatred. It was made just for shock value even i'm not into gore games I don't think anybody will find this gory  now. It has similar graphics to fallout one and two. So you can think what Hatred would be like if it would have bad graphics and worse controlls. You can only shoot in eight directions so the enemies seen to go between your bullets.[SPOILER FREE PLOT]You are an emo who goes and kills people.With a plot like that you can guess the gameplay gets dull very quickly.Good-The fact that you know that the game was shocking some 20 years agoBad-Controlls-Graphics-Gameplay3/10UPDATEI tried the game with a xbox 360 controller and it totally changes the game. It changes the game from a crappy shock game to a great retro twin stick shooter and it's great. But as most retro twin stick shooters it gets old fast. And i got to say the commynity is suprisingly good. In 3 hours after i post it my negative review the developer told me new info about controller support. So top notch community.7/10

For example, it's already 20 years after the release of this game, but the developers have added in achievements and gamepad support.There are some quirks here and there, like you have to press ""F1"" to get to the next level, you can't load a savefile from within a level, no proper mouse support to control the reticle (you can move your mouse from left to right to rotate the reticle around your character, simmilar to how wolfenstein 3D works, but top-down though it's not really a problem cause you can walk with wsad and shoot with arrows, you get used it after the first level).Overall however, the game is really fun, even today, and I do recommend you buy it and play for yourself."
