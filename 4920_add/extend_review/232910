,Recommended,232910,7673180,"Posted: 16 November, 2013",all,isa,"+ Simple and fun gameplay which is easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.+ Very skill-based and competitive. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.+ Tolerable community. Most of the time they show sportsmanship and are very fair.+ Lots of community created content. Also includes the Steam Workshop.+ User friendly track, car and replay editors to create said content.+ Great car physics.- Ubisoft decided it'd be a good idea to split the TM² environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. The result? Less players, less servers. You won't have a problem though until you hit 60k ladderpoints - that's when you have to play on different servers to gain more. And those servers are rather dead.- Said car physics tend to mess up sometimes, but that's usually the map builder's fault.- 5min cooldown on official races is a bit too long. In fact, why do they even make you wait? You could simply pay with Coppers (the currency) in previous games to try again, however, this doesn't work here. So this makes it really tedious to get good times on official races.- The price tag. TMNF was free, while this is $10, even though it's pretty much the same game.TrackMania² Stadium is an updated version of TMNF, ported to the updated engine with ManiaPlanet. It's great, but I wouldn't recommend picking it up at its full price.8/10"
,Recommended,232910,32670882,Posted: 23 June,all,SinasAppel,"For context, I am writing this review a few months after the update every other review below is talking about.The game is very stable, the update brought even better graphics to an already great looking game. Maps can be easily updated in the game itself, this is no problem.Trackmania is a great arcade style racing game. The controls are phenomenal, you really feel in control of your car. Multiplayer makes this game so great, servers are full of great maps and players. Sometimes you can play with more than 100 players on 1 map, which looks really cool.There is also a great esport scene, almost always there is some competition going on in your favorite style of maps.I play this game for more than 10 years now and I probably will never stop playing it. Please try it out, you will not regret it."

I would drive around in my car a little bit, crash into some wall, then go. Honestly, looking at the name and trailers, I wasn't really expecting a great game. I was so wrong. This game is great. The tracks, the concept, the art, even the music. Everything about this game was done right.  The levels aren't repetative so you won't get lulled into a bored repetitive leveling. No, each level has its own new quirck and obviously a new track. If you are going to buy this, be prepared to start honing your keyboard driving skills because this fast-paced game will require skill. But skill that you won't mind training for because it is such a fun game."

The reason I am not recommending this game is because they removed a main selling point from the game for me; local splitscreen multiplayer.This game is a blast to play with friends/family locally, but it is no longer possible since they removed it. If they added it I'd love to switch this to the YES the game deserves."
,Recommended,232910,11220462,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,Grandma,"This game is pretty ridiculous. It's like the company asked a bunch of 4th graders to come up with ideas for a racing game, and this is the result. Wall rides, loops, huge jumps, crazy speed. It's awesome.That being said, the skill cap is infinitely high. Yes, it's massively fun to go on a server and smash through a bunch of new tracks, crashing all over the place and hitting walls like they owe you money. And it's worth mentioning that since the multiplayer is almost exclusively user-created levels, there are tens of thousands of maps to play. But once you settle in to a server and have learned the maps, then it becomes a wonderfully technical game about shaving off bits of time where you can.A notable game mechanic, for those unaware, is that in time attack mode (probably the most popular game type, that and Rounds) you can reset to the beginning of the track (or the last checkpoint) at any time. This is a bit of departure from many other racing games. You'll just have a set amount of time (usually 5 to 7 minutes), to get a single best run possible. This makes it so that you never have to waste time finishing a run when you've already messed up, you can just reset and start fresh immediately. Makes for a much more efficient practice regimen, and resulting rate of improvement.There are three environments within TrackMania 2 (Stadium, Valley, Canyon), but within each environment is an abundance of variety in itself. Since this review is Stadium, I'll focus on that briefly:-Track materials: Pavement, Dirt, Grass, Water-Game Modes: Time Attack, Rounds. Probably others, but rarely used. RPG, I suppose.-Track Types: FullSpeed (because braking is for losers), Tech (because fullspeed is for neanderthals), Dirt (because you are full of self-loathing), Speedtech (Because you're a well-balanced individual with many friends and a winning smile).Seriously, the infinite permutations of tracks alone makes this game worth it.The End"

Instead of choosing a set car or track, Nadeo lets the players create their own experiences, with multiple creation tools such as creating a track or painting a car. Trackmania is a very competitive game, most racing will be decided by 1 or 2 milliseconds. Trackmania is not about who has the best car, its about who is the best racer. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the best racing games i have ever played."

For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you referenceSteamChartsfor Stadium, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 90 and 190. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes."

If you are looking for a racing game with crashes and power-ups, this is not for you. TMS has a large surplus of maps with various difficulties. Almost every track involve a very large amount of skill to pull of fast times. TMS has a single-player mode and it's pretty basic. You competing against yourself to get bronze, silver or gold medals. The single-player is here to enhance your ability to do better on courses and to make you even better at the game. The money is well spent when you play multiplayer.There are a ton of servers that are up across the world. All ranging from U.S. to Germany to Japan. I was amazed by how the servers ran, even with over 50 people. Obviously, this was needed as this type of game relies on time based racing.It's exhilerating to go at a such high speed and making perfect turns as you barely beat the opponent who is ahead of you. You actually feel like you are going extremely fast and it makes the game challenging and pretty addicting at certain times. The graphics in TMS aren't amazing compared to TrackMania Valley, but they get the job done as well as the audio.The controls aren't totally perfect, but they're responsive enough to give you a chance of making some really good times.I'm not that great at the game, but these last 7 hours have improved me as a player and I can only learn from the professionals around me.PROS:+High Speed Time Trials+Great Amount of Tracks+Solid Controls+Good Community with a large surplus of servers+Decent Price+Excellent Frame-rate with very rare connection issues+Skill BasedCONS:-Can get tedious on occasionWhile I only have one con, that bullet is very important. I rarely find myself playing TMS for more than an hour on any given time which isn't that great of a thing. Although, TMS is a solid game nonetheless.TRACKMANIA2 STADIUM: 7.0/10"

Valley is the middle ground of the TM games,it feels more like stadium with more traction on the road,but ultra fast like canyon but doesn't offer anything really different apart from being an all round great game,however there are some other things about valley that do stand out and that's in it's level track design,the editor has a little more scope for making day and night time tracks,forrest tracks and underground tracks that can have you driving through mountains,i would say it's the middle ground and having all the of the best features of the two before it you would think it's the best of the bunch but it just isn't ! not a thing wrong with it but it still can't beat stadium.I would always recommend Stadium as the starting game,it's the cheapest of the three and the core game is there,the other two are just as good but I would say Stadium is the best of the three,with stadium you do not even need to ever play the other two games,the other two are for those who can't get enough of the Trackmania series and it's also good to change out every now and then for something s bit different to race on.CONSThe game like soo many others are not without problems,many bugs have already been sorted but I found the Trackmania series in particular to have some very backwards design ideas/flaws,for the most part this game and it's expansions will run 60fps+ on the very high graphical settings,some settings still slow it down like motionblur but thankfully you can turn all details from off,low,med,high,the vsync options are not very well explained as there are six options for vsync as well as triple buffering and first time users won't know the correct/best setup,I will say now that you should use vsync,also use every third frame (not constant frame) and also use triple buffer and this should give you a proper 60fps,water shader detail for medium pc's should be med or low,and motion blur would be recommended as off,there are many other options in the start up menu and you should take the time in setting these up,resolution is very important in this game,i found that lower resolutions are fine but you really miss the graphical details so I would recommend you aim for 1080,full frame rate with vsync options and then turn up other details to see what you can get away with.Other problems with the game are the lack of support,this game is made by a French company and the forums and users are mostly EU users,there's not as many users from the uk and usa on the forums,that doesn't mean there are not many users from uk and usa playing the game,just means we try to avoid the unhelpful forums as I found I didn't get anywhere when asking for help.The game's layout,the way the game works can be quite strange as well,you earn points for scoring high,these points are called Planets ? your planets are displayed in the top bar when you are in the main menu,these Planets are then used to buy online user created content,you earn a little planets each day that you play as well,another thing that seems backward to me is the apparent new menu system that combines everything together (it doesn't actually work) after all the time this game has been out it still is broken but since an update a month ago it is now working outside of steam but the steam version is still unworking,this means that if you own two or more of the trackmania games,you need to exit out the game and start then other one up from steam ( not a big deal really)Overall this game is amazing,be prepared to spend some time on the game,take your time and mess about in the menus and try to get used to the way the Trackmania system works,playing the game for the first time gave me the feeling of (wtf have I just bought ?) it took me a while to understand the games charm,I was expecting far too much from the game and when I couldn't really GET the concept of the game along with the many problems I faced in trying to find out what Planets are and why my planets would disappear without buying content or sometimes I would buy content and lose my planets but not receive my item,I found it very hard in finding the answers on google or the mania forums,little things like this can really put you off a strange game and concept like this one,but give it a go and you will find it hard not to fall in love with this game,it's a classic reborn and in my opinion one of the best hardcore/arcade racers you can get !10/10"

It plays just the same, very easy controls, very difficult to master, and almost impossible to put down. Graphically it's far superior to the original (hardly surprising) although with everything moving so fast it's difficult to really spot a lot of the graphical improvements, apart from those on the car itself.

,Recommended,232910,34386985,Posted: 20 August,all,Anonymate,"What this game is and is not about.1.This is NOT a F1 simulator.You drive a F1 car and that's as close as it gets. Expect to be running in dirt tracks (yeap, those used in rally races), going through vertical loops and even floating on air. Yes, you will be jumping and ""flying"" a lot.2.You DO NOT race against other players;or even against bots. You just race alone trying to get better and better times. In solo, you just try to break your own record, as well as local/national/world records for each official track. In multiplayer, you just try to get a better time than the other players: you can try as many times as you wish before the time ends and the track is changed; you also see the other players trying, but only as ghosts (no direct interaction).3.The physics are NOT even close to reality.You can literally accelerate, break and even turn while floating on air (although these cause a much smaller effect than doing those on the ground). Your car doesn't suffer any damage when you hit a wall. Also good to point out that the gravity is much lower than Earth's gravity. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it; that doesn't make it any more realistic.The current problems with the game1. In the past, you could just download the game and start playing. Now, before you start the game, you must register in their website before you can connect, and then download some huge updates in-game using their servers (instead of steam servers). It's annoying and you may need to access the community discussions in order to learn how to register (at least when I did, the in-game instructions did not work - for me or anybody else - and I'm not sure if they fixed it).There are other minor issues not worth pointing out here. Unfortunately, from what I've seen, new bugs are created and older ones are not fixed. The game doesn't suffer from any major issue though.Other than that, I'm under the impression that they still have devs working on the game and it's still fun to spend some time (I usually connect, play on a single track for 10 to 20 minutes and quit)."

You cannot run other players off the road in this game.- In multiplayer, you're in a simultaneous time-trial competition with the other players, but sometimes there are other goals... such as simply being able to finish a very difficult track or a specially crafted stunt-oriented track at all.Generally speaking, this is a game for perfectionists, speed seekers, and stunt lovers.The main benefit of this game over other racing games is that you can jump into an already-running multiplayer server at random, encounter new tracks that you've never seen before as well as ones you've mastered, and have people to compete with, pretty much any time you want."

A friend of mine made me buy it years ago (he loves it). I didn't like racing with keyboard, I disliked the casual arcade style, I disliked the very short races.  I found a whole bunch of things to dislike and noted them in order of priority (that list has been lost now, perhaps thrown away inadvertently).2015 is drawing to an end, and having recently purchased an Oculus DK2: I downloaded the demo of Trackmania Stadium.  I can tell you that Trackmania with Oculus is a whole new experience! The graphics are beautiful in stereoscopic 3d. The visuals are very sharp, beautifully lit and it all looks very real. Not even the slightest hint of judder (running in extended mode 6.0.1. runtime windows 8, Nvidia 680).I think HMD VR has the unique ability of being able to reveal to you the beauty of a particular game you couldn't fully appreciate without it.When playing games the conventional way through a TV or monitor - you're seeing that game world from a distance (through a small window). With VR you are projected into that world - everything is life size. You tend to notice things and feel immersed to a degree not possible even with the best 4k monitor or large screen TV.Control-wise it's nice to see Trackmania automatically detect my Saitek X52 Pro so I can use the joystick for racing (I haven't had to configure anything!). Much nicer than key-presses.Racing in 3rd person with Oculus is mind-blowing (3rd person was also on my dislike list in the past).  You get to see all of the detail in the game and the tracks are jaw-dropping. I find myself looking up at the sky or at the intricate scenery. I would say this is one of the best VR experiences you can have.  In an instant I have converted from someone who didn't like the game (previous versions), to someone who thinks it's stunning and hopes Nadeo convert their entire series to VR. Yes, for every Trackmania game released with VR support: I will buy and recommend to others.Trackmania is a great example of a game that reveals its true beauty through VR...Nadeo should be very proud of this creation."

Everybody is racing at the same time, for the best time. You cannot directly interact with the other cars but you can see them and you are competing with them. Most tracks are only about 30 seconds long and you get about 5 minutes to get the best time possible. All the while you know how well your competitors are doing and see them racing besides you. It is a very intense and fun experience.Trackmania 2 Stadium is the direct sequel to Trackmania Nations Forever and includes an updated engine with much better graphic, a nicer user interface, better multiplayer, more tracks, and a more active community. It is all about speed and crazy tracks with loops and fast curves.The other Trackmania 2 games, Canyon and Valley, feature different environments. Canyon is more on-road racing with wider tracks in a beautiful desert environment. Canyon also includes nicer-looking cars which show damage when you hit things. Valley, which I have not yet played, features more off-road driving. All games have the capabilities to create your own tracks or download pre-made tracks from the Internet.I recommend starting with Trackmania 2: Stadium as it is the cheapest and most popular environment.

Not because of the simulation like mechanics but rather because of its unrealistic gameplay.TrackMania² Stadium is all about going fast and driving through different kinds of tracks ranging from Acrobatic tracks to more classic Endurance type of tracks. There's quite some variety with the built in tracks that the game comes with. Each and every track feels unique and doesn't really use any old mechanics or tricks from previous tracks. You can clearly see thought was put into making the tracks for the base game. All the different track types usually have a couple of trick that you need to learn in order to master them and get the fastest time which adds a lot of replayability to the game. You most likely won't succeed with your first try on the tracks which is fine because the tracks are usually short and fast so it's not really that common for you to try out a track for tens, even hundreds, of times to perfect your run.While I do like the tracks that were built in to the game by Nadeo, the developers of the game, I still do think the genuine fun factor comes from something a little different. Not much, just little. What I'm talking about is the Track Editor which lets you build your own tracks and share them with everyone on the internet. There are thousands of tracks to choose from so if you ever master all of the Nadeos tracks you will not run out of tracks to play after that.TrackMania² Stadium is a close to perfect game in my books. It's fast, fun, challenging and has a level editor in it with easy and advanced tools to create more levels for everyone to enjoy. TrackMania² Stadium is a must play if you are a fan of arcade type of racing games that do not care about realism.

Essentially, this game is an arcade racer where you compete against the clock to see who can get the fastest time around the track. However there is a twist, if you're playing online, then be prepared to compete against 50 other people who are trying to do the same thing as you!It's a Ubisoft game... Will I need a UPlay account to play?Not really... You'll need a Maniaplanet account to play online, unless you're just interested in playing the game offline, then you won't need an account at all, but I highly recommend that you make an account.What's the customisation like in-game?Absolutely limitless! So you can create tracks in the track builder and then share them to the Steam Workshop, or share them to the ManiaExchange website which is the biggest collective of user-created tracks. As well as this, you can create skins for your cars, which includes colours and paint-jobs for the stadium car, as well as entirely different models for your car.Is racing against the clock the only thing you can do?Nope. There are a lot of user-implemented modes in this game. Some great examples are NASCAR, (you drive around ovals at break-neck speeds) RPG (which is essentially a very large track that can take from 5 minutes to an hour to complete) and the likes of other fantastic modes!How's the online community?In my opinion, the online community is the best part of the game. Back in the day, I used to play this game religiously and made loads of friends on the LOLMAPS server. (if you play on there a lot, what up it's Mumbles!) There's also an e-Gaming community behind this game, so if you think you're pretty good at this game, you can crank it up a notch and compete against the REAL good players.Do you recommend this game?Yes I do!

But with the update the appeal, for me at least, has been severly hammered.A very sad week; I doubt I'll be playing the new version anywhere near as much. :(Original review follows.---------------------------------Why so much time on what looks like a pretty basic, arcady, and completely unrealistic racing game?Well, after 3k+ hours, there are probably about 3k+ reasons. Let me try and pick a few.First off, this is very much skill-based. Even on the 'silly, luck' tracks (which I'll come to in a moment). Play online, and you'll find pro-level gamers showing almost unbelievable levels of skill and achieving the seemingly impossible. But it's not impossible - this is a very fair game. Any cheating is caught and eliminated pretty quickly. All the cars have the same spec, there is no car-to-car collision to mess up your times. It's (mostly) just you, and a track, and your level of skill that determine how well you do.Next, the variety. The track creator provided allows an almost limitless tracks, and the community has produced masses of content. This obviously varies enormously in both style and quality, but since you are generally only on any given track for 4-5 minutes, if you don't like one you just wait it out and see if the next is more your kind of thing. And probably, in those 4-5 minutes you'll try it anyway and still get sucked in to try and beat your own times at the very least.[continued in comments]"

Except it's better.TrackMania is widely known as being one of the most difficult racing games ever - to beat the different achievements (""medals"") on each track, you need to clock some seriously freaking amazing times.  And then there's the so-called ""Author Medal"" - the medal you can only achieve by beating the best time set by the track'screator.  I've played this game and TM:NF for years and I've only ever earned about three of them, at best.The visuals of this game are absolutely stunning, bringing the cars, tracks, and of course the stadium itself, truly to life.The amount of content in the game is virtually limitless, from user creations in the Workshop to tracks you can put together yourself.  The map creator gives you literally as much flexibility as the game's creators had, and is super easy to use.The multiplayer is a lot of fun too - connecting to servers and racing live with other players, or even having everyone individually clock their own best times, with a time limit to see who can clock the best time the fastest.  It's very easy to set up a server of your own too!And I also like the ""Official Time"" function - that's something they didn't have before in TM:NF.  It's solo-play, except that you can observe your best times and how they stack up to other players across your state, country, or across the globe.The music, as it was in TM:NF, isn't amazing (it's not bad, but not great either), but then again, it's the gameplay we're after, right?The only real gripe I had about the game is this: I noticed very quickly going through the White-level (easiest) tracks that a number of tracks were re-used from TM:NF, just adapted to the new graphics engine.  Really?  If I wanted to play those again, I would have just gotten the free download of Nations instead.But all-in-all, I recommend that you go for it, especially if you love racing and you love a challenge.  After all, it's only $10, and it comes with the free demo of ShootMania Elite."

The login system changed, many of the graphics were changed, and other elements of the game were changed arbitrarily. I have spent nearly an hour just trying to play Trackmania 2 at all, but the game claimed my account didn't exist anymore and wouldn't let me reset my password.This is a problem, because even though Trackmania 2 downloaded a nearly 100mb patch, I had to log in to ManiaPlanet in order to download another 700mb of data. Otherwise, even if I tried to play in Offline mode without logging in, this new updated version of ManiaPlanet wouldn't have the necessary game data to even launch Trackmania 2 at all.After deciphering their broken password reset system and logging in, I found that the updated Trackmania 2 had erased all of my medals and ranks. This is because the new Trackmania 2 changed how vehicle physics work, so all of the old ranking data was invalid. This also breaks tons of custom tracks made over the last 3-5 years, which are the lifeblood of a game like this.Ubisoft and Nadeo have essentially decided to arbitrarily reset everything about Trackmania 2 without warning or any way to go back to the old game. For users just starting out from this point forward it's not going to be a big deal, but for a Trackmania veteran like me, an update like this is devastating.What a disaster."

I picked it up  on a Steam sale for around $2.50 along with Trackmania Canyon for me and a friend because it was so cheap. There's a stripped down single player version: No story, no opponents (Except for the predeterminded time goasts), no collision. Just you and the road.The multiplayer is the real reason why you would buy this game, though. The basis of multiplayer is that you have at set amount of time to finish the track and get the fastest time possible, while others are doing the same. There's a ""place"" in that it's how you match up against other player's fastest times. It has an extensive server list, modding community, and track creators, and they're friendly!! Some actually say hello and strike a conversation when a new person joins. Because the game relies mostly on skill, professional racing teams have been created. I must say, server admins have a very good taste in music.On the visual side, it looks very good, and because it's a reletively light game, you'll be running a pretty high FPS most of the time. You can also design your own vehicle skins, either the default car, or something from the Steam community. The modding community can let you race around the track as Sonic if you want.The game itself can be pretty hard, to be honest. Many tracks require split second reaction time with very low margin for error. Don't be discouraged if you crash off the track a few times or if the pros get a faster time than you. Happens to the best of us. The more you play a track, the better you naturally get at it.Overall, try to get it on a Steam sale. You might like it."

With the single-player mode, you get a set amount of tracks split into five groups of skill level, White being the easiest and Black being the most difficult (a bit like the karate belt system) and within those tracks, there is no room (as I know) to download other tracks and play them alone in single-player.Multiplayer is a whole different story, however. As you get more used to a server and it's map rotation (if there is one) you'll be able to remember the tracks as you play them within the five to ten minute time limit per map, and shave off those precious few tenth's of a second, sometimes even making it come down to the hundreth's of a second, truly making your mark in the track's leaderboard. A bit like Formula 1 in that matter, as it really comes down to the skill of the driver, and the knowledge of the track that you're on.But don't let that deter you if you aren't into that track-precision stuff, as there as many other fun-orientated maps which don't focus as much on your time taken, albeit there are less people on those servers.Story = -/10 (no story)Multiplayer = 9/10 (amazing community, great maps in general, easy to get along with)Graphics = 8/10 (when maxed out, the game can and does look stunning)Graphics Perfomance = 9/10 (runs very smoothly on older pc's and laptops)Controls = 10/10 (personally, I play with a keyboard, but controllers are supported too, and again, how you drive your car really makes the difference)Total = 36/40Final Comments - Please, if you can, pick up Trackmania² Stadium when you can, or even Canyon or Valley.

Stadium's parts tend to be more versatile and there are more community tracks. Stadium was originally a standalone free version ofTrackmania United, and then whenUnited Foreverrolled around Stadium was the one environment you could play for free, so naturally it had more players and the community glommed onto it more.

Put simply, it doesn't offer anything new over its free-to-play predecessor Trackmania Nations.There's also the issue that because Nadeo has split the game into three separate versions; Stadium, Canyon and Valley, it has managed to separate the community of players. This has left the multi-player servers somewhat sparsely populated.In short, if you you're a Trackmania veteran, you don’t need this.

The tracks were interesting and varied, the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time. So you buy the game, open the server list and pick the first one that isn't plain black text.And then it all comes tumbling down.Half the screen is filled with needless leaderboards, ugly buttons that don't do anything and other pointless bells and whistles. The other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you'll be lucky to beat even once. Most of the time they're so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path, and that still won't help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it.If this were the game the demo claimed it would be, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you're a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version, just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that's been mutated in a demonic, unforgiving shell of its former self."

76561198067939274,Not Recommended,232910,8461377,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,MattV,"Why should you care about my review?I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the ""dream"" of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)Pros-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a ""playlist"" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.Cons-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on ""Stadium"" from Steam, then decide to play ""Canyon"" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the ""Start Game"" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit ""more blue"" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42"" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use ""multiple profiles"" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say ""You must connect online to launch the game."" I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to ""take"" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.ConclusionThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise."

Doesn't matter this game offers both and still tells you what your global and regional ranks are.The map editor is still as fun as it was in Trackmania Nations and the car painting feels more smooth now and high resolution. Time to make some epic looking custom paint jobs.This is a racing game for you who wants a little more than just another racing game.

You are then poked and proded to log 50 times before you can get to anything that even says TM2 Stadium.

So, went to go for good measure try to make an account; Lol no thanks after about the 4th screen, Especially concidering the networking of the game seems to run on peer to peer which is heavily throttled by my isp. So I gave up, and went to look on the forums (always an exciting experience, as i'm sure many know.) Found nothing regarding offline play for the most part, other than some posts in russian that weren't really relevant.Are my issues with this game easy to get around?Possibly, Though I don't quite care to jump through hoops for 2 hours though for something supposed to be relaxing.I'll probably end up getting it fixed someday but, For the purpose of relating ease of access to certain things^^^Is this game a game for people who like an easy offline racing experience?No, wouldn't say so.

,Not Recommended,232910,17675539,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,Luparax,"Okay, so, I have to warn you before I begin this review. I am biased. Against TM2 (Track Mania 2) and towards TMU (Track Mania United). Let me tell you why.Review of Track Mania 2 : StadiumSo, before I begin delving into the depth of deprivation, let me tell you that this is essentially ""Track Mania United - Stadium"". Except TMU came with 6 other areas, which are essentially ""themes"", you could play in.Price Comparison:TMU - Star Edition --> 29.99€ (seven areas + some small extras)TM2 - Stadium       -->  9.99€ (one area)TM2 - Stadium + TM2 - Valley + TM2 - Canyon --> 39,99€ (three areas)I am a little speechless. And in order to prevent myself from getting a headache, I will treat the rest of the review as if that is not a giant rip off.A fair reviewer treats games independently. The 6th iteration in a series need not necessarily be worse than the 1st. And I would give TM2 - Stadium the benefit of the doubt, if it weren't for the fact that it is an exact copy of the TMU stadium area. The size of the stadium, the pieces that are used to build the tracks, even the color of the grass if it isn't stuck on a darker shade again for a couple of blocks because screw unified grass colors. That would be silly, right? I could of course just be a giant doof and missed the ""Unify grass colors again"" button, but I believe there is none. There is but a single set of road pieces that got added from the last iteration of TM.Maybe I should have expected that, when I bought a TM game with the name ""Stadium"". But I didn't excpect a company to be as cocky as to sell an area they sold before for another 10 bucks and call it ""Track Mania 2"". But Nadeo just laughs a ""Think again!"" in my face.GameplayTrack Mania is about driving on courses built with an open level editor. It is about driving a course over and over and over again until you can beat that sweet gold medal time. It's about building your own tracks, and watching your friends drive into walls you placed at inconvenient locations.Track Mania is a racing game with essentially infinite levels, built with the same +100 pieces. It is fun, it is competitive and it is exciting.For those of you who don't know the TM Series yet: It's not a game where you can crash into other people. You'll be always driving against their ""ghost"". TM is about finding that ideal path through a course, not about pushing other people off the track.The controls are as simple as you can get. Arrow keys to control your car, backspace to respawn at the last checkpoint. These are rebindable, of course. You can also use a gamepad which allows for precise driving with the analog stick. I personally prefer the keyboard, because the TM tracksusually are about trying to find the ideal path in a course, and analog input is hard to repeat perfectly every time you try again. It seems to me that the game engine and car physics have been tweaked to accomodate analog input more, which makes the cars drift a lot when using digital input i.e. the keyboard. That is more of a problem with the other areas and not so much with stadium, so I will not consider that as a disadvantage for this game.There is no split screen option, as far as I am aware. Local players have to take turns. There never has been a split screen option in any of the TM games. I don't know why, because it is a fun game to play against friends locally; racing games in general are.To conclude all of the above: The gameplay is solid. The game executes what it wants to do perfectly.GraphicsPeople say, TM2 has really nice graphics. Be prepared to drop some frames on crowded tracks though if you crank them up to the highest setting. In addition to that arguably small flaw, I had to consult the internet to find a way to change graphics settings in the launcher. Apparently, pressing ""Customize"" does not allow you to change graphics settings. Setting the preset to ""None"" does. Again, a small flaw. Overall the games graphics do not have to hide from the big players.Conclusion: Great graphics, small flaws in the execution.Singleplayer vs MultiplayerI felt like this needed an extra category. While the game has a ""singleplayer"" campaign and unless you have friends who also play the game, the real fun comes in beating other peoples times. Of course there is no lobby system, since you only every try to beat their time or drive against their ""ghost"" if you will.The single player campaign is slightly flawed in my eyes. Gold Medal now actually means ""Gold Medal"", even on the first track of the first part of the campaign. There is no increase in difficulty when it comes to the times you have to beat, they will always be tough. There will be an increase of the skill you need to traverse a track though, which in my eyes is just about enough for a racing game single player campaign. Of course there is no story or anything apart from the tracks, but in a game like TM2 I did not miss that.Conclusion: Single player is solid and demanding. Multiplayer in the classic meaning does not exists, but you will be comparing your track time to other peoples time constantly.VerdictI don't see anything that TMU does not provide. TM2 might not be a bad game, but in my eyes it adds nothing the the TM ""Genre"" as a whole. If you like the slightly better graphics get TM2 over TMU. For anyone else I recommend buying TMU, especially since you get more bang bang bang bang bang bang bang for buck."

They are NOT designed to make you learn how to drive. They are designed to test you how far you can go till you ragequit.

Yet its physics are disapppointingly despondent towards drifting and have a numbing feeling in general. The cars are also programmed to be mortal enemies towards any wall, making it impossible to recover your race after a single mistake or botched turn. The game seems to be geared towards racing AI that always knows the right line to take. This makes playing the game agitating, tedious, and stressful. Also, there is an extremely annoying and obvious lack of any learning curve at all, as if the game expects you to be a pro-TrackMania player with hundreds of hours logged as soon as you start playing. This once again points to the idea that the game is designed for computers. The basic level editor allows the choice of, quite literally, less than 10 pieces and seems to be designed for toddlers. This is in stark contrast to the advanced level editor, which gives absolutely no direction as to how to use its nonsensical pre-race footage editing tools and seems to expect you to compute shadows every time you edit a map, a process that can take 10+ minutes with all the computations forgotten by the file even after you save the map. There is also no option for car-on-car collision, allowing them to pathetically phase through one another. The game also requires intimate router port forwarding knowledge in order to use several customization functions, which is something I spent all day trying to figure out. Generally the ports are forwarded by the .exe install file instead. Moreover, there is no boost, very few graphics and audio options, and a completely stupid currency system. This is only a portion of the things I have a problem with, but I'll spare the rest. In short, this game is great for people who love experiencing repeated failure, but a dismal waste to all others."

It has very enjoyable driving physics and along with that an amazing community that continues to make maps or car skins that adds more and more hours of fun into this game. The graphics in this game also hold up pretty well from 2013 to 2016 with good lighting effects and nice looking cars. The multiplayer in this game is also addicting while you continue to race many community maps to become the number 1 racer in your area. It is satisfying to see yourself rise up and up until you are in the top ten in your country. So over all this game is great fun, and you can expect to get many hours of racing out of this cheap 10 dollar game."

To that respect this one is ""good"", but stick to the stadium version.It focuses on the player (you) skills to ride on the race with no collision between cars. To many this can feel like a gamebreaker but it remains unexpectly fun in all of the different available game mods. I'm talking about time attack, rounds or laps here. It really feels rewarding to finish 1st, or even get close to it. If the competion is that hard, not being relagated to the queue for being the worst player can be a rewarding achievement in itself.While everyting about it feels simple, easy to understand, from the controls to the rules they are also hard to master. You will get better and some rides will feel amazing. I'm not a fan of racing games but this one had me addicted. I don't play all the time but I always enjoy when I race on TM² Stadium. And as some famous anonymous guy said once: ""Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted"".If you are trying to decide if that's a game for you, get it already (TM² Stadium) and give it a try. The production value is well worth the price."

Every time I start up the game again, it swaps back to the unasigned gray car if I forget to change it. Another thing that suffers is that offline mode does not seem to work, which sucks, because I really like playing 8-player hotseat games against myself as another means to get good at a track.I don't know.

Then, once I finally created the freaking account and started up (and navigated around a menu system out of UX designer's nightmare) I found out that for some reason the game does not work with an XBox 360 controller. Digging around online I found that the makers of the game have been aware of the controller mapping problem for FIVE YEARS and have never bothered to fit it. I was really looking forward to building my own tracks and racing around, but in the end TrackMania was a massive, colossal dissapointment and frankly I will never, ever give any Mania Planet games even a second's consideration."

Trackmania is time trials race style game,  you won't have to worry about colliding with other drivers because you will be to concentrated on just yourself.  It's a fairly simple game to pick up and start but to get the top awards you have to practice and practice to understand the flow of the tracks.Tracks can include simple dirt tracks where you have less grip as contrete tracks, and can come with various loops, rolls, boosts, and free wheeling parts. (Free Wheeling is when you have no engine, just going off of momentum.  Players can design their own tracks and many do.  Most online play is custom tracks where you race off against up to 100 people on a single track.I find the game addictive to the point where I lose track of time.

The single player mode provides a challenge and you will want to keep improving your times to move up the leaderboards, but the game really shines in multiplayer. Races can be tense and very exciting and final results will often be decided on just milliseconds. The tracks and other content produced by Nadeo are good enough, but the many customisation options bring so much more to the game. The level editor in particular is mostly simple to use and there are many good tracks provided by the community that add a lot of variety and will keep you interested in the game for a long time. The other TrackMania games are very good as well, but the track features and excellent car handling that form the Stadium environment make this game come highly recommended."

There's a daunting, semi-functional UI, the controls are hard to set up for anything beyond a keyboard, and single-player feels anemic at best. On the other hand, the graphics shine, the infrastructure behind the seamless multiplayer experience is almost unparalleled, and the community capitalizes on that with a near infinite amount of custom tracks.Stadium offers the best ""tileset"" for any of the TrackMania series, with generous pourings of HotWheels-style loops, corkscrews, and vertical turns. Due to this, it feels absolutely exhilarating to finally ace a full-speed (FS) track, and you'll be more than happy to continue doing it to shave off a precious few milliseconds from your time.It's pretty much racing, distilled."

Just get it, you'll love it too. Pretty much the same game with updated graphics, but for under 5$, it's hard to resist.For everybody else: This is a very arcade like racer. The whole fun to be had is online in it's multiplayer mode. The most common play modes involve a rotating track list with a fixed amount of time per track to run your best time. You see all the other players ghosts but won't have any collisions with them. No damage model, unlimited retries and a very fast paced play make this game to an absolute time killer. Everybody has the same car stat-wise so there is no advantages in that regard for anybody and no pay to win scenario. You can customize the skin of your car however you want though. The game's highlight is the track editor. You can build marvelous tracks with banked corners, jumps and loops in no time. A dedicated server is freely available as well as a ladder system. This game once played will make you come back over and over. The famous ""I'll play for 5 minutes"" (which is totally possible) usually turn into 2 hour sessions. ""Just one more round..."".

Also there is always a way to make your time even slightly better. There is almost no perfect time. As in many games, people like to abuse a bug they find, which might at start may look unfair, but it gives many different ways to complete a track with. It makes more possibilities than normally.One thing I really love about this game, is the track-editor. It's simple, fast and fun. Also, with mods like ""unlimiter"", you don't have to worry about not being able to place a block, because it will allow it. Also, you can customize your car, and buy other cars, but they will not increase your speed or acceleration or anything like that. They're just a skin.Most of tracks can be rather confusing, furious and enjoyable.I seriously recommend this game to everyone who are into breaking times and wanting to compete with others. There are no one with a better and faster car than you, it's just about how you drive.I really like this game, but I think some of bugs are annoying and fustrating, and should be fixed. I give this game 9/10, because you will fast get used to those bugs, and because this game is amazing in a competitive way."

Still, it's worth considering.If you're new to TrackMania, let me say that TrackMania is AWESOME. It is basically a time trial game, but what a game! The driving is not realistic. You will do tight turns, stunts and drifts. You will drive at ridiculous speeds, stack, and try again. You will make a tight, high-speed turn, followed by a jump, fly across an enourmous gulf, land, do a loop, and then crash into a finish line. Or miss, but eventually you will succeed.And then there is the extraordinarily powerful (AND easy to use!!) level editor, which has led to large community of excellent user created tracks and multiplayer servers."

The tracks all feel unique, range wildly in difficulty, and are short enough that it doesn't feel like a chore to replay a level to shave off a few milliseconds (as opposed races that take upwards of three minutes, where you may have to drive through the same few kilometers time and time again to get to the one corner you're focusing on). It ends up feeling like a condensed version of other racing games, where the races can take less than a minute, the tracks are full of interesting bits and concice, and the controls are very tight.Additionally, the game looks great. It has a unified asthetic and looks smooth and polished, even on my sub-par labtop. The sound and music are not outstanding, but they serve the game well. It also has local multiplayer, which is always a plus in my books.Finally, the track editor is excellent. It's not hard to make a good level, and the level editor makes it easy to make good looking games as well. I've only made a few low-quality tracks, but even then the ability to build>test>tweak>test>tweak>test makes the proscess enjoyable in itself.Would recommend, especially if you've been turned off other racers in the past because you find them tedious."

There's something very humorous about spinning through the air at 450 MPH after missing a jump, only to land back on the track, unscathed, and continue as if nothing had happened.This game, being the sequel to Nations, has not lost that same exciting feel I enjoyed so much.  The downside to Nations was the wait times between games (being that it was a free game), and to play the full game you had to pay around $45.  This game is much cheaper, and there are no wait times.  The multiplayer is a huge improvment from any other racing game I've ever tried.Simply put: Try the Demo, or even Nations Forever.

,Recommended,232910,25001509,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,daletfours,"Let's go ahead and get the negative stuff out of the way. Trackmania 2 had the misfortune of being split into several games, each containing only one enviornment. I can see how that might have seemed like a good move on paper (rather than buying a full-priced game, you can simply pay only for the enviornments you care for) but a lot of people in the fanbase will probably tell you that it ended up fracturing the community quite a bit. Another negative thing about the game, in my opinion, is the fact that on the singleplayer maps there's a 5 minute cooldown period in between official race attempts. TM United didn't have that; you'd just pay 10 coppers per attempt and you could do it as many times as you wanted. I'm sure the cooldown timer was introduced to stop people from spamming official attempts, but it sucks to have to wait 5 minutes to try an official race again just because you nicked the wall. This only affects the singleplayer maps though, and it only matters if you care about official races.But this is a positive review, SO...Hello, new racer! TrackMania is a game about getting your car to the finish line as fast as possible. Which seems kind of...""duh"", because it's a racing game, but hear me out. Trackmania doesn't have car upgrades, boost meters, moving obstacles, or collision detection between you and other players. It's entirely you vs the clock, and you can't blame any of your mistakes on not having a fast enough car or getting punted into a wall by another racer. This game is entirely skill-based because everybody has an identical car with no handicaps or advantages, and there's no random or variable elements. If you didn't win that gold medal, it is purely because you didn't control your car well enough to get to the finish line in time. This alone makes TrackMania one of the most well-designed, perfectly fair, violently rage-inducing,I WANT TO KICK A BABY-tier games you'll ever play. It's great, trust me.Coming from somebody that's put almost 100 hours into TrackMania United in less than 2 months (on a crappy laptop) I can confirm that TrackMania 2 on it's lowest settings will not onlylookbetter but alsorunbetter. The performance is buttery smooth and very consistent. There's plenty of singleplayer tracks, tons of mods for custom tracks, car models, skins, and total conversions (check out the F1 mod). There's also the super-popular multiplayer mode. Even if this game only has one enviornment and less game modes than TrackMania United, TrackMania 2 Stadium still has a wealth of content. Of all the enviornments, Stadium is probably the best-feeling one anyway (although Canyon is a lot of fun too). For the current price of $9.99, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing great buy. If you like it, check out some of the other enviornments too. Hopefully once Lagoon releases, we'll see a TrackMania 2 United. Until then, TM2 Staduim is a great introduction to the new generation of TrackMania."

76561198105539140,Recommended,232910,22491035,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,AkiraNarukami,"There are 2 simple components that could make the game much more manageable.1: Make tracks easier to download, and save them to the game's files without the need to take a tutorial to do so. This can be accomplished by simply the server owner ticking a ""allow download"" box, and giving us a simple ""download this track"" option.2. Make the physics engine more forgiving of mistakes committed that happen 9 times out of 10 by complete accident. Give us options to correct our angle midair, point the nose of the car downward so as to prevent bouncing off of the side of the track. The option to turn your car in midair and to correct your positioning midair would prevent SO MUCH frustration and allow the player to make more percise jumps much more easily than if they were flung off of a ramp, with the correct angle expected to be taken before gaining altitude. Excuse me if I didn't have the split-second reaction time needed to correct my angle before flying off of a ramp. It really is not my fault when I cannot correct a mistake that was made by accident.Overall, the game needs to let us download tracks easier, so we can better learn it in our off time when we are not playing multiplayer where the time limit for learning a track is not nearly long enough 90% of the time. Some of us require hours of constant practice in order to make sure that we are familiarized with a track's layout before we can start aiming for shorter and shorter completion times. Or, even better, have a practice server option so players can judge your track, practice it, and familiarize themselves with it. Secondly, all I want is to be able to correct my angle in midair. That's it. Being able to steer your car in mid air would correct so many mistakes, and would make even the toughest track layouts just a BIT more fair and manageable.Now, given my gripes so far, there are really only two issues I have with this game, despite them in my opinion, being major flaws. Everything else about this game, from the track editor, the car editor, mod support, and the sheer intensity and adrenaline rush you get when you go full speed is absolutely stunning. All I want is easier track downloads for practice, and midair correction. LITERALLY nothing else needs to be fixed."

The track is incredibly reflective for no reason, rather than being made of, you know, tarmac, and the whole thing just looks a little bit... off.Replays are totally ruined too - the camera never, ever goes to the right position, which makes editing them into what you thought was going to be a masterpiece a complete and utter waste of time.

Then I was forced to do a massive update that promised higher frame rates, lower load times and I got the exact opposite! Now the game has frame pacing issues and the user interface is broken! The load times are about 3 times longer than they used to be! Plus the stupid game barely worked after the update as it told me that there was no game after the update in which I had to restart and re sign in.EDIT: Yes this was an unfavorable review that has turned into to a favorable because these issues have now been fixed after a few more updates. The game runs as good as it looks now and there are no longer any frame pacing issues as it runs smooth as silk like before. The update actually now delivers what it initially promised which was better graphics with higher frame rates. In addition to the fixes, you now don't have to run an official race in the solo campaign to solidify a record which is a massively welcome addition to the game and one that should have been done a long time ago. You used to have to practice for 5 minutes then choose to do an official run in order to set a record. If you didn't happen to race very well you were forced to practice again for 5 minutes until you could go for a record again which was maddening especially if you did well in practice and then F'ed up the official run. Now every run can set a record."

,Recommended,232910,7787882,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,TomZeBomb,"People don't like change, which is why a lot of people are rating negatively on this game.Really, they are only reacting to the menu changes, and I think the new menu looks fine. Maybe change the background to be a looping video instead of a static background for it to not be as stale, and it's all good for me.Most importantly in this new update, are the new blocks that you can play with in the editor. You can also create custom blocks as well WITHIN THE GAME, and that is pretty rad right there. I haven't figured out how to use it yet, as it is confusing as hell, but it seems to be a really powerful tool that map creators will take use of well.Other than block additions and menu layout changes, the game is the same as it was a year ago. Fun, fast paced racing action with twitch reactions that determine good times from the bad times. Online isn't as strong as it was before (probably because I live in the US and we don't have $h1t for filled servers), but the game is still fun.If you are new and looking at this game, and are feeling discouraged from all the negative reviews, don't. Buy the game, play it, and if you don't like it, return it. It's that easy. However, I say that since this is a pretty baller game, keep it.
