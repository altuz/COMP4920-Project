When you build a bridge meant for cars you don't expect a 100 ton train to cross it suddenly.  The draw bridges are also TERRIBLE.  Everytime the bridge ""draws"" it always breaks somewhere."

I have played bridge simulator games since the original Bridge Builder and I can say that there were some major design flaws particularly in controls, but you can overcome that; and there are a lot of bugs/inconsistencies, at least compared to older games like ""Bridge It!"".I really hope that developers will improve the game experience, but until then this game cannot be compared to Bridge Builder and Pontifex, since it's obviously in their genre. The only thing that is good in that case is graphics, but in my experience ""Bridge It!"" looked much nicer."

The UI is poor -- you can't move  joints, connections aren't always made properly (so the roadway just falls through the bridge), and sometimes a member is under great stress for no reason.   There's no data provided on the materials, and the stress feedback only shows some form of accumulated stress -- no directions, no % remaining.In short, this is a puzzle game, not an engineering game."

Ultimately this is another example of a good concept, poorly executed. You might surmise (from the awesome looking screenshot) that you would be building epic bridges spanning huge chasms with a wealth of materials at your disposal so you can build a bridge your way. No. What you actually get is a series of extremely similar small levels that require you to build a bridge out of the limited materials given (pretty much ruining any hopes you might have for grand designs). The controls are flawed and the similarity of the levels and the crappy physics engine mean 9 times out of 10 the correct solution to finish the level is to build the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing bridge, varied only by the material used in its construction and whether most of the support goes on the left or the right hand side. It's stale, boring and unimaginative when it could easily have been so much more. In other words, a typical German simulator cobbled together for the bargain bins of the world's game stores."

,Recommended,232950,12799343,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Kilppari,"First time I encountered a bridge building game was back in the time when Pontifex and later Bridge Construction Set came out. Messing with physics was intriguing even though the game stressed out my old hardware beyond its limits. Looong did I hope that a modern version of such game would appear and there Bridge Project hit the target. After all, it's the same developer. They've gone up with the size from 32 MB (Pontifex) to 511 MB (Bridge Project). New maps to play, more decent graphics, perhaps a bit more casual feel to it but still, the essense is there.The basic interface is simple. Select the material to use, click on a joint and draw the piece where you want it to be. Simple mode helps you out quite a lot adding blocks, mirroring blocks and adding cross beams to support the structure. You can get far with it and be happy to see how the vehicles cross your newly built bridge.However, the most facinating part of the game is to scrap the simple mode and go expert. How far can you strip down the bridge and make it withstand the stress from the vehicles without it falling apart? To build a bridge with least number of elements, as light as possible, and with lowest budget is where you compete with yourself and globally with other players. The game has in-built global leaderboards where you can check out how well the best ones have done it.And this is where the interface gets in the way of the fun. You use the mouse to control pretty much everything (in addition to some keyboard shortcut keys). The left mouse button is for selecting and building, the middle button lets you dolly the camera, zoom works with mouse scroll, and the right button is for turning the camera and selecting the items for deletion.Unfortunately the last one simply doesn't seem to have any logic to it. The mouse pointer, humangous arrow, seems to be little off at all times. And despite of which item is highlighted on screen when mouse pointer is on it, the right click either selects another item or it simply turns the camera! Why?!? Why can't I select an item with LMB and then hit delete key from keyboard? That's how every other software works. No, here you need to find a specific spot of an item somewhere and then right click on it and select delete option. More often than not I was unable to find the correct spot and I ended up restarting the map instead. The cables seemed to be the worst. Using the separate select mode makes selection much easier and then even the delete key works. But why is it a separate mode? Fortunately space bar is the shortcut.The game is fun and it'll keep me playing it trying to best myself over and over again. If you're into semi-realistic physics simulation and construction then you probably will like the game. However, if you're easily irritated by cloggy interface then I'd recommend testing the game before purchase. Chronic Logic offers a free demo on their website with limited number of maps to try it out."

Control of the contruction process is very unfriendly and not fun at all. Most of the time, the game does not respond to what you are telling it to do. For example, if you want to delete a bridge deck, you do not hover your mouse on the bridge deck but a square away from the bridge deck. Then when you right click to delete, nothing happens. So you try, and try again, then finally the delete option comes up.Biggest waste of $10 I have ever spent. I will never spend another dime on this developer. They need to hire less physics geeks and more interface, human factors designers.\Absolute garbage."

Despite the more attractive graphics, the interface is clumsy and difficult to use, and the simulations even less accurate. Most of the time you end up with a failing bridge with absolutely no indication as to why. The stress analysis doesn’t really show anything, leaving you almost completely guessing as to how the bridge needs to be constructed. The math behind the simulations seems to be badly flawed, but it's difficult to say becuase it doesn't display stresses at all well. All in all, even though Bridge Constructor has it’s faults, it’s the better game. Go buy that instead."

This is a fun game to play when you’re bored or have some spare time and is more in depth and realistic than the free flash games. The first levels are easy and help teach basic controls but the later levels will offer difficulty and will challenge you. The only bad part is the game never really teaches you all the controls and it takes a while to learn how to use some of the more advanced one which you need to beat later levels which can cause frustration

This one, however, is a complete dud. This game lacks any polish or depth whatsoever. Every asset in this game is completely stock, from the creaking of the bridges to the fake cheering played whenever you complete a hideously easy level. The physics are complete wank, and some of the building materials are weird to get the hang of. I attempted to use suspension cables on a bridge only to have it immediately collapse, at which point I just used regular old wood and beat the level just fine. Steer clear of this, even when it's on sale and especially at full price. Go instead for literally any other bridge game on the market."

It doesn't take any real engineering knowlege to get through the levels, or at least not anything you can't look up easily. The game is ok, and feels like something I'd play on my tablet in between classes to kill time. It has no tutorial, and no manual leaving you to figure out things for yourself which is fine most of the time, except when it comes to one or two things like using pistons. Figuring out those can be frustrating. The most irritatiing part of the game is when the materials are so restricted that it forces you to play ""what was the level designer thinking"" instead of what would actually be the best solution. If the price dropped to 1 dollar I'd recommend it, if you're into games like this. Otherwise forget it."

I decided that I'd get it. It might be an entertaining puzzle game. Long answer short: it wasn't.It isn't very entertaining. I mean, I guess it is what it says it is, but there isn't enough to it. There should be more creativity and imagination involved. There really isn't any. I was hoping that I would be able to build these large fancy bridges, but you only make simple ones.The look of this game is only okay. The graphics look quite dated. It's not terrible, but it certainly isn't good. I'm also disappointed that it wasn't more entertaining to watch your bridge break. Instead, the pieces just detach and fall. There's no breaking apart, splintering, cracking, or whatever. All things considered, rather boring.The controls are not the greatest either. Placing pieces is not very smooth. It feels like I'm playing an old game. Also, deleting a single piece is a pain. You right-click the piece to bring up the options for that piece (including deleting it), but most of the time, that menu doesn't show up.My final complaint is the sound. First of all, the soundtrack sucks. I turned it off soon after I started the game. As for the other in-game sound, it sounds like I'm playing a game that's 20 years old. I'm not a game designer, but I'm pretty sure it is not that hard to have higher quality sounds for a game like this (which essentially consist of bridge-breaking noises, car horns, and annoying cheering). That reminds me, why did you find it necessary to add that stupid cheering after a car makes it across the bridge? This isn't a pre-school computer program.Also, where is this workshop that it mentions? That was one of the reasons I got this. So that was also a disappointment. People probably could've added some interesting things to this game, but whatever.Summary: This game is boring. There isn't enough creativity involved. The visuals are dated. The controls are not smooth enough when they work. The sound quality is awful. Overall, I would not even think about paying $20 for it. This game seems like it should be $5 dollars. The original price gave me a higher expectation, which it definitely did not come close to meeting."

What hurts this game is the inconsistant physics engine coupled with the 'slamming on' when the testing scenerio begins.  The bridges never yield the same results after testing.  Conditions are always the same, results should BE the same.  Draw bridges a lot of times stick together when they should cleary be separiting.   I'm not a big fan of winning games by chance; winning some scenerios means just retesting and the bridge will hold second or third try.  On the positive side, it is pretty cool to see basic construction physic in play and the challenge of getting  the bridge to span the gap.  Plenty of room for improvment.  It would be nice to see additional scenerios added to the game now that I've played them all."

While the core mechanics remain the same as the simple 2d vector game from 15 years ago, there's a lot to be said for continuing the core mechanic but making the extra materials and 3d editing relatively easy.  There's a simple joy in creating the cheapest (and pretty much most unsafe) bridge you possibly can that holds up (or not).  Oh, and there's draw bridges!"

What works once may not work again even on the same map.Graphics = horrible and somehow even on the lowest settings and in the smallest resolution window I still struggle to play this game on my AMD quad-core (@ 3.2GHz) with 8 GB ram. Sometimes the game just stops responding too and it doesn't always save what maps I've completed.tl;dr this game is garbage

You are given resources and a gap to bridge and it is up to you how you design the bridge.

It isn't a fast paced game, but it is stimulating for people who like a challenge."

The ""free"" camera for looking around is still limited mostly to the bridges profile and pretty useless.  Even setting the game speed to maximum for testing your construction, it still takes almost a minute for the different waves of cars, busses, tanks, and trains to simulate.  Very frustrating when the construction fails on the last round and you have to wait.The only thing new to bridge construction games this offers is being tested by wind storms and earthquakes.  Not worth $20, if you really want to try it, wait until it's on sale for no more than $5."

,Recommended,232950,20165952,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,hitsman4u,This game will keep somebody occupied for quite a lengthy time though at no point have I come across anything within it that is as extensive and spectacular as the illustration to the right implies! The only down side I encountered is that the user interface can be frustrating at times particularly when you need to delete bridge components during construction. On occasions it took a number of attempts to highlight the offending components in order to remove them and on others it was hard to position the parts correctly within the construction grid. A number of sceneries (maps) are available for you to build within and bridges need to be able to withstand cars buses trains and even tanks in order for them to be fit for purpose. There is no sandbox / free play mode within which you would be able to test your own designs and creations (contraptions!) So my final verdict on this one has to be a 4/5 as the user interface factor can at times be very frustrating but the rest of the game is fine.

Additionally to the reasons from the other reviews there is a simple reason why this game just doesnt deserve to be neither played nor bought: it makes rounding errors as soon as you build structures not completly horizontally, That leads to situations where you can build an arch when starting from both sides and meeting in the center, but dont have enough material if you build it from one side to the other. Ridiculous and an insult to the gaming world."
,Not Recommended,232950,4920402,"Posted: 24 June, 2013",all,Icetrips,"Great idea but this game is a really bad implementation of this idea. There is no instruction at all - you don't know how materials work or what is the difference between them. Google become your best friend. After that when you try to build a bridge, the interface is so bad. Always need to switch between Normal mode and Expert mode for remove errors that normal mode insert. Always need switch front and back for remove errors. And the gameplay is bad too. I can reply the same scenario several time and every time I'll have a different outcome. A new game on your ""Do not play list""."

Every one I can find lacks some random bits of Chronic Logic's defining games. The physics of this one just aren't up to par.But the same holds true for Chronic Logic's own games; after their first two, instead of just increasing and refining features, each new game gains some while losing others. What the world? You'd think at least within one developer studio they could manage to not have noticable regressions, or at least make each subsequent game a clear improvement.I'm still searching to the One True Successor to Pontifex (which is a true successor of Bridge Builder Game). Halycon Media, I still hope you'll make one that's more about physics simulation and flexible construction tools. Fancy graphics are nice, but it's the underlying simulation that provides the replay value."
