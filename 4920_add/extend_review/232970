,Recommended,232970,11698611,"Posted: 14 August, 2014",all,Not One Of Us,"Going into Thunder Wolves, I was expecting an arcadey Desert/Jungle Strike.  What I got was what Desert/Jungle Strike would've been if they were madeforan actual arcade.The game is played loose, with the core focus being shooting and blowing up as many enemies as quickly as you can - chopper control being simple and extremely responsive.  Machine gun ammo is infinite and the weapon has no cooldown, while the various missle types you can use recharge rather quickly, and you can switch between the types while waiting for one to restock.The graphics are kept simple and clean - really something you'd've seen in an arcade from the late 90s/early 00s, only with a bit more polygons.  These visuals work perfectly for such a straightforward game, giving you a clear and quick understanding of the immediate area to focus on what to shoot and what not to shoot (most the time what to shoot).  Additionally, a good amount of the buildings and whatnot are destructable, adding to the fun of just blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up for the hell of it.As for the sound, well, it's satisfying. Things go boom, and they sound like they go boom.  The music is fitting hard rock.  The voice acting, taking itself as seriously as a self-aware 80s action film, is perfect.The only negatives I could say is that, while the music and sound settings are seperately adjustable, the voice overs are attached to the sound control, and at times the action can really drown out the characters' speech.  I could also say the game's a bit on the short side (about four hours for my first playthrough), but for ten bucks, hard to complain - and if it's still too much, you know there's always the seasonal Steam sales.I recommend playing this on Expert.  Going through Normal was too easy; six missions in wondering if I could even be killed.  Expert provides an actual challenge, making the game more intense.While this would've been perfect for the arcades toward the end of their golden days, it's still a great time on PC."

There seems to be an ancient, anarchistic urge, deeply anchored in our genes, rewarding us with pleasure, whenever we kill or destroy things, especially when we exaggerate excessively in doing so. 'Thunder Wolves' allows you to do just that - kill and enjoy. It's a helicopter combat game that feels like an arcade game from the 90s and does not take itself seriously. It's trashy, loud and enjoyable. This is a game to play at the end of a long day when you just want to blow something up!Pros:- it's fun- fantastic voice acting- varied campaign levels- nine different helicopters- different type of rockets- plenty of enemies- different environments- side missions- local co-op where one player is the pilot and the other is the gunner- good story- lots of explosionsCons:- graphics could be better- not the most polished game"
,Recommended,232970,21166230,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,RockstarCRO,"I will recommend this game but with MUCH CAUTION. If you're looking for a helicopter combat simulator this isn't it. If you're looking for an action packed, things exploding and cowboy dialogue this is it. The extreme plus side to this is the game is relatively cheap on sale. Still though, I know a few people that would rather keep two bucks than spend it.Thunder Wolves caught my eye as I used to play Urban Strike relentlessly on Sega Genesis. I came in hoping for a reboot and got something a little different. Is this difference bad or good? Depending on what you like will guide your decision. Thunder Wolves is a game in which you are given control of a helicopter and usually have to blow a lot of things up. There are extraction missions and escort missions but all involve over the top violence. There are cameo's in a sense where you get to control a sniper, a guided missile and even a tank. I should add here that the game is indeed LOCAL CO-OP! If you do end up playing two players, one player will be the gunner where another player. You eachDO NOTget your own respective helicopter. This would have been awesome if it was the case.Having the campaign add these little tweaks in where you have a different sense of control adds a bit of variables to the game regarding it's enjoyment. There is a point where even the devs realized that simply blowing everything up may get boring. The explosions themselves aren't bad. I wish there was a little bit more boom especially when unleashing loads of missile. There is enough destruction though to keep you hyper stimulated. At first, the player is given a single helicopter with not too many options to choose from. As you progress throughout the game, different skins and different helicopters will be available later on. You cannot customize exactly what weapons the helicopter will use. Instead, each helicopter will have a different set of skill. Some helicopters will have guided missiles and be able to launch about 10 missiles at one time whereas another helicopter may have rapid fire missiles and can call in an air strike. The controls themselves are probably the best feature of the game. Whether it's how the helicopter moves, how it reacts to inertia when it begins/stops movement or whether it's fairly easy to control makes it absolutely enjoyable.You definitely don't have to be a professional helicopter pilot to play this game. They've also added a boost feature which is extremely useful in tight situations or in traveling to another location on the map. Careful though, not all helicopters have the same boost ability. A counter ability feature on all helicopters (by pressing ""X"") will release flares to misguide homing missiles.All helicopters have the basic ability of machine gun (""RT"") while ""RB"" will handle most of the missile weapons. You can move your helicopter along the Z axis (meaning up and down) but you cannot control a hoist upon your discretion. It would have been cool to have complete control over this and maybe even pick up a few enemies to take them for a ride.The visuals themselves can be boosted to max performance and do look like xbox 360 graphics. This is okay but the next gen feel is definitely not here (which is ok). To make up for this, there are a lot of explosive animations. The animation concerning the demolition of buildings is decent. I wish you could level them to the ground but you can't. At least you can do some damage! Which is also a little weird is that in one level where you drive a tank, the tank treads don't move. Weird eh? The sounds overall are okay and they tried varying the gun sounds as well as the explosions. They seem like they took their dialogue seriously as you'll have some good old 'Murican F-bombs dropping regularly. So if you don't like swearing, beware!Overall, this is AT BEST a decent game. For the price it's worth, I think it's a fair asking price (especially on sale)!RATING : 7.0/10GameplayB-Story / CampaignB-Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+ScreenShots :I was eventually allowed to take this crane downHelicopter blow up?

76561198016739532,Recommended,232970,12738075,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Chaser Zulu,"An all around awesome arcade game!  Good engaging storyline, variable gameplay with multiple weapon systems including several types of helos, a remote helo, C-130 gunner, helicopter sniper and missile guidance via camera view.  The dialogue is a bit goofy, but it works for what this game is:  a quick paced heli shooter flying game.  The player flies for a PMC (private military contractor).  Combined with the crazy shooting and dodging action, this makes this game stand out as you're not another military pilot with special privileges by virtue of being you.  The designers open up the opportunities with storyline, colorful characters and helicopter skins by putting the player as a flyer for a PMC.  I can't help but think of the movie Expendables when I think of this game.If I can add two things for improvement:  game control and engaging characters.  I get that this is a fast pace arcade style game, but at the same time, it's a bit over the top with all the shooting/dodging, but yet very little aim is required.  I'm not saying this game should be a Jane's Longbow game.  You should however play this game to win, not win by merely playing.  While I flew all missions on normal, I died a grand total of one time.  While you also get to fly different helicopters, there's no different feel to it.  I can't see the advanatage of taking a Little Bird vs. a Blackhawk (though in the game, they are under different names).  While they have their different categories, I apparently can take a Blackhawk for a job better suited for an Apache.  Weapons on the helo are also the same, regardless of air frame.  The machine gun sounds and looks the same while the missiles the player launches are bright smoke trailing fire streaks.  I will say the flare graphics and game mechanics are nicely done.  Flares work and look cool in the game.Second is the engaging characters idea.  While the players are colorful and comical, they aren't as engaging as the Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction Characters.  Players simply follow along with the characters as their dialogue helps put the details of the storyline together.  Perhaps if players had the ability to choose the pilots they fly with; they would have more of a vested interest to engage with these characters.Bottom line, I do like this game and am happy with this purchase!  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this game a solid 7."

Do you remember ace combat assault horizon? The arcade style of helicopter driving is really close. The plot is quite good, some characters have a strong personality, the framerate is rock-solid (60 FPS), the gameplay is good, and it's freaking fun. I recommend this title if you're looking for a crazy arcade shooter, better if in sale (at full price is quite short). Let's see pro and cons.PRO:+ Arcade and frenetic action is really fun!+ Framerate is solid (60 FPS)+ Controller and Mouse/Keyboard input mode+ Local coop+ Achievements aren't very easy to get+ Quite good plot+ Metal music during destruction is awesome+ Some characters are well created+ The photography department did an awesome job! Locations are good!CONS:- In 3h or less you will finish the game- Graphics aren't awesome, animations neither- Sometimes airstrike doesn't shoot (very bad. it's hard to reload!)- All helicopters look the same, lack of customization- Except 4 big families, weapons are all the same (tiny difference)- I couldn't play it with my old laptop, it crashes after 5min (with my desktop is fine)- Repetitive: shoot, shoot, take an object, shoot, shoot, take and object, shoot, ...- AC-130, tank, machine guns, sniper, refuel, etc they all look near the same to use (even sniper looks like shooting missles!)- Do change some key bindings: change guns with q/e and increase/decrease the altitude with shift/ctrl (is much better!)I recommend this game only because I took it on sales, and because it's fun as hell!

There are also a few secrets to nab as well, (crates to grab, and a special guy {Pedroz} to kill on every level)(also there are some pop-culture, and historical referrences if you look around the levels)Not a long game, and local co-op is all but unplayable due to the mapping of the 360 controller being horrible off, and you can't do anything about it.

In my case that's a good thing because I rather enjoyed those games WAY back when.  Thunder Wolves seems like a modern take on those games which brings modern graphics and an updated video game engine to the table.  The POV is a bit more zoomed in than I remember but still a nice tip of the hat to them old EA games.Essentially you're flying a helicopter around rescuing people and accomplishing tasks... all while blowing up enemies and oposing defenses.  Movement and control was fine once I stopped using a gamepad and went to the WSAD keyboard control.  The gamepad options don't allow for your own configuration.  It only has preset gamepad configurations to choose from and I couldn't get used to any of them.  Once I went to WSAD, I played with no issues and is actually more comfortable than you'd think.This is a fun game if you like strafing over the landscape blowing everything up along the way (which I do).  The story line isn't bad and the adult language was right up my alley.  Buy it on sale."

Over-the-top style takes the front seat and you'll find yourself mashing the trigger while flying in crazy circles and getting shot from every direction.It's not a simulation game by any stretch of the imagination. You can get hit by dozens of tracking AA missiles and stay in the air. Each mission includes pumping rock and roll and dialogue consists mostly of the pilots exchanging witty quips. Each helicopter comes with three rocket varieties and different handling characteristics. Sometimes you'll also find yourself gunning from things besides helicopters for small sections in the story missions too.At 13 levels, it's not a long game, but if you're in the mood for a fast-flying, rocket-thumping, rock-blaring, lighthearted slugfest, it really shines."
,Recommended,232970,9964462,"Posted: 28 April, 2014",all,Rip,"Thunder Wolves... wow. So I went into this game the same way I went into watching the movies ""Taken"" and ""Edge of Darkness"". I was thinking ""Eh, looks like good mindless action. If nothing else I can watch stuff blow up for a little while"".But just like those movies, I was actually extremely surprised! Playing Thunder Wolves gives you the same feeling as watching ""The Expendables"" or playing the game ""Broforce"". Basically:""F**K YEAH! *EXPLOSION NOISES*""Thunder Wolves is an arcadey helicopter action game, obviously. It's fairly tongue-in-cheek and doesn't take itself too seriously (""Hmm, a region of the world full of conflict starting with the word 'Middle'... I wonder where THAT could be??"") As you swoop around, blowing up wave after wave of faceless, stereotypical enemies of freedom, you get point bonuses for chain kills and group kills. Messages like ""IT'S ALL YOU BRO!"" and ""YOU A BADASS!"" splash across the screen, all while heavy metal guitar solos play in the background. Good stress relief in Thunder Wolves!From watching gameplay, you'd think it's fairly repetitive. But you'd be wrong. You have a decent selection of different choppers to grind enemies with, with a fair variety in weaponry. Notice I use the terms ""decent"" and ""fair"". It's not off-the-wall or even above average, but it's not bad either. Adding to the variety are some unique segments. For example, there are parts where you snipe sentries from the side door of your chopper with a rifle and a segment where you actually get to gun for an AC-130 Gunship. In fact, at one point in the campaign, you are actually shot down, and you have to hold off enemies with the door gun until rescue arrives. So the variety in each level comes as a pleasant surprise!Overall, at it's absolute worse, it's you blowing stuff up to heavy metal. Who doesn't like that?"

,Recommended,232970,25386982,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,eXcruciate,"Found out the game has no mouse aim if you are using a Razer mouse without Synapse installed. For me, anyway. I suppose that's the problem anyway since it works now after reinstalling Synapse which I had to do to fix a keyboard lighting problem. I noticed this game was still installed so I thought I would try it again and now it has mouse aim. I really don't want Synapse installed because it sucks, and despite my keyboard having a few keys not lighting correctly, I would just uninstall Synapse again were it not for this game, and surely will when I am done with this game. Why does this game need it and no other does? Who knows, who cares.Controls:K&M are floaty but things die easily and don't need precise aim, plus you can sorta lock on to other choppers so it is certainly serviceable. I would play the game with my xbox 360 pad but it has some of the worst floaty controls I have ever seen with a gamepad, so bad that it was nearly impossible to kill the first enemy in the tutorial, so the option to use my controller is out without question.Game:The game is pretty decent across the board. Heavy metal blaring while blowing things up can be fun for a while. It has some of the worst writing and worst dialogue delivery I have ever heard in a game. When anyone says anything it feels like what you would hear if you could listen in on two fifth graders playing a action game in their room together. Not to mention the totally misplaced cursing feels forced and cringy and is just awkward. It's almost as bad as the insanely misplaced cursing in the game Styx.Technical:The game functions enough to be worth a once-through for a few dollars on sale and is actually pretty fun for a little while. I have had one crash though at the end of mission 3 during the cutscene but luckily upon reloading the game it started me at mission 4.7/10 Decent. But with so many other better titles I am currently playing through, I may finish it, I may not. Probably some day."

Not going to win any awards for dialogue or story, but it compensates with some good action, infinite ammo, and a lot of stuff to blow up.The controllers are fairly simple and straight forward. The voice acting was decent and the dialogue had me laughing quite a bit, and reminding me of some of the 80s action movies I used to watch back in the day. Also, raining death from above and having the ability to destroy pretty much anything man made actually made me forget a few times to follow the mission objectives. Parts where you switch to the machine gun and sniper rifle were also well as well.Perhaps my only complaint with this game was the missiles being a little good at tracking you even after you drop flares. The sniping sections were also a little tricky to aim, but they give you a big enough hit box as to make it forgiving.Overall, I definetely would recommend this game. If you like flying choppers, cheesy old action movies, and raining death and destruction, this one is for you."

When I finally did I was not dissapointed.  Thunder Wolves is a pretty damn neat, fast-paced, helicopter shoot-em-up with absolutely non-stop action, a variety of helicopters to use (each differing in classes; support, assault, etc.,) and skins to outfit the helicopters with.  You are a member of a private military group known as the Thunder Wolves and the story follows them on their adventures ranging from the years 1983-1991.Pros:- Genuinely fun, reminds you how entertaining simply blowing things up can be.- There are sequences where the gameplay changes from the standard flying the helicopter to, in example, piloting a heli drone, using an AA gun to fend off bombers, or on-rail sequences where you are the gunner of an assault helicopter.  These keep the game from getting too stale.- The game in general can be very funny at times.Cons:- I never paid too much attention to specs of helicopters when choosing which one to take on a mission.  They do not seem to play too much of an important role besides maybe one helicopter having a different missile type then another.- After a while the missions do get linear, the gameplay sequences mentioned above kind of dull the pain of doing the same thing over and over.- The story can be hard to follow, at least it was for me.  Mission objectives are clear but why you're even doing it may not be so clear.Overall, I had a lot of fun and it was worth the playthrough.  I give it a solid 8/10."

Enjoy :)Thunder Wolves is one of those games that every casual player should play. It's full of action, humour and of course explosions!Thunder Wolves is developed by Most Wanted Entertainment and originally published by bitComposer Games but now published by Nordic Games, even though the game's opening starts with the original publisher's logo. What a confusing world of publishers we live in...Thunder Wolves is a sort of top down 3D action shooter game where the game's missions are split up into 13 missions each with they're own set of difficulties which are; Casual, Normal and Hard. The Casual difficulty is the easiest mode from the wholeYou control a helicopter where you can move in 360 via the WASD keys, simple enough. You shoot with the LMB and fire missiles with the RMB and you shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of enemies. The story is pretty simple, the game takes place in the Middle East in 1991 and some flashbacks to Central Asia from the 1980'sThe graphics aren't the best, you won't see people in this game. The very few people you see they look like from the early days on PC gaming, the graphics in the environment aren't bad but the close ups look a bit bad, but it didn't really bother me. Some animations are pretty poor but not that badThe voice acting at first may be bad to some people but the voice acting is deliberatly set for the 90's cheesy style of voice acting. The length of the game is ridiculously short, clocking in at around 2-3 hours just playing in normal difficulty! So overall if you played all the difficulties with the same missions it would clock in at around 8-9 hours, not the best. The game does also offer Local Co-op, but I have no friends...Overall, Thunder Wolves is a fun game to play and it is a fun game for casual players who would like to play a short game for the reasonably pricing. Thunder Wolves is one hell of a ride!RECOMMENDED :)"

Not to the point where I need devices to assist my daily functions old; but I am old to the point where I listen to music that people born in the ’90s can’t seem to easily identify. This means that I played a lot of video games that would fall under similar circumstances. NES, Genesis, and Super Nintendo were definitely the main sources of my entertainment in my developmental years, and I still take the time to indulge them. This is particularly true of my Genesis which gets a month tour of duty thanks to a couple of great games that I never seem to grow tired of, no matter how old I get. Those two games are Jungle Strike, and Desert Strike. Suffice to say, Thunder Wolves grabbed my attention from the moment I caught wind of its existence via Steam, if only because of its similarity to those two games.Thunder Wolves is fairly straight forward, and doesn’t pull any punches. You pilot a helicopter and you will be blowing lots of things up. From the outset, things are pretty sharp. The controls feel tight, responsive, and are plenty easy to learn; and the game itself is sharp looking, with a great art style, and powerful little engine. Much like most retro titles, Thunder Wolves is built around completing levels at different difficulties. While there is no reward beyond an in game accolade, and a placing on an online leader board, it is still pretty cool to see old gameplay mechanics like this. In this way you can see that the meat of the game isn’t in revolutionizing anything, it is just going to try to deliver it’s experience better than others. In that regard the game completely succeeds, and sometimes this is in spite of itself.The levels themselves are superbly designed for the most part. You will be given a clear objective, and oftentimes be given a specific amount of time to complete it. The levels allow for smooth navigation to these markers, and give you a decent sense of verticality to be able to take accurate stock of any situation. Decent being the operative word here though; the vertical ceiling seems to vary from level to level, and isn’t always as high as one would think. There gets a point when you would want to just get a few feet higher, and find that you’re unable to because of a level ceiling. This may seem like minutia, but it does become something that undermines the experience at certain points. Especially in tight dogfights with other helicopters where you could benefit from zipping over them, and the spinning around to dish out death.The complaints of height limits aside, the other elements of the levels are all in place, and work to tremendous effect. You have a bevy of helicopters that will unlock as you continue to complete levels; and each helicopter has their own unique weapons and capability. Destructible environments, and a range of enemy infantry types, and vehicles all keep you on your toes and changing up your tactics. Dealing with certain land vehicles will obviously be a different experience than taking on an enemy chopper in the sky, and it is nice to see the game reflect that in the different strategies that you will consistently need to employ to deal with all of them.In fact the game does a remarkable job of handling in-game monotony in a general way. While Thunder Wolves could probably get away with being a one trick shoot ’em up, and not wear out its welcome, it isn’t content with that. So the game will have you performing escort missions, defense missions, straight out attacks, and quite a few surprisingly good on-rails sequences. Thunder Wolves addresses the problem of gameplay fatigue in a way that a lot of larger developers completely miss, in a way that frankly surprised and blew me away. Of particular note is a sitting turret sequence that takes place inside your crashed chopper, where you’re using one of the side guns as a mounted turret. That type of creativity within the context and framework of the game is pretty smart and agile.Thunder Wolves is a game that knows what it wants to be, and cuts through any of the other filler to give an experience that is as pure as possible. Plenty of games miss this, like missing the forest for the trees. Solid mechanics with superb delivery will always produce a quality game, no matter the scale or the budget. By focusing on what makes flying a helicopter fun, and making that a varied and rich experience, the crew behind Thunder Wolves have not only created a great game, but a great blueprint for other developers to follow when they think about working on their own helicopter projects. Just please, fix the vertical ceiling and ditch the cheesy nu-metal soundtrack.Version Reviewed: PC"
