(you can't freeze time and put some turrets)- You can speed up the time (x2), but if you do that the turrets will be less effective!- There is no minimap and you can't zoom-out to see the whole map.- You can't change the targeting priority of your turrets.- The interface is failed ! It was designed to play with a controller, which is cool for people playing on consoles, but isn't effective with a mouse and a keyboard.- The first half of the campaign is boring : no difficulty, no mazing, no original turrets. Fortunately, in the second half, you gain acces to more interesting turrets, you can start mazing and levels become challenging.- There is no other game modes, just the campaign.The level transformation idea is interesting, though it isn't used a lot. The graphics are good and I like the mecha-style of the turrets.The game isn't entirely bad, but it contains a lot of frustrating things. Buy it only on big sale, prefer Defense Grid or Defenders Quest."

The art style, the interface, the icons. Everything. This is like the shameless copy-catting you see on iOS, where they try to confuse the customer into buying the wrong game.

If you are looking for a nice TD, just go for anotherone, there are so many good TD´s out there (Defense Grid for example).Graphics (4/10):Not really that impressive. Considering this is a PC version, it has crappy animations, the framerate is just taken over from the android version and overall it could have been much better.Design (2/10):As this is a TD, especially the leveldesign. It´s just.... aweful. They tried to copy what DG did right, a mix between maze and standart. I hope you already know: they failed. The first levels are actually ok, but as they get bigger comes a confusing layout. That doesn´t change with the ""blockers"" standing on each map (things the enemies will stop at and attack till it´s gone).For the overall design: The enemies are nicely diversified which doesn´t count for the towers. If a tower is level 1 or 2, you will not see it.Gameplay (7/20):You can upgrade your towers, so thats a plus. But what else? You always have to place your towers on the exact spot it was supposed to stand in order to block the enemies path. How strategy is that. After the first level, the fun is just gone. It gets repetitiv really quick as you don´t get any new useful stuff. The real killer are the blockers tho. Having to build towers which you than have to sell later is just stupid.You also don´t need to adjust any towers to the enemies spawing as they nearly all do the same thing.Controls (4/5):Works overall. Sometimes the camera pans a bit strange but thats ok. Annoying is the zoom tho. You will never use it. You don´t need to, but it´s really bad.Innovation (2/5):Copies DG, every tower has already been seen in other games and there are no new enemy types to speak of.Tho you have a upgrade system of each tower and the blockers are (even tho really bad) new as well."

Tower Defense games are one of my favorite  arcade/indie genres.  I'm quite pleased with this one even if it doesn't  offer up anything new apart from the crystals that enable you to occassionally reveal  the most  optimal placement of turrets or the luck based card system that offer enduring bonuses such as reduced build costs.  Sadly   these crystals  take an age to  save enough to use effectively.If you're new to TD games, I'd give this one a miss at least until its on sale as it can be quite   hard to win once you've passed the first  several levels.

There's little introduction or explanation to gameplay concepts. For example, the 4th level introduces its first weather effect, except it doesn't really tell you when this is happening, or what its effect is. You have to go out of your way to find such simple things.You know what other amazing feature it possesses? Enemies drop a cube of additional resources upon death, which you are required to hover your mouse over to collect. Maps become several screens large even from the first level, so if you create a few killzones, you have to constantly cycle between them to scavenge your rewards. It's kind of ludicrous in a terrible way, honestly.I would best describe Defense Technica as a half-hearted mash-up of Defense Grid (in look, feel, and mechanisms [you quickly acquire what is essentially the orbital laser, towers pop out of the ground in little boxes, etc]) and Kingdom Rush (towers are limited, but gain upgrade paths). Maybe somewhere in there is a kernal of a good idea, but it's not easily accessable, and it's hugely unpolished.Sadly, this is a purchase I regret."

But you should be warned that some of the stages are really hard to beat. This can be frustrating, cause you have to finish a stage to unlock the next one. I personally liked that challenge, but if you don't own Defense Grid yet, I'd recommend that you get that game before buying Defense Technica, cause Defense Grid is a bit easier and the better game over all.The graphics in Defense Technica are really nice in my opinion. The tower upgrade system is a lot of fun. To have more than one core that is attacked by the enemies is also a great idea. Another nice feature: Some of the stages change during play (for example an area with another core that is under water at first becomes accessible after a while)."

There aren't certain super powered tower in this game, it depends on what enemy's type(s) gonna hit you next (light-bio,light-mecha etc). Mazing options are quite puzzling! once you found the perfect one, you'll get a killer maze, so its not just some random-placed tower grid. Towers are quite varied and their upgrade paths are interesting and fun. Level designs are solid and seem well thought, I especially like their level-transformation concept and implementation.Control is a bit clunky at times though, also it is hard sometimes just to figured out the path of flying enemies and the lack of pause isn't making it any better.A lot of people complained but I actually spend more hours on this game, 35 hours vs  14 hours on Defense Grid, and I just finished all level on hardcore.As a fan of tower defense genre, I would recommend this game."

,Recommended,233110,20878662,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Doug,"I have played completely through this game and both Defense Grid and Defense Grid 2.  I don't think the other reviewers have played through this game entirely.  While there may be similarities between this game and the Defense Grid games, there are also very significant differences.  Since so many other reviewers are comparing the two games, I will as well.One of the biggest differences is that you can add upgrade ability to your towers between levels which carries over.  In Defense Grid there is no overarching upgrade ability.  Every level is brand new with the same vanilla towers.  The upgrades in Defense Technica can significantly change the way a tower behaves.  In Defence Grid, upgrades just increase damage and range.  For example, the basic machine gun tower can go up the machine gun path which will give it longer range and more damage against biological enemies.  Or it can become a mass driver which allows it to penetrate all enemies in a line specialized again mechanical enemies but with a much slower rate of fire.There are very distinct catagories of enemies and damage.  One type of damage is optimal for a certain type of enemy but may be very weak against another.  Defense grid has shielded and unshielded.  This game has shielded, unshielded, heavy, light, bio and mechanical.  If you specialize in one type of damage, you will become vulnerable to enemies that are resistant to it.Unlike in Defense Grid, when enemies make it to your core, they do damage.  They are not stealing cores which float back to your base.  They stay there until your core is destroyed at which point you lose the game.Also, the core itself has a couple of finite abilities.  It can do a smart bomb a few times or heal itself using ether.  Once the ether runs out, then you have no more for the rest of the level.I found the game to be enjoyable.  IMO it is tactically more challenging with the added complexity of upgrades available and the more varying enemies attacking you."

,Not Recommended,233110,10319039,"Posted: 1 June, 2014",all,Mazian,"While the game has some attributes that warrant interest, the game is ultimately hampered by a clunky UI that feels like a bad console port. Between the requirement to start over from the beginning of a level if you make a small mistake (aiming for a perfect game), the lack of ease with which towers are placed and upgraded, the absence of a game save feature (it autosaves, but you can't restart from a save, you have to always restart from the beginning so I'm not sure what value ""autosave"" has except to save your progress between levels.) and much else... Ultimately this game comes across as the scrawney adopted younger sibling to Defense Grid-- you feel absolutely no loyalty to it, and it as it cannot surpass it's older sibling you wonder (no matter how bad a person you think this might make you) if you might be able to return it from whence it came."

It is not fun to play a game that you always lose.  There is no motivation to play the game if you never win.  Waste of money in my view.Mike"
