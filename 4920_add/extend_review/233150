Yes, you're in a plane and you're shooting down planes (and boats and blimps), but what it really is frenetic aerial bullet hell chaos. But what makes Luftrausers so good, besides the action and stylized graphics, are the controls. Your plane is insanely maneuverable, able to turn on a dime, reach top speed in a moment. That level of control makes a difference.It's one thing to weave between some bullets and return fire. It's another to swoop into a dive, deftly plummet through a hail storm of bullets, take out a projectile-spewing battleship, and pull up so close that the water's surface is flared up by your thrusters.It's one thing to shoot down some planes. It's another to maneuver your enemies into a tight cluster, cut your thrusters, and shoot the planes pursuing you while your momentum carries you in the other direction. (And it helps that just activating your thrusters is so satisfying, thanks to the awesome fwhoosh sound effect)It's fast, it's hard as hell, it's addictive. The music is great. The visuals are simple, yet suit the game perfectly, displaying all the information you need to know without cluttering the onscreen spectacle. Each new part you unlock feels different, a new tool to master, Luftrausers isn't the most complex game, but it's certainly one of the most addictive and satisfying I've played in a while. I'd say it's up there with One Finger Death Punch, in terms of a simple experience that's laser focused on delivering finely tuned fun gameplay. It's the kind of game where I'm instantly restarting upon defeat, to improve my skills, complete missions, unlock new parts."

,Recommended,233150,17760207,"Posted: 28 August, 2015",all,Tom,"LUFTRAUSERS is a bullet hell airplane based game, being released on PC, PS3 and Vita in early 2014.Game play is quite simple, you are in control of a airplane and you have to take on hundreds and hundreds of other enemy fighters coming at you from all angles. This game allows your plane to fly in all 360 degrees. Your main weapon will shoot from the front of your plane, you also have to take into consideration things like gravity, stalling and drifting whilst dodging all of the oncoming enemies.  Initially the controls seem very hard to get a grasp of, but once you work out how the plane flies and how you are supposed to control it, it becomes almost second nature. I would say it took me at least an hour to get to grips with the controls.Graphically, the game has a very minimalist look to it. Whilst there is little detail gone into the planes and their silhouettes, you still feel like you are actually there in the skies shooting the planes down yourself.  They could of quite easily made this look like a many of the other flight games on Steam, I think its the graphics and art style that most people will remember this game for.There isn't really any story or plot to follow in LUFTRAUSERS. I also didn't really want one too; it's perfectly fine for a game not to have a plot I think. After all, your character can nose dive your plane into an enemy battleship, reap the rewards from it and move onto the next character without batting an eyelid.The game also has a kind of rogue-like feel to it, after each level, you are able to customize your plane with different weapons and armor, and you keep all of the updates even after you die, along with any levels and points you have earned. Eventually you'll get more powerful and be able to simply overpower some stages purely because your plane will be kitted up so much.LUFTRAUSERS is a very hard game. I have died countless times, you just need to get used to it - there is no way around it. But if you preserver through, you'll soon be able to break through that wall you have been pounding your head on for an hour and beat the challenges that are set at the start of each level.  In order for me to reach the ""end"", it took me just over five hours. For me it felt just about right as I think it would really start to get tedious if I had to keep playing.This is probably a game you will want to dip into now and then, and not do a full stint of it like me, to get maximum fun out of it, just play it for twenty minutes at a time. The game is also highly recommended you use a game pad too; I tried with keyboard and it was just horrendous to control.To sum up, LUFTRAUSERS is a nicely put together indie title with some interesting elements; bullet-hell fans will absolutely adore it, and this is really a good game to play if you have five or ten minutes to spare as no level will ever last longer than that. The price tag of £6,99 makes it an absolute bargain for anyone.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

,Recommended,233150,31909225,Posted: 22 May,all,Gungrounds Games,"An excellent feel of flight, maneuvering, and destruction - I felt as though I was a top pilot fighting through dozens of enemy airplanes. The visual style is perfect for this type of game.Each rauser consists of three main parts - weapon, body, and engine. There are five versions of each part which the player chooses freely in order to assemble their rauser. This translates to 125 combinations of planes.Each mission requires the player to use a particular loadout, which makes it fun to try out different combinations. Plane components are visually distinct and also affect the music which makes using each rauser unique.Some problems I encountered:-certain weapons require the player to take some time to understand the mechanics-steep learning curve (depending on user preference)-apart form mission completion and unlocking of components there is not a lot of unlockable content, but given that different components allow different missions, there should always be enough room to play a different mission if stuckEven though the game is short, I believe that the sheer quality justifies the high price tag. It is crucial to invest enough time to fully understand the game, and get a feel for it. If you manage that, it won’t be long before you love it forever.Vlambeer has been our major source of inspiration, and one of the reasons why we started making shooter games. I hope they will not mind, but because it is so hard to reach players these days I want to mention our newest game Rocking Pilot which is in some ways similar to Luftrausers.

There's no deep story or hero with a traumatic past here. Just you gunning down countless waves of scum who deny you the right to the skies.Here's a video giving you my first impressions of the game. Although given how short it is, you may be able to consider it a review.http://youtu.be/l1Fuvydgcp4For those of you who want a short and dirty summary, I'll break it down for you with pros and cons.+ Challenging gameplay. There isn't a point where you'll ever be bored with how easy something is.+ Great replayability. No game will ever play the same, especially when you throw in all the different plane parts into the mix.+ Lots of different playstyles. You can fly everything from a plane that spearheads through destroyers to a meaty clunker that fires a laser and poops bullets.+ Smooth, responsive gameplay. Nothing feels clunky and everything responds when you do it.+ Every shade of yellow you can find is here. Bask in its yellow glory! (Though you can change the scheme when you level up, but why?)- Extremely short. After playing 3 hours, I've practically done everything in the game.- Some of the weapons just aren't as good as others in my opinion. The homing missiles seem to have a lot of trouble hitting their target, even massive destroyers that barely move. Limiting you to 4 at a time makes it even more frustrating when they don't hit what they're supposed to. The cannon is similar, as it only allows one shot at a time, and if you miss, you have a lot of downtime between shots. And in a game as fast-paced as this, missing happens often.- Sometimes enemies just don't spawn and come after you. It makes it hard to bump up combos and get more points, allowing the more interesting enemies trying to gun you down.- Sometimes the game can be cheap and send 3 destroyers at you at a time with a few ace pilots to boot. At that point, you're just not gonna live with the amount of things on screen.All in all, I recommend you pick this game up when you want an excellent time waster. Even when it goes up to 10 dollars, it'll still be worth it. But if you don't like the fact that it is so short, feel free to wait until it goes on sale. You won't be disappointed either way."

All of the different weapons, bodies, and engines really make it so you can have a different experience each time you play. There are enough unlocks to hold your interest for quite a while and the difficulty level is low enough at the start for inexperienced players (like myself) to enjoy short fast paced games, but ramps up high enough that you can put as many hours as you want into the game perfecting it. There's even a more hardcore mode that just amps the difficulty up to 11 from the start. Good for players that want to skip the easy starting bit. The soundtrack is also awesome and totally gets you in the mood."

Like, really really short. I unlocked all plane pieces (save for 3) within 45 minutes. The 3 pieces I didn't unlock I assume you gain from destroying a Blimp, a rare and difficult enemy. Upon further research, it appears that Blimps appear randomly after a fairly easy prerequisite is reached. Some players report finding it within their first hour, some after 5. It seems like some kind of artificial lengthening to me.If this game is %50 or more, go for I guess. Full price is a bit much right now."

The patterns of enemies remain roughly the same, with the exception of boss-esque appearances.The core gameplay is phenomenal, but the lack of variety comes as huge a disappointment. What about a mission-based system, or campaign? Different missions with combinations of the enemies.

,Not Recommended,233150,9774481,"Posted: 9 April, 2014",all,William Shakesman,"Look at the video for Luftrausers, where you can have a bunch of fighters chasing your plane, cut the engines in mid air, spin around, strafe them, and zoom off in the opposite direction. Yes, Luftrausers does let you be a crazy plane badass. Sadly, that's about the only good point.The whole thing feels like an Iphone game, but brings almost enough excitement that it could qualify as a real game. Runs are short. You'll die within 5 minutes, easily. The score system is arbitrary and meaningless for the very same reason I cannot recommend the game.Beyond the fighters, every other enemy simply takes too much damage to kill. By the game you have made the five or so passes needed to kill a battleship, three more have spawned, and they will ALL be training their sights on you while you try to kill the others. And you have boats, planes, subs, and jets to deal with while you're trying to ice these. The score system relies on a chaining mechanic and every single tough enemy takes more damage to kill than it takes your chain to drop, so you can only hope to play for score by hoping the RNG throws you a bunch of suicidal popcorn fighters and jets. The big bad blimp boss of the game is a total pushover unless you have to fight it while two dozen battleships also try to nail you from below but he may as well take twice as much sustained fire as you have put out since the game started to get him to show up and fight. The enemy variety is just tedious and sucks the fun out of the game beyond that initial rush where you duplicate the preview video's cool tricks.Like an Iphone game, you can do three objectives each time to unlock parts to customize your plane and they're really the actual goal of the game as they block all the unlocks and provide you the only sort of direction you get beyond getting shot at. The plane parts are roughly 25% cool, 75% stupid, and share the same loose, uninspiring design as the basic game. Some change core mechanics in fundamental ways but they are not enough to save the game.$10 for a tight arcade experience would be a no brainer but Luftrausers just does not have that spark that makes an arcade game fun. You won't come back to it months later to revisit the fond memories. It burns out too quick and does not leave much beyond the flash... Which is a shame as a lot of love and care went into the glitz and the flash and the style of it but a little more should have went into tightening the gameplay."

It feels good to fly and shoot in this, and in general the feedback for your actions and status is good.  The choice to make this game look like military profile diagrams fighting in a newsreel makes it easy to see what's going on, but they've managed to put nice details in like the turbulence of your plane kicking up spray off the ocean.  All the parts you can customise your plane with are distinct and force different play styles.It's a solid foundation for a good game, but the scoring and enemy spawning system is screwed up and destroys any appeal to seeking high scores.  Luck will determine if you can carry a full score multiplier (and it's a big multiplier) because sometimes small planes and boats don't spawn often enough.  Sometimes four or five big, deadly planes will spawn at once and spell doom for all but a few specific plane part combos.  The game derives its longevity instead through hiding the different plane parts behind missions, many of which only ask you be persistent than skillfull (accumulate X points over however many tries it takes).  You're going to notice the game's problems well before you get the last part."

Videos might give you some idea.   I used to play the prototype flash game for hours and that was without any upgrades or any of the new stuff.  The minimal graphics are amazingly detailed, from debres and shrapnel flying from your plane and enemies, to smoke and bullets and even water dripping off after you splash down.The controls are very solid, and relay the power and abilities of the chosen engine well.  High tech engines feel snappy and powerful and the odd-job (bullet) engines feel sluggish and less responsive.  Once you learn to steer well, the game really opens up and is amazingly entertaining.Well that is until a jet screams onto your screen and smashes you into tiny pixels.I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys shooters, bullet hell, action rogue-lites.And since a friend of a friend saw on some forum that this is a free flash game, let me set the record straight.  It began life as a ULTRA simple version of the current game a long time ago. And while the prototype is still available, the full version adds missions, and level / upgrade system and many more enemies and is totally worth the few bucks.  Although the prototype will give you a basic feel of how the game plays (keyboard and mouse only I believe) the full version offers controller support.And I mean, who doesn't want to support some of the most awesome indie devs around?9/10 Anyday."

You are catapulted into the air and gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to survive. If you die it's game over, but depending on your plane you can take a number of hits, some plane types more, some less. When you stop shooting you regain health.During the course of the game you unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different engines.You can modify your plane by combining one weapon with one type of fuselage and one engine. This leads to various different plane types, some fast, some slow, some able to swim, some more agile, some more damage resistant.By killing enemies you gain points. Killing enemies in a sequence increases your multiplier. Higher multipliers mean more points.For each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, or a blimp, or killing a submarine with maximum multiplier, etc.It's fun to complete the challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun."

I started out with almost no idea of what the game was except for a few screenshots and mentions that gave it high praise.The relatively unintuitive controls for flying around ended up being a thrill and give just enough direct control to make it feel like you really are narrowly boosting in and out of swarms of enemy fights. The catchy music and brown stain palette do an amazing job of creating an ‘against all odds’/WW2 dogfight game feel that also complements the insanity the game can throw at you sometimes. Moving from blasting fighters while freefalling to boosting away from a mass of projectiles, waiting for your ship to repair, before you boost right back into the crowd feels exhilarating.The customizations are interesting ways to keep you entertained while you complete mini-objectives but they can seem pretty useless if you already have a preferred setup for your plane. Since the arcade-like nature of the game prefers to have you improve your skill, none of the customizations are straight upgrades and all have downsides but it helps to keep the game interesting over the long run, especially as you find uniquely volatile combinations for beating certain enemies or mini-objectives.That being said, the enemy variety gets old rather fast and you can experience what feels like a majority of the game in only a few hours. This feeling is amplified after running out of do-able mini-objectives (dang some of them are tough/rare). It’s the same handful of remixes and 5 or 6 enemy types every round, and I don’t get the feeling that things really change after defeating the blimp (which almost never appears).Still, it’s a captivating game for the first couple hours and is something you’ll spend a lot of time revisiting."

,Recommended,233150,9692371,"Posted: 31 March, 2014",all,TehShrike,"Luftrauser is a game of physical expression on a two-dimensional plane.Luftrauser reminds me of three of my all-time favorite games from the spatial-awareness-shooty genre:1. In Triplane Turmoil, momentum is everything - you have a narrow band of space between ground and sky, and your job is to occupy that space without getting shot down.  You have to maintain motion to keep from nosediving into the rocks, but a good pilot can stall into the perfect place to shoot their sibling's plane and pull out of the dive without taking damage.2. Crimsonland is top-down bullet hell done right - the ""bullets"" are zombies, and the only long-term way to dodge them is by killing them.  The only way to kill them effectively is to internalize the dodging mechanics so that one half of your brain handles the feet, weaving around the monsters, with the other half of your brain working on aiming in such a way as to make sure that you can keep dodging a few more precious seconds.3. It took me a few hours to catch it, but Luftrauser also reminds me of Uniball.  Uniball is soccer with spaceships, a weird futuristic air hockey viewed from the top down.  As a younger man I dedicated thousands of hours to playing online, but when bored I would even fire up the ""single-player"" mode without any other players, just to practice dribbling and moving.  Momentum is a huge part of the game, and I would practice shooting and passing while constantly spinning, limiting myself to only a few direction keys to force myself to use momentum with perfect efficiency.Luftrauser is an arcade-intense game that asks you to dodge with one brain, use your other brain to shoot speedy bad guys out of the air (with MAX COMBO), and if you're really leet, gives you a spatial playground to express yourself in with all the spinning, stalling, and lasers that my childhood gamer's heart so deeply desires.And also the soundtrack is super-awesome, the aesthetics are gorgeous, and the upgrades and goals are excellently crafted and all that other stuff.  But really, that's just the devs showing off after creating a beautiful Game."

Tense gameplay with tight controls, heavy replayability, a gorgeous aesthetic, and awesome music combine to make a great experience overall. I don't usually care for bullet hell, but this game pulls it off with enough style that I made an exception.The only problem is that the game is partially centered around completing 'missions' which usually involve destroying a certain enemy, or a number of certain enemies. It becomes a problem when the randomized enemy spawning doesn't give you enough of them, or doesn't give you enough weaker enemies to combo. It doesn't quite shoot the game down, but it's a slight blemish.It also strikes me that the aesthetic's slight harkening towards the stylings of Nazi Germany, not to mention the theme of Glorious Combat™, might not sit well with everyone. It's nothing major, and the game usually looks starkly beautiful, so make your purchasing decision accordingly.At the very least, in short sessions it's a good timewaster. I especially recommend it to bullet hell fans who play nothing but Touhou and other games with anime girls who possess planet-destroying magical powers. You need some IRON in your diet."

The Music is superb and exhilarating, constantly pushing you forward. Think Hotline Miami music, but in the skies.The gameplay is where the game outshines every other aspect. There is no use of mouse here, just the keyboard for those of you who want to play this in you bed or on the train/bus or something.The movement and momentum that you get from flying is something which reminds me of the responsiveness of Super Meat Boy, it just ""feels"" right. It feels like you are moving an actual (very flexible) plane, where you are flinging it about using the momentum, only sometimes turining the engine on to move from place to place.There is use of a mission system which gives a little but more meaning behind the carnage, and completing these allows you to unlock new features for your plane, and each of these features does a good job of changing the feel, without causing you to relearn the game.Finally, do not worry about repitition, as it that there is quite alot of random generation, so it is always impossible to get used to where the enemy is coming from.I absolutly recommend this game, and at the current price point, i'd say go ahead and buy it at full price."

There is really only one thing I could even come remotely close to criticism and that would be the story. Of course I can't hold this against luftrausers as it is a retro title meant for quick hardcore dosage and not meant to be taken too seriously in terms of setting.

There is no option for either part I whould miss and the combinations are numerous.The mechanics of turning faster while not boosting (and thus falling) are deep enough to keep you playing for some time even though the rounds can be pretty short (because of you dying so fast).The FOV needs some getting used to, though as enemies can be hit but also shoot at you while beeing outside the screen.Also, there are some weapons which do not pay off as good as others as the really high points can only be reached by chaining one giant combo. Some weapons are just not capable of that imo and thus rendered useless.Nonetheless, a nicely designed high score game but nothing more. No motivation besides that."

You take control of a single fighter jet, holding off thousand of planes, jets, boats, and submarines until you die. It's essentially achieving the highest score you possibly can. This game isn't easy, it's hard, but mastering is where the game shines.This game is simple at it's core, but it's filled to the brim with fast paced, non-stop action, sure to get your adrenaline going. You don't fly this thing normally. You can turn it left, right, and accelerate by holding up. This means you can keep your fighter in the air for a good amount of time if you take advantage of the momentum. For enemies, you have your simple planes and boats, but stronger variants pop up, like battleships that have massive HP and fire a barrage of bullets, or aces in the sky with very accurate aim. You need to keep your wits about you, so dodge and shoot your way to victory. Shooting isn't the only way to kill enemies either, you can also ram into enemies for some massive damage, as the expense of losing health quickly. Your health is regenerative, so the way you recover it is to simply not fire your weapon.However, the best part about this game is the customization. There are literally 125 ways to build your fighter. You can change the weapon, body, and engine, each with their own perks and disadvantages. This makes the game accustomed to have so many different play styles, so you can see which one fits to your choosing. You can have a powerful tank with a cannon and heavy armor, have a super fast engine with a laser beam for quick aiming, or you can have a kamikaze style fighter with massive impact damage and explode spectacularly upon death.With all these parts, also come missions for each individual part. This gives the player the chance to try out new pieces and accomplish a goal while doing so. Think of it as a reward for trying new things, and testing your skils. It extends replay ability as well.After you've messed around in normal mode long enough, there's another mode called SFMT, which is essentially hard mode. Battleships, Aces, and more enemies spawn right at the beginning, and it's as frantic as you can imagine, and you WILL die quickly. If you've mastered normal mode, try your skills at SFMT, and see how long you can survive Hell.Overall, Luftrausers is an incredible arcade style game with blood pumping action that never stops with so much customization in one package. This game is definitely worth full price, and you'll have an awesome time if you enjoy a good challenge."

I recall reading an article from the guy who designed it (I think onkotaku.com)where he said they made it when they were at a dark place in their lives... and well, World War style games are like that, and even if they may regret being at a dark place, the game itself is worth playing and supporting. I want to see more from this studio when they are at a bright and happy place.I may not have played this game as long as I've played others, but I believe this is one of the greatest casual games I've played on steam. And when I say ""casual"" what I mean is a ""pick up and play"" game - you don't have to spend hours min/maxing your characters, grinding reputations... you just go out there and Rouse.When you unlock different parts for your Rouser each part has it's own challenges - and when you complete them you get harder and harder ones, so if eventually you get to one you're not doing great on, just switch to another part that may have easier challenges, do those, get better at the game, then go back and do the harder ones you were stuck on before.The gameplay feels responsive, and ""Rousing"" as it's called where you essentially turn off the engine and free fall feels great; dodging cannonfire and enemy missiles only to re-ignite the engines seconds later to gain a burst of speed. It feels great.The soundtrack is ace too; I can't think of any recent game that's made me think ""This music is kicking!"" but this does. I'd liken it to the ""Jets'n'Guns Soundtrack"" by Machinae Supremacy... however please note, the soundtrack to Jets'n'Guns is great... the game... utter poo-poo. It's available on steam, but I'd say listen to the soundtrack on Spotify and ignore the game.Well enough of me rambling. Buy Luftrrausers. Rause those Lufts!"

There are next to no frills in terms of extra content, but the game is strong enough to stand on its own.The objective is obvious enough, so there's no time wasted on tutorials. You may take a few runs fumbling around trying to  steer your craft and dying annoying deaths, but when you get the hang of it the game feels almost perfect.Luftrausers really nailed it with the scoring system. As you kill enemies your combo increases, allowing you to stack phat multipliers to add to your score. The multiplier only lasts for a couple of seconds though, so there's always a rush to hunt and kill enemies to keep it going. Also, your health recovers by ceasing fire. You'll frequently run into tense situations where you halt your recovery in an attempt to keep your combo alive.The sense of progression is well done, too. As you get a better grip of the controls, you'll find yourself doing wacky maneuvers without even thinking about it. What was once a sloppy death from a couple bullets and crashing into a battleship turns into a delicate weaving throughout the barrage and skirting off the top of the boat. Clumsily trying to position yourself to get a shot at an Ace craft before it pulls off turns into charging at them head on with guns blazing and boosting through before they can even let loose their barrage. It all adds to up a thrilling sensation as you dance through storms of bullets and lay waste to all opposition.So yeah, highly recommended. Happy rausing."

The controls are not accurate enough to make it a fun ""bullet-dodge"" game, instead the controls make you feel engaged in duels - but it's not much about that, game is mostly about finding a cheese-tactic in order to scratch another mission off your list.Every combination of gun/ship/boost make you feel crippled with drawbacks - you never feel like you are particularly strong or efficient, you just feel like a slug trying to all-in for a mission clear; die, repeat.Drawbacks on all gear should be adjusted - it makes no sense that EVERYTHING has so strong drawbacks that you ALWAYS feel like a goddamn retard.

It's simple enough to grasp with minimal controls and easy to latch onto goal; if it moves, blow it up. It's a shooter, it's an action game, it's fun, and it'll have you hooked. If this doesn't make you want to be a Rauser pilot, I don't know what will.Don't be fooled by the screenshots, this game is HARD. It appears easy, but it gets difficult fast. But unlike other games where ramped difficulty makes people want to give up after the first few tries, Luftrausers brings you back for more and more, giving you more options, more choices, more ways to kick some butt and blow stuff up. If you like a challenge, this game is definitely for you. You will spend hours with this.What makes this game so delightfully addictive is it's simple elegance. It doesn't need to be decked out and fancy to be a really fun and difficult game. It's satisfying to achieve goals and relaxing if you want to kick back and blow off steam. The action is non-stop, the music is great, and the graphics are an awesome throw back to the days of Space Invaders. You become a part of this incredible world full of bullets and fire, and you will love every second of it. It's worth every cent, and for $9.99, you'd be crazy to pass up a game like this."

The game starts off rather challenging already, and I found that getting around required actual thought, and made me develop a lot of tactics for different planes, which feels pretty rewarding.Then, for another eight hours, I tried going through the rest of the 'late game' achievements and some of its little flaws start to really shine. I'm still sitting here trying this actually, with the game cut to .3 of its' original speed.The whole system is based off getting a combo killing enemies, yet the flawed spawning rates sometimes leave me with only one enemy on screen which I can barely kill after around 12 or so normal enemies, which absolutely disappear.There's also some flaws in the whole 'bullet hell with tank-controls' when some enemies can create whole walls which you just have to hope you pass through. These will also take up all of this 'spawn cap' so it's a huge block for no progress.Aaand while I did enjoy the game, it's rather simplistic and the customizeable mechanics aren't very well balanced.

Worth every cent.In LUFTRAUSERS, skill matters just as much as style. You are rewarded for playing well to the aircraft's strengths with large combos and/or survivability, but the game is not reluctant in the least to punish careless mistakes and exploit the plane's weaknesses from both above and below. The player is given plentiful options to craft their most favorable flight/combat experience, yet they must always be prepared to suffer the cons of their choices; frankly, the balances between Pro and Con in this game are commendable and always clearly stated.The combat itself starts out quite simple with a few basic enemies to work with that are vulnerable to virtually any style. This acts as a sort of grace period for pilots testing new combinations. However, the game quickly works itself into a pilot's nightmare full of stray bullets, introducing new enemies in both sea and air. This steep difficulty curve, in combination with the mission system and various 'bosses', contributes greatly to the addictiveness of the game. New high scores give you a genuine sense of accomplishment and encourage the pilot to pursue other combinations that may help them reach even higher. All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is one tough survival test that will keep you coming back for more."

Both visually and musically the tone is set quite richly and its hard not to enjoy all the subtle little touches like the main theme song as you play changing based on how you configured your fighter.Its not necessarily spilling over with replayability.  The overall game is a bit fun but progress is rather limited in the 'finish one of these several goals' task completion.  Once you have finished all of the base tasks, there is another layer of incredibly ridiculously hard that opens up but its honestly *so* over the top its more worth trying for a few laughs at its utter futility.The one last comment is that honestly I was not a fan of the controls *at all*.  While the basic flight mechanic is quite well executed, the game screams out for really solid gamepad support, and it was just not quite there.  While basic gamepad control is possible, its not very customizable and the configurations that you are presented with simply didn't work that well for me.

The combination of the excellent camera, sound, and gratifying pixel explosions make shooting and movement a blast. The different ship parts that you can unlock are also well designed: each one is unique and, more importantly, they can synergize in interesting ways. The music track that changes according to your combination of ship parts is a delightful touch.The Bad:Progression in LUFTRAUSERS is awkward. In one of my early playthroughs I spotted a Blimp and I believed it was the first of many ""boss"" type enemies that I would encounter. After it promptly destroyed me, and after several more unsuccessful attempts to encounter it again, I began to wonder how many of these bosses there were; how much harder could this game possibly get? It turns out Blimps are the first and final boss and they are unbelievably hard to take down. So I turned my gaze to the ""missions"" that each ship part presents (""Kill 3 Submarines"", ""Score 10000 points"" etc). After about an hour and a half I had unlocked every ship part and now my only real remaining goal was to take down a damn blimp. My remaining 2 hours in the game have been enjoyable due to the game's great core mechanics, but I have made no progress after unlocking the last ship part.The Ugly:The menu is pretty bad.  It does not adjust input text for a gamepad and it obfuscates information. I was told many times that I had unlocked something but it was not clear what I had unlocked. I was told to enable this mystery unlock in the ""options"" menu but this options menu was nowhere to be found. It turns out the things I had been unlocking were different color palettes for the game, a few of which were so hideous I am surprised they are even included as an option.tl;dr+ Top notch game-feel+ Great audio- Lack of content / game progression- Poorly designed menus"

It will inevitably best you, but the fun is seeing how long you can avoid it.I have two actual gripes:The first gripe is that the firing/boosting ""non-stop"" missions don't always appear to count correctly. For example, you continuous fire 20 chain-kills to reach MAX combo but the mission shows that you've only been credited for 3 kills. This really sucks on the one for a 30 chain.The other gripe is that the entire range of ""at MAX combo"" missions rely on more serendipity than actual skill. There will often be gaps in the spawn rate long enough for the combo counter to drop the bonus. Only then does the target spawn, and with nothing around to build back the combo counter."

Sometimes, it's more viable to crash into your enemies rather than try and aim and shoot at them. It is really fun.I should note here that this game works best with a controller. I haven't played with a keyboard, but I can't imagine it going that well. The joystick controlls work best with the fluid movement of this game."

A gamesession can variate between 30 seconds to 5 minutes (IF you got any luck surviving this long^^). It´s brutal, unforgiving, plain and simple but a hellish addicting game =)GAMEPLAYSimply put, you have to press 4 different buttons. And avoiding projectiles while flying. Oh and sometimes you needn´t to push a button or else you fly directly into another projectile xD But this depens on how you build up your aircraft. Bulky but slow with high firepower or fast with a melee body ala Kamikaze Joe? There are three different slots where you can choose your loadout: Weapon, Body and Engine. To discribe the gameplay of Luftrausers is a little hard so I put a playlist at the end of this review.GRAPHICSGraphics on the other hand are quite simple to discribe. 8-bit pixels with a stabile framerate of 30 FPS deliver fluid pictures of hate and enjoyment. Through unlockable color patterns the original 3-Color mode can be switched from psychodellic neon to simple black and grey and white. Every mode except the original made me puke and laugh at the same time but this lies in the eye of the beholder. :PSOUNDNow this is what really stands out. Every game has a soundtrack but Luftrausers is a shiny example for how great and important good music is for a game. Every bodypart has its own ""OST"". I´d say industrial meets 8-Bit... I totally love it =)For 9€ it´s hard not to recommend this game but after playing it for 8 hours only highscore hunting is left (maybe achievement hunting, but that´s not for me) I hope there´ll be updates with more equipment parts to play around with or maybe new enemies. For those who beat the normal mode AND defeated an enormous aircraft called ""BLIMP"" you get access to a new mode called ""SFMT"".. Even satan cries in his bedchamber after he played ten minutes in this mode xDhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5l53rMB022oUMaN98kNHfuafv6XRGEu"

Fairly disappointing.After the first maybe 15-20 minutes you may encounter your first blimp, kind of a boss which was fantastic the first time but it turns out that's basically the most powerful thing, the only boss ever. A hardcore SFMT mode just adds more stuff and more bullets coming at you, no new interesting enemies.Also no restart button I could find when I accidentally started a game in the wrong mode or wrong ship setup, you have to just kill yourself which is rather difficult to do in the normal game mode for 10-15 seconds while there are very few enemies (particularly with the underwater thruster).""Let's have a 5sec air raid siren start each hardcore game, where average playtime is about 5sec."" That's where I had to mute my audio unfortunately where it was otherwise enjoyable in other parts of the game.Again the first 30 minutes of playing and unlocking (~80% of the game) stuff is great fun, which is maybe why this game got so many great reviews from critics who didn't play further?

This is important enough to be the first line of this review because if you're like me and like to chat with friends over voicechat, you may need your master volume turned up pretty high and adjust games as needed. I almost didn't even play this game because of how loud it was on startup and there was nothing I could do in-game to fix it. Eventually after some googling I took some time away from friends to mute everything so I could pass the tutorial and actual fix the in game volume.Now, after that this is an extremely fun game. The arcade action is quick and fun and there's a ton of different configurations of parts to make your Rauser out of. Well, if a ton is equal to One Hundred and Twenty Five. Still, there's a lot of variety and each part has it's own mission objectives, giving some direction other than just scoring and adding to longevity to the experience. The four color aesthetic works wonderfully and the music plays to the action very well. Besides the red and sepia look there are other color schemes to unlock, most of which I've found are completely terrible, but they are completely optional and don't take away from the core experience which is so fun that the only real complaint I have with it is that I wish there was more!"

The color palette used for this game is easy on the eyes and will keep you sucked in for a while. The only minor downside is the usic. The music might seem enjoyble at first but it can get tiresome if you play for too long.

Luftrausers is a pretty straight forward arcade style bullet hell game that is well designed and fun to play. It offers ways to customize your ""rausers"" with different bodies, weapons, and engines. I do like that each combination has its own name, it's not a big deal, but it's a small thing that I rather like. According to the trailer each rauser has its own music and while I did notice a slight, it's not so unique that I instantly noticed.Luftrausers takes up very little space on my hard drive, it isn't taxing on my processor, it's cheap, and you can jump into a game in seconds. It's a game I play when I have a few minutes to kill like BroForce or Papers Please, but I think BroForce has more content.

Well, I'm happy to report It has it in spades my friends.Luftrausers is basically Asteroids with gravity and World War I planes, and it really goes for the WWI aesthetic. The game is presented in a red and yellow sepia filter that pairs well with the WWI look of the menus and the various air and watercrafts.You have goals that will unlock new parts for your plane that not only change the look and capabilities of your own craft, but also give the music a specific spin depending on the part you attach. This actually adds a lot to the game's minimal but stellar sound track.There is no better feeling than when you become the plane! Once you wrap your mind around the controls, you quickly find yourself weaving in and out of a few battleship's bullet spray while pulling a 180 to boost THROUGH your pursuers. Okay, so maybe its more than Asteroids with gravity and WWI planes, and thats why I love it.Recommend it to a friend,Tino"

Several enemies can take you out in a snap, sometimes when they're not even on screen. I've had several occasions where I've gotten out of an intense dogfight with only a scrap of health left (with little else on the screen) only for a jet to zoom in and smack into me. Battleships either need less health or shoot less bullets, and an ace can often times take you out before you have any time to react. For several hours, most of my objectives consisted of ""take out a blimp to continue"", but I can't for the life of me tell you the spawn conditions for one (sometimes they appeared 30 seconds in, sometimes three minutes of intense fighting will pass with niether hide nor hair). Blimps don't spawn nearly often enough to develop a strategy, and when I finally did beat one it was by dying with the kamikaze bomb part.Despite it's shortcomings, however, LUFTRAUSERS' ten dollar asking price seems about right as an asking price, and I'd definitely buy it again.

(It even features some recycled Hotline Miami musik, so you know that part is wonderful.)A triumph for pixel art in games.Works off the principle that what goes up must come down (YES!--gravity), using this physic to create a whole new twist to twin-stick shooter arcade play.  Also, playing like a suicide-bomber can be to your advantage as you can use your plane to melee enemies as well as to fire missles.  Very challenging gameplay (the achievements will most likely not be hard to cook through, but the game itself provides a beautiful challenge and you can compete for high scores).The art is simplistic, but subdued, easy on the eyes, and beautiful.  The art style is unique and fun, the kind of art you would expect from Devolver.  Beige color-scheme is interesting.  Play-style is customizable (you can alter weapons/parts of the ship).The gravity mechanic doesn't make sense in light of the German war Aero-plane theme, but oh well.  It's a video game  and absurdity is welcome.  The sky and water serve as a function of the game, not just backdrop, so I guess it all works.I came to love this game in a very short time and this is definitely doing to be one of my top picks for a long while."

Sure, the floaty controls and 2D shooting is satisfying, for a few hours that is. There's only 15 parts to customize your aircraft with, 7 enemies to dogfight with, and 1 gamemode: shoot things to get points until you die. It's an endless wave game with some very frustrating elements to it such as the simple art style which is pretty, but can interfere when there's a bunch of similarly colored things on the screen and compounded by immense screen shaking when things explode and stuttering when you take damage. The ""100 challenging missions"" the game touts is nothing more than a list of basic and boring goals such as ""Kill a Blimp"" or ""Get a score of 8000"" that is effectively a list of achievements that quickly becomes a test of luck down the line with its pseudo-difficulty.The bullet hell nature of the game is also hindered by the fact the camera is heavily focused on your rauser despite all the airspace available, you will often find yourself flying straight into a cloud of bullets that leaves you a very small window of opportunity to dodge whereas other bullet hell games gives you view of the entire field to plan out your maneuvers. All of this and the game asks you for $10, not really expensive, but for that price one could buy other replayable games with truckloads of more content such as Binding of Isaac, Dungeons of Dredmor, FTL, or Risk of Rain. Wait for a sale if you're still thinking about this one."

It's a physics-based game, kind of, except when it's not.My biggest critique is that you don't make progress; you unlock a bunch of stuff that looks cool, but mainly isn't.Stuff like ""body that's a blade that makes you weaker than default but doesn't insta-kill hard baddies on impact hits so net the heavy armor does more DPS + survivability"".  Basic stuff.  Stuff that should have been addressed, if not at release, but in a patch, after the developers had a chance to get away from their product for a while and then played it, rather than merely testing features.So the game gets hard, basically Nintendo Hard, but you're stuck with the (few) combinations of parts that are actually worth using at all and a bunch of features, like dropping bombs, that feel like they should have been available to every body type, because it was one of the few interesting things.  And then you get to the end and are going to be like, ""well, that was short"".Compared to Wings Of Fury, this is a simplistic game that is pretending to be a lot more than it is.  I did not honestly feel like I got my $10 worth, and I rarely ever feel that.It's like they made this at some Code Day in about 24 hours, then slapped a very basic UI and some hired-gun graphics on it and then called it Done, frankly, with no further follow-through to improve the core balance of the design, a very limited selection of enemy types, and game mechanics that basically just punish you for making progress, without mitigation.  There isn't a story; there's nothing to get emotionally involved in... it's less interesting in those respects than any smallish title I've played recently.The game doesn't even have a difficulty setting, for example, so for a lot of you twitch-challenged people... you'll just hate it, frankly.This is the kind of game where if you actually long for games that were just brutally hard to keep you from noticing how bad they really were in the 1980s, then you're probably moderately happy, but I don't actually like the results much; it's like they borrowed liberally from the past without understanding it very well and then were promoted by All The Right People so that suckers like me would shell out $10.  It's rare that I've encountered a well-mentioned Indie darling with less to really offer for the money, though.Never again, Vlambeer- either build decent games that deliver real value and patch after release to get balance and the core of gameplay halfway decent or fuggitaboutit."

We’re talking the age of fear for mind control, floating sky fortresses, orbital rays, weaponised dolphins, cryptography and submerging warplanes. The player is part of an undefined enemy force that was not on ‘our’ side during the six or seven decades in which military intelligence was effectively telling us to prepare for a laser-equipped hoverboat assault. It's pretty awesome.As a Vlambeer game,LUFTRAUSERShas a lot going for it. The game is all about big bullets, lots of screen-shaking explosions, fun mechanics, and ridiculous controls. Like with all Vlambeer games, it features a high skill ceiling and difficulty while maintaining easy accessibility and addictive gameplay. Aesthetically, it has simple but great pixel art and vibrant color palettes. KOZILEK's soundtrack is amazing; it subtly changes as you customize your Rauser with different guns, hulls, and engines. Everything about it justfeelsamazing.There are a few flaws, however. The user interface is a little clunky; I've had trouble remapping the controls and the menus are a little hard to navigate. Players might get turned off by the simplicity and lack of content as well as the difficult missions. Still, I definitely think it's worth the $10.

,Recommended,233150,30983926,Posted: 6 April,all,Thedankcar,wetBut in a serious note this game is very good. It has a feel of zero gravity when manurvering. I find it especially gratifying when you get to higher levels and unlock bigger slower weapons. This makes you strategize when to shoot and when to escape. Although the hardest difficulty and only difficulty change is a bit much. What with the wall of bullets but when you get used to it you find it to be challenging and fun. This game is very fun and is one of the reasons why i love steam so much.

Its biggest issue is the pure lack of content, or rather the rate at which you unlock new airplane parts. Maybe 20-40 minutes into the game I unlocked every single plane part (except for the top secret last ones), and thus I really had nothing else to play for. While there is that final unlock, it just becomes a technical challenge and a grind due to the lack of unlockables, which makes for painfully unfulfilling gameplay.Overall I would give this game a 4.5 out of 10, because it gets very old very quickly."

With the quick unlocks of new kinds of aircraft parts, the different gameplay styles that come with them, and the great dynamic soundtrack make this game a fun, epic, and unique game. In addition to lovely music, each new aircraft part can add new abilities, such as exploding on death, being able to fly underwater, etc. The flying controls are also excellent! You can turn on/off the thrusters and rotate freely however you want, allowing for the many parts of your plane to show off how they work best. For example, if you have a spread gun, heavy frame, and a superbooster, you would lead a ton of enemies in one direction, then cut the thrusters and fire backwards. On the other hand, if you had the melee frame, laser weapon, and underwater booster, you would keep low, spear through ships, and take down planes with the laser. The possibilities in this game are endless and so is the fun! I would recommend this game to anyone, no matter who you are."

All of the upgrades you unlock also have their drawbacks which is really annoying. I've unlocked about 15 new items so far and i still keep going back to the original config because the cons keep outweighing the pros.The real root of the problem is the fact that enemies spawn offscreen with no warning. THe number of times I've been doing well and then dip down into a new battleships barrage of lasers for instant death is crazy.I typically love all of these games with permadeath and upgrades. If you're into that style I'd recommend Rogue Legacy or Risk of Rain. If you have both of those already then Rogue shooter is also really fun.

Not so much in this game because the leaderboards is filled with cheaters that has billions of points.Point is that this game has no lasting appeal.Take Race the Sun for example. While it also takes a few hours to unlock everything you still have random levels and a daily leaderboard after you've unlocked everything.

Know before purchasing that the ""missions"" are challenges like ""score 10k points"" or ""kill 3 submarines in one combo"", they are NOT unique levels like you would find in Raiden or Gradius. This ""one level"" game is meant to be played over and over again; it's very difficult. Runs can be anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. You unlock parts as you go and after defeating a particularly large enemy, you unlock ""hard mode"". Good luck with that....Lots of unique ship combos with a different version of the Luftrausers original theme depending on what you pick. It's a really wonderful track, check it out on soundcloud if you haven't heard it.The controls are intentionally slippery but very well done. You aim your craft and then either thrust or stall, the challenge is cutting your thrust at the perfect time...weaving between the bullet hell and keeping your combo multipler at MAX. You unlock different color schemes as you progress, they're all pretty wacky.Luftrauser's arena loops like Defender, while the game controls like a bullet hell Asteroids.

The biggest issue of Roguelike game is player often dies randomly with little or none character progression. You keep dying in this game too, but this game is not much repeative than other games. Players can try different kinds of plane builds, every build is combined with 3 parts: Weapon, Body & Engine. Each of them got unique attributes, so try to build your own plane & find set up suits you best can cost you hours.Also, this game has a progress system that you can unlock different kinds of parts each time you raised to a new level. So it's not boring after died many times, at least an aim is set. The game progress is well balanced so you can get your new gear just before you are a little bit of tired, that makes you spend another 15 minutes to try your shiny new gear.The last and the most important is LUFTRAUSERS also has awesome gameplay with simulated 2D physics. Each kind of plane has its own physical parameter. You can get these in *.json files under game folder, adjust them as well. Game control only need 5 keys(4 directions + fire) and it works just fine. The core mechanism is simple, but being well made and adjusted. It must took producers lots of time. I have to say this game worth its price and it won't let you down."

I do like this game it's just a shame it doesn't live up to it's potential.I never really liked them that much. the pixel art is just not something feel nostalgia for I grew up on early 3d and detailed 2d games.and this color theme is ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting. what is this? bloody vomit? look at it it's stomache acid and pieces of blood.and the other color themes are so ♥♥♥♥ing bad too. why are half of them inverted? nobody likes to look at brightness inverted images.the black and white and the pink one are the only ones that look just close to acceptable.on the bright side the music is really good.it's a nice little addictive game for a while. but I lost interest quickly.It just didn't feel right. It's as if you find a beautiful kinky girlfriend, but then it turns out she is a feminist and you just get cucked.she doesn't want to get spanked! she wants to spank you and I just don't roll that way!I am just trying to play the ♥♥♥♥ing game here but the game keeps playing me.there is always some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t coming offscreen, the enemies are too tanky and they spam too many bullets.and the bullets are so annoyingly slow that you just have to accept that now you ve been denied this part of the screen.but worst of all is the blimp. I have never ever seen a worse bossfight. the blimp is nearly the entire time offscreen and you can only guess his position by the crazy bullet spam.it is so tanky and it doesn't even have a healthbar. I am asuming it lowers as it's health lowers but come on. is this really the best you could come up with?getting spammed form battleships is bad enough but now the blimp does the exact same spam from above! infinite bullet hell.ugh it was so hard to kill that blimp the first time. I only once killed it without the nuke body. it's pretty hard.and the screen is so ♥♥♥♥ing small, it doesn't even take up the whole widescreen it has these dumb black bars on the side! who doesn't have widescreen at this point, wtfand that's really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying in a game that keeps spamming fast moving airplanes trying to ram into you from offscreen.in general the screen is too zoomed in for how fast you move. you never know where you re going or what is going to kill you from behind.the gameplay is beautifully simplistic but I think they could ve made more interesting choices. like how about a body that modifies how the weapons work.the little missions or achievements of the game are really cool. it's very additice to try to beat them. I like how the encourage you to try out new combinations.too bad they only unlock more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inverted color themes.some of the items are compelte garbage: the nuke for example a bad idea on it's own cause you always die at the end, so it basically just adds some points when you die, big deal.but it also ♥♥♥♥s up the challenges completely.kill 2 battleships in one game: OH YOU MEAN DIE WHILE USING THE NUKE. kill two aces in one combo? DIE WITH NUKE! kill 30 enemies without firing. Nukeand if you play with the random option you get the nuke like every 5th game, so that ll just do the achievments eventually just by dying.they could ve come up with way more interesting items. how about a body that makes you shoot in a v Shape doubling your weapon output at the cost of health or speed.I hate how the game freezes when you get hit, please let me disable that it's ♥♥♥♥ing disturbing, nobody likes lag! and the fact that the game lags ever time you get hit makes it really disgustingthere should never be two battleships overlapping that's just complete garbage, it's obvious enough when they are 2 when they are so close together and suddenly you die from insane spam.but the game really likes you dying for random dumb reason as evident by the laser aliens that show up once per hour to instant kill you.and fighting back is near impossible even if you hit them with cannon close by they just explose in a big ♥♥♥♥ you laser death that kills you.and even worse is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mode that you unlock by beating the blimp for the first time. it basically asks the question could you play the game if the entire screen was filled with bullets to the brim.the anwer is no, it's unplayble. but the developers know that! that's why the achievments for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mode are so damn easy. they don't expect you to live past half a minute in that mode.there is 10 aces! they take more than 10 seconds to kill a piece. and by the time you kill one a new one will spawn there is just no winning.I might be wrong tho maybe they actually unlock more achievements that need you to survive this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for even longer. oh god I hope not.I ve played the game for 10 hours now. I actually refunded it after 2 but then I bough it again when it was 2 bucks on sale.So I guess now this bullet hell has become my life."

Gameplay's solid , the combinations are nice and it's generally a very fun experience.But the names of some of the combinations in this thing kills it for me; and other people who'd happen to be in my shoes also. I know they're supposed to show the would-be awesomeness of the plane you're flying, but ""Hellrauser"" and ""Fist of God""? Really? (I almost don't mind the ""Karaterauser"" and ""Batman"", albeit not by much.) Seriously, I don't see a real need to give the combos names proper to God alone/not to be profaned in one way or another. So please, change those names. You can come up with better titles than that.And I know there's a whole lot of you that disagree with me and will say ""just don't use those."" Again, it's not as simple as that. Once it's in the game, it can't be played. Of course the one thing I expect a whole bunch of you guys to say is ""then don't play it then, it's just a game. Get over it"" etc.But I needed to make that clear so that it could be possible for other people somewhere around my case CAN play this thing with a problem without boundaries being crossed and worst case scenarios befalling them.

I can now recommend this game BUT only for the game play and the controls, which are so solid that when you die you know its your fault. I say ""when"" because this is a bullet hell side scrolling sh'mup and you are going to die. This one is a challenge, again, I'm at 40 hours and I'm still 3 missions away from 100% completion. *sigh*There are still bits to this game that I find upsetting. Normally I would care less, but the game is soooo good that the little things to it are upsetting.ConsBeing color blind, I found that I can only use 4 of the 15 color schemes. The other 11 color schemes, I'm lost. Majority are horrendous anyways.I still find the 4:3 game play a huge disapiontment. I would really love to know the reason Vlambeer decided to go with this format.Still get lost navigating the menu... Yeah after 40 hours of game play.Calibrations! The controls are just too damn sensative in the menu and seem to be inconsistent at times. Controls just stop working.Aiming is still very difficult due to a number of factors. First, for weapons the have low frequence of shots, you have to guess when you are able to shoot again. Example missiles, you can only shoot 4 at a time. Sometimes they go rogue on you preventing you from firing. This is problem for health regen., keeping up your combo, defense, and offence. Second, the lower bit graphics also contribute.ProsEverything else.Final ThoughtTo put it simply, its a great game with the worst design.[Prior Review]+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+There is something I'd like to note before I review. I do play this game regularly in hopes that some of these issues are fixed. This review and rating may be updated.I love this game, which has some of the finest shmup action I've played. Beside the game play and the audio, for me, nothing else works. First off, I don't understand the decision the developer made with color scheme, more modes, more horrendous than the next can be unlocked to making it even more difficult than the last to identify enemies. A characteristic of this game that seems like a truely unnessisary hinderence. I'm really hoping there is a normal color scheme mode to unlock. Additionally, when you first load the game, you get the splash screen in wide screen, then in the game, standard. Black strips? What a tease, I can look past this small issue, only if it wasn't used a method to limit the firing range of the player and not the computer. Also with the graphics, I don't mind they are low res but it makes for difficult aiming without a line of sight or some other targeting method to see where you are shooting, this is critical when using weapons with a low frequency rate of fire.Next, navigating the menu's are a chore and shouldn't have to be. When you have 'go to' screens set to buttons that change on you pending the menu screen you are looking at can get confusing. The menu settings can be changed way too easily and inadvertantly as the controls are too sensative with no way to turn them down or even have dead zones. And how the heck do you exit the game? Well, took me a couple games to firgure out but you have to navigate to one screen to exit the game or even get to the options, that screen being what I thought was the start of the game.There really isn't too much more to this game and these intended unnessisary problems really do break my heart as I'm seeing a great game go bad. but If you are the type of gamer that can look past these problems, I do recommend this, but otherwise as it stands today, I can not. Maximum I'd give this a 6/10. That 6 easily could be a 9 or 10. Will update if game does.-RoX"

Health regenerates as long as you aren't firing your guns. The game starts off sdlow but quickly ramps up as you increase your score, adding more, and tougher enemies until you go from little gunboats and fighters to fighting massive battleships, zeppelins, and UFOS, dodging enemy fire, lasers, and skimming water and clouds to avoid everything, until you finally explode and do it all over again. The game's scoring challenge comes from continuing to string together massive combo multipliers, constanly urging you to take higher and higher risks to keep the combo going withouty dropping it, lest you have to build it up all over again.The player's ship is heavily customizeable in body, engines, and weapon types, allowing for a large variety of playstyles. As a neat touch, the music alters itself based on the type of ship you put together, putting together a new mashup of instruments and beats. The downsde is the game's pocket size, along with quickyly ramping difficulty, means you're going to be hearing the first one to two minutes of the song an awful lot.Completing achievements and challenges in the game unlocks new parts for your ""Rauser"", and new color paletes to play the game with.It's pure arcade action and it's a lot of fun."

I will provide examples if pressured.If you think the unique mechanics of this game itself make it worth purchasing, then the eb version is free and feels better to play, though it is still not very entertaining.The special part of this version of the game is that completing a number of missions will unlock new ship parts and extras like cutscenes and background color swaps.The ship parts are all given strengths and weknesses, but they are poorly balanced to be overpowered or useless.  I will provide examples if asked.The missions themselves do not directly relate to being ""good at the game"", and one can quickly earn all ship parts and a randomizer but save for the last three without beating the game once (It took me around four hours).  The music is made up of a universal part and three parts that are assigned to each part of your ship-- in other words the music has a very large chance of being disjointed and offputting, not around long enough to stick in your head, and , worst of all, gimmicky.  If you play with the randoms on so that you have a chance to ue some of the useless parts instead of playing with the superior build.The extra backgrounds are likely to be offputting save for one or two, based off of your color preferences, and even the faded black/white (beige) film aesthetic seems tired and uninspiring.  The main and common grunts are too easy to take care of, and only pose a threat when they are in groups of more than ten, and the large battleships are too powerful.  Once you learn how to fight the battleships, then you are able to survive until the enemy dogfighters arrive--- which are actually fun to fight instead of annoyances like the blades of grass that are the grunts or the trees that are the battleships.Though, to even have fun DOGFIGHTING IN A DOGFIGHTING SIMULATOR, you have to make it through the boring first section,which happens to be very long.

Made by Devolver Digital and Vlambeer, it has a delicious arcade feel to it, meaning it can be played for 5 mins or 5 hrs, depending on the mood you may be in. Multiple enemy types to destroy, many leaving the player with a great feeling of satisfaction (I'm looking at you, battleships and blimps).There are lots of different parts available to the player for the customization of their rauser. There are also many unlockable color palettes to choose from, which allow you to change up the flavor of your rausing here and there. The difficulty is perfectly scaling, increasing a little more with each kill, each passing second of your continued survival. The one big drawback I've found with this game is no multiplayer option. Even a local VS mode would help add so much more variety to this already immensly addicting game.If you like techo/electro music with a sort of diesel influence, you will love the soundtrack of Luftrausers. It has a great selection of tracks which perfectly match up to the setting of your aireal combat.

Got this at 75% off and I'm still not sure I got the money's worth... it literally plays like a free flash game you find online.-The game is fun for the first ten minutes but it gets repetitiveveryfast. You see all of what this game has to offer pretty quickly. The lack of enemy variety doesn't help. There's no motivation to continue playing except for the objectives on the plane pieces; 90% of which are easy as all f*ck and the other 10% are basically impossible without blind luck (Oh hey, that rhymed). If you're an achievement hunter that's into some mental masochism- here's your new kink-The only thing this game really has going for it is trying out differen't airplane combinations. I won't lie, it is fun seeing/playing the different combinations and reading the unique names for each one... but that whole experience is quickly sullied when you find out how repetitive it still ends up being. Thinking up some clever/funny names does not justify a $10 pricetag to me. Most of the combinations really don't change the gameplay at all either (only two that I can think of that really do any major gameplay changesthe Melee body and the Underwater engine). Any other piece than those and you'll be flailing in the air firing aimlessly.-People are saying the controls are really tight- but I found them to be quite loose and floaty. Maybe because I used a controller? It hindered the gameplay signifigantly. It's nearly impossible to react to split-second situations... which is all this game is (a bullet hell of split-second situations). You'll be spending a majority of the time shooting frantically, not tactically. That's not to say youwon'tbe shooting tactically (good luck taking down a battleship otherwise) it's just most of the time you'll be spamming your shots in a general directionhopingto hit something as opposed to actuallyaimingto hit something. I know, that's a factor in most (if not all) bullet hell/arcade shooter games like this, but it just seems way more apparent in this one. That it's entirely Luck > Skill. Dying every 2mins, just to respawn at the exact same point everytime, with the same slow start up everytime.... it gets monotonous fast. The controlscouldof helped that, but they don't. Least not with a controller.-Good luck if you wanna try rebinding keys. Misunderstanding the (easily misunderstandable) menu can get you to a point of being forced to manually find and delete an innocuous file in your /%APPDATA% folder... just to return the controls to the default settings... instead of a simple ""Reset to default"" in the options menu. Don't believe me? Go to the community hub and read the first Q&A on the FAQ. It's that much of a problem. I'd be willing to gamble that there's a recent post there with someone complaining and/or having trouble with the key bindings right now if you went and checked. The store page says ""Full Controller Support""... as far as I'm concerned, that's a lie-The ""cutscenes"" are a joke. Literally just flashes one picture when you kill one of the (7 or 8) different enemies for the first time...  I know it's an arcade game and all, but damn, why even bother if it's gonna be that terrible. Almost seems like a slap in the face after a certain point.-To top everything off you get a pretty ugly/stale looking theme and a lot of the other themes you unlock (theotheronly real attraction to this game (unless you're a closet nazi or something)) are either buggy or just hinder most situations by making enemies harder to see.If you're looking for a small, ""pass the time"" type of game just to blow a quick 10-15 minutes... I'd still say you can spend the time better beatin' off. Or, if you're tired from all that jerkin', you're still better off buying something like'Bit Blaster'for 99c. 1/10th the price but 10x the fun. Ironic, too, because that game lists this one as one of the developers inspirationstldr -  This game is way overpriced for what it offers. If you really are sold about getting this then wait until it's on sale 75% off or more, or you'll probably regret it."

Indeed, in Luftrausers, you get to make your grandfather proud, who served in an Unspecified War on an Unspecified Side as a decorated kamikaze fighter and managed to fly experimental laser-based *cough cough* Luftwaffe aircraft in the nostalgic era of Unspecified global conflict that spawned such innocent things as Popeye and nuclear fission and resulted in that same grandfather hiding in Rio de Janero for a few decades to conceive your mom and maybe eventually you too. It is a game that depicts acts of aerial valor and ultimate sacrifice on the wings of physically impossible aircraft diving in and out of the water to kill a lot of people for fun and high scores.I'm not trying to act surprised that this game called Luftrausers is what it is. It's supposedly funny, but I don't really get the jokes. If I throw on a fedora and crack a whip and punch the makers of the game in the face, I'll also go on record saying their game ""belongs in a museum!"" but specifically in the museum of Things A Lot of White People Thought Were Good Ideas, alongside a collective self-assurance that Resident Evil 5 is not racist or colonialist in any fashion, despite a macho government agent stomping through the Congo to accidentally shoot a whole bunch of dark people in the face for being diseased. I mean, as we all know, Starship Troopers is just an awesome stupid action movie about beautiful people fighting a good fight.I honestly don't get it and you are free to try to explain to me where all the elusive self awareness or ironies lie in the game. What are we supposed to make of this alternate reality version of Joust from Man-in-the-High-Castle America? What's the point of going after these aesthetics? Is the music that evokes the sound of countless oiled black boots marching only a ""gentle nod"" to a movement that murdered millions of people? Some idiot thinker coined the phrase ""all's fair in love and war"" and Luftrausers is low-key cool with donning a crisp SS uniform if there's savage arcade action to be had with an inbound bass drop. How quickly Dieselpunk gives way to Nazi-punk! If you pitched this game to me, I'd say it sounds fun. If you then showed me your private box of concept art next to pop-pop's secret insignias, I'd stop letting you out of my line of sight, expecting you to turn your feckless eyes on me to ask if I actually believe the Holocaust happened as some kind of secret handshake you expect me to accept."

,Not Recommended,233150,9614643,"Posted: 23 March, 2014",all,Jinjo,"LUFTRAUSERS is addicting, let me start by saying that. You customize your plane, take to the sky, and have some bullethell fun.When I say it's addicting though, I don't mean it in a good way. It's addicting like heroin or crack cocaine is addicting, at it's core the game is barely playable.The game mechanics are fine, really, they are, you fly around in a way that no pilot should never ever have to fly (i.e. cutting the engine off to make a hard turn, spinning in circles just to engage at the last second before hitting the water), shoot at boats and planes, and later, shoot at dirigibles and submarines. Let me start with that first one: I saw one review of this game that described the game's controls as ""flawless."" This is in no way the case since it feels like someone took a bullet hell, stapled that vector graphic Tank battling game to it and called it a day. In no way should anyone have to control like this in a bullet hell.As I mentioned before, you can customize your plane, and this is neat. But this is where the game falters THE MOST. Most of the unlockable parts you, well, unlock, are absolutely useless. You can unlock a melee fighter body which can ram into thinks without even getting a scratch, but when you realize that this is a bullet hell you should be uninstalling the game. You can also unlock a few other bodies, but all of them are ♥♥♥♥ing useless with the exception maybe one or two. All of the other bodies basically cripple your plane in the hopes that you'll find the tactic fun or interesting.The weapons I don't really have a problem with. They all have their ups and downs with the exception of missile, which no sane human being would ever use, but for the most part they feel finished and polished. It's such a shame the dev didnt take the time to ♥♥♥♥ing do the same for the other parts you can apply to your plane.And then there's the amount of parts you can have. The game's store page boasts 125 combos to add to your plane, but when you factor in the undeniable truth that most of the bodies and engines are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, you're instead left with about 50 useful combinations. And, while 125 may seem like a lot of parts, YOU WILL UNLOCK THESE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR, POSSIBLE EVEN LESS. THAT'S RIGHT, ALL OF THE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR. I.E., THE BIG GOAL  OF THE GAME, IS ACHIEVABLE IN AN HOUR OR LESS. If they don't expand on the part customization section of the game, or at least improve what you get, I see no reason to even touch this game.Also, you get to unlock color schemes for completing the entirety of a challenge tree. They're eyesores. And the names of these color schemes are the devs' names backwards. ♥♥♥♥ING. CLEVER.The game's prequel was a flash game called LUFTRAUSER. With the tacked on S, it makes sense that this is not the only ♥♥♥♥ing thing that's tacked on. Don't buy this game."

Game.Luftrausers is a 2D, bullet hell, combo based dogfighting game which sees you playing as what is essentially a Nazi fighter pilot in not-so-WW2. You customise your ""Rauser"" with tonns of different parts that have their powers and weaknesses, like an engine that lets you fly underwater, but will receive more damage if you fly too high, or a body that explodes like a nuclear bomb when you die, allowing you to do a last ditch Kamikaze into one of the many enemies wanting to ruin your day. You can customise your weapon system, your body, and your engine. Depending on which parts you pick will affect the soundtrack in drastic ways.Overall, this game is an absolute gem. Any PC can run it, it has a load of replayability, an amazing soundtrack, slick retro visuals and at a fiver, its a bargain. Pick it up and get Rausing."

Each new part unlocked really alters handling and tactics.- Cons -Can become kind of repetetive.For the asking price it is at the very least a couple of hours of arcadey fun. If you like arcade games with a retro feel then you should play it."

Great action-packed gameplay, cool stylized graphics, interesting mechanics (such as repairing your ship when not firing), groovy soundtrack that is interestly impacted based on what Rauser parts you use, etc.  The combat is frantic, and reminds me of an old Konami game called Time Pilot, mostly from a control perspective.  Another great thing is that the game not only encourages, but also rewards players for trying new Rausers, rather than just sticking with the same ones, via the soundtrack and the challenges that they have for it.  This game would work great on a handheld device, due to its quick gameplay rounds, chalenges, and unlockables.  This shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone familar with Vlambeer, best known for their smash hit iOS game Ridiculous Fishing.I totally reccomend this, but if you have a Vita (which you probably don't) you might want to get it on that, just because the game seems like it would work well on a handheld.RAUSERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSBUY IT!"

The controls are tight, the action is fun, and the customization is interesting. However, it's insane that what amounts to a flash game that you would find for free on the internet is sold for $10 on Steam. After a couple of hours, this game completely lost its momentum. It started out great, but it's so shallow that it made me angry that I paid $2 for it on sale.The challenges get to the point that they are too hard to have fun. I don't know how to trigger blimp appearances or make submarines show up, but when the challenge involves destroying one of those specific enemies, the frustration becomes unbearable. It ultimately just becomes a repetitious chore, and the fact that there is only one song during gameplay (which starts over every time you start a new game) doesn't help.Luftrausers is the second game I've ever bought that wound up on my ""hidden"" list in my games library."

It's amazing. I listen to the music all the time. It's, just look up ""Luftrausers OST"". If you don't like it something's wrong with you.2, The simplicity: Being just such a cool 8-bit and 16-bit arcade shooter with simple controls makes this one of the most fun games you'll be able to play forever. Sure, it doesn't have much unlocks, once you get to level 10 and you beat the challenges it's over, but you can still play it forever just to get ridiocolous kills and go to the emergency room from exerition of playing this game for too long.3, The art style: It's such a simple, russian-esc looking artstyle. The fact that you can change it as well is kinda cool, but I find that it makes playing the game harder... only my opinion. You can try whatever you like. If you go to my profile, you'll notice I basically have my entire steam profile decorated in Luftrauser steam merch. Backgrounds, the badge, emoticions, ect.

It's very easy to learn, yet difficult to master, due to the stalling system.Now, what is the stalling system?Well, when you aren't flying your plane by boosting, you fall. When you are falling, you are able to rotate the plane faster than you would when you are boosting.Oh, and your plane automatically repairs itself when you aren't shooting. That's something.The art style is simplistic, yet pretty good. It's sepia retraux. Don't like either? Well, the latter is kinda unfixable, but you can modify the former to various other styles, including my favorite, black and white....Which is named ''Distiny'', after an infamous spelling error in a clone's marketing line.And then there is the soundtrack.I REALLY like the soundtrack.

The control sticks work fairly well but it felt like I was turning slower and I kept trying to play it like a twin-stick shooter, but it doesn't boost the way you are pointing, only up boosts you.

Each plane part changes the name of your plane and changes some small part of the soundtrack, providing a different song every time.Overall this game is a blast to play and my only complaints are that some of the control schemes take a bit of getting used to because they seem different than the keyboard and that this game could have only been better with multiplayer- local or online- would have put this game totally through the roof!9/10 Would Luftrause again...and again...and again!"

It's you vs everything. The entire game is essentially a massive ""Objective: Survive"".There are roughly 9 different enemies in the game. The consist of different things like planes, ""Aces"" which are super-powered planes, and (Blank, not putting the full name, since it makes it a tad obvious what they do.) aces which are super powered aces. (Scary♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is also boats, battleships, submarines and the acemarine. (Real scary♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then you have the blimp. You're on your own to find out what each of these things do how ever.The game has a form of loadout system, using 3 parts. The gun, the body and the propulsion. Part of the fun in this game is finding different insane combinations and seeing how long you'll last. The body will for instance make you slower, but with more health, or faster with little health. I personally like to play as a glass cannon, going at mach speeds, but get scratched and I die. Can lead to some fun or frustrating playthroughs.There's enough variation to keep the game fresh how ever I can say from personal experience that I feel that it's a ""Go To"" game. When you have moments where you just want to hop on and play a game. No story or anything like that, just pure gameplay. Each playthrough is relatively short and depends on your skill. Sometimes a minute, sometimes 10. All depends on you.The standard music is pretty great. You'll be flying down from the sky, about to take out a battle ship and the music peaks up. It really feels great, when moments like that happens.There's 2 difficulty modes from what I can see. SFMT and Normal. Essentially, hear sirens and cry. You can periodically unlock new colour schemes for the game but I didn't think any of them match up with the original, how ever if you're looking for a new experience after playing for a while. Maybe just changing the colours is all you need.Conclusion, if you're looking for a game which you can keep coming back to, that doesn't take a lot of your time, yet has enough replay value for multiple playthroughs then this is a pretty decent game. I reccomend trying it out, and if you're still skeptical then wait for a sale. It was roughly 2-3 pounds when I bought it, which is a pretty nice price."

The combat is simlpy something to behold, as you zip across the sky in a beautiful, brown, bullet-filled sky while all hell breaks lose around you. It's a spectacle arcade SHMUP, and an extremely good one at that. It's really hard to not overplay how much fun the flying and shooting is in this game, it gives such an exhilarating and engaging feeling that's hard to find at this calibur. The game is recommendable on this aspect alone, the game is a prime example of a game that's just fun to play, you don't need any other motivation.Unfortunately, that's really all there is. The customization is limited, and a lot of the parts are kinda lack-luster in comparison to their counterparts. For example, I think the homing missiles, the cannon, the collision body, and bomb body are all utter garbage, their drawbacks all outweigh their benefits, and there are clearly better weapons. After for playing for just a few ours, the dominant strategy effect takes place and I see only three or four combinations worthy of my time. Randoming is fun as well, but a lot of the time you'll just get a back combination and die before you get anywhere really exciting. The names for each combination and mis-matched music tracks are really neat, but the novelty wears off as each match lasts just a few minutes. The missions are over in four or five hours and the SFMT, although gloriously hectic, gets a bit more frustrating than fun pretty quick. At the bottom line, the game sadly gets a little repetitive about four hours in.It's just that the game is so amazingly fun to play. Everything feels, looks, and sounds fantastic, it's a great experience. The price is a little steep for a game that gets a little old only four hours in, but if you don't mind fighting the same same seven enemy types over and over and over in rapid succession with stunted progression just for the sake of it, the game is simply and utterly fantastic."

Basically, you pilot a plane, avoiding bullets & missiles while shooting down your many adversaries. As you play & achieve things, you are rewarded with new plane parts interchangeable in-between runs (runs are basically infinite and can only be renewed when you die). These parts are divided into weaponry, body & thruster.However, newer parts are not necessarily superior. All parts comes with their own pluses & minuses, based on the special property it carries (like a body made of a nuclear warhead, yeah, go figure). So it depends on your combination & how you play them.Equipping certain parts also means you are only allowed to unlock certain achievements. However, this can also be used to your advantage. For example, one of the achievement missions  for the basic machine gun would be to take down a battleship. This is to say, a rather impossible task. However, if you equip your plane with the nuclear warhead body while also equpping the machine gun, you can simply run into the ship to kill it, you, and everything else on the screen and there you have it. One battleship down while 'using' the machine gun.The game doesn't have any story, but it doesn't need one anyways. The setting is enough to give you the idea that it's a war, and you are just one among the many disposable soldiers.That said, due to the nature of the game it probably has low lasting appeal. However, due to its simplicity (doesn't necessarily mean it's easy though, far from it) it's also an easy pick up and play for when you just want to play a game but isn't in the mood to think much, but still wants more or less a challenge. If you don't have a game like that in your library yet, you might want to get this."

But this really does dip to a whole new level.Essentially, you've got a weird hybrid game of Altitude meeting a set piece from Access's classic Beach-Head from 1984. Except both of these games are more fun. Anyone old enough to remember another classic - Domark's 'Wings of Fury' will also find this familiar - but again, the shooting planes and attacking ships was much better done in that game too.I really am puzzled as to what they were trying to achieve with this game. It feels clumsy, truly horrific to look at in 2014 and just ultimately a very boring, bland game to play. I really wish I'd bothered with a demo before forking out even my measely £6.99 for it.

By letting go of the throttle you continue flying but can turn very rapidly by throttling in the direction you want to go, which makes larger dogfights much more about agility and compensating for your lack of it than just getting hits off. The plane can be customised by switching gun, engine and body and every customisation radically changes how you fly and even changes the goals you have to complete to better suit what you've chosen. Also, the music changes depending on what you have equipped, which is a cool feature.However, if you're pretty good you should be able to complete the game in about 2 hours if not less and in this respect it feels like you might not be getting as much bang for your buck as you would with other titles at a similar price point. You may want to consider waiting for a sale before picking this up (which I still do highly recommend)."

Your own plane looks different enough that it doesn’t get lost in the fighting without it looking foolish and too cartoony. Everything sticks nicely to the games aesthetic and it looks like an old arcade machine.The music has a marching drive to it, spurring you on. There is a weird choice to make the music track restart on launch so if you die in the first few seconds you hear a sharp stop and start of the soundtrack.Story: 1/3As far as I can tell, you are a German flying the most advance plane in the war. The evil Churchill has declared total war against the Glorious Third Reich and only you can stop his relentless assault over the British Channel. You fight not for glory or for riches, you fight for the survival of your glorious empire.I don’t know if this was made by Germans or someone simply said, “you know what we have too much of? The Allies' side of the war. Let’s change that”. It wasn’t until I killed Churchill in his war zeppelin that I realized I was playing as a German.Since this is a score attack rogue-like game, it doesn’t need a story or dialog to keep you playing. It does create a uniform world with some discovery, but no great mystery. Doesn’t add or subtract anything.Game Play: 3/3This game gives some great visuals to assist your gameplay. There is no health bar or ammo, thereis only the dog fight. There is no power ups or health drops, there is only the dog fight. There are no allies, there is only the dog fight.When you take damage, the screen starts to get narrower. To regen health, you just stop shooting. Enemies play by the same rules as you, when you crash you lose health, but you might kill the enemy. To accomplish this your plane can maintain speed after you stop thrusting. So you can fly across the screen while shooting backwards.The controls are tight and the feedback is instant. There is a large number of supported play styles with different planes geared directly for. At a certain point you get a randomizer to add a new element to the game.Re-Playability: 1/1You unlock new parts after you die, and there is one plane body that turns you into a nuke on death.Should you buy it?I had more fun playing this with friends than alone. Has some good value, but nothing world changing, buy on a lite sale.Note: single player only, you need friends in room."

,Recommended,233150,17785798,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,Graced by Autumn,"Vlambeer: a studio known for its outstanding design skills and dedication to retro-inspired games that deliver fast action without getting hung up on anything that isn’t directly related to the core gameplay. This studio has proven itself time and time again with its catalogue of fast-action games. It should therefore come as no surprise to one acquainted with the two-man team’s previous releases that LUFTRAUSERS is a game of the same variety. It should also come as no surprise to hear that; like those games; it is also an undoubtedly outstanding piece of work.The core gameplay of LUFTRAUSERS is centred on the destruction of enemy aircraft, naval vessels and blimps (the latter of which only appear once you’re scoring big). Like other shmups LUFTRAUSERS likes to throw wave after wave of enemies at you. In this case there’s a little more room to manoeuvre than what one might be used to in a bog-standard shmup. It’s possible to scroll the screen left or right and continue flying in either direction indefinitely as you contend with the limitless supply of opponents for your blood. Destroying enemies earns the player points and as one’s score increases so too does the severity of the threat posed by the enemy. Each time an enemy is killed, the player’s score multiplier goes up by one. Keeping that multiplier high is the key to getting the best scores. It’s a very simple concept, but it lends itself to create some interesting gameplay scenarios. Do you go chase down that swarm of fighters in order to raise your multiplier before sinking the nearby battleship? Or do you attack the ship first and take the fighters on afterwards? The former has the potential to yield a greater final score, but it’s worth bearing in mind that dodging AA fire is no joke. The latter is the safer option, but you’re not going to get as many points that way. Players just starting out are likely to only witness some fighters and gun boats, but those racking up big scores will quickly find themselves facing off against large numbers of battleships, aircraft equipped with laser weapons and eventually the dreaded blimps. Stronger enemies yield more points, so the more of them you kill the better your score becomes, but that comes at the expense of inviting further trouble in the form of more of those strong enemies showing up to blow you out of the sky (whichwillhappen sooner or later, as is the case with games featuring what one might call ‘survival-mode’ style gameplay).A Rauser is comprised of three components: a weapon, body and engine. Specific components from each category can be swapped in and out upon returning to the menus, allowing you to find a perfect match that suits your playstyle. Some of the available choices are fairly conventional, while others are somewhat less so. Want to fly a jet with a conventional machine gun built into the nose? Fine. What about a plane that propels itself through the sky by firing bullets from its tail-end, while incinerating those in front of it with a high-powered laser? It’s done. Or maybe an aircraft that can dive under the waves and surface under enemy ships, sinking them with a single-shot cannon that releases additional projectiles in all directions after the initial projectile’s impact? Not a problem. Every part has a number of small-scale tasks associated with it, such as defeating a certain number of enemies whilst maintaining a combo, or killing enough enemies of a specific type. Successfully completing these tasks usually unlocks either new parts or new colour schemes. Most of these short-term goals are fun to pursue and encourage a bit of experimentation. Even if you have a favourite combination of parts, it’s fun to go after some of these while trying out parts which you might not normally go for.The world of LUFTRAUSERS is depicted through pixel art, something that a good number of indie games have chosen to go for. The visual style goes a long way in contributing towards the ‘arcade-like’ feel that the game has - a retro-inspired art style for a retro-inspired game. The default colour scheme keeps things simple enough so that it’s always easy to keep track of what’s going on, while the effective use of silhouettes in place of highly detailed sprites allows your imagination to fill in the blanks. Some of the alternate colour schemes are less appealing, thanks to some colour combinations that just don’t match-up, either because the contrast between colours is too great or because the scheme feels dull in comparison to the default one.KOZILEK’s main theme fits the game well enough, but what really stands out here is how the instruments used to play the said theme change depending on which parts you’ve got equipped. It’s a nice little touch that keeps things fresh. The sound effects themselves also do a great job of helping to maintain that retro feel, and sound like they came straight out of an 8-bit game.LUFTRAUSERS is another example of a game made by a studio that knows its target audience inside-out. It’s a stellar example of an arcade-style game done right – it knows it’s a straightforward, pick-up-and-play game, so it focuses purely on what matters most for that type of game: the core gameplay experience. Put simply if you’re a fan of the ‘instant-action’ games that Vlambeer has put out in the past then chances are LUFTRAUSERS is one game you can’t afford to miss out on."

These missions range from ""destroy your fist X"" to ""score X amount"" or ""get X number of kills in a single combo"" and can become significantly difficult to accomplish.Your score isheavlydependant of building, maintaining, and killing powerfull enimies in combos. after killing an enemy, your multiplier will apear, starting at x1 and increasing by 1 every kill, to a max of x20.

The feedback loop of just one more round along with no waiting time between attempts just kept me hooked. It has a great soundtrack, one which works amazingly when your ship is in critical condition while the heroic refrain of the track blazes high as you thread the needle through a sea of bullets and coming out the other side! The core gameplay mechanic is a joy to play with.There are some issues, notably it does not make it obvious how to quit (you can quit on the screen with the carrier). Along the same lines is that its menus could had done better. Some of the mission design (for unlocking new parts and giving you goals to work for) could had been better. Some of the parts could be better balanced.The game does seem perhaps a little too hard. Mostly in that I shake my fists at those pesky battleships, especially when more than one start stacking together to make a cloud of death. Yet as hard as the game is, you can eventually lock a mode which turns the game into a literal bullet hell.But on the whole, it was very enjoyable and a great surprise. Highly recommended."

When I lose I know I facked up.Possible con:  They changed the game mechanic from the original flash game.  It was really cool too.  Your plane went into a default counter-clockwise loop spin stall when not engaging engine which allowed for quick directional extractions.  They changed the mechanic to where there is no auto-loop when disengaging thrust..  now you control direction completely.  It's different but not better or worse.

The challenges presented for each module of your aircraft produce a feeling that makes you want to keep playing. Unlocking new parts and guns for the planes reaches its peak rather quickly, if you play well, so having teh challenges present for each module is a nice touch.Thats all the good i will say...The game worked great on my work pc, which was the first pc i installed it on. However when i tried to install the game on my gaming rig later that day, the game would not even get past the opening screen without one of about a million different variations of glitches would take over, making it impossible for me to even start flying a plane.I tried every fix i could find online and contacted the developers through the message boards. I got one reply initially that led me nowhere and then the devs seemed to just give up and abandon the message boards entirely. After not getting any replies to my numerous posts and questions for over 4 months i gave up on that idea. Tried to contact them by email. No luck. Back to fixes. you guessed it, no luck whatsoever.Now i am stuck with a game that will only run on my work computer, that i can scarcely play only when i am on break or waiting around after work for a colleague. The worst part is I ACTUALLY ENJOY THE GAME!I just wish the devs would have helped me and plenty others in fixing the major issues with the game. It really bothers me that i hear thorugh the boards they are already working on their next game (so now my hopes for fixing 'Luftrausers' is really crushed) and ""have been through some tough times"" so try to understand.I paid $10 for an indie title, so quite frankly, I ain't understandin' sh*t!"

I might even go so far as to say it's not worth $5.  It's definitely a game you should only buy on special.Now, with that out of the way, let me start with the highlights of the game.The graphics and music are excellent, I love the artstyle in general, it's very quirky and has a lot of personality.  The game is quite difficult but simple to play.  Easy to pick up but hard to master certainly applies here, especially if you're going for points.Now, for the bad bits. Just a forewarning, this negative impression might be coloured by my own level of skill as opposed to the game itself, but either way, here's my two cents.Though the slightly random generation of the levels does help, it doesn't feel like there's quite enough enemy variety, at least not as far as I've seen. Perhaps there's much more if you survive for a lot longer than I have but I'm a bit skeptical.The game also focuses on combo chaining to get points but after you clear the initial wave of little planes that chase you, and if you're good enough to clear out the boats, all you're left with to kill are huge battleships, large aircraft that move much faster than you do and have a large chunk of HP, and massive airships (if you're lucky enough to have them spawn at all).  All of these enemies have too much HP for your weapons (which don't increase in power throughout your run) to take down with any efficiency, and the 5 second timer for your combo meter is not nearly generous enough for you to get more than a couple multipliers before it resets at this point.  There are still the cruise missiles and the fighter jets that streak around but the cruise missiles don't seem to appear in enough quantity and the fighter jets are too fast to reliably shoot down to keep up your combo meter.Also, speaking of the points, due to the flaws that I perceive in the score system, it is difficult to get much more than 10,000 points in a successful run, which makes unlocking new parts a bit of a grind since it can take tens of thousands of points to unlock a single new part for your plane later on.The final nail in the coffin for me is also the fact that, despite the interesting range of part combinations that you can put together in this game to create your own unique vehicle, I ended up feeling that the only combination that really worked to survive and score with any efficiency was pretty much laser + high HP body + fast engine.  The HP difference between the high HP body and everything else rendered almost all the other bodies moot, especially when you pair the high HP body with the high speed engine.  It doesn't help that all of these parts are quite literally the first set of parts you unlock.Clearly some of this is subjective in how you approach the game, how good of a player you are, and which body combination works for you (though it's hard to imagine how any of the other bodies could surpass the massive HP difference of the high HP body), but I feel the scoring system, weapon unlock system, and the unviability of the various part combinations makes this a frustrating experience that quickly becomes repetitive."

It's very smoothly done, and being able to flip in midair and shoot down an entire horde of enemy fighters makes you feel like a badass.In fact, the main part of the game makes you feel like a badass!No gem comes in flawless, though. The lack of a start menu, awkward custom controls setup method and the game throwing you directly into the fight is something I don't really like.I also don't like that to reset your controls if you accidentally screw them up, you have to go into the files and delete the config files, due to the fact that there's no reset-to-default button in-game.But these are things that can easily be updated later on, nothing that ruins the game for me. Just slight annoyances.A bit of story would be nice, too. Just as a side-thing. I'd really like to know a bit more about the universe this game takes place in."

Product placement done right, really.So I gave it a try. It *might* have appealed to me as a German, the title gave me a good chuckle.Not disappointed, this game is fun for 5 minutes or fun for 5 hours (can't tell for days and weeks yet) and made me watch out for other Vlambeer releases.I have fun playing it. My girlfriend will love it. My 6-year old niece will love it. My dog will not notice the reduced color palette. It's a family game at its best, really.Most impressive about Luftrausers: it feels and looks hilarious when you play it, but the objects for themselves actually are as pixel-minimal as it gets. They get their characteristics from a combination of sound, minute details in animations, and physics that hit the sweet spot of goofiness right between the eyes. Masterpiece!"

Want to make a ship that takes lots of damage and dishes out death? Go for it, but be aware that your ship might move slower and offer you less time to dodge. Want a plane that specializes in ramming through boats? I guess you can do that! A plane that hovers in the sky and spins around firing lasers and dropping bombs? Sure!The myriad customization options keep me coming back to this game, whether it's to shoot up some baddies in my favorite armored death machine or if it's to try something new, like a ship that shoots ~10 bullets per second. Every run is as different as you want it to be.As far as the core mechanics, everything about this game justfeelsright. Things explode in satisfying ways, the controls are responsive if a bit (purposefully) unwieldy, and none of the options you can use for your plane will make you frustrated at how bad their disadvantages are. It is clear that the developers spent a lot of time fine-tuning things to make every run satisfying and fun."

There is also a lot of variation in planes, which you can customize. However, the games scoring and progression system is a bit lackluster, and becomes dull once youve unlocked all plane-parts. The game rewards you for combos, and gives up to 20x points if you rack up consecutive kills, making big targets that take long to kill pointless. The game does not reward you for killing the interesting enemies, and becomes boring if you, like myself, enjoy beating highscores."

,Recommended,233150,35407534,Posted: 2 October,all,WHAM,"Take to the air and raus, Raus, RAUS!This is a fairly simple little game, in which you pick up three parts of an aircraft: the nose, the hull and the tail, and then take to the air in an attempt to break your high score, complete sub-objectives and to see how long you can survive as the endless enemy onslaught piles on without mercy.Aircaft, boats, ships, jets and zeppelins are all out to get you, and you will die over and over again, making for quick, bite-sized snippets of gameplay. It all leads to a rather wonderful 'one more run' -feeling.The game opts for a stylized low-colour palette and simple, silhouette-based pixel art -style. The simplistic look of the game may turn some players away, as the game has something of a mobile-game look to it, but personally I found it quite pleasant to look at.For the last piece of loveliness: music. Whichever pieces of aircraft you choose, whether it be the beam-spewing laserrauser or chainsaw-nosed, surface-skipping murder-machine, the music adapts, using different overlaind parts of the soundtrack to give you variations of the main theme song of the game. Marching boots and electronica combine for one of the more enjoyable, if short and simple, game soundtracks. The variation helps minimize the sense of repetition.Luftrausers is not some great masterpiece or an epic journey, but it is a damn fun little game to waste a few hours on, and it remains as sone of my 'pick up to waste fifteen minutes' -games with ease.Playtime: 3+ hoursRatings (1-10)Visual: 8Audio: 9Story: N/AGameplay: 8Overall: 8"
