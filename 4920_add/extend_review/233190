,Recommended,233190,7758640,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,ButterflyRocket,"Fun game. Designed for up to 4 players. Solo play is possible, but slower paced I felt, as I went through the game solo. Game was a bit short, and you end up revisiting some levels. Character animations are good, and the level system is okay. Leaderboards might have its fair share of cheaters, but maybe a purge of sorts could be implemented.exploration thoughout the game is okay. i have yet to find all of the collectables to get the best weapons, and was able to join 2 games that were in progress online. Not for players expecting a wide range of enemies or deep story - it's all about collecting and killing for leaderboard supremacy.a very cool pick up game that supports the XBOX controller that shouldn't be missed."

I particularly liked that they didn't use zombies, instead opting for entirely original slime monsters. Reminds me a bit of a more melee focused Shoot Many Robots. The beat'em up action is pretty basic at first, but quickly gets more complex as you unlock skills.Pros:+ Great co-op gameplay+ Interesting monsters+ Long, involved multi-stage levels+ Levels are interesting and visually pleasing+ RPG-lite character upgradesCons:- Could have used more weapons and ways to customize your character- Levels get reused- Could have used a couple more monsters- 4 player co-op gets too hectic- Camera focuses on the 1st player which often results in other players getting pushed off screen"
,Recommended,233190,11681168,"Posted: 12 August, 2014",all,Evaheist,"A decent hack n'slash with decent length. Very shallow even though you can upgrade your different attributes and gain character-specific abilities. The levels are larger areas with many nooks and crannies to explore which leads to finding new weapons (close range and long range). There are 4 characters to choose from although the most difference comes from the special abilities which aren't that special. (added flame damage, electrical damage etc.)Local coop is nice but I'd recommend online coop because the camera only follows player 1 and there will be parts where dividing up will result in unmanagable chaos and/or backtracking. There are different kinds of enemies but generally all you do in the levels is the same no matter how diverse they feel: Kill loads of monsters, help an NPC with something or protect them and also item hunts.I'd say buy this in a sale and go in with very low expectations. The combat isn't deep and it all boils down to button mashing and building up massive combos. If you want to play single player, just forget this game it'll get boring really fast. Coop though is another story. The very definition of a bargain bin video game."
,Recommended,233190,9410399,"Posted: 10 March, 2014",all,AestheticGamer,"Final Exam is a spin-off from the ObsCure series of horror games, which there were two of for the PC, PS2, and Wii. Those games were Resident Evil clones set in a school setting and with heavy teen horror cliches. All characters were stereotypical, stupid, and various cliches of teen horror movies showed up in the game, and many teens died. The game had to do with a type of plant over growing and spreading something strange around... The game was also notable for being an old-school styled horror game with co-op, though no online.Well, the studio that made ObsCure games parent company was going down the shutter, the team disbanded from them, and then used their own money to buy the ObsCure IP back from them. They worked on a handheld spin-off, known for a while as Project Obscure, but changed the name to Final Exam so fans wouldn't throw a fit the game was too different from the ObsCure series, being a 2D Brawler and all of that. It's still set in the ObsCure universe though, just a lot more cartoony.Final Exam is a 2.5D Beat-Em-Up with a focus on 4-player co-op, and the studios first title as their new group. Also their first online title. The game is best described like a mixture of Devil May Cry meets Shoot Many Robots, as the combat has a surprising amount of depth to it, mixed with chipping enemies health away with guns, coming in and performing combos or stuns, dodging attacks, juggling enemies in the air, etc. you get a combo going, that is times and resets when hit. The game can get addicting to keep a combo going, especially as points are tied in to rankings, unlockables, and leaderboard, as well as experience. At any time, you can press a button to cash-in your combo and get the points from your current combo, which also resets the combo. But better than getting hit and losing it all, right? Or maybe you want to risk it and go higher...Experience helps learn more combos and abilities, and as the course of the game continues, you get a good variety of guns, melee weapons, and grenades to use, which all feel pretty different.The stages have a fun open-world style, with multiple objectives to do. You can, as a team, work with your friends to go location to location to complete objectives, or separate to complete different ones apart. Occassionally the game will throw some change of pace to keep things interesting. Objectives are sort of typical; go here and beat enemies, pick up these items and delver them to this point, push a kart and hold enemies off, escort a character, etc. Stages also have thing to discover by exploring, including new weapons, and extra skill points to increase character stats hidden around to collect.There's not really a strong story to it. There is some small story, even some extremely brief cutscenes, but no dialogue, and feel kind of like a missed opportunity as the game as a quirky comic-feel, and could be fun with some story humor. The presentation is nice though, and the music is fitting.The game has the flaw of re-using areas, though. They have different objectives and have changes to them, but in the games 8 stages, there are four locations, and you go to two of the locations three times. There is also only two bosses in the game, and one of them just keeps getting stronger and adding new moves over the course of the game. Enemies are varied though, and usually multiple types of a single enemy, all who get introduced well over the course of the game.I would say if you want a beat-em-up with friends, and don't mind a bit of tedium (maybe best played in spurts rather than all at once), to give it a shake. It has flaws, but also some charm with it, and the combat is well-done."

What I like in the game is that your playing as high school students who fight off green monsters (It's a nice break from zombies to be honest), The story is about 4 students who were going to a party because school is almost over for them but while the four of them were driving to the party a random monster spawns out of nowhere and one of the students freak out & crash (Do you see where this is going?) so basically the objective of this game is to survive the apocalypse kinda.Pros: Lots of weapons, Decent combat, Lots of replayability & Decent musicCons: Too short (It's only 8 chapters long) & You always have to fight the same boss (He's A Big Monster) all the time but at least they made the end boss differentOverall this game is only average but if you like beat em up platformers that involve monster bashing then this game is for you.

,Not Recommended,233190,7781256,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,okram2k,"Released this week on steam for $9.99 (or $29.99 for a four-pack if you happen to have four friends to play with) is a “2.5D sidescroller” smash’em up: Final Exam from Mighty Rocket Studio. A slick looking online multiplayer supported smash ‘em up to make the tried and true transition from Xbox Live and Playstation Network onto Valve’s Steam.So four characters that look like they should be featured in a ‘where are they now?’ of The Breakfast Club are on their way to a High School Alumni Party. The Jocky Football guy, artsy chick, nerdy boy, and token minority (not sure which, but his skin is darker than the others) happen to be adequately trained with martial arts, explosives, and the use of several types of firearms. Since this is not a game about awkward realization that everyone else in high school has moved on with their lives and become adults instead of trying to relive their glory days into their late 20′s their car runs into a hoard of monsters, you grab a pistol and baseball bat with nails driven into it, and start a swinging.Each character specializes on a few key skills, Jock is the big melee bruiser, nerd is the tank / explosives expert, Artsy chick is good with firearms and melee, while token guy is good at guns and explosives. Gameplay is smooth and well polished. If you’ve played any 2d style smash ‘em up since River City Ransom you know how this all works (even down to enemies dropping food, ammo, and grenades for some reason when they die). Go from objective to objective smashing things as you go. It’s certainly done well with beautiful polished levels sporting impressive backdrops along the way. If anything the levels are TOO well detailed as some areas can have quite a bit of clutter in the background but overall the game does a great job of offering you plenty of eye candy and a never ending stream of monsters to smash.As you progress through the game you earn skill points to unlock special moves and such as well as character points to add to your character’s abilities. Basically it improves damage dealt and how much hp you have. It’s an interesting RPG element designed specifically to add longevity to a rather simple and straight forward smashing game. While it certainly is nice to make your character more powerful and makes you want to scour every level for every collectable and weapon to get all the unlocks, the abilities are actually counter-productive to their longevity cause. See with all the new weapons you find and new abilities and stats you get your character becomes too badass and frankly the combat starts to get too repetitive and dull.The game is broken up into several missions at the end of which you are rewarded for how well you completed it. More points means more skill points. I think though the missions are just a bit too long as some of them really start to wear on me and often times I was just hoping it would hurry up and end. Also the objectives in each mission are pretty much typical copy and paste stuff that feels rather dull and uninspired. After having to fetch crap (be it gas cans, weapons, machine parts, lab assistants, or children) every single mission you get rather tired of it after a while. And while the game has a pretty cool and perhaps a little edgy (and chuckle worthy) style the story is just so inanely pointless I have no investment in it or the characters to care enough to keep playing.I was ready to praise Final Exam, for the first few hours I played it was fun, fast, furious, and a fresh break from the usual slow paced games I play. Online was likewise even more fun and a great fast paced romp with random strangers. But after the sixth mission I just hit a wall and suddenly I didn’t care anymore. I’ve killed a thousands of these dang monsters, only have a faint idea why and really don’t care if I save the day or not. Just about every mute NPC that I’ve come across in my journey who helped me ended up dying in some kinda humorous way (usually squashed by a mini-boss) and I was just tired of the game.This game made me seriously consider just how long should a game keep me entertained? Obviously it should do so at least from beginning to end, which sadly Final Exam fails for me. But even if it did keep you satisfied to the end you might replay the game again just to get all the unlocks. But then what? Once you’ve filled out all the skill and ability trees there’s really little to do unless you’re the kind of person who wants to get their name up on a high score list. This is clearly a throw-away game at best that you play through once or twice maybe with a couple friends and then forget it ever existed. It’s almost sad really, as the developers did a great job of making a crisp clean and pretty fighting game. But repetitive boring mission objectives that have been used a million times in MMO grinds (go here, collect, bring back. Go here, escort, bring back. Go here, kill, kill, kill, kill, keep killing, and kill some more.) ruined an excellent fighting game. Combined with a completely uninteresting generic carbon copy story that gives me absolutely no connection or reason to keep going and we have a game that really falls up short.If you like smash’em up games I might suggest giving it a try but don’t expect anything life changing.Final Score:Graphics: 8.5/10Game Play: 7/10Music / Ambiance: 9/10Story: 1/10Value: 5/10Overall: 6.1/10Read more reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com/"

,Recommended,233190,35286201,Posted: 29 September,all,Karma,"+ Fun+ Runs well+ Collectables mean something- Online is empty- Online people hog kits/don't let you explore- Mic only in-game (text window only in lobby)- No bots to help you, not even in singleplayer (may be a turn off for some players)Very fun, however I only find solo fun when I know what to do on the campaigns. Otherwise it is boring, specially on some where you need to collect so much on your own to bring back to one area.Most enjoyed when people join you online however that seems minimal as online is always empty. I gotten maybe 1-2 people to join but only within 1 hour of my time-zone and the rest just being empty! So be sure to add people who have the game and want to play (feel free to add me)There are collectables and weapons and you actually need to find them not only to upgrade your skills/character but also to get the top rank (gold). Points alone will not get you gold which is pretty cool, they mean something.However this is a pain because if you do find players online they most likely rush the objective and lock you out of an area where a weapon/collectable was which is a pain. You cannot tell them unless you have a mic either and most times they will ignore you. So again make sure you have friends or play on EASY PEASY to find the collectables.I want this game to be more popular, it is a nice beat-em up and online mode when you can find players. So get it but maybe when it is on sale due to the lack of players playing online. However if you need an online buddy, just add and shoot a comment my way when you want to play."

,Not Recommended,233190,29282929,Posted: 15 January,all,eXcruciate,"It is fun for a few levels and has really great graphics but it quickly devolves into a painfully barbaric button masher. I kept going anyway for sake of being fair in my review. Playing on medium, the game was never challenging then on the last boss comes the biggest difficulty spike I have ever seen. I had said before the worst last boss I have ever seen was in Bound by Flame, and yea that one is beyond words. This game easily equals that, and is maybe even worse.He changes forms 3 times, possibly more, and each form takes a ton of hits while you get flooded by enemies and take major dmg from falling rocks and ground spikes. You can dodge the obstacles easy enough but even only a few hits leaves you in serious trouble during the second form when you have to fight the double behemoths. The fight takes FOREVER and if at any point you use all 3 lives which is easy to do, you have to do the whole long, button mashing boring fight over. Also, changing the difficulty to easy didn't do a single thing. The boss still took the same amount of hits and the enemies still did the same amount of dmg to me and spawned in the same amount too. The whole fight is just purely god awful.I was going to give this around a 5/10 which is on average what the critics gave it, but because of the last boss being so sickening, 3/10 avoid like the ♥♥♥♥ing plague."

Beat up some monsters, pick up the bulky key item you just dropped and move another ten seconds or so in the direction of your objective before being forced to drop said item yet AGAIN to beat up some MORE monsters!  I mean, I know it's a ""beat-'em-up"", but cooooome oooooon!!  Things can be a little less relentless/tedious than that.It also has an inordinately large number of ""escort"" missions, some of which are admittedly very amusing - carrying a candy dispenser to get the fat kid to follow you, or scaring another kid in the direction you want them to go by wearing a giant rabbit head and going ""boogie woogie""! - but having to constantly make sure they're keeping up with you, when the game is already a race against time to make it that extra ten feet before you have to stop/drop everything for yet another same-ish battle DOES get a bit tiresome.Having said that, the escort missions are perhaps the things which give this game much of its ""character"", as without them, it really is just running around pummelling or shooting things.  Bit of a catch-22 somewhere there, one suspects...Look, the graphics are lovely, the sound is fine (even if the groovy/spooky music gets a tad repetitious, like everything else), and the gameplay is fun enough in small doses (a notion not exactly helped by the fact that you can't save in the middle of a ""chapter"", and have to see the whole thing through in one sitting unless you feel like starting from scratch again next time).  I found myself quite unable, in any case, to play for much more than an hour or so at a time, as it really does get a tad ""old"" kinda fast.Mostly recommended for the die-hard beat-'em-up crowd...for the rest of us, we'll probably ""get the idea"" within the first couple of hours of gameplay, and be sufficiently satisfied by that.  I know I was...and that's probably why I'm giving up about half-way through the game (which I may not have done, granted, if I were able to jump into it for only twenty minutes at a time, but the aforementioned save system nixes all that...in all other regards, however, this is the very definition of ""casual"" gaming).One thing I will say in the game's defense is that it really IS meant to be a multiplayer game, so I perhaps partly have myself to blame for playing it solo.  Just the same, a bit more variety wouldn't have hurt either the single OR multi-player mode (heck, even reducing the endless amounts of ""back-tracking"" may have done wonders)!  Recommended, yes, but only for the right kind of people, in the right kind of numbers.Verdict: 7/10.(PS  Oddly enough, this game has vague tie-ins with the Obscure series of survival horror games.  If for no reason other than it being from the same developers/publishers, and featuring the same high school and some of the same characters.  And that's about where the similarities end.  It's a strange world, sometimes...)"

I really hope they make some DLC or a second game. I've only played a couple of hours but very impressed.Final Exam combines retro style beat em up style game play with good graphics and modern gameplay stuff such as character levels, skills points and coop team work. Think Streets of Rage/Double Dragon meets Left for Dead or Killing Floor.I guess to sum it up ""Sidescroller Left For Dead"" would nail it!Basically you and your friends play through a platformer game and a story with 10 levels currently. It all sounds simple but there's lots of nice twists along the way it's not just hack and slash, game play is diverse enough that each level is different from the last and it keeps you interested. Each level you will have objectives to complete whilst smashing monsters and leveling up. You get a certain number of lives but can be revived by friends, you'll need to work together to make sure items are shared out properly and you have the right specced characters to complete the game. The game play is pretty quick and you need to watch carefully for changes in levels as new things like background objects, re spawning monsters or level secrets keep you busy there's not much standing around admiring the well designed graphics. The bosses I've encountered are defiantly a nice challenge the first time you fight them.Anyway....level objectives consist of finding objectives, escorting an NPC, moving something from A to B and occasionally surviving a horde it's pretty simple but very fun. You will encounter new missions and plenty of variety as  you go through the game, there's some nice game play features which are clearly borrowed from games like Sonic The Hedgehog, Battle Toads, Golden Axe and many of classic console titles.There are many different attacks, skills and enough character customization to make this repayable on harder difficulties. Max health is your friend!!!!!!!!The characters and controls are pretty standard to platform players and you'll quickly recognise character wise one is ranged, one is tanky and one is melee with a jack of all trades, however you can assign skill points and items however you want.The tutorial is nice and simple and teaches you the basics, the combos and monsters are fun and the art style, sounds and graphics are all pretty cool and this game is stable, solid and well thought out. There's some nice humour in this game but I'd imagine single player it wouldn't be as good so I'd recommend picking up with at least 1 other person, I'm playing 3 player which is just enough it's not to chaotic.If you want a cheap coop game with 5-10 hours game play with friends go for it. Oh and there's full controller support if you have USB pad but it's fine on keyboard and mouse. Just make sure you like beat em up/platformer games first.WE NEED DLC/NEW LEVELS OR A 2ND GAME!"

But after playing for an hour i feel like i have wasted my time despite the fact that the levels aren't that bad in design and ideas.I guess it's to repetitive to pummel zombiealiens into the ground and dodge my♥♥♥♥♥away from more then two of them.Picking up items in a single player game is just redundant button bashing on top of the required buttonbashing...which is also too much to have fun with it.The game lacks basic fun elements as well ( besides the funny character animations ) that could have made the repetitive pain in this game somewhat bareable like a funny voice remark from the character or some funny references or easter eggs. but i doubt i'm gonna encounter much of them if i push myself into playing another hour.It's a real shame because this game had potential....too bad it didn't work out."

So i know a good game on eyesight.Series i've played : DnD arcade, Cadilacs and Dinos, Captain commando, Steet of rage, Double Dragon, Battletoads, Final fight, Dynasty warriors, Samurai warriors, Devil kings, Fighting Force, Gaiapolis, Lightbringer, Night slashers, and so many i cannot remmeber all of them. So lets start with it already.-The controls on this game are awfully hard to master. They are way too unconventional. Even after getting used to it, it won't feel right.-Every stage is the same boss, but greenier.-Only 1 monster: A green alien thing. Then a green flying alien thing. Then a green crawling alien thing. So on.-Inifinite monster spawn on your face, making your progress throught the game very slow, as you are constantly fighting something.-Goofy animations. Feels like  a cartoon or something like that.-Special atks aren't satisfying as they should be.-Granades are the best way to win any fight.-All the weapons are the same: Some do slightly higher damage with lower stk spd, some with high stk spd but lower damage, overall they kill an enemy in the same amount of time. So what is the point in that ? Maybe just aethetics for players to choose a shotgun or a rifle.-Objetives in this game make you feel like a delivery-boy, not a apocalypse zombie/alien thing.-The game has very stupid mini-games that are unskippable.-Some specs are very underpowered. Like a certain character deals more damage in AoE with 1 bar than 4 bars on single target.-You can afk highscore. Just leave some weight on your controller or keyboard and kill infinite monsters till you reach your desired score.-Doesn't feel like other beat'em ups that you always want to punch something.

This game takes a boat load of the elements previously stated and mash them all into one game (I'm sure I'm missing a few or several, but I've nailed what's important to me).Slightly vague storyline, but you can still enjoy this without paying attention to it. Gameplay is fun all the way through. Controls are fluid. There are plenty of options to killing certain enemies (e.g. I'll melee an enemy in neutral with a baseball bat or machete, knock them up in the air and shoot them with my machine gun or jump in the air to finish my ridiculous combo). There's a lot to collect, plenty of upgradable choices for your favorite characters (mine is the Geek). I honestly could've stopped at my first sentence but there's definitely more to this game that I haven't mentioned.There's nostalgia written all over this game. Think of it as an over the top Final Fight, except the ""Fight"" was replaced with ""Exam"" throw a bunch of zombie like creatures in it, give your characters some guns and you've got yourself an A+."

The best thing about it is that you are not stuck to a shared screen like most beat'em'ups. It's also quite good for keeping your character in the foreground so you won't lose yourself!Great 4 player game."

Online coop makes this even all the more better.  With up to 4 players at once there's lots of action going on.  Some missions you'll have to even guard your team mates while they take on other obstacles.  Not happy with previous scores go back and play the stage again.  Show your friends what's up with you reigning supreme with top scores!  If you like beat'em ups might as well check this one out.  Good fun!"

I was hoping for a boss at the end of every level. It was disappointing to find out that all of the boss, except the final boss, were variations of the tank NPC, which began spawning regularly at later levels. A lot of the unique events are fun, including a parade float mounted with a rocket launcher, two miniguns, and flamethrowers. The combat system was unique but easy to learn. There are different types of attacks to use, but there are no combos besides the standard ""click left mouse three times"" combo. You put your own combos together, which I like a lot. Playing with friends is a blast."

,Recommended,233190,20173285,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,whitmer_zach,"Probably one of the best side scroller beat em ups Ive ever played. The graphics are gorgeous, some of best lighting ive seen in a game. Gameplay is truly top notch and very addicting. Love how each character has their own skill tree for most part and their own abilities, really makes replay value high. Levels and very fun to play through, multiple layers to them to suggest exploration but not confusing to where it gets frustrating. Bought this for $4 and change couple months ago and really one of best games ive bought on steam. Havent tried coop but I know it only adds to the experience.Only gripes are I wish it was 4 player local coop and there were more characters. There are 4 which is fine but more would definitely be welcome. Also wish there was a way to track mission progress like collectibles. Im totally nuts when it comes to finding collectibles so knowing how many I have found during a mission is crucial to me.Amazing game, solid 10/10 for its genre"

Sadly, not many people play this game at the present time. I feel like this game needs more missions with more variety, not only in the stages but in the enemies. The current missions are just the same stages revisited, and the monsters are all the same."

Great hack'n'slash combat, a neat little character progression system, and a solid musical score. My only gripe is that *SPOILERS* a couple of the levels are used more than once. But the level design is great, so I didn't mind playing the one or two levels a second time."
