,Recommended,233210,11721098,"Posted: 15 August, 2014",all,Thunderthud,"‘Air Conflicts Vietnam’ is a mixed bag but most people who have posted reviews seem to have only played about 25% of the game and so, unlike myself, I would suggest that what they say is not a representation of the full game and should be taken with a pinch of salt. This game, though I do enjoy it, is not worth the current £13.59 (or your regional equivalent) price tag. I would advise that if you are interested in this game wait until it is on sale, it may not be for everyone and I can see a lot of its issues killing the game for some.To address some of the common complaints I have seen about this game; the controls are a little strange and quite sensitive but after a little while you can get used to them. I find that it is perfectly playable with mouse and keyboard, though controller support is also available. The map areas are small only in some missions, keep playing and you will discover that is far from the norm and in many missions I never saw the edges of the map. Finally, as I understand multiplayer does work but only if you are playing the beta version of the game, however I doubt you will find anyone to play with at this point.I will start by saying that this is not a realistic ‘simulator’ and though I prefer realistic games, I do find ‘Air Conflicts Vietnam’ enjoyable. It is however, fairly authentic while not being entirely realistic and this is one of its greatest strengths.In addition to all the positive and negative points I will make about this game, I would like to mention a few interesting things which may be overlooked. As a nod to their Second World War titles, you can find the wrecks of an F4U and an A6M on certain levels and if collected they will be added to your aircraft inventory, allowing you to fly them in custom battles. To illustrate the inherent unreliability of air-to-air missiles during this period, the game gives you the option to change between five different accuracy settings of 20-100%. Interestingly every plane and helo has its own realistic cockpit which is well modelled (though arguably textured poorly) and you can also look around them using the directional view controls. Lastly, missions require you to use more than one aircraft which allows for variety within each mission and highlights the relationships between different aircraft types of the war.A positive in my book are that the damage models of aircraft which are (comparatively) reasonably authentic, despite the game’s use of health bars and damage not effecting flying characteristics. This is with the exception of the helos which are figuratively flying tanks due to the design on the missions. The game also includes visual models which reflect damage taken. While flight models are arcady, there is an hair of realism here too, with the handling and performance of aircraft being authentically depicted. The ordnance aircraft carry is true to the era and is portrayed reasonably well with the exception of unrealistic loadouts which are required to complete arcade style missions which heavily feature target rich environments. There is a variety of ordnance modelled, however disappointingly the game lacks the AIM-7 Sparrow leaving you just the AIM-9 Sidewinders and your gun(s) for aerial combat. Just like the real air war in Vietnam, this game heavily features ground attack missions with MiG engagements being few and far between. Though this realistically represents the air war in Vietnam, it may be a thing to keep in mind if you're just looking for a MiG-fest. However there is an instant action game mode where you can just fight AI. The missions are varied and the terrain looks good, with the campaign taking approximately 8-9 hours and spanning the entirety of the war. Missions are plentiful in number and variety here and show a side to the Vietnam War which is not often portrayed.To start on the negatives, the AI is not that great. They only serve to be a real threat when they are either in great numbers, or attacking aircraft you have to protect. Though this is not too much of a problem because, as I have mentioned, killing MiGs is not the main portion of this game. In custom battles against the AI you can ramp up their numbers to make it more challenging but even then it is still not that great. When in the gunner view of a UH-1 or CH-47 you can throw grenades to kill tanks with a single hit, another peculiar element which adds to the UFO-like behaviour of transport helo gameplay. You also use an M2 and not the iconic M60 so synonymous with the Vietnam War in these sequences which was a little disappointing. Though the game is loosely based on a true story and highlights many aspects of the U.S. populous’ feelings toward the Vietnam War, it is executed poorly due to bad writing and voice acting. You play the role of a U.S. Navy pilot but this simply serves as an excuse to put you in the war. In reality you fly a multitude of Navy and Air Force aircraft which translates to F-100s and F-105s sitting on the flight deck of the USS Enterprise in the menu screens. Aircraft are dictated by the mission and even when replaying you cannot chose which aircraft you wish to fly. This is not a terrible thing though as you are given the aircraft you need, with the payloads you need to complete the missions. However, when the game decides to switch your aircraft during missions for different tasks, its choice is sometimes…questionable. For example; one mission starts you bombing in an F-4 Phantom, some MiGs roll in and now you are flying an A-4 Skyhawk. The bad AI makes this playable but it struck me as poorly thought out. Finally on a more technical note ‘Air Conflicts Vietnam’ lacks the ability to change screen resolution and its option menus in general are very sparse.Though not outright negatives, in this paragraph I will address some to the more goofy development decisions that went into this game. Worth a small mention is that some missions, for whatever reason, start you facing the opposite way to the direction you are meant to be heading. The developers obviously used a lot of assets from their previous Second World War titles and this results in some…odd experiences. There are a few different ships in game but apart from the USS Enterprise, they are all Second World War vintage DDs and subs. The U.S. Army are equipped with Sherman tanks and though the devs took the time to model T-55s, PT-76s, and ZSU-23-4s for the PAVN, even then they also use Second World War Japanese tanks! During one part in the game a PAVN soldier is supposedly talking but he is clearly speaking Japanese and not Vietnamese. Another thing I noticed is that the description for the F4U on the carrier is actually for an F4F, an aircraft not even in the game! When you pass other planes and helos at close range it sounds like you are actually passing a prop aircraft. The cut scene graphics are, for some reason, worse than the in-game ones (not that they are bad) and they often look out of focus. With all of these problems I just found it hilarious that there is a wide array of sea life in the Gulf of Tonkin which is only seen in one mission. Whales, dolphins…it just makes me think; why did they not model an M48 Patton instead?In sum, this can be a fun game but is far from perfect and certainly not without its flaws. It feels rushed and unpolished with many elements that I do not doubt will put some off the game completely but if you are able to look past a lot of the bad there is also good here and persistence, I found, brought that out in this game. Not exactly a glowing review but there are two sides to every coin."

Controls wise it is likewise messed up, without much functionality for changing the axis of various manuevers. In the jets, C-123 etc, there isn't even an independent rudder/aileron control that I've found-so if you pull up then want to roll, it ends up sending you in some crazy direction of its own devising. (I've played it with mouse/keyboard and 360 controller; it's possible that it's better/more adjustable with a joystick but the game turned me off so much I didn't go to the trouble of plugging in my stick)The maps are tiny (so tiny that in a jet, I went from out of bounds to out of bounds in less than 10 seconds while trying to kill a MiG) and the voice acting is corny at best.I hoped that the helicopter mode would be better, but no. Clunky controls, no way to change rudder/attitude controls, massively sluggish yaw. No challenge in attack chopper so far-you sit back in your AH-1 and lob in rockets from way outside the range of the enemy.This game would have been good ten or fifteen years ago. As a 2013 title, noooo way.Definitely not worth $30; I would probably still regret this purchase if it was $10. Very disappointed."

,Not Recommended,233210,9028449,"Posted: 9 February, 2014",all,KarateKite,"Air Conflicts: Vietnam is disappointing to me seeing as I really liked the previous Air Conflicts games. The previous games were all about fast arcade-style air-to-air and air-to-ground combat in large open arenas, and Vietnam basically gets all of those points wrong. The maps are very small and often obscured by low fog, so you're constantly going past the map's walls. The controls are fiddly and strange, nothing at all like the fluidity of Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers (which I think is the high point of the franchise).By far the worst thing about the game is that it interrupts gameplay to deliver cutscenes after the completion of each goal, and these interruptions are frequent. Your goal might be to take out three AA emplacements — which you'll get done within 1-3 minutes since the maps are so small — and then you'll sit through a 20 or 30 second cutscene with hammy voice acting. This will happen about five times per mission.Give this a miss and try out Pacific Carriers instead. Secret Wars is okay too. I regret buying this game."
76561198188787550,Not Recommended,233210,17004689,"Posted: 11 July, 2015",all,Splinterfuzz,"Review based on the current beta build at the time of this review.A game that could have been better, the graphics aren't bad and the era is one not often seen in flight games.  I had written an initial ""not recommended"" review but retracted it when they released a beta patch adding a new flight model and some other changes in order to give it a 2nd chance.  However it must be said that there is  still more wrong than right with this game.JET FLIGHT: You have two choices of which are flying like a car, or flying with a buggy ""simulation"" mode in which aircraft controls don't function properly.  For some examples: applying right rudder has 0 yaw effect and will roll your plane over toward the left, or how banking can have little or no effect on turning.HELO FLIGHT: Large improvement over pre-beta.  Helicopter flight actually felt decent and the bindings were an improvement from before.  The main bother here is the dodge mechanic which lets the helo suddenly jerk left or right.  It doesn't look so bad in cockpit view but out of cockpit it looks ridiculous.WEAPONS: Very auto-aim based, get in the general proximity with the sight and watch the bullets fly from your jet as if they were coming from a turret in the nose.  Missiles can be adjusted to varying degrees of accuracy, generally not an issue.  Bomb view is limited to straight flight when in simulation, no rudder control due to the bug for fine adjustments.  Applying rudder or banking will pull you out of bomber view.  This game would strongly benefit from the option to use a mouse for the door gunner while using a flightstick for the helicopter as well.AI: Not much to say but if you control any aircraft during mission the AI will no longer function on that aircraft for the remainder of said mission.  (That aircraft will just keep flying straight.)STORY: The story really had no draw to it, you hear the narration of some letters from the main pilot and to the main pilot as well as the general briefing for missions but they lack any emotional draw and just didn't engage me as a player.  On another down note to story there is almost no radio chatter during missions to draw you into the story and it creates a very hard separation between the missions and the cuts between them.  What little chatter there is is comparable to the the movie Sharknado and the cuts during missions feel just as dry and out of context as the cuts inbetween missions.Overall the gameplay in simulation is undesireable due to the current bugs with no sign of developer feedback.  Unfortunately while arcade works better I have serious issues calling games with the ""flying car"" model of flight a flight game in this day and age.  Air Conflicts Vietnam is a game that has or had a lot of potential that just isn't coming through.  Is it redeemable, I'd say yes... however it will take more than I believe they are willing to do at this stage considering they have mentioned work on an expansion.  In its current state this game comes off as dry, repetitive, buggy, pretty  much uninteresting, and I just can't recommend it."

This really is not on the same level as Pacific carriers or Secret wars.  Maps that are too small, graphics that don't hold up visually at close range, and the entirety of the gameplay feels like a bunch of quick-time events. They build up the complexity of the mission in the briefing, but then you drop one bomb on a location and you're instantly into the next phase. Helo controls are not good at all, the F-4 is too fast to stay in the map, missile targetting is non-existent, and the wingmen do nothing but chase the seven or eight enemy that all gang up on you alone. They don't even fire on them! Door-gunning in the Huey is laughable, using an MG to blast open an armored ZSU-23-4? Rail shooters never looked so boring.On the point of controls, I have to complain heavily on the fact that I can't seem to alter the keyboard assignments at all, yet the landing gear (which you NEVER USE TO LAND) are on the same key as the after-burners?  Was this a test by the programmers to see how frustrated they can make their users with a little flashing ""gear down"" indicator every time they try to chase down an enemy?Finally, the story. Yes, Vietnam was a mistake. Yes a lot of people died for ridiculous reasons. I can even go along with a family's fears because their sons are off fighting, it's dramatic. But you really don't need to bemoan the pointlessness of the war while forcing me to endure such a painfully sub-par game. It's a bit redundant. After six missions, I started skipping the depressing commentary entirely. You wasted money and time on your writers, folks.And they still have the gall to charge 29.99?  I'm glad I got it on a Steam Sale for dirt cheap."

AAAAHHH! They detract massively from the Cobra sequences. With a Cobra, all you do is just fire Hydra rockets and pulverise everything. Its great funThe jet fighter sequences are a bit lame.

I enjoy the Vietnam addition, however there are some issues that take away from enjoying this title compared to it's predecessors. I'll keep this short and simple. There are some of the most iconic planes and helicopters in the post WWII era, and they have managed to do a good job in the graphic and loadout department. The size of the conflict zones is sometimes so small, that you find yourself constantly having to manuever your aircraft to avoid going, ""out of bounds"", as it were. This drastically lowers the possible enjoyment of many campaign scenarios, which I find frustrating. I haven't tried the multiplayer so I can't speak for that part, as of yet, but unfortunately I find myself on the edge of a question. Would I recommend this game to a friend? Sadly, the answer is no but, once again, I'm on the fence here. Whereas I find many aspects of the gameplay questionable another person may love it. So, who am I to say, ""don't purchase this game"". Well, so much for short and simple. Also, I can't quite place my finger on it, but there's just something missing in this Vietnam release."

It is NOT a sim by any definition I would use.  However it can be fun.  That being said, I have found that many people are in the same situation that I find myself.  Operation Gamewarden is a two part mission.  The first part you are flying a F-4 Phantom.  Not bad.  The second part you are flying a Chinook low to drop seals and must remain undetected.  The helicopter controls are a bit clunky but with some work you can get the hang of them. After spending more time than I care to admit trying to complete this mission, I have given up.

I give a lot of credit towards the developers with the wide range of assorted aircraft during the 60's/70's. The soundtrack is good or unique in a sense ,yet after a couple missions they get really beaten to death since they wrote original songs for this game with some range of genres too. I'll be honest by saying that the story isn't interesting at all even though I'm not that far into the game. Some other things that bother me with what the developers did was mainly the grid they put into each of the combat airspaces giving you only so much room to fly yet it's not all that bad, but it takes away from ""some"" of the immersion. Graphically this game is beautiful despite all the nay-sayers are saying how this seems dated which on the ground it does but its really gorgeous up in the skies of vietnam while you're chasing screaming Migs.Another small thing that bothers me too is during helicopter gameplay your seated in the Co-Pilot seat of lets say the Hueys and Chinooks when in reality they should of had you sitting in the actual pilot seat.These are just some of the things that popped at me with my short time of playing this but I'm going to enjoy it nonetheless.If you are on the fence about picking this title up my best advice is to wait for it to be on sale instead of paying full price since you don't have too much to loose."

,Recommended,233210,11747758,"Posted: 16 August, 2014",all,atAHRI-2600,"Reports of this game's flaws are largely exaggerated.In the case of Air Conflicts: Vietnam while many of the complaints are valid they are also blown way out of proportion. The game's controls are a tad on the sensitive side and take some adjusting to, but they are simple and easy to learn. I have yet to run into a mission I could not complete, although the allied AI is certainly useless 99% of the time, but this does not stop the game from being enjoyable. The soundtrack is great, if not a little repetative. This is definitely not Ace Combat, but it also doesn't need to be to do what it does well.Pros:-Good Soundtrack-Good mix of fighter, bomber, attack helo, and support helo-Simple Controls for easy access to non-simulator flying fansCons:-Brainless ally AINeeds Work:-Voice Acting-Script Writing(generally we call it anti-air and not double A)Overall, if you want a period game that you can quickly pick up play for a bit and then put down without a hastle, this is it. Though I suggest grabbing it when it's on sale, like I did, it's fun just not full price game fun."

Keep in mind I am playing this on a Mac so I felt that maybe it was something to do with the platform, but then again, this game **is** compatible with the Mac platform.Anyway, so I posted a dicussion here, over a year ago highlighting the aforementioned issue:https://steamcommunity.com/app/233210/discussions/0/611704730315759849/Left it for a week after posting then I got bored and deleted the game off of my Steam account. Came back to the game today to try it again - who knows, maybe I missed something first time around.lol, nope.Got to the same mission, and the same problem presented. No mouse clicker on the screen to select the Huey.Go back to the same forum topic I posted and was equally amazed and appalled that NOT ONE RESPONSE BY THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEVELOPERS WAS MADE.A WHOLE YEAR.IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO GET A MOUSE TO WORK ON A GAME.IT IS NOT HARD TO PROGRAM THE MOUSE TO PERFORM BASIC FUNCTIONALITY LIKE SELECTING ANOTHER HELICOPTER.So I give this game a 3/10. The good:- Beautiful Graphics, even on Medium.- Transistion between Airplanes and Helicopters is fun.And the bad:- Developers clearly do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their PAYING CUSTOMERS.- Broken game on Mac.- Awful dialogue.- Even worse control layout.Whoever coined up this game. Please. Do not make another game in your life, if you cannot be bothered to tend the games you already have. This could be a FANTASTIC game if you weren't so inattentive to your consumer needs. Either that, or do not enable multi-platform playability if you CANNOT PLAY IT."

It`s not a patch on Air conflicts secret war, that games actually fun.I selected dogfight in this and am still looking for someone to shoot at, I guess they forgot to put adversaries in there or they`re so scared of my awesome flying skills they`ve all scarpered....You WILL spend most of your time turning around and flying in circles in this game to keep in that ridiculously small playing area, you can literally start at one end, count to ten and you have to turn around again or the game ends.Thumbs down.Edit:-I came back to take a look at this title as I`d heard that a lot of work had been done, the game had been updated and everything was peaches and cream... and tickety boo.Don`t believe a word of it.SAME teeeeny tiny ""battle area"" and no discernable changes, AT ALL.When I selected single player,  the game ASKED me what aeroplane I wanted to fly and accepted the input of ""F4 Phantom""... - either they don`t know what F4 phantoms look like or theres another bug as the plane displayed was a sabre..   I also noticed that despite selecting ""Instant dogfight"" there was absolutely no sign anywhere of an opponent, so exactly the same issues I saw when I first purchased this game are still there.I timed myself flying from one side to the other in a sabreIt took 28 seconds...28 seconds to fly across your entire game area....Keep flying and it ends the game and throws you out.If there are ""improvements"", I`d love to know where they are, because to my eyes this game is exactly the same rubbish I voted down when I bought it.Save your money, there are FAR better games out there."

The story makes you feel slightly guilty about happily gunning down vietcong on missions by reminding you that your family is slowly drifting away from you and joining the anti-war movement. The game's soundtrack, however, seems a bit out of place. For the ideal Vietnam experience, mute the music and put on Spotify 60's radio station instead. :)"

It reflects very well how people from homefront thinked about this ""war"" First they are proud about how U.S is helping South Vietnam to battle agains communism. When this conflicts takes longer and people from U.S sees horrors of this conflict and  more and more U.S soldier die on Vietnam and protests and general feel about U.S involment in Vietnam was growing stronger. This reflects on story as you family questions about you and how can you kill innocent people.But sad that game itself is not so good. Flying and graphics are good. Only very low frames animated soldiers on ground looking stupid. But i still recomend this game if you find it on good sale."
