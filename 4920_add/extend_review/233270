This is absolutely hilarious. The gameplay is actually really good too. If you liked Far Cry 3 then you will like this one a lot. All the same amazing gameplay features that made Far Cry 3 so fun are there.The environment is always dark so when you get your rifle upgraded to laser ammunition then you end up watching a laser show in every gunfight.You will think you are Kurt Russell half the time.Even the voice acting is old school...the lead character being played by the guy from the original Terminator.There are dragons with laser beams shooting out of them which is always a plus. I could go on further but like I said...80s, dragons and laser guns. Too cool"

,Recommended,233270,16259005,"Posted: 8 June, 2015",all,Tom,"Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon is an 80s sci-fi parody, with childish humor and old school gun play mechanics, similar to the likes of Duke Nukem or Serious Sam.The gameplay is virtually identical to Far Cry 3, all the same controls, weapons just have different skins. The stealth side of Blood Dragon is very key. You find your self having to stalk around dinosaurs in order to reach objectives, along with the regular stalking through bases to switch off alarm systems etc. I personally like to play Far Cry as stealthy as possible and then go gung-ho with weapons once I inevitably get caught. I really enjoyed using the bow and arrow in Blood Dragon, more so than in Far Cry 3, maybe it was because it has a cool bluey glow effect! Another nice addition, since you are a human cyborg, you no longer take fall damage. There is a hunting side to be found here too, b ut not as in depth as Far Cry 3, its merely there for an achievement purpose from what I could see.Graphics wise, we are looking at another re-skin of Far Cry 3, everything in Blood Dragon is darker and has the sci-fi look to it, with lots of glowing,  shinny, and metallic looking objects.The main story is full of cheesy one liners and plot twists, but still has a convincing and interesting story line to want to play it. If you were to purchase Blood Dragon just for the story alone, you will probably be disappointed.This is another open world, it does a couple of things differently to Far Cry 3 though. First of all, without wanting to spoil too much, there are tons of hidden Easter eggs found throughout the map that will give you a good chuckle. The map size it self is a little bit bigger than the first island you find yourself on in FC3, Sadly it lacks a little depth here, unlike in FC3, you  can't find many hidden secrets which reveal more about the story and characters,This is one of the few games that I have actually found my self playing through for a second time. My first playthrough done on normal mode, and second on harder mode. This added to the replay ability for me. You can also spend a lot of time working on (dirty) uPlay achievements, although some may not find this as attractive as Steam achievements, which is something Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon miss. You can if you work hard enough and plan things out, reach about 80% of completing the game fully on your first playthrough, alot will be time consuming though, be warned.My first play through was finished in six or seven hours or so, this was completing all of the side missions as well as a little achievement gathering. Sadly it seems a little short for what you are paying, but all of the other aspects of the game make up for it.Final thoughts on Blood Dragon, well, I would recommend people pick it up. The game brings back fun into a game without sacrificing core gameplay. I had fun playing from beginning to end. When you do complete Blood Dragon, it will leave you wanting more.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If you really can't get it working there's enough help on the internet that it shouldn't remain a problem for you.""requires too much stealth"" - how did you even come to that conclussion?? I spent the first hour of this game blowing stuff up and shooting people point blank in the face with a shotgun (the only reason I started using stealth was to get more exp). If you can't play like a man that's your fault not the game's.""penalises you for stealth"" - what, by giving you more exp? By stopping dragons from seeing you if you're crouched allowing you to evade them with ease?? Did you even play the game!?!?""exactly like farcry3 with less customisation"" - okay 1) blood dragon was just some fun thrown together by the developers so you could HAVE FUN. It's not a new game or even a full game so don't expect it to be. 2) the game takes care of your level-up perks so you can focus on killing things with lasers.

,Recommended,233270,12864638,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"I describe Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon as a cheesy take on famous sci-fi and action films of the 1980s. It purposely reminds you of famous films like Terminator, Die Hard, Commando, Predator, Robocop, and Rocky IV. Being cheesy doesn’t mean it’s not fun at all. It is actually quite a lot of fun to play in the permanently neon environments. The protagonist is Rex Colt, whose voiceover is played by actor Michael Biehn from the 1984 Terminator movie. Rex is a cyber-commando with a cybernetic left hand and a human right hand. He regularly comes up with one-liners after kills and after his data console tells him what his next objective is.The cut scenes play out in 8-bit and 16-bit form like a VHS tape whereas the gameplay is in modern 3D. The soundtrack is outstanding as it is from Power Glove and it genuinely sounds like ‘80s music. The gameplay will feel very familiar to Far Cry 3 players since the control scheme is the same and the ability to take over territory is the same. The outposts in Far Cry 3 are referred to as garrisons in Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Rex’s killer moves such as death from above and death from below feel very much the Jason Brody’s moves from Far Cry 3. However, there is no such thing as taking damage from any falls since Rex is a cybernetic guy. The main antagonist, Sloan, strongly resembles Bennett from the movie Commando starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The weapons you possess are the handgun, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, all with attachments that you can acquire as you progress. Later you will have access to the bow, a chaingun, and proximity mines. Those with experience with Far Cry 3 will feel at home playing Blood Dragon. The island has random battles between scientists who are part of your faction and members of the Omega Force.Blood Dragons are an integral part of the game and they appear all over the map. They’re quirky in that they fire lasers from their eyes. These dragons are powerful and take a lot of bullets to kill but you can lure them to cyber hearts that you can throw near them so that you can attack them while they’re eating cyber hearts. Cyber hearts are the hearts of the Omega Force soldiers that you can collect after killing them.There are still cool RPG elements similar to those in Far Cry 3. For every kill you earn cybernetic points that help you level up Rex. The RPG aspect of the game is simpler than it is in Far Cry 3, but it’s still fun to apply. Therefore, it would be wise to take on the side missions such as hostage rescues and hunting down special animals for leveling up and for earning attachments for the weapons.The environments do feel a bit monotonous since it always feels like night and the neon lights are the same. There doesn’t seem to be a day-night cycle at any time as you progress through the story. This game contains a lot of quirkiness paying homage to the 1980s. It’s not as fun as the classic Far Cry 3, but it’s still worth playing."

Still, the degree of creativity and the load of ideas on display really demonstrates which ways you can treat your source material inventively via spin-offs or DLCs. I really could get used to that.Fans of Far Cry 3 should not miss this fantastic experience, and anyone who grew up watching films like Terminator, Aliens and Commando owe it to themselves to play this, as it was certainly crafted by people who understand the culture.This game is pure irony: story, dialogue, music, graphics... everything recalls the craziest clichés of the 80s.Blood Dragon is a reminder that a story about one man killing thousands is just silly. That’s fine though, because games don’t always need to be serious. Games should just be fun, and that’s exactly what Blood Dragon is.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a true manifesto of vintage culture, of 16-bit gaming and trash cinema: a gem of rare beauty!"

You're Sergeant Rex Colt, a Cyber Commando who has a simple mission...save the whole damn world.The core Far Cry 3 gameplay is still here, but given new life as you sneak about enemy outposts stalking prey for a silent takedown, assassinating targets with a well placed arrow, sniping pilots out of helicopters or simply picking up the biggest gun you can find and going to town on enemy Cyborgs like some crazy 80's action flick - complete with ridiculous story line, cheesy dialogue, neon visuals, synth soundtrack and more explosions than you can shake something highly explosive at.There is certainly more fun to be had for those that enjoy a more sandbox like environment as you almost always have options available for how you approach a given situation (the exception being a few missions that require you to kill a target with a specific weapon to succeed), whether you want to take things slow and stealthy or go in guns blazing the world is set up to allow for different playstyles.The game doesn't take itself seriously, poking fun at things like tutorials and collection quests (although it still puts you through them, annoyingly), it even has a laugh with its loading screen tips. It's well aware its a game and can suit quick pick up and play action or longer play sessions as you clear out outposts, hunt wildlife or just cause on the fly chaos. One drawback is the number of enemies, in many cases there just seems to be too few that even the largest of outposts can be cleared in under a minute...but it is usually a fun minute!If Far Cry 3 was a decent bottle of wine, Blood Dragon would be a few pints and a lot of shots. It may be a reduced game at a reduced price, but its not reduced the fun to be had. It's a more distilled Far Cry 3 experience that will suit both FPS fans that have yet to play Far Cry 3 and those that have, but want more of the same with some 80's flair on top."

The main campaign is only about 4 hours but there are plenty of collectables to extend the playtime. As well as what has become something of an expectation, outpost takeovers. Upon liberating those outposts you'll unlock a side mission or two. Consisting of a hostage rescue or hunting specific animals with a specific weapon type affairs.Its pretty strait forward, its enjoyable. Its Far Cry. One complaint I have with the game is that it is way too red, I realize it was an aesthetic choice but its kind of over powering.It feels as good if not better than other Far Cry games, however the main character is kind of a show off and does a lot of flipping guns and spinny junk which looks really cool but when you're looting corpses or switching weapons in the heat of battle it can get a little annoying.It has some genuine laughs, Ubisoft poking itself for collectables “I hope I don't have to collect any feathers” The cut-scenes are also a throwback and done in a rather decent pixel art style.One aspect I really enjoy due to the games length is everything regarding character progression is sped up. No hunting a number of animals for their skin to expand wallet size or weapon holsters. Most abilities are unlocked immediately but still leaves room for more progression. Fall damaged is removed which is nice, movement speed is also much faster to the point where I never even bothered getting into a vehicle.Its nice to see Ubisoft do weird things like this instead of delving into the money machine with their cookie cutter prowess (Not that that's inherently a bad thing) Its also nice to see Ubisoft turn criticism into something fun; giving us, the players, a nod that they have heard you.Follow my curation for more"

The 80s, specifically 80s action movies, with their simple no-nonsense plot lines about badass dudes saving the world from ultimate destruction, with synth heavy rock blaring in the background and explosions around every corner. Remember those? Blood Dragon definitely does, in fact it does such a good job of paying homage while simultaneously parodying them that it almost feels like it's a recently unearthed time capsule, built with technology far ahead of its time and hidden until the public was ready for it. That time is now; Blood Dragon is here and it's flipping sweet!As Sargent Rex ""Power"" Colt, former army vet killed and then brought back to life Robocop style as a superhuman cyborg, it's up to you to put a stop to the tyrannical plot of your former commander, who plans to harness the blood of the cyber dragon to bring about a new age for humanity no matter the costs. The plot is cheesy, over the top, full of outrageous one liners and more explosions than a Michael Bay film, and outrageously fun for all of it. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard playing a game as with Blood Dragon, which perfectly nails the balance between self aware cheese and playing up the ridiculousness of itself.And of course, Blood Dragon plays exactly how you'd expect, by which I mean to say it makes you feel like the incredible cyber soldier that you are, liberating the remote supernatural island bit by bit as you pop off robots, save the helpless nerds, and face off against cyber dragons (essentially giant dragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes). For a budget game, Blood Dragon is surprisingly expansive, with the island being surprisingly large and chock full of side missions, collectibles, and cyber animals for you to hunt. It's not on the level of Far Cry 3 proper, but the size feels perfect for the sort of game it's trying to be, without any bloat and a fantastic ending which I won't spoil but is one of my favorites of any game in years.If I was going to nitpick, my biggest complaint would be that the constant darkness contrasting with the neon color palette can be rather hard on the eyes after awhile, making this a game best played in short bursts if you don't want to go into self induced blindness. Other minor issues arise with the somewhat weak gunplay and the difficulty of trying to maneuver any vehicle around the island (I eventually gave up driving and just sprinted to my destination) can be bothersome at times, but never made enough of an impact to lessen my enjoyment.Blood Dragon is a game designed to allow you to relive the glory days of silly action movies, updated with modern sensibilities to be nothing but unadulterated fun. It doesn't take itself the slightest bit seriously, and focuses all its energy into building itself up as a love letter to nonsensical action and soundtracks that you can't help but love (the music might be the best thing in the game, period). As long as you don't go into it expecting anything deeper than ""kill the bad guy"" and take it for what it is, Blood Dragon will shower you in it self indulging awesomeness and have you begging for more."

This is a more cheeky and silly game compared to the original Far Cry 3 but does well in providing a fun and funny experience both through gameplay and dialog.

Blood Dragon has cool visuals, a very campy 80's feel, some decent bits of humor, and a kick-awesome soundtrack.Yet where Blood Dragon suffers is when it tries to be over-the-top ridiculous and use the Far Cry 3 game mechanics at the same time. You're given a rifle that can shoot lasers, turrets, a minigun, a laser you mount on your wrist, and you're supposed to feel like the ultimate badass that can kill everything.Yet the Far Cry mechanics call for stealth, not run-and-gun. So for example if you do a hostage mission, you have all these cool guns that you just want to go pew pew and boom boom with, but if you get spotted by the guards then you have seconds until the hostage is killed. What? These mechanics that fail to properly invent exciting combat are fully realized with the Blood Dragons. There is no real strategy to kill them, other to mercilessly run and shoot. Left 4 Dead makes this fun because the gunplay makes sense. Here it simply does not.Oh, and by the way, you use the same button to heal yourself and to extinguish fire on you. Due to the first person perspective, it's difficult to tell when you are on fire and when there's just fire around you. So you press Q before you are given the prompt to do so thinking you can put out the fire early. Instead, you just waste a syringe/time healing yourself and then you're still on fire.Overall, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and just want to have a more absurd version of that, this will suit you well. If you want to be the ultimate badass, play Serious Sam or Saints Row or anything else that is actually BUILT for that."

If you grew up in the 80's and you enjoyedcheesy b-level movies, this game nails that feeling.+ A variety of guns with attachments that can be unlocked by completed some very easy side quests.+ Solid shooting mechanics.+ A soundtrack ripped straight from the original terminator and that’s awesome.The Average:The game has scanlines to give it a more retro feeling, unfortunately this makes the game look worse with no option toturn it off. Luckily you can hex edit a file to remove them.Its not a very long game however the game doesn't over extend its stay either.As per every Ubisoft game, expect pointless collectables.Conclusion:A well written game feature an over the top story.

An over-the-top FPS shooter with great soundtracks and a cyberpunk setting. Quite the reminisce if you ask me.Graphics: 9/10Straight out from what the future would’ve looked like if you were imagining it from the 1980s. Neon lights, multicolour lasers and robotic arms are seen throughout the entire game. Some might even say they are too bright.Storyline: 7/10It’s a very simple – “get the girl and save the world because you’re the only one who can do it!”. I guess it’s the 1980s and this would be the norm, but it just seemed a bit too generic for me really; they should’ve tried something more unique as with sticking with the original theme. Nonetheless, the game will feed you a ton of 80s references and over the top comedy that will keep you entertained for the rest of the game.Sound: 10/10Do I even need to say anything here?? I mean it’s just pure awesomeness with everything about the soundtracks. Especially the voice acting and the minigun sound…they are so satisfying to hear.Gameplay: 8/10You either go in quiet and unnoticed or just go in full metal mode and barge in the room with your shotgun, it’s up to you. You’ll have fun either way. The weaponry, the enemies and the vehicles are well refined to have an enjoyable gameplay. The only downsides are the random frame drops when the game AutoSaves and it requires Uplay for you to be able to play.Price: 6/10Asking for £11.99 is a bit too much for the amount of time you can complete this game (around 6-8 hours), it’s not worth the ‘pound per hour’ if you’re wondering that.

Blood Dragon sums up everything which was glamour - bright lights,  synth pop, shoulder pads etc, and forms  a tremendous experience loaded with adrenaline and testosterone. This is crowned by voice talents such as Michael Biehn (Terminator, Aliens), Grey DeLisle and iconic Phil LaMarr.Having same mechanisms as its big brother original Far Cry 3 the gameplay is fun and controls work fine. Between main quests player is free to roam in a world and assault on hostile compounds. Enemies can be wiped out loud or silently. This stealthy way is much more difficult, but always possible.To play Blood Dragon you need to have or create an account in UPlay, which I'm going to criticize only by saying that it feels vain. More significant problem is the content in the game which took me 7 hours to complete and I beat almost anything the game had to offer!

Almost all of the creatures that inhabit said island are given some kind of shiny robot-like texture, signifying just how MUCH of everything was hit with cybernetics.

While the ride is short, around 6 hours if you clear most of the outposts and side missions to level your character up, since it is a Farcry 3 game it’s very open and has a level of replayability.  The story is good enough with the cutscense using old school 16 bit still images which again add to the old school feeling of the game.  However what it doesn’t do is take itself serious, this is a comedy game make no mistakes and the comedy that is there is fairly solid though younger players who did not live though the 80s and 90s might not get many of the references or be able to fully appreciate what the game is showing you.The game’s style is great though the scan lines might give people the wrong impression about the visuals of the game though they do seem to muddy up the image a bit.  However with everything being neon in tone it’s not hard to find objects, enemies and animals within the game.  Blood dragons are by far one of the coolest natural animals that you will see in many games and they fit very well within the universe, they are also a force to be reckoned with, before you gain the highest level that is.The one major advantage of this game is that once you to get to the highest level and max out most/all of the sub missions you will feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ unlike in Farcry 3 which was at times rather bland once you gained your full powers.  The arsenals are awesome though some are more useful then others, some are more customizable then FC3 while others are less so however the important ones you do have the ability to make almost every weapon 10 times better.If any of this sounds good to you then by all means buy it and enjoy, whether it be for the humor or the fun gameplay you will enjoy your time spent playing FC3: Blood Dragon."

So, here's some fun trivia about 80's action sci-fi from someone that grew up watching it in the 80's...* As the 80's rolled in, computer graphics stated taking off, most notably with CGA (which had a vivid, neon Magenta, Cyan, White and Black as it's prominent color scheme). Since computers were ""the future"", a lot of what folks saw in computer graphics (going from monocrhome green/amber screens to CGA) fueled some of the neon explosion of the 80's in regards to computer graphics art work about what the future might look like. Hence, the neon pinks (magenta) and neon blues (cyan) mixed with white and black. Other neon colors were popular in pop-culture, but since comptuers were being used more for marketing and graphics, the CGA color pallette really impacted a lot of 80's style (hence hot pink / magenta lettering and stuff).* Movies of old required a huge orchastra to create the sound track. When the synthesizer came around, you could instead hire one guy working with a keyboard and some sound editing software on a computer or in a small studio to do all the music. This was much cheaper for movie production studios to help them cut costs, and is why synth music became so iconinc to 80's movies. With the advent of more portable cameras and computers, you could have very low-cost movie produciton with just a few people handling the sound, music, camera work, etc... hence the explosion of B-rated movies in the 80's.* The 70's drug trips were mostly LSD and psychadelics which caused colorful trippy highs, which was reflected in a lot of the iconic art of the 70's. These gave way and mixed with the cocaine boom of the 80's, which amped everyone up with tons of energy and the ability to stay up all night (or even go for days/nights without sleep). Mix in the CGA computers for graphics that people used for movie sfx and ""future art"", and you end up with the iconic 80's dark, gritty, neon look.... a look that suggests ""it's the future (neon), but things are bleak (darkness from cocaine fueled nights)""."

This stand alone expansion is short (10 hours for my play through), but densely packed.  The gameplay consists of capturing enemy installations on an island map, completing side missions to upgrade your weapons, and ripping out the mecha hearts of your cyborg enemies for experience and cash.  Abilities are unlocked by just leveling instead of the more complex Far Cry skill tree system, but it feels more like a streamlining instead of an afterthought, allowing you to focus on the gameplay.  Guns blazing, satisfying stealth, or throwing aforementioned mecha hearts into an enemy complex to attract the nearly invincible, eye lazering blood dragons, you get to decide how to approach each situation.  Finally, the ultra-campy humor, retro NES-style cinema scenes, and Terminator inspired sound track round out this time capsule of a gem, topping it off with Michael Biehn (aka Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, aka the original Kyle Reese) grumbling out the best action star since golden age of Arnie, Stallone, and Van Damme.Buy if you love everything 80's, definite buy on sale to enjoy playing a game the developer had just as much fun making."

,Recommended,233270,811623,"Posted: 10 May, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Blood Dragon is a more modern take on the games and movies of the 80's (and early 90's I guess). It's got lots of neon, dragons, a cheesy story, old school music and a lot, A LOT, of explosions. All combined into a neat little Far Cry package. Meaning it's an open world environment, and it has sidemissions and upgrades, too.If you're from the 80's theres's a high probability you'll instantly fall in love with this game. I did. It looks great in motion, the voice acting is great (although the story is purposely ridiculous) and it has tons of action in it, thanks to some awesome weapons in it. The world feels a bit empty, however. Where Far Cry 3 was filled with wildlife, I rarely saw wild animals in Blood Dragon. But it's possible that was because of the lighing and the fact that I didn't really explore like I normally do. Nothing big, it just caught my attention.Blood Dragon is, unfortunately, also a bit on the short side. Completing the game, doing only the main missions, took me about 3,5-4 hours to do. Enough for a downloadable game and more importantly, to keep things interesting. If you add the hunting missions and other sidemissions you can probably double that number. Upgrading your character also happens automatically (there are no skill trees) so replaying the game isn't all that interesting because you'll gain the same skills and perks every time, no matter what.Not that it mattered, because I had a blast playing Blood Dragon, and that's all that counts.

,Recommended,233270,13066563,"Posted: 24 November, 2014",all,Dekonega,"I ended up recommending this game but it was probably one of the hardest decisions I've made recently here in Steam. This is a game that is not fun to play outside of few interesting moments and kind of funny scenes. But please don't misunderstand me. I absolutely love the theme and the idea behind the Blood Dragon.This is a very stylish game with some really funny stuff in it. Especially for those of you who understand the references to the 80's action films and animated cartoon series. You can get a lot of out of this by just wanting to know what's the next thing the developers put into the game. But I guarantee that it's going to require hard work. It's also the only real motivation to make progress in this game.You see, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is not fun to play. The gameplay revolves around mostly just running from point A to point B. And it's boring as hell. You run around, do simple kills, and then run around again. Killing the stuff is so easy that even on the hardest difficulty level I never really died unless I became so bored that I lost focus and then died because I didn't bother to even try.The main objective in Blood Dragon is to collect stuff, so you can buy more stuff, that allows you to kill more things more efficiently. To be able to get more stuff you need to perform series of tasks, but you just cannot do them without liberating a garrison and unlocking those tasks, these tasks involve usually killing certain things in a certain way, and oh boy, it's annoying as hell. When you're travelling you need to collect random stuff along the way.This is a game where the main story can be completed within a four hours or less. Collecting the stuff takes probably another four to five hours. After the main story is complete the end game is easy and boring marathon. Especially if you're planning on getting all the achievements like I did.There are few rare moments when you're playing in a closed hallways and arenas which are used to advance the story. The story is mostly just as meaningless and cliché as most 80's action film plots are but in a wrong way. Result is a boring and meaningless mess of things. The script writers had the right idea but they were the wrong people to do it.I found it funny that although you cannot reach the kind of speed you can reach in Daikatana or Doom, players can still run faster than the vehicles in this game. Blood Dragon in overall has probably fastest gameplay I've seen in a recently released game. However the gun mechanics don't work like they'd work in an old school shooter. That♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most as the game is mostly optimised for gamepads.I could write more about the gameplay but I doubt anyone would read all that. Let me just sum it all up. This game is boring. Just as boring as the Far Cry 2 and Far Cry 3 are.Most things in Dragon Blood are suitably 80s. I don't need to pick them up and pull apart one by one.Visually the game functions mostly OK. Sometimes there are really weird slowdowns but usually just restarting the game it starts to work again. The neon lights and the colour palette in the Blood Dragon can cause huge eye strain and I'd recommend taking 15 minute breaks after every one hour spent playing the game. My eyes were bleeding dragon blood after playing this for a while. Blood Dragon also crashes every now and then without any apparent reason but at least it makes automatic saves after any and every meaningful event so you don't lose progress.The only thing I can honestly say was really awesome in Blood Dragon was its sound design and especially its soundtrack. It's full of really good FX and music with hints to various films and TV series but it still manages to sound fairly original and suitably 80's. It's just the perfect thing in this game. And I dare to suggest that you rather go toAmazon.comand order the soundtrack instead of buying this game. The voice acting is suitably bad in a good way that fits the game's mood.The controls work fairly well in the game but it's just weird how many actions there are which require you to hold a key pressed. Why not just pressing once to do the action? It would have made this game a lot more pleasant to play if instead of stopping, holding E, and then moving again players were able to just tap once when they're nearby something they can loot. I do however understand the need to keep Q pressed down to heal. The healing mechanic worked fairly well but I would have expected to have a separate key for the health packs that instantly give maximum health. I also just loved the fact that there's a dedicated ""F*ck you"" button in the game bidden to F.Blood Dragon uses Ubisoft's Uplay which means that you don't get to play the game before you've installed and upgraded that thing and oh boy, it can take time. I probably spent 5 to 6 hours in just trying to get the Uplay to work. It constantly kept disconnecting while it was downloading updates. It was awful. And when I finally had it updated and installed... I swear that every single time I started the game Uplay was updating something. It completely stripped me of any will I still had in me to buy other games made by Ubisoft that use Uplay. As a funny side note the Uplay apparently disables screen capture and pressing PrtSrc does nothing.That pretty much sums up the game. It's a game about funny 80's stuff without being actually a fun enjoyable game. There are much better games out there but at least to my knowledge this is the only one where you can play as a kind of funny walking parody of a Terminator T-800 that uses Robocop's pistol, has the Rambo's attitude, Cobra's moves, and overall is a generic 80's cartoon action hero with Viatnam War II stories to give the character little backstory, and you fight (and later in the game ride) a f*cking dinosaurs that shoots lasers from its eyes just like in the Dino-Riders.And yes, it even has a sex scene like the one you can see in 80s and perhaps in some early 90s films. The 80's theme goes up to the point that it even is little bit racist in a funny and politically incorrect way which earns it a lot of points. Oh yeah, this game also has Michael Biehn as the voice of the main character. I'll give more points to for that cleverness. I'd say it's worth checking it out if you can get it cheap."

The ridiculous 1980's neon future art and theming is definitely a part of that, but there's more to it then just that.

Where I feel that FC3 was probably 75% filler and only 25% ""killer"", Blood Dragon is probably the opposite, if not 100% killer.That is, of course, as long as you like the sometimes-sneaky sometimes-loud first-person shooting that Far Cry 3, BD, and now FC4 all offer.There is a caveat to all of this, however, and one that is a deal-breaker for some.

What happens instead is that the story and setting are introduced immediately as parody, allowing the player to immediately suspend their disbelief and simply enjoy the ride.Rex is a great extension of the player: he has small reactions to the world around him (including missions), the character is actually enjoying himself, and there’s no emotional turmoil for Rex outside of a very 80s twist at the end. This is in stark contrast to young Whiny Zoolander from Far Cry 3, who couldn’t decide if he was a hardened killer or a scared kid who just wanted to take his friends and family home and could somehow proficiently wield firearms with zero prior training (I’m not purposefully omitting the main character’s name, I actually do not remember him as anything else but Whiny Zoolander). Rex’s character is actually surprisingly important in this regard because if the main character is lively and likes what he’s doing, the player will be on the receiving end of those feelings as well.In FC3, Whiny Zoolander is a know-nothing college student who has to slowly become lord of the game, but there isn’t any extreme challenge early on because FC3 forcibly railroads the player into what they should and shouldn’t go after early on with mandatory early missions, so this limitation does nothing to actually make the player truly feel as if they’re overcoming a challenge. Quite conversely, in combination with the elasticated XP gain, it simply makes the player wonder when they’ll finally be able to get into the thick of it as they click on lone guards and wild animals for the nth time and by the time they reach the second island, the game is already almost over. It also doesn’t help that in FC3, any weapon that actually looks fun is stashed behind a tech tree, quest, and/or XP wall.The most important thing about Blood Dragon’s combat to me is that although there are fewer weapons to choose from altogether, none of the weapons suck. Instead, they start off good and just get better the more one plays and the more the player unlocks things. Weapons are accurate, reasonably powerful in regards to what each weapon does, and have plenty of ammunition. Players can carry 4 weapons right off the bat. Weapon upgrades merely enhance the versatility and further increase the power of the weapons they upgrade instead of being absolutely necessary to obtain reasonable firepower and accuracy. There is no weapon deprecation; instead, weapons fill different purposes and niches.Another one of my absolute favorite parts of the game is the fact that there’s no overarching “best strat” of just assassinating everything in your path or taking high ground in one spot and picking the bots off as they predictably run to trigger the base alarm. You can choose to be a sneaky bugger and chain assassination kills if you want, or you can go right in guns blazing and break some backs. The bases were constructed in such a way that there’s more thought and freedom to what the player can actually do. There’s a lot more detail to each base in Blood Dragon than in FC3.Another thing I’d like to bring up is that while Far Cry 3 will have people clocking in low double-digit hours if they want to hunt down everything in the game, Blood Dragon is an easy 7 or 8 hours of constant fun depending on how one plays it. The quests are much more active, but there are fewer of them. The immediate response to this is “Well that sucks! I want a game with content!” My response to that would be, “Would you like to jackass around the map just to stealth kill the same officer 60 times or would you rather a rescue mission take place in reasonably close proximity to a base you want to capture right after?” Essentially, it’s quality and uniqueness over quantity and repetitiveness.Despite my lavish praise, Blood Dragon isn’t the perfect game I’ve made it out to be in the last few paragraphs. It has its fair share of shortcomings. For one, the world is pretty static. The AI doesn’t really do anything to step up unit spawns and patrols (more and bigger squads of enemies) once the player starts their conquest, it’s more of a world that’s simply yours to take from without consequence. The enemy types are pretty limited – human enemy types (the most common) are limited to 5. You fight lots of grunts and Molotov tossers with a scattering of heavy troopers and the odd sniper here and there, and that’s it. I had the following gripe for when I played Wolfenstein The New Order: with the setting provided and how wild and imaginative the game was, there wasn’t enough experimentation with unit types in relation to the trope. Cyberninjas that could digitize themselves to hide in computers? Enslaved Vietnam War II veterans encased in robotic suits? Luddite forces that fight against all the factions with old or even primitive weaponry?The fact that the super weapon was highly encouraged until reaching “the” mount during the ending sequence was also not terribly fun, since it was a thoughtless “point and win” weapon. I would have loved if it was a plot device instead, with Rex going in guns blazing with a horde of angry nerd scientists jacking helicopters and vehicles and fighting to support Rex. There were so many explosive barrels and variances in height that it would have made sense for that entire first half of the ending sequence to be a clash between the two factions.Overall, I really liked Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, much more than the base game. I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun time, but if you’re someone who doesn’t like dropping $15 on 7 hours of content, grab it on sale."

Blood Dragon is completely different in the sense that the survival element has been completely removed from this standalone expansion.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is basically a gigantic spoof of 80's movies and filled with 80's references in a comedic sense and cyber-punk manner. I didn't grow up in the 80's so I don't really get the jokes, but to anyone who has. This is the game for you! Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is in my top 3 best games list of 2013, it's cool, it's funny and down-right stupid. Unlike Far Cry 3, which was based on the harshness of the jungle, the enviroment and the enemies, this game is NOT a frightful survival game, which I meantioned at the start.THE STORY: You play as Rex ""Power"" Colt, a cyborg military man who is rebuilt to be better, stronger and faster. You start out in a machine gun turret inside a helicopter (Yeah, best beginning ever) and descend to take a tutorial (which shows a comedic part of the game) When Rex Colt takes the tutorial, he is frustrated and angry and wants to shoot things, while the tutorial lady is speaking. (Quite a funny scene) It is chock-full of bright lights, with a cyberpunk feel to it making it graphically impressive.THE PORT: Excellent port, has and FOV slider, full world detail changes and nice options to do with textures. Why did I list the FOV slider as a key feature? Becuase this one can go anywhere from 55-110, varies quite well when you really have a look at it.RELEVANCE: This standalone expansion is quite similar to the base game, only cybered-up and takes off more 80's movies.PROS+Nice options menu and graphics customisation+Funny plot and comedic ""hints""+Isn't another ♥♥♥♥ing MMS (Modern Military Shooter)+Nice change from a jungle-theme to a cyber-punk theme+You run faster than you driveCONS-Short story-Low replayability-Everything is red-Smaller map-Useless side quests-Small amount of weapons (Some credit to the creators anyway, most of the weapons are spoofed)-Requires a Uplay account.9/10, would definitely recommend picking it up on a sale."

If you are on the line about whether to buy this or not, know you will have to deal with some consequences.I don't think the game understands how to correctly minimize. Pressing the Windows key doesn't work. Pressing Win + D doesn't take you to the desktop. Pressing Shift+Ctrl+Esc doesn't bring up the task manager. When you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, the game will automatically run in windowed mode with no option to minimize. If you want to make the game fullscreen again, you will have to go to menu -> options -> video -> fullscreen and change it.The game tries really hard to play satire on the genre its depicting, but it kind of comes off as an excuse for lazy game design decisions.I have also found the first game that can't get to 30 fps on my computer using minimum settings.

There are missions and open-world gameplay, and you can't do a hard save in the middle of a mission.  There are checkpoints within the missions, but if you quit the game and come back, you have to restart that mission.  It's fine in the open-world sections.  Also had trouble sometimes with not being able to walk up 2-inch steps, which is annoying while stealthing.  Oh and Uplay can be annoying when it needs to update.Speaking of stealthing, it's totally optional.  You can sneak about getting stealth kills, or just charge in with your guns blazing.

,Recommended,233270,21483446,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,BadassFreeman,"I decided to replay this game and make a review out of it. You know, for science and stuff. As usual, I will talk about the bad stuff first:First and foremost; Uplay. I shouldn't have to say anything else about that, but some people might not know much about it, so let's go into it. Uplay is a Steam-wannabe created by Ubisoft. It's laggy. It's crap. And if it wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft forces everyone to use it on their games. The thing is, you start the game and while other Steam games would likely start right away, with Ubisoft games you have to wait until this thing starts as well, and then the game starts. With singleplayer games ain't that bad, but if you have it on a new one, DEAR BUDDHA HAVE MERCY ON YOUR PATIENCE, as it will constantly ask for updates and crap like that. Uplay is even worse than Origin, and that's a big f#cking statement. And somehow, it still exists. Thankfully there are ways to disable it, and I seriously recommend you do it.The other problem the game has is this lenght. For 15€ you would expect at least 6-8 hours of content, however on my new playthrough I barely got 4 out of it, clearing everything at 100%. The main story itself barely has arround 5 missions, the rest are side-quests to unlock upgrades to your weapons; stuff you will surely want to get your cyber-arms on. What's sad about this is that this game is quite original and fun, and I feel like Ubisoft got lazy when they could've turned this little standalone mod into a game of it's own. It also doesn't help that, while the island is decently sized, the character runs and swims so fast that even vehicles are pointless when traveling, and you even have Fast-travel.That being said, is it good? Yeah. It's good. Have you seen any generic action movie from the 70's to the 90's? This game is pretty much a parody of all of them combined, throwing some game references along the way. The plot is so cheesy and idiotic that feels completely right.The gameplay is, obviously, quite similar to Far Cry 3. The only important stuff that has changed are things like upgrading your weapons to insane levels, and the main character throwing one liners non-stop.There's not much variety on enemies, and the NPC's indeed seem to be f#cking r#tarded, but they offer a decent challenge (until you upgrade your weapons, a fully upgraded shotgun pretty much kills anything on your screen in one or two shots).The soundtrack is what stands out the most in the game, always delivering this special 80's style. The item descriptions and graphics also show what dumb humans from the past though earth would look in the future, which was actually quite hilarious.There are also collectibles on the game, which you will need to get some of the collectibles, however you can buy maps that will show to you their exact location. With the speed you have, you can get them all in an hour.Granted, it's a fun experience. But a short one. And after clearing it 100%, I can't bring myself to recommend it at full price AT ALL. You should totally experience this, however wait for a sale. 7,50€ is good, but 5€ or bellow is perfect for this game. I just hope a sequel actually comes out someday, and it's longer and more 80's.TL;DR: The game's cool, but not worth the 15€ pricetag. Wait at least for a 50% sale."

Outside of missions you're free to roam an shruken down vers of FC3's island with the same kind of side missions, collectibles and the basic structure that revolves around capturing outposts, a.k.a. garrisons.

Personally I wasn't born, so I wouldn't know, yet playing Blood Dragon was like reliving the era that I never knew. While this game is still Far Cry 3 at it's core which isn't a problem as Far Cry 3 was by far one of the best games of 2012, this expansion takes a journey into territory not taken by any DLC or even game before it. In short, it tries to recreate the 1980's nostalgia from dialogue, setting and even its great music composed by Power Glove, which really sets the mood.The story picks up in 2007 where you play as Rex, a American cybernetic super-soldier. He and another American cyber-soldier named Spider travel to an unnamed island to investigate Colonel Sloan, an elite agent who has gone rogue. Sound cliched? It is. It practically rips off every movie from the 1980's such as the Terminator and even makes clever references to other minor 80's shows such as great easter egg paradying the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (personal favourite), but I won't spoil it here.While the game does not have a complete new setting from Far Cry 3, a red haze covers the screen to give a retro feel and many new locations, enemies have been added to the mix. The new weapons are also a highlight including a razor disk that demolishes and disentigrates every enemy in your path, it's one of the weirdest yet most fun weapons in years.The story can be finished in 3-5 hours which may seem short, theres plenty to do afterwards such as saving scientists and collecting classic 80's items such as Television sets and VHS tapes. Those were the days. So with all these things to do Blood Dragon never gets stail, and for DLC you can't get 'better bang for your buck' so to speak.Best bit is that you don't need the original Far Cry 3 to play it, so anyone can buy this game straight up and play through it's hilarious yet cheesy dialogue and action sequences so bizzarre I can't even begin to describe them here. With Blood Dragon the 1980's are back in fashion, so put on some Michael Jackson full blast and bring back that Flock of Seagulls haircut, sh**s about to go down."

If you grew up gaming in the 80s and 90s, this game is a must buy. The only criticisms I have are that the main storyline is too short and the side quests aren't enticing enough. The cheesy one-liners also get a bit old after hearing the same ones over 100 times too!"
,Recommended,233270,7821719,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Spacedad,"This one is a definite must-own and must-play.  It's fun and satisfying to treat the game like a big toybox playground of action figures from the 80s with you running around like a maniac at cyborg-enhanced speed blasting crowds of bad guys and finishing them off with shurikens and swords.The humor, music, and visuals are also all great.  The neon-on-black aesthetic makes the whole game feel like you're running around inside a giant arcade from the 80s.The only real downside is the major gameplay drag that was present in farycry 3 - the game, even on 'hard' mode, is still too easy.  The enemy AI is pretty dim and the enemies are far too easy to kill in general - even the blood dragons are chumps when you figure out their weakness.There was also an opportunity with this game to make more threatening enemies - for example, stalker cyborgs that might be a combination of Terminator, bits of the predator, and the stalkers from the Running-Man movie.  Basically, things that could be a tough match for Rex Power Colt to deal with.This game is also a budget spinoff made in-house, and it shows - they re-use assets for most of the game, and the game lacks a lot of features that would be great to have in a fully priced release - like epic boss battles and more variety.As it is though, this is one of those 'must-play' games.  You will feel like your dreams from childhood of being a cybernetic soldier of the future who gets to cuss all he wants and be the coolest kid on the playground are being realized.Oh and this game features one of the funniest sex scenes in anything.I look forward to seeing this game get its own true release in sequel/remake/spinoff form - everything from boss battles to coop play to more area, enemy, and mission variety needs to happen.  Rex Power Colt shall rise again.PS - When you play this game, unless you're rescuing a hostage or don't want to deal with a blood dragon at the moment, don't worry in the least about exercising caution.  Even on hard mode, you can pretty much run around like a maniac meleeing and stopping to blast a few enemies, so long as you run around behind cover a lot and use commo sense about not over-extending.  You're a superpowered cyborg after all, so you can do a lot more running and jumping than a human being  - might as well dash around like the Terminator stabbing people in the face."

As you can imagine, America is non-too-chuffed that this is happening so they have got their two best part cyborg, part human soldiers on the case, Spider and the character the player plays; Rex Power Colt.Let me put this frank, Rex doesn't f**k around. He may as well have his balls out (and for all I know, he might) as he shoots bullets, lasers, arrows, explosives and god knows what else as he charges through the Omega cyborg army's bases. As he does this he taunts his enemies with such lines as ""School's out... forever!"" and ""Way to fail on the job...d**ks**tter!"".The whole game screams of nostalgic 80's action goodness, reminiscent of such movies as Escape from L.A., Terminator and Robocop . It also have Sega Mega Drive-esc cut scenes, a sh*t load of references to other games and other 80's movies, plus enough up-gradable weapons and enemies to paint the ground blue with their synthetic brains. And I haven't even mentioned the freaking sharks and dragons(!?) that can shoot f**king lasers yet...While this is every 80's action loving kid's wet dream, I must stress the game is short. I'm certainly more than 50% of the way through it and I've been d**king around with side quests and base attacks. But for £2.99 and considering it is a standalone DLC, I am not complaining.This is a game that I will return to constantly. It's best played with a casual and completely non-progressive state of mind.Go a bit brain dead and enjoy the interactive cheesy, 80's action-come-comedy that Ubisoft have created for your eyeballs.

Stop getting shot, okay?  I swear, it's like talking to a monkey.""In terms of content, much of what makes the '80s great and plenty of what makes that time cringeworthy, too.  The devs really had fun with this one.  It's literally packed with humor and references, everything from the story, characters and dialogue to the one-liners, hints, animations, extras, even the (not really a) tutorial.  Not a game that wants to be taken seriously!From a gameplay perspective, Blood Dragon is fairly straightforward Far Cry material.  The weapons are all fun to use and offer options for sneaky combat or total chaos.  Area design is pretty recycled and AI is nothing to write home about but the combat is fun regardless.  Bases can be captured from the enemy and claimed for friendly factions, creating new fast travel points and opening up missions to rescue scientists, hunt wildlife, and more.  Certain achievements will unlock new mods for your weapons in the stores.  A few collectibles in case you're really into hunting around for hidden goodies.  There's really not much to be said in light of the fact that FPS players, especially fans of the Far Cry series will feel right at home with the controls and mechanics.  The art style and graphic effects are pleasing.  The visuals and audio suit each other perfectly.  I didn't mess around too much with the fancy takedowns or other moves but they are cool to see.  Finished the game on hard difficulty without doing much exploring of the place, instead moving quickly through the campaign.Perfect recommendation for an infusion of '80s goodness and a brief bit of mindless first-person shooter action."

,Recommended,233270,9958539,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,Captain MooMoos,"This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon then skip toResultsand read from there.Ubisoft packs a punch with the epic 80s action movie video game. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon pushes the bounds of traditional fps with epic dialogue, brilliant combat, hilarious cinematics, and an over the top story.Story:You play as Rex, a Mark IV cyborg that is sent on a mission to clear out some hostiles. Upon arriving you discover the mission is a lot more complex than you originally assumed. Your partner Spider is killed right at the start and it’s up to you to get revenge and ultimately save the world. Dr. Darling is your female guide offering you more than just her brains. Sloan an evil super-villain has concocted a serum from the Blood Dragons that turns people into zombies. He’s going to unleash this concoction upon the world if you do not stop him.Campaign:Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon starts off with you flying into an blaze of glory only to end the same way. The campaign is ridiculously short, unless you go out an complete all other objectives. It took me 5 hours to complete the entire game (get every TV/Video, complete all missions, capture all the bases, kill all 12 animals, and upgrade every weapon). If you just ran the campaign I could imagine you completing it in under an hour and a half easy. There are about five actual missions, the one you play with Spider, the one where you blow up the dam, the one where you kill the scientist, the one where you complete the temples challenge, and the final one where you kill Sloan. The actual game takes place on an open-world map making you run between missions, but this is not a problem as you are a Mark IV and can sprint faster than the cars can drive, fall off cliffs without taking damage, and teleport to any of the captured garrisons.Gameplay:The combat makes you a complete and total hero, even on the hardest difficulty you will still be able to run into a room full of people and slaughter them like a wolf amongst lambs. You have a healthbar, but you are able to heal yourself without medpacks. For combat, missions, and secrets you get CP which levels Rex. Each level offers Rex a new ability (usually increased health and self-repair), but every now and then you get a special something else thrown in. If you complete missions and find secrets you can upgrade your guns in special ways making yourself even more heroic than before. There are eight weapons (A.J.M. 9, Fzertron, Kobracon, Galleria 1991, Bow, Terror 4000, Flamer, and KillStar) and two explosives (Grenades, and C400). The first four weapons have upgrades, the last four do not. You will find yourself using different weapons over others, but based on the nature of the game you will probably want to go for the loudest guns you can find.Hints:>Some people are having problem with saving the game. If you are trying to play the game please note you will not be able to click the save button until you have fully completed the first and second mission. The game will save itself once you complete the first mission, and it will allow you to save once you complete the second mission.>Some of the animals you must kill will not be revealed till after you complete some of the garrison missions (if you do not complete the missions you will only find nine of them).>The Kobracon explosive round upgrade is probably the best weapon upgrade you will be able to get. It allows you to kill Blood Dragons like they are nothing, so I would recommend getting it.Results:Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is an epic first person shooter that brings the 80s action hero genre to life. It feels like you are playing Arnold Schwarzenegger from Commando as you blast through hundreds of cyborg soldiers, wild animals, dragons, and zombies. The game is coupled with a hilarious soundtrack, amazing cut-scenes, epic dialogue, and downright awesome explosions. You will not find yourself bored while playing this game, so make sure you’re ready to become an epic action hero. Because Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is such a short game I would be wary paying full price if you are not 100% sure you want this title. This game is a great game if you can get it on sale.Pros:+Character levels which make you considerably stronger.+Weapon customization which allows you to fully kit out guns making them even more destructive.+Fast travel which allows you to move quickly across the map.+Items you can buy from the store that reveal all the secrets on the map, saving you from having to actually look.+Epic combat system with awesome melee as well as ranged.+Lots of different enemies that keep you interested.+Dragons obviously…+Great graphics, scenery, and map design.+Open-world Environment (I personally do not like open-world FPS, but for those who do this is a pro).+Great dialogue, music, and cutscenes+You do not need Far Cry 3 in order to play this game.Cons:-You have very little control over saving until after the first two missions, which is incredibly annoying.-Finding some of the animals is near impossible (also the stingray is classified as a civilian?)-You will spend more time traveling between objectives than you will actually playing the game."

,Recommended,233270,15087996,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,Sentient_Toaster,"This is a corny 80's-style retro-future comedic FPS -- a non-serious look at a fictional neon-filled post-apocalyptic 2007.  If you've watched Commando, Predator, Robocop, TMNT, and the like -- you'll probably catch quite a few homages to those.  If you want serious business or anything not covered in massive helpings of cheese, look elsewhere.  If you want a corny power-trip with a goofball plot and a protagonist frequently cracking one-liners after killing enemies, this will entertain.It's very much in the style of the player as cinematic-level action hero -- you start pretty strong and pretty well armed, and it escalates from there.  There's a bow for silent ranged kills, takedown melee kills that can chain to multiple targets, a sniper rifle that you can upgrade to fire rounds that cause large explosions (think back to the original Robocop), an assault rifle that can be upgraded to fire laser blasts...It's pretty accessible.  I'm by no means an FPS fanatic, and on the default medium difficulty most things struck me as generally on the easy side -- it becomes not ""can I take out this garrison"", but ""would I prefer to do it quietly, or do I feel like guns blazing, or maybe it's time to lure in a Blood Dragon -- basically, a giant neon-lit T-rex that can fire laser blasts from its eyes -- for some chaos"".  There's one main-story mission that has a pretty severe difficulty spike in it, but difficulty can be adjusted on-the-fly.  This is definitely meant more to amuse and entertain rather than challenge and stump you.It's not a terribly long game.  Got all collectibles (some weapon attachments are unlocked with by accumulating them, so they matter somewhat), finished all side missions (which are almost either 'rescue a hostage' or 'kill a rare instance of one enemy type' at a specific location;), finished all story missions in under 17 hours, and many players will do this significantly faster.   There isn't randomly-generated content other than spawning of friendly/enemy NPCs (with no interaction beyond non-interactive greetings or killing, respectively) and it's not that long until you've been everywhere important, acquired all the weapons, hit the level cap, and killed at least one of every enemy type.As with most ~recent Ubisoft games, buying it on Steam will not exempt you from needing Uplay.  I experienced no trouble with this.  The game does have some crash bugs, though -- in particular, the game sometimes crashed if I inadvertently attempted to buy a health pack (""nano-meds"") from the store when I already had a limit.  Watch out for that if you're on a mission; once you start one, you can't leave the area without failing it and losing progress, and you only get checkpoints -- you can't actually save until you finish or fail it.    Individual missions usually aren't terribly long, but keep this in mind if you only have short intervals in which to play.Other notes --Soundtrack suits the game very VERY well.   It's by Power Glove -- @https://soundcloud.com/powergloveAlso,  this is a standalone expansion.  I've never played any other Far Cry game, anyway, and gather that the rest of the series tends to actually be much more serious in tone.Was originally $15 and Ubisoft is not averse to sales.   If you don't want two DRM systems for the same game, you could buy it directly via Uplay."

I tried everything in my knowledge to revover the save files.  I looked on Google and found tons of other players in the same situation as me, some of them found and posted solutions, none of which worked for me.  I tried contacting UBISOFT about it but only recieved a prewritten, stencel email that addressed my problem by offering a link to their FAQ page.  In order for me to speak with someone directly, I would have to go through more steps, which I will spare you from hearing about here.  Just to be clear, I never recovered my save files for UBISOFT games which have forced me to never want to play another UBISOFT game as long as I live.This game is a lot of fun -- I love the post aapocolyptic 1980s vision of the near future of 2007.

After spending an hour-and-a-half trying to reset my password (last time I used it was for Assassin's Creed 2 on Xbox 360) and dealing with UPlay's fail-captchas, I finally decided to just make a new account. While I totally disagree against the requirement of the additional DRM/content client that is UPlay, I also have to take into account that I spent a lot of money (relatively speaking) to buy all the Farcry games. Once I had a new account, I was finally able to play the game.Being someone that has seen a large number of 80's action movies, I caught on to many of the references and even recognized Michael Biehn immediately on the front cover. The game is fun and humorous from the Get-Go. The game play is boring however. I expected more explosions and campy dialog during fights, but even during the first scene of carnage, not a line of dialog was spoken--just some classic rock music and the white noise from a helicopter machine gun. At one point, I caught myself leaning on my hand and yawning while using my other hand to aim and shoot. The audio wasn't very loud like I wanted either, even with my volume turned all the way up--but I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt and assume that's just my problem.In the end, I can't recommend this game. It's fun for a short while but gets old really fast. If you didn't have to deal with UPlay just to play the game, maybe it would be worth it, but as it stands, it's just not."

It's both a parody and a tribute of the 80's,  with a strange future timeline, based on the Far Cry 3 engine, and most of the same island. WIth a dark atmosphere you can't really tell it's the same island, and the neon decor (reminiscent of Tron) and the overly dramatic delivery of the heros, villains, and other characters, makes for one heck of a presentation.You play Rex Power Colt, Mk IV Cybercommando of the US Military. Recently rebuilt / recovered from serious injuries and upgraded to Mk IV, you are sent with a buddy commando to infiltrate enemy compound to retrieve computer data... Only to discover the defending forces were commanded by your ex-commander, Colonel Sloan. However, you have someone helping you: Dr. Darling, someone forced to help Sloan develope this ""dragon blood"", which supercharged his cybernetics, making him more powerful than ever.You start as a level 1. As you achieve objectives, make kills, and so on you will gain XP which will let you gain levels, and additional skills and additional health points. Max level is 30, and the progression table is fixed, i.e. you can't choose which power.There are only so many weapons: pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, shotgun, minigun, blade, bow, grenade, molotox, mine, and C400 (satchel charge). But some weapons can be upgraded by attachments, which are unlocked through collecting collectibles.The actual game mechanics are identical to Far Cry 3: take over outposts by killing everybody inside, preferably without being discovered. Once you liberate an outpost Scientists loyal to Dr. Darling will move in. You can still do takedowns, and you already know how to do takedown drag and chain takedowns, but the advanced moves like grenade takedown,  shuriken takedown, pistol takedown, as well as death from above, and death from below are activated later.Animals are now mutated into strange forms, like cybercroc, cybershark, cyberpanther, etc. as well as tiger, cassowary, boar, goat, and more.Then there's the game's namesake: blood dragon. Practically small dinosaurs, they also have some really fancy ability: shoot lasers out of their eyes. Yep. It's their blood that supercharged Sloan, and killing them can be extremely tough, but doable.Scattered on the island are ""TV Sets"" that contains additional information about Omega Force, some ""VHS Tapes"" you have to 'rent' (i.e. collect) with horrible movie premises, and Dr. Darling's research notes. Collecting them unlocks weapon attachments that you can buy at the ""vending machine"" found in each outpost.Much like Far Cry 3, you will find the scientists fighting with the Omega Force on the island, as well as with the creatures. It is up to you if you want to interfere.Entire game is full of 80's pop culture references. You'll spot things from Star Wars, GI Joe, Aliens, and much much more. There's also jokes referring to other games, such as Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed (collecting flags and feathers, hahahah), and much more.Even the music is done in the 80's pop rock style.And let's just say the beginning and ending are hilarious enough you may LOL or even ROFL. And it must be experienced in person. It can't really be explained.All in all, Blood Dragon is a fun game with familiar mechanics, very different visuals, and callout to the 80's, and you should play it."

Being a game influenced by films such as Robocop, Terminator, Rocky, Tron, Commando etc, the main hero is a cybernetic super-soldier that obliterates everything in his way with the use of his ""little friend"". Also, there is a dedicated key for giving your enemies the middle finger.Keeping in mind that the game is supposed to be an hommage to the 80s films, the story, while being a massive cliche, has several exciting moments and is downright amusing.

There isn't a whole lot of pressure put on you to upgrade your weapons, but it helps to do so. It just a way to waste time in the game.  The real reason to play this game lies within the story. Its full of humour and references, but manages to stay original. The world is brand new, with ""future"" lighting and a slew of new creatures (Inlcuding the ""Blood Dragon"", which is extremely difficult to kill). You get a few futuristic versions of guns from the previous game, and a couple completely new ones. As you happily battle your way through hoards of enemies, you level up your character and guns; making you stronger and stronger.

Over a few games, though, it becomes apparent that Madden 25 doesn’t screw up as much. The Infinity Engine 2 physics got a lot of tweaking, and players look more realistic than ever in action. Each tackle feels and looks different, with players tumbling to the ground in myriad ways, but this year they do it without the crazy splaying legs and linebackers comically tripping over a downed receiver after a play. The cartoonish goofiness that took us out of the experience is gone, and Madden feels one step closer to replicating the look and feel of a real NFL broadcast.The other noticeable enhancement to moment-to-moment play is a much better set of tools for the running game. Maneuvers like spins, dives, stiff arms, and hurdles have all been improved and expanded, making great running backs and tight ends more awesome to play with. If you’re playing with a superstar athlete like Adrian Peterson, you can use a new Precision Modifier to really amp up the moves – if a player's stat in, say, Hurdles, is high enough, he can leap greater bounds, jumping over diving defenders. It's tough to pull off, and can only be done with the superstar athletes, but it's so satisfying when it happens.All of the modes from last year's game return, with some new tweaks that add another fun layer on top. Like in Madden NFL 13, each of 31 online players can decide if they want to play as a coach or as a single player (created, real, or legendary) in Connected Franchise. But now Franchise lets you play in Owner Mode, putting you in control of an entire team's staff, finances, and stadium. For the most part this is just a lot of metagame menus on top of Coach Mode, and deciding the price of hot dogs and jerseys isn’t the kind of thing that’s going to be long-term fun for most. But there is some cool stuff in here, most notably the ability to move teams to new cities. I was pleasantly surprised that when I decided to move my St. Louis Rams I was encouraged to pick Los Angeles, and when I did the mode's faux-Twitter stream mentioned the return of LA's prodigal sons. Owner Mode is a novelty to some extent, but it's a well done novelty, and adds a new way to play the already expansive Connected Franchise.With its incremental but noticeable improvements, Madden NFL 25 is the best football game experience I've had to date. It shines on a technical level, but the real issue with the series is that other sports games have improved so much faster that Madden 25 looks and feels dated by comparison – fake Twitter streams and pre-game montages are already old news. It would be better if EA Sports did more that was new and interesting rather than bringing back features discarded in previous versions. But the real meat-and-potatoes gameplay is better than ever, and when it comes down to it, we’re here to play some damn football. Madden 25 brings it with bone-crunching intensity."

Though the story is a bit short (about 8 hours on easy), the gameplay is fun and engaging. You may not have a large variety of weapons, but there are lots of attachments for them that you get by completing side missions (explosive bullets for a sniper rifle, for example). All the attachments give you a good reason to play on after completing the story. The game gives you a choice of playing it stealthy or going in guns blazing for many of the missions. My only real pet peeve is the brightness. Because the island is always dark, the neon lights don't quite light up the levels enough, and when they do, they are so bright it is hard to see anythingOverall, 8/10 would strongly recommend, especially on sale"

More of the great Far Cry 3 combat system and mechanics, better atmosphere, stirring music, ridiculous weapons, and memorable quotes. After watching a few trailers, I can't see how anyone would be on the fence about this purchase. $15 is an absolute steal, if you don't see it in a classic Steam sale anyway. The 80's aesthetic work flawlessly well, and anyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s will find Blood Dragon chalked full of nostalgic references. This game gets a full recommendation from myself, and it belongs in your collection if you enjoyed the Far Cry franchise, 80s action movies, or just an excellent open world first-person experience.As an aside, I'm not a huge fan of Ubisoft's UPLAY, and I'm not sure if it prevents Steam from tracking play time (I did get 1 of my trading cards).

I saw this on the horizon, and to be honest, I thought it'd be awful: a gimmicky tie-in that looked absolutely ridiculous.  And it is absolutely ridiculous.  But it is impossibly well executed!  Don't get me wrong, Far Cry 3 was a fantastic game but there were things that made the game just a wee bit tedious at times - impossibly sensitive fall damage, some skills that just seemed pointless, swimming sections.Blood Dragon streamlines all the realism (because this game leaves all reason at the door) in favor of making the game fun.  The plot is ridiculous and a lovely send-up of all those glorious 80s sci-fi/action movies - and who better to provide the voice for the main character than 80s action hero luminary, Michael Biehn (see: Terminator, Aliens)?  He's more grizzled here in the distant future of 2013 (when the game came out), but holy crap, he is phenomenal with the voice work and his one-liners and dialogue that he delivers throughout the game make it so much more viscerally enjoyable to run around like a commando - scratch that, CYBER Commando - all over the island.  Yeah, you're on an island like in Far Cry 3 and this one's much smaller, has an 80s VHS tracking haze that I'm not complaining about because it goes with the theme, and everything is muted or neon.  Why? Because it's awesome, that's why.  If you don't understand that perhaps you and your haughty airs might enjoy a nice quiet evening listening to NPR.So yeah, fall damage is gone, you can breathe forever in water and run pretty much as fast as you could drive a car making getting around the island a breeze.  The enemy types are a bit lacking since they basically fall into the categories of 1) palette-swapped wild animals from FC3, 2) Motocross guy with an assault rifle 3) Welder-mask guy with molotovs 4) Heavy weapons guy with a minigun or flamethrower or 5) the eponymous blood dragons.   And while there's some gauntlets and set-piece missions you'll play through, there aren't really any 'boss fights' to speak of unless you count fighting blood dragons or conquering outposts.Those are really the only negatives I experienced in this game and they don't detract too much from the fun you have playing an avatar of death known as Rex 'Power' Colt.  Play Far Cry 3, appreciate the beauty and realism and survival challenge.  After you do that, play this game for the fun and sense of empowerment as all of Jason Brody's weaknesses are eliminated for the sake of having a good old 80's action movie complete with cheesy but fun dialogue, 16-bit cutscenes, and dinosaurs that shoot lasers out of their eyes."

The main missions are also a lot better than in FC3, and the humor is also particularly self-aware and well done in a pleasingly-cheesy way.Blood Dragon will be over before it gets mind-numbingly repetitive like Far Cry 3 and its filler, so I consider it the definitive Far Cry (3) game to play.

It's a fun sight to see a big game developer sidetrack and go absolutely bonkers with its franchise and that is what FC3 - Blood dragon is, absolutely bonkerville.

Love it!Like with Far Cry 3, I had very little problems with Far Cry 3 - Blood dragon (works with same engine, duh). It's a lot shorter experience but the price simultaneously is much lower and you don't need to have the original Far Cry 3 to play Blood Dragon. If you hate the 80s, corny remarks, one liners and references and you don't like fast paced shooting or alternatively slowly hiding and stabbing people or shooting arrows to your foes heads then the game definitely isn't for you.

Although there are not very many weapons, the weapon upgrades and the length of the game make each weapon a unique experience. It seems like the game knows when you are getting bored of a weapon, and says ""wait, you collected enough TVs to get a new upgrade that changes the weapon!"" and then you have something new.The enemies are mostly balanced. None of them are too overpowered, doo too much damage, or are too easy to kill (except for the flamethrower dudes, they are really op in my opinion)The graphics are not amazing on low quality, they are like low quality skyrim. However, the neon colors splashed everywhere make it look highly visually appealing.The game is funny. There are plenty of little jokes thrown in that will make you chuckle, or at least smile.It is rated M partly for sequal content, but the only part of the game that really has that is a cutscene you can skip. There is some writing with some sexual content, but it too is avoidable and optional to read.In traditional Far Cry style, you can realistically heal without medkits. Welding and reconnect parts of your cyber arm, exercising a hurt hand, reconnect a disjointed wrist, it all makes sense and later in the game heals up to 4-5 bars of health without a medkit.Cons:Healing and fire don't work well together. If you are healing, then during it you get set on fire, the healing will be canceled and you have to pat the fire out. However, you cannot pat the fire out for several seconds after it cancels out the healing. When it finally is cancelled out, you have to wait another few seconds before you can heal. it is quite a hassle.The game has taken me about 10 hours to completely beat, as in every side quest, garrison, collectible set, main story, and weapon upgrade acheived/done, and I hit max level. Although the game is great, 10 hours of playing is not worth 15 dollars.Summary: The game is amazing, every open world gaming fan should have it. However, don't buy it at full price. If you can get it for more than 50% off, i got it 75% off, it is definitely worth the money."

Blood Dragon is that game, and I want another one. Blood Dragon is a shortened version of Far Cry 3 but with a theme that is the totality of rad from every 80s action movie ever combined into one. The year is 2007, and you have survived an apocalyptic nuclear winter between the U.S. and the USSR that crescendoed in the 1980s. You play as a Michael Biehn cyborg (ironic seeing how he fought one in the Terminator) and are trying to stop a Cobra Commander type of villain from sending his army of cyborg soldiers out to enslave mankind and rule what's left of the world. The action is awesome, the controls are great, the fetch quests are addicting and everything I've ever wanted in a soundtrack or action movie is here.

While I can't remember the entire paragraph, one sentence basically reads: ''It has Neon, therefore its a bow of the future''. The description summarizes two things about this title: it has a ♥♥♥♥load of neon, which means its an 80's dystopian vision of the future; it's really laid back and almost comedic in its approach to everything. At one point in the game your concierge tells you about something and how you have to accomplish a task, and our protagonist is left confused and wondering what the hell she's talking about or what's going on. Her response? ''Oh, I didn't tell you about that?''. It immediately became obvious that the creators didn't want you to overthink the plot or worry about the details. Just kill♥♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay boils down to taking over bases, doing the unlocked missions (usually two, sometimes one) after taking control of the garisson, and finding collectibles. Collectibles are worth it, since they unlock weapon upgrades. Unfair? Not really, since you can, after freeing up a set amount of garissons, unlock maps in the store that display locations of collectibles on the map. Does that make collectibles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, since they TELL YOU where they are? Nah, my take on it is that they're set up so that you travel the island, encountering enemies and dragons along the way. It's not finding them that matters, its getting to them.Even with the side quests its a short title, so you'd think it has very little to offer. In fact, it's pretty much a bite-size version of Far Cry 3, with neon and a ♥♥♥♥♥in' 80's soundtrack. The latter makes it worthwhile; the game has enough style and personality of its own to be a fruitful endeavour. It doesn't overstay its welcome, carries itself comedically and refuses to take anything it does seriously. If you've played Far Cry 3 before, odds are you've seen a lot of this already. But the new paint is good looking enough to warrant a second drive through the much smaller island of Blood Dragon. If you HAVEN'T played a Far Cry title before, ♥♥♥♥ing buy this already. For veterans its familiar territory, albeit with a different coat of paint. But for newbies, it's an enticingly retro foray into open world first person shooting. Whether a veteran or a newcomer, capturing bases stealthily is still as fun as ever. But now you get to do it to sounds of the 80's."

The noisy, interlaced, ""shades-of-pink,"" VHS aesthetic is simply a distraction from how little is actually going on. The gunfights are all immensely easy, made worse by the fact that the enemies simply throw themselves at the player without ever posing any actual threat or attempting any defensive tactics. The level-up system is completely unnecessary due to the game's abject linearity and lack of variation and simply serves to slowly buff the player out of control. Aside from the upgrade system and the visuals, the game's mechanics are mostly identical to Far Cry 3's, except that Far Cry 3's enemy layouts actually created situations which required some consideration, especially when going for a stealthy approach. Here, the best strategy is almost always to stand is a narrow corridor -- and there are plenty -- and wait for all of a level's enemies to come rushing to their deaths.

It forces you to install ubisoft's uPlay, having it on Steam is not enough. The world feels completely desolate and uninteractive. The controls feel clunky and there is no option for hold-crouch because its made for people with only one finger on their left hand. There is no usable minimap either, I have to go to the full map every 10 seconds if I want to navigate anywhere. I have no idea why anyone would consider this anything but total garbage. Michael Biehn was the only reason i played for even 2 hours before uninstalling. It's just no fun at all, somehow watching someone play this makes it seem fun but it's not."

One doesn't have to be born in the 80's to see how every detail- from the animations of the Omega Force to the way Rex Power-Colt swims- combine to form a hilarious satire of the nuclear-future-obsessed films of the Reagan age. The game is also enjoyed in other languages, where the acting is always superb. (A character in the game retains his Japanese accent in all five dubbed languages.)

If you love chessy 80's action movies, then you should get this game.-The plot is very thin, but the cheesy one-liners make up for it.-You unlock gun mods from side quests and collectables, all the while gaining XP and levelling up which give extra heath, or little perks.-The art style is awesome, from the filters put on the gameplay, to the retro style cut-scenes.-The game rewards stealth, for the most part.

You need to go through all the hassle of creating exceptions for your firewall for uPlay and register an account. It needs to be active all the time you're playing, and if you are a smart enough user to not play on your administrator account (as you should), you'll be bugged to enter your administrator password each and every time you start the game.About the game itself, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a console game and it shows. You cannot bind anything to the mousewheel, all the audio is incredibly quiet even with the volume on max and no way to increase it. The menus and interface are a complete mess with unintuitive controls, open and close slowly and the only thing they succeed at is making you want to use them as little as possible. You have only a single save slot per game, you cannot replay any particular level if you ever want to, and you can't even save when on a mission. Every time a wild animal catches you, you get a quicktime event, which usually leads to your death because the keys it requires you to spam are different every time.The content of the game itself is pretty well designed. It's a parody game using pretty much every known cliché of the 80s/90s action movies in an 80s future vision setting.Most of the weapons are fun to use, though some require you to unlock and buy upgrades to not be useless, such as explosive ammo for the sniper rifle.You are dropped on an island where you can roam around as you please, follow the main story, side quests or do whatever. While I generally like games with an open world, I feel there is some lack of direction. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games have shown how to do an open world properly while still maintaining a good sense of direction.A big plus of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is the music. It's one of the best soundtracks heard in computer gaming and fits the general theme of the game perfectly. Now if only it wasn't so damn quiet you could barely hear anything...All in all, this is a good FPS plagued by some issues around it. I feel that the positives of the game, mainly the setting, music and over-the-top action hero theme, outweight the negatives and make it worth playing."

This game has nothing to prove to anyone because it is the ultimate 1980's power fantasy distilled  into game form. Does it have minor flaws? Maybe. Does it matter? No. Because you can jump off a hanglider, break your fall on a cyborg as you stab him, ninja star his friend, and then rip out their hearts and feed it to a dragon. That combo doesn't even use any of your bullets. This game can't be bothered with stamina meters or fall damage, it's too busy bringing future justice to care about that stuff. What it doesn't feature is unlimited ammo, which would suck, since half the awesomeness of having cybog weapons is reloading them like a boss."

This game , or rather stand-alone DLC is excellent. I would most likely rate it a 9/10. This game is pretty much a giant homage to 80's movies. You have references from RoboCop to Terminator to the animated cartoons like GI Joe and Transformers. Oh and not to mention the amazing yet horrible 80s movie Miami Connection. Also there are many more refernces like Predator, there are just so many to mention that it's hard to list them all. If you love 80s movies I think you will love this game. Even if you aren't that interested in this I think you would still love it. Also, Michael Biehn is Rex ""Power"" Colt so that's pretty sweet. The only downside to this game was UPlay. The game was also very short but that's because it is a stand-alone DLC. I consider this game better than the actual Far Cry 3. Oh, and also you don't even need to have the base Far Cry 3 to run it. This game/stand-alone DLC is worth every penny. I loved it you should really consider picking it up or if you've been debating then you should certainly make a purchase."

The colour sceme is fantastic the punch-lines hit spot on and It's so different from the original it gives you a new experiance even if you think nothing can be better than the 3rd please play this game.Allowing to own this game and not have to own the original was a good idea purely for convienence.The tutorial knows its a tutorial and then knowingly says how annoying it is to have a tutorial in your game and the bases ofer great stealth and then guns blazing tactics.The animals fun and inventive including the Blood Dragon.Speaking of wich the ability to turn off the enemy's shields and watch a dinosaur the size of an Elephant run in shooting lazers out of it's eyes Is one of the funniest things In the game.Of course it has the exact same mechanics as farcry3 as expected, but one thing I was Dissapointed to find was the lack of weapons.There is some customisation with the mods for the weapons but once you get the max there's no point trying the older upgrades wich is a large flaw in an open world FPS.I never played it After i finished the game As there's no point, it's increddibly easy to find the collectables and after that there's nothing to do the challenges are fun but few and I'd only recomend it for Its humour, visuals and story.All in all a good game but lack of content, I know its a DLC but you don't have to have the original so i'll count it as half a game.I'll give it a 8/10 A good game and i'd reccomend it to gamers who like FPS's, Gamers who like Sci-fi and Gamers who like the original farcry3 but want something new"

This is the game comes straight from the 70s, 80s, and 90s all rolled into one, to give us a neon-filled, nostalgia-fuelled cyber-shooter. You play as a cyber commando, fighting other cyber commandos, and there are DRAGONS WITH FRICKIN' LASERS IN THEIR EYES. Lots of fun references, including Robocop and Predator, hilarious dialogue and jokes, and probably some of the funniest writing outisde of the Borderlands series. However, combat can often get repetitive with the many garrisons that you have to raid. Also, you can't fly a helicopter, but you drive something much better that I cannot say without ruining some ascpect of the game. Probably the one and only real problem that I've had with this game was that it was launched through UPlay. It just gets in the way. Plus, the main campaign is fairly short, but hey, pick it up during a sale, and it's definitely worth it.8.5/10 Would 100% complete this game."

You'll only get about 3 hours out of this game (more if you do collectibles) but it's a great 3 hours with an amazing ending.As far as gameplay, imagine that Far Cry 3 got a lot less buggy, a lot less tedious, the combat got a lot more stable, and was injected with a heaping, healthy dose of FUN.  Fall damage was removed, as was the need to breathe while underwater, and you can sprint at about 30 MPH.  Everything has been given a neon tint (to emulate an old 1980s sci-fi movie) but it's never really distracting.  Overall, the dialogue and combat feel very Duke Nukem-ey.On the negatives, the game is VERY short (3 hours on my playthrough), but it's an extremely enjoyable experience for those 3 hours.  By the end of it, you'll be feeling like a super-powered monster, able to kill almost anything in one or two hits.

The visuals are flashy, neon and 80s. The characters are stereotypical and 80s. Yeah, a lot of 80s stuff.But with the gameplay, you'll get about 3-4 hours worth of content, if you do the story mainly. Otherwise I'd say it's 6-7 hours, if you 100% it.The animations just make you feel badass, the same with your powers and skills.The wildlife, which was a strong part in FC3, is extremely weak here. No crafting system in the game at all. There are some upgrades though, which I approve of.Now, the movement system... You sprint about 2x faster than in FC3 and you take no fall damage. The game encourages you not to really even use a car, but just run like Forrest Gump across the map. Again, it just makes you feel awesome.And the last thing, soundtrack.

Prior to this spontaneous purchase, I remembered Blood Dragon being an April Fool's joke - - - I didn't realize that it was actually published!The 1980's. The Golden Age of the science-fiction action film. Big hair and big biceps. Leather jackets and tight, acid-wash jeans. Aviator shades and motorcycle helmets with tinted visors - worn at night-time. Cigarettes under neon lights. Synth music. Sawed-off shotguns and laser rifles.Blood Dragon is a child of an '80's Child. Throughout this epic adventure you'll pick up on references to Robocop, Predator, Terminator, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, and tons more. There is also some clever commentary on some of the trends in gaming (feather collecting, idiotic tutorials, etc.)To be perfectly fair - it isn't perfect, there are three issues that I find terribly detrimental:Firstly, Far Cry 3 requires U-Play, a deal breaker in of itself for many. Literally every single time I boot up Blood Dragon I must tell U-Play to ""try again"" in synching my progress. It works, after that - but many people claim they cannot run the game whatsoever. We shouldn't have to run DRM through our DRM, but that's how it is.My second issue with Blood Dragon is that it has the much maligned Far Cry 3 system of checkpoint saving. If you give the game some time you will learn how it works, albeit you'll probably find yourself repeating a mission or two before you finally learn to truly get a ""SAVING"" notice before quitting to desktop. It's not a game breaker, its just an inconvenience.My final issue with the game is that there are infrequent instances where the AI does something stupid - shooting at walls, walking into walls - or the game glitches to the point where a re-load is necessary.These issues are easily over-looked by me. Blood Dragon is a damned good FPS. You can read any number of reviews on Far Cry 3 for specifics on the engine and physics and whatnot. The storyline is much appreciated parody, it doesn't have the menopausal drama of the modern warfare shooter. The voiceacting, provided by Michael Biehn, is perfect. The soundtrack, provided by PowerGlove, is absolutely, absolutely incredible and worth listening to on its own.For what I paid, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon offers the absolute best value of nearly any game I have ever purchased."

I played through three sections of the game, and every time I started the game back up, I had to restart with the same (AWFUL) tutorial section.  what made it worse was that the gameplay past the tutorial wasn't even much fun.  the game encourages you to use stealth, yet makes it very challenging to find a path you can take undetected (keep in mind that this is in the very first gameplay area).  once detected by one enemy, every other enemy in the area is alerted to your presence, forcing you into an open gunfight (despite having just trained you in the art of stealth).  if you, like me, decide to retry the area so as not to be detected, you have to start all over from the opening cutscene and terrible tutorial.  while the game would not let me manually save during the first area, I hoped that it had auto-saved for me after I reached the fourth section (a ""protect a guy while he does a thing"" section, which are never fun).  nope!  next time I started the game up, it was back to the opening cutscene and (did I mention AWFUL) tutorial.  there was some humor in the game that I enjoyed, and while I thought the graphical style missed the mark of what they seemed to be aiming for (in particular, there was an omnipresent neon haze that washed the life out of everything), overall I thought the setting of the game seemed appealing.  too bad the actual gameplay leaves nothing to be enjoyed."

Sure enough, there is an 80's action flick atmosphere here but ultimately it all comes down to the game being cheesy for the sake of being cheesy. It feels uninspired. The game has way too many cutscenes that are horribly executed. They're meant to imitate pixelated graphics from the 80's but are just out of place here altogether. They simply feel like an excuse for the developer not to create a specific game sequence. Instead of having to flee a secret lab using a stunt jump yourself, you get to watch a set of pixelated images of the event in question. Enemy variety is non-existent either: you're basically fighting against Daft Punk all the time. Weapons are extremely unbalanced. A Daft Punk guy may take about five bullets to the head or a whole magazine to the chest in order to die, though you could also hit it with an arrow to the knee to get him down. All in all a pretty bad game capitalizing on the success of Far Cry 3 on the one hand and 80's nostalgia on the other. Cheesiness alone is not enough to make a game good.

Blood Dragon, while using mostly the same gameplay and recycling a lot of assets (mostly terrain and animations) from FC3, it's a much less serious game. You play as Rex Power Colt, a cyborg commando infiltrating an island in 2007, which in this case is seen as a sci-fi post-apoc setting due to this game being heavily 80s inspired. Music is the usual retrowave fare, and if you've played Hotline Miami or watched Drive, you'll know what I'm talking about. The visuals are pretty much FC3 at night, but then with red filters and scanlines slapped on top of it, and lots of neon-lighting. I like it, but some people may consider it eye-straining or just bad overall. Keep in mind there's no way to disable things such as scanlines in-game, but you can edit game files.Blood Dragon jokes about a lot of things, and it seems to be slightly aware of its nature as yet another iteration of the Ubisoft Game(TM), that game with an open world full of collectibles and enemy outposts/towers. After a turret sequence that serves as an opening to the game, the protagonist enters a tutorial mode where the game does present the controls to you while Rex complains about wanting to shoot things. Since this isn't a full game in itself there was no time to make half the campaign a bloody tutorial in itself like in most Ubisoft open-world games, so the tutorial bit is mercifully short. Apart from this, there is the usual Ubi gameplay of collecting shiny things and conquering outposts.Exploration doesn't feel as fun here as in FC3 as the gameworld is mostly purple and red, and so I ended up doing the fairly short main missions (only 6 + prologue) and conquering less than half of the outposts. As I previously mentioned the gameplay is much like FC3, but with less upgrading: There are levels but each level has an automatic upgrade, making the only optional upgrades available weapon upgrades. For each weapon upgrade you have to complete a side mission (which revolves around saving scientists or hunting rare animals), and unfortunately I have to say the game has no upgrades for the bow, which is quite a shame. Overall, weapons do seem to lack a bit of punch except for the sniper rifle and the bow, and the fact that even though you do have a lot of mobility by sprinting, sliding and jumping, you can't actually fire while sprinting, making you mostly have to fire from cover and restricting overall combat mobility. Combat is fairly good but not great.The game's story doesn't bother taking itself seriously and ends up being a pretty cool 80s action movie-style thing, and the main mission starts with the usual Far Cry semi-open levels, and ends on a mostly linear power-fantasy. Overall, Blood Dragon is a pretty fun but ultimately short game."

I gotBlood Dragonprimarily for its 1980s theme, having heard many good comments about its humor and music.Let's begin with the good. The story in this game is over the top, but mostly fun; though it's pretty short and without side missions it takes only about 5 hours to complete. The humor is good:Far Cry 3: Blood Dragondeliberately mocks the player and makes fun of video game and movie clichés. Aesthetically the game is great: the visuals are stylish and have lots of crazy effects, but several times I found the environments just too dark; the music byPower Gloveis awesome and creates a dark future atmosphere, however I felt it was not loud enough and unfortunately there is no option to increase its volume.Sadly, the gameplay is this game's weakest point. The weapons are cool and feel nice, but there are not so many types of guns and foes, so you repeatedly fight the same bad guys using the same arsenal, which becomes boring after about an hour of playing. Weapons can be fitted with attachments like extended magazines or laser sights, but to get them you have to complete boring side missions and look for secret items scattered around the map, which is hardly fun.Blood Dragonfeatures a small but open world, however there's hardly any point in exploring it.To conclude,Far Cry 3: Blood Dragonexceeds as a parody and an homage to the 80s, but its gameplay falls short. It's not a bad game, but I won't recommend it to those who want deep gameplay and a serious story. Get it if you enjoy the culture of the 80s and the stuff inspired by this era (such as synthwave music and movies likeKung Fury)."

With it's aged cheese and good delivery, the game tends to be an absolute joy to run through (if a bit short.)The aesthetic is quite different from that of Far Cry 3, and it does better as a result. A pretty significant contrast for neon and video filters for distance which gives a distnictive TRON-like appeal.The story itself is just hammed up which is perfectly fine with the exception of some significant plot holes that may or may not have been introduced on purpose.  With that said, references to old experiences that anyone old enough to have played in (good) arcades back in the 90's would remember.At $15 for the game, it's a bit of a fence to consider. While I did have a blast, I find myself having done almost everything I'm interested in under five hours on ""hard"" difficulty.

All of this could be easily fixed if the game so would autosave at every checkpoint and not after completing the mission, but that's not going to happen.TLDR versionI really had high hopes for this one, the game is fun, it's full of 80s-90s pop culture references and throw away gags. The graphics look nice and polished (the Tron-like neon look might not be for everybody but it works for me). The audio is also great, synth music and goofy robot voices straight out of Robowar.The game mechanics are basically identical to Far Cry 3 (although the skill tree is fixed), but the game also borrows the save system from Far Cry 3 and here the fun stops abruptly becauseyou can't save during missions. Should you decide to exit the game during a mission, you lose all saved progress and have to restart from after the last completed mission. That wouldn't be such a big thing if the missions were short, but the first two missions are both over an hour long (played using stealth). Why can't the mission checkpoints be used as saving points is beyond me.One more thing worth mentioning is thatthis game requires Uplay(Ubisoft's own flavour of DRM) which adds another level of frustration. I didn't have any major problems with it (some people can't even start their games), but I had to sit thorough updates almost every time it started and these are not you 2-3s updates. With limited play time available (as I imagine is the case with most gamers today) 5-15 mins of updates are something to take into consideration. I think you can start it in offline mode and skip the updates, but it's still a bad decision for Ubisoft to include their own DRM in a Steam game and I don't want to support it."

If it wasn't for the gamepaly and soundtrack, I would have abandoned the game.The culprit was Window 10, which is still problematic.

It's perfect!The gameplay offers not many new things compared to FC 3. They tightened it by removing getting all these different things for loot you had to sell (cards, dices, bling and other garbage), the crafting, and the messing with skill points. I appreciate that because I never enjoyed these aspects of FC 3.Also they break the 4th wall alot. So will the main character when doing game typical collecting tasks complain that it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, or ask what he is doing there at all.Can't say much about the story because honestly I don't care for it. Story in Far Cry 3 was nicely done and told in a quite interactive way, in Blood Dragon there are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of cutscenes in 80s style. They are ok but I skip them because they bore me. The missions I played so far were also quite boring to me, the usual shooter stuff. Find this, find that, protect your friend while making your way into a building, cover his back while he his hacking into a system, blah blah blah. The game kinda celebrates this by giving you mission descriptions like: ""Kill the Sniper. Why? Because Snipers are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. ""Do you really care why you save the scientist? Just save him"".Just saved a scientist, he pulled out his welder, pointed it at some wires and died.

Now that that steam sale is out of the way (I love how my birthday always falls RIGHT in the middle) I'm here to review the DLC for Far Cry 3. Blood dragon.In this game you take on the role of Rex Power Colt, A patriotic cyber commando who makes terrible puns. (I didn't appreciate this, he would always talk over me while I was making a pun)Alrighty, let's get started as any pessimist would, by going through and exaggerating the games faults. First of allIT'S SHORTAny speedrunner could complete this game in little over an hour. Any even for completionist, there simply isn't enough content in the game to keep anyone satisfied for long, perhaps 5 hours tops. There a few weapons (7, I think), few collectables, few side missions and, all in all, simply not enough to do. This was so frustrating because this game had so much potential. The blood dragon's design was fantastic, but the game could have benefited from other sorts of blood dragons, as there is only one type. The side missions were repetitive (Rescue the hostage, hunt the tiger, rinse and repeat) The garrisons were too easy (either kill all the enemies or open the mega shields and let the blood dragons do the work) and the collectables were barely hidden. The game also had a very basic scheme of levelling up. At the very start, you already had full access to most of the abilities in Far Cry 3, and the last few (Grenade takedown, Gunslinger takedown ect) Were unlocked simply by being a certain level. Each level would hold a single benefit, such as an extra health bar. If you're like me and you love a large skill tree, I would recommend Path of Exile, because you will not find anything here. The game also was missing a serious crafting system. you started the game with four weapon slots, a wallet way to big to ever be full, regardless of how long you play for, and everything else that you should have had to craft in order to give this game some extra content.As I hinted earlier, too easy. To be fair, I did play the game on normal mode (I recently tried to play through Batman: Arkham Origins on hard mode and simply couldn’t get past the first fight (Because I had no idea how to fight) so I thought it’d be safer to play through like this) but I was completely baffled about how easy the game was. You don’t even need to attempt to avoid enemy fire, you’re basically immortal. I tended to run directly at a blood dragon wielding a shotgun and I would win. I thought I’d mention that because you can jump really high (Yay, Cyborg powers activate) you can “Death from above” any enemy regardless of whether or not you are above, on the same level or even below them, effectively allowing you to one-shotty any enemy, even elite heavies. After discovering this little glitch, I did what any fifteen year old boy would do after discovering a way to cheat, exploited the crap out of it until the game was no longer fun. Even without exploiting this glitch, you’re still basically a god.This game still does have some positive aspects, regardless of how negative I’ve been so far. The guns were fun (Regardless of there being only 7), the blood dragons were awesome (Even though there was only one type) and the missions were all fun (regardless of being repetitive). And I couldn’t complete this review without mentioning the loading screens. ♥♥♥♥, those things were hilarious. Such great lines as “The takedown drag ability has nothing to do with cross dressers”, “Ziplines. We have them” and “Need help? The next randomly selected loading screen could answer your question”Alright, summary time (If you were gonna skip to the end, this’d be the place I’d choose to read.Cons: 	ShortRepetitiveNot enough contentPros:	Yay, explosionsYay, DinosaursYay, humorous loading screensBasically, what I’m trying to say is that it’s a good afternoon of explosion-y goodness, but unless you’re desperate for more Far-Cry 3, don’t waste your money.4/10 (Drunk 6 at best.)Thanks for reading, like this review if you liked it, comment on this review if you have something to say, Like this review if you didn’t like it, comment on this review regardless of whether or not you have something to say, like this review if you feel completely neutral to it.Thanks, and I’ll see you guys next time.(Like it, damn it.

I loved Far Cry 3, and thought the creative direction to incorporate cheesy 80's-style humor with retro gaming was a neat take. But like... when you're playing a game, and you find yourself having to purposefully push yourself to keep playing it? That's a bad sign.I'd give a plot synopsis, but really, there's not much more to it then ""you're a badass cyborg on an island killing pretty much everything while you save the world for the USA."" If the humor the game uses were enough to make up for the flat plot, this might be exclusable, but there were countless groaners that really fit the genre... too well. Guys, there's a reason we don't right corny as hell plots like this anymore.Alright, so the story is flat and schlocky, how about the gameplay? Well, it's basically just Far Cry 3, except... detached. You've got maybe 6 hours in the core game, 16ish overall if you get all the collectables. They didn't add much new until really the end of the game, and really, half of what was so fun about Far Cry 3 was you ascended your character from weak chump to badass over the course of the game, discovering new skills and abilities. Here, you just start out a badass becoming a bigger badass, fighting hordes and hordes of bland, faceless enemies... It just kind of became boring. Vast murder and tons of explosions became boring. That's half the selling point of your game!The only stuff I really took enjoyment in was the stealth and the mobility, which is surpisingly good. The environments may not be all that pretty, but at least moving about them is a fluid and kinda pleasant experience.All in all, unless you really want some kind of new Far Cry 3 experience? Just avoid this one. I'm surprised I stuck with it as long as I did."

So i should give it a negative review. It's an ok game, but after playing this i know i don't want to play any of the other Far Cries (and i haven't). It is bland and repetitive. Story missions and the theme is ok, but nothing really engaging, spectacular, at times stupid even. I get that this was an intention to beat on trash movies cliches, but it was too much some times. Outside of the main story it is an open world which is pretty empty. Yeah with some fights between scientists and commandos going on here and there. It was fun to roam in a jeep, but not for long. Side quest are all similar (go and kill someone and maybe save some scientist jerk). I hated missions requiring you to do stealth in an open field surrounded by 20+ enemies. ""Cutscenes"" were often too long and, i don't know, i just didn't liked how they sounded and looked. I didn't get the leveling thing as you couldn't choose a skill, it was just a linear progression which happened automatically. I hated some animations like pilfering cyberhearts (which you needed sometimes to distract dragons) or shotgun reloading cycle which took to long to start shooting again.Then the general design. Saves somethimes weren't working. So i ended up only using checkpoints. And once i had to listen to some story dialog like 10 times while dying on some side quest and loading again. Stupid system of repeating everything when you load a save. After a recent uPlay update it started to mess with Blood Dragon launch and jumped in front of it making BD starting in a windowed state, so i had to restart it every time (that' because uPlay wasn't already running, yeah, i don't want some program to run all the time when i only need it for one game occasionally). That's another point why i won't play Far Cry or other Ubisoft game.All in all, it was fun to shoot enemies and ride the jeep at times, but it was also a bland, sometimes boring game with an overdone humour. Can't call it a good game."

From a dedicated flip-off button, to an insanely overpowered laser, to mechanical sharks, to cheesy one-liners and plot points from just about every 80's action movie you can think of; Blood Dragon is a great change of pace from the generic monotony of modern shooters.That being said, this game is easy... like really easy.I played through Far Cry 3 on normal and ended up having to challenge myself by not using stealth or certain weapons because it was so easy. With that in mind I played Blood Dragon on hard. Playing through this on hard felt easier than vanilla Far Cry 3 on normal. I was run and gunning almost the entire way through the game with little use of stealth and little to no threat of danger. Just one of the many perks of being a badass cyber commando I guess.Then there's the unfortunate fact that the game completely misses an opportunity to have a cheesy and completely unnecessary sex scene when Rex has too much energy for his body to handle. Luckily the game rectifies this by having an even cheesier sex scene about 2 minutes later.All-in-all, I give this game a 5 out of 5; Dangerously Cheesy."

If that trailer was the thing for you - weeeeell, maybe you will kinda like the game. But still it is a watered-down, less-serious, brainless and rushed in version of FC3. It screames ""I want to be awesome!!!"" out of everywhere but the gameplay is basically your FC3 wrapped in some old time references. It looks like you should be running and gunning around Serious Sam-style but nope. Find some cover, spot your enemies, still the same. But level design does not really help with that. And the atmosphere. And the music. Everything wants the game to be tougher and cooler than it can actually be.After 30 minutes I wasn't really feeling like playing it anymore constantly thinking ""give me back my Far Cry"". Today I have tried it once again. And guess what - I've had to start it all over again. Why bother with all those ""checkpoint, game saved""? It worked fine in FC3 last time I checked. And I'm not going through half an hour of that ""tutorial"" again. I'm noping out of it. Once again, everything is not that bad, even fine. Except for the gameplay. It doesn't fit at all.Mind that I don't really write revirews but this game made me do it. I just hope I can help some fellow gamer to save a few bucks. If you are not really sure then don't buy it. Forget it.P.S. To all those negative pseudo-reviews based solely on the presence of Uplay - stop being such crybabies and learn to PC or buy youself a console, just stop bothering people. Never had any troubles with it, always launches without asking any questions and works silently until you exit the game. Then it takes you just one click to close it."

Sure, it comes with a full visual overhaul and a true 80s retro feel, but to call this a separate game would be too generous. The pacing is pretty bad, and they don't give you choice over how you level your player. The weapon selection is woefully limited and vehicles are pretty much pointless as your character runs at breakneck speed by default. The inclusion of the blood dragons was a nice touch, but I would have liked to see more of this, more character abilities, more challenge.The tongue-in-cheek humour is good (although it dries up a little outside of the first 30mins). There's some good retro gaming fan service and let's face it, shooting cyborgs in the face with a neon-coated bow from a faraway hill still ticks some boxes, but this game could've been much more.

Technical support was of no help at all, and even after upgrading my computer (which I shouldn't have had to do, since I already met all the requirements), finally getting the game to work was an ordeal when I discovered that the game would crash on me almost every five minutes of play. Worse, it would often give me the Blue Screen of Death, forcing me to reboot. Even after trying everything I could from every advice, tip and tutorial I found online written for (and by) the many users who have gove through the exact same issues, the game would still crash.Since the game doesn't let you decide when you save your progress, most of my original run of Far Cry 3 was devoted to trying to get through the mandatory tutorial (that felt like it was 20-minutes long) in the beginning of the game, hoping it would not-crash long enough for me to get to a checkpoint and not have to start all over again when the game inevitably freezes my computer, forcing both a reboot on my part as well as a long wail of frustration, curled fingers reaching for the uncaring dark skies above.Blood Dragon, I was hoping, would be an improvement and the issues with its parent game (which were reported not only by yours truly, but a great many users who practically flooded not only the official game forums but a big chunk of other threads and discussion boards) - unfortunately, the game crashed right in the middle of the (again, mandatory) tutorial in the beginning, shortly after the opening scene and before I could get two minutes into the thing.I wish I had more to say about both games, but this abyssal experience has not allowed me much of an opportunity to actually play the game itself, and since it shouldn't be on me, the customer, to spend months of my life sifting through forums and struggling against the current, trying to get the game I paid money for to actually PLAY, I simply deleted both games from my computer and consoled myself only with the fact that I bought this one on sale.Still, it doesn't wash away the bad taste of the promise of a little video gamey fun being ruined by the video game not actually running."

It's standard and stale FPS gameplay with neon and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes.The Good.+The game play is smooth, and aside from cutscenes (which don't really obstruct gameplay) and loading you'll spend your time wandering the black-and-neon wastes.+The game engine itself feels fluent and all cutscenes are skippable.+The sniper rifle is useful, with or without any attachments.Not OP at all.>+Blowing people up with the sniper issatisfying, for a short period anyway.+Power Core (Power on Uplay?) is actually pretty good.+Blood Dragon Main theme is OK.+You can still drive the large utility trucks atleast once in the game, it never forces you to, but you can do it.+If you look for it you can find a mantaray in the water, nothing too special but it was cool seing something other than a shark, eal or fish.The Bad.-Game is supposed to have a stupid atmostphere, but it just ends up being bad.-It is WAY too short even on hard, even after collecting EVERYTHING. It's under 4 hours. I've beaten  it twice already and screwed around in the empty world.-The pistol, while probably supposed to be a reference to the Robocop pistol, is, unlike it's original, useless. Looks are decieving.-The shotgun doesn't work like you would expect when it's in quad. It takes 3-5 shells to kill a heavy on single, 4 on double, and a total of 8 on quad. How does that work? It's because it normally takes an average of 4, but the game most likely doesn't count all 4 shells hitting when your in quad. The fire attachment feels OK and it works, until you realize it isn't just fire. It explodes too, which is most likely going to shred you too when your using a shotgun at close range, it also explodes grass, which lights everything on fire. Which includes you, because there is grass everywhere. Plus fire is useless on Blood ""Dragons.""-I know the point of the game is to be all-on-you, but if your going to have friendly AI, don't make them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I watched a couple jeeps of scientists crash into the same Blood ""Dragon"" at the same spot.-Blood Dragons are clearly Dinosaurs.>-This isn't Star Trek, and that isn't a dog with a cone on it's head.>-How hard is it to tell a Dinosaur from a Dragon? It's not even a European Dragon/Wyvern.-The Terror 4000.-The bow is absolute crap, and I don't know why anyone though it was a good idea. ♥♥♥♥ing Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ that's why.-Remember death from above? How about finishing 1/2 the game never using ammo? Sound fun? It's not. It's OP and is even worse when you get auto pilfer. Someone tell me why I need a gun again.-The Pin Cussion (CRT) Shader gets really anoying after about an hour in game, If it needs to be there, it could have atleast had been better.-Minor, but there is no photo mode, there's some really cool stuff to see, If only there wasn't a GUI and the shaders from the GUI in the way.-Ending sequence is BS, and you can't die.-Minor: They missed the opertunity to reference Atari's Battlezone and put a castle in the background and send missiles at you when you try to go to it.-The Kill Star is terrible VS the Terror or Sniper.-You don't get to kill sloan.-Ending BS cutscene is BS.-Flamer is still terrible.-Fazetron is Ok, I'm Ok with that, and I am not OK with that.>-Fazetron on lasers is actually pretty bad, and not worth the effort. Just skip it.-Cutscenes are based on the Ninja Giaden style, but if you never played that they just end up looking like slideshows. Why they weren't Sega-CD-like-FMV style beats me, I'd expect that to be wider known. They even go as far to make the still sprites slide across the scene in some cases.-You still can't go onto Sloan's island or the bridge even after the game is fully complete.-Why the ♥♥♥♥ would anyone kill 25 Blood Dragons?-Soundtrack does not contain any mitch murder or Kavinsky>-Uplay doesn't let you get the song from the fights leading up to the Kill Star, but gives you sloan's assault instead.-Why do you keep giving me C400, let alone C4, if  I will NEVER USE IT.-Molotox tends  not to light♥♥♥♥♥♥on fire, let alone doing damage to anything other than you.-Mission abandoned due to walking too far to the left, or any direction for tha matter.-Cyber Soldiers voice isn't irony or nostalgia, it's just anoying.-Location isn't new, if you didn't know it't just FC3's second island burned and covered in Noble gas lights.-Jeeps without guns. Everywhere.-Cyber Soldiers drop weapons and they decintegrate, and no matter what they had tend to give you Fazetron ammo anyway.-I had to be on hard to ever have a shark not ignore me.-Can my Blood Dinosaurs do something toehr than explode when killed?-Saving hostages that run into fire, explosions or my sniper rifle is BS-The limit for cyber hearts is 99. You'll collect around 230 ingame if your like me (collectively before and after they take everythingaway), using only ~32 in the entire game.-The D20, when the ♥♥♥♥ would I ever use that.-Sniper is OP on max upgrades.Joke points-The TVs don't have descriptions, unlike the VHS tapes which are based off real movies.-There is no VHS player to use any of the VHS tapes, 2007 really was hell.-TVs under water.-Where is my bike?-Blue goo.-You can♥♥♥♥♥♥off animals and slow them down with D20s.-Stop putting bow ammo everywhere, it's useless.+Mmmm.

Completely thurough with it's cheesy 80's theme, but often to a fault.For example, purposfully covering your view with scanlines and tint to bring back crappy 80's resolution doesn't mean said scanlines and tint won't make it hard to see what the christ is going on throughout the entire christing game!Far Cry 3's use of its engine was magnificant! But it wasn't designed as an over the top shooter. It was about planning, taking it slow, and methodically toppeling your foes' instalments. This game on the other hand is about action! Lots of action! Over the top action! But Far Cry 3's engine just doens't support it. Oh, Blood Dragon will tell you that stealth is still an option, but stealth requires precision and clarity, two things which this game's visuals (while awesome) utterly preclude.If you're more into 80's cheese than I am, you might be able to look past that. But all that deliberatily crappy grunge just gets in the way of the mechanics, the clarity and the conveyance.Yes, it's completely faithful to it's 80's theme, but I personally am reminded why it's a good job it's not the 80's anymore.Not to mention horrible horrible Uplay.

The other being Far Cry 3 obviously. I must admit, I’m a little biased because I'm a sucker for anything 80's: movies, music and the general 'Sci-Fi' feeling and because of this Blood Dragon fits in all the right references, making it seem like a great corny action packed movie.There isn't too much to hate about the game. Ubisoft is one thing naturally, the game is not that challenging even on hard but that is probably for the best and the game seems to crash a fair bit on windows 10? I minimised this by opting out of the steam beta which I signed up years ago (In fact Ubisoft support commented on a forum to do this), sucks it didn't completely work but I did see a fps boost of around 5-10fps.Overall this game is very good, I'd recommend you play Far Cry 3 before this and not after as it gives a different vibe, making a greater experience.

,Recommended,233270,20638051,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,Sevlir,"This game is short, fast, and fun. Take every 80's movie you've ever seen, boil them down into one sickeningly neon-tinged plot that seems to check every box that defines the age of the VHS tape. From Winners Don't Do Drugs to the Terminator's lever action shotgun, this game is packed with all sorts of jokes and references, while divulging from time to time to crack wise at the dumbing down of modern games. Where this game shines is in the main missions, slick humor, responsive shooting, dynamic battlefields, and of course the gradual journey of becoming the ultimate 80's action hero.This is not an intellectual game, however, and the game is far from perfect. There is plenty of meaningless collecting, familiar outpost clearing, and animal slaying that a fan of the modern Far Cry series will find tiring and less fitting to such a setting that relies on fast action. Increasing the movement speed across the board makes the travel all the more tedius, and there seems little reward for completing these tasks other than re-upgrading weapons to their initial state. There are only a handful of weapons compared to an armory's worth in previous games, I experienced a number of crashing issues and there is all sorts of open-world wierdness, but nothing too glaring or frustrating.All in all, the game is quite fun, if familiar. The main missions and cutscenes are well worth the cost, and by the time you finish this 10 hour experience you'll be wishing there was more."
