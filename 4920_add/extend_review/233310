,Recommended,233310,7729733,"Posted: 23 November, 2013",all,Der Ungrund,"Avadon 2 very much takes the ""more of the same"" approach to sequel writing.  It has everything the first game had, only bigger areas, more side quests, new classes, and more companions.  Unfortunately, I've never really liked the Avadons as much as I have some of Spiderweb's other games and I think I've finally worked out why: they are games about politics where there's really not a whole lot at stake that's interesting.  This point sticks out more than it otherwise might given that Spiderweb has already done politics heavy RPGs so superbly in the Geneforge games.  In the Geneforges, each political faction was modeled around answers to central ethical and philosophical questions about the nature of personhood, human rights, eugenics, and  power.  This makes each of the factions not only easily identifiable, but immediately engaging as the issues at stake are so emotionally charged and relevant to our own world.  The brilliant thing about the Geneforges is that they use their faction systems to rigorously dissect these issues from a variety of different angles, continually muddying and graying them so that you often find yourself taking ethical positions that you'd never thought you'd take a few hours (or games) earlier.In contrast to the Geneforges, though, Avadon's political squabbles tend to be over much more dry and mundane things like land and political rule and the moral and ethical stakes are never as clear or well defined.  While the games do delve into the question of how much freedom citizens should be willing to give up in exchange for safety, the issue is never really tackled with much rigor or emotional resonance.  Likewise, the various political groups themselves are not as philosophically distinct and tend to blur together as a consequence.  Which ultimately makes it hard to choose sides, not because of the presence of any moral ambiguity, but because of the absence of any reason to care.  It's very hard to get invested in a plot that is, ultimately, about nothing more than squabbles over who gets to control digital land in a digital fantasy world.All that said, when it comes to being not as good as the Geneforge series, many, many, RPGs fall short.  So I don't mean to suggest that Avadon 2 is a bad game.  I enjoyed it a great deal and if you like turn based, party focused, RPGs you probably will too.  It's just disappointing as I know Spiderweb is capable of doing way better."

The graphics are bad, the sound is terrible, and the presentation leaves a lot to be desired... but the writing is great, the story and setting are interesting, and the game is a fun old-school RPG.

Also this is long and rambling.I enjoyed the first Avadon well enough. But that's because it was a fresh IP. Spiderweb's last totally new IP was Geneforge. I loved the first game, despite its flaws, and hoped the sequel would be even better. Well, the sequel added a few new monsters to shape, but didn't do anything significant with the rest of it. He (Jeff Vogel) doesn't improve his games as he makes sequels. This is definitely true of Avadon. He added a new class without touching the others.So that sounds like purely a dig at Spiderweb's ability to make sequels. Other games get away with worse, sure (Dynasty Warriors, any sports game). So how about just talking about this game? Well, other reviews here are talking about some ""80 hours"" of gameplay. Many RPG's achieve higher numbers like these with things like down time (managing items, houses, crafting, etc.) and repawns/random encounters. Here he does it with backtracking and reading. And this is the kind of backtracking that involves checking EVERY NPC who gives quests just to see if new ones pop up. And reading is fine, obviously, and even having reading that covers narration instead of just dialogue is good, too. But I feel it's too much. He uses it in place of visuals to too high of a degree. I once read a description of an NPC I was talking to that described her as an old woman in rags. The NPC looked like a male blacksmith to me. This complaint sounds a little odd when talking about an RPG, but video games are a visual medium. And there is clearly room for some visuals in this game engine, like having the NPC's walk around or having things look more like their description so they don't ALWAYS have to be described. Simple things! Anything! More!On that note, the writing has gotten weird. It has this cynical tone to it. And not a ""this is a gritty place where every one tries to screw you"" tone, but a ""I'm tired of making video games"" tone.The combat has a delightful number of scripted encounters (interesting boss fights and not-necessarily-a-boss fights), but the difficulty of combat overall is wonky. I pushed up the difficulty a notch from ""normal"" because I remembered the first Avadon feeling easy. This did... something. Who knows. Most of the time is spent auto-attacking trash. Until you get areas with enemies that are inexplicably way stronger because they are color-swapped. The tanking abilities do nothing, so I use the terrain to trick them into fighting the tank. Sometimes this can't be done fully and my teammates would get manhandled. Then I would just chip them away slowly on my lonely tank. There's no telling what level things are, so my tank can go from being unstoppable to burning through health pots between areas. Much of this is also due to tanking being reliant on avoidance rather than mitigation. So sometimes he dodges everything, sometimes he'd dodge nothing. I suspect using a shaman and tinkermage and filling the screen with summons is a better plan. But I made myself a blademaster, so bleh.After 40 hours I was just too bored to continue, so that's when I had to give up and stop forcing myself to play.P.S. Why is there housing in a game where you have a home? Avadon. Avadon is your home. And it's better than the houses you can buy by a million percent."
,Recommended,233310,12343377,"Posted: 3 October, 2014",all,WabiWasabi,"The first 10 hours of Avadon 2 brought me back to the old days circa Ultima IV, suggesting a sprawling world full of ethically ambiguous side-quests and NPC’s. Although the full game doesn’t quite live up to its initial promise, it’s still a solid CRPG experience overall.The graphics are like something straight out of the early ‘90s, and you’ll either find that charming or off-putting depending on your taste. I lean a little more toward the former, and although I did miss the ability to rotate my camera view a few times, overall the low-fi look didn’t detract from my enjoyment at all.What did put me off the game a bit is how the story arc kind of fizzles out not even halfway through. What starts out feeling like an interesting thicket of subplots and opportunities for interesting decisions ends up really boiling down to one grand choice of “taking sides,” expressed over and over again in pretty much the same way.The game is also quite long, and although the tactical combat isn’t terrible, it’s not quite rich or varied enough to stay fresh through 60-70 hrs of gameplay. The last third of the game was a bit of a slog, and although the battles were ramped up both in scale and difficulty, they felt more tedious than climactic.Still, it’s a solid game, and though I don’t see myself playing through it again, I might come back in a few months to check out something from Spiderweb’s back catalog."
76561198045118691,Not Recommended,233310,31518096,Posted: 2 May,all,Scarface,"Avadon 2: The Corruption of my ComputerThe 2nd instalment in Avadon is a slog with a large helping of filler. I like the Spiderweb games, but honestly this one felt like a waste of time. Nothing really happens, the fights are drawn out and numerous, and I constantly had to run from one area back to another which considerably boosted the time played in all the wrong ways. Another reviewer called the ending anti-climactic... I agree with this wholeheartedly.One of the biggest flaws was the broken combat system as you progress. I guess ol' Jeffy boy realized you'd hit level 30 well before the end of the game so he gave his wizards and spellcasters the ability to take 3 steps, cast a lightning bolt, cast a daze spell, then cast another lightning bolt all in one turn (all while not being hasted or speed boosted in any way)! I mean, even if you drink a haste and frenzy potion, you'll get two attacks max. Great lazy programming there to prolong a game with pointless drawn out combat sequences against ""Random"" Tawon soldiers.I wanted to like this game, I tried to read the majority of dialogues and such... but it was just too much filler. I was pumped to play all three in the series but now I'll take a pass on part 3 until it goes on sale for the inevitable $5. Play this game if you love the story, but be ready for a game that draaaaaagggggggs."
,Recommended,233310,16032798,"Posted: 27 May, 2015",all,Monte Cristo,"The Game in short:Old school ""crpg"" gameplay & aesthetics.Fantastic writing and a story you _will_ get drawn into (eventually - see extended comments below).Squad-based tactical combat and customizable characters.Enjoyable loot hoarding.Insanely good value (at time of writing I have 63 hours on one play through - not bad for $10).EXTENDED COMMENTSAs others have said, this game is graphically moribund. If you've played  other Spiderweb games you already know this (and you are already familiar with most of the sprites and textures). **However** the graphics really don't matter; after a while the graphics will look better and better because this game _will_ engage your imagination as you personally construct the world Avadon presents (this is probably an effect of all the reading you will do - think of how personal and vivid the reality of your favorite book was at the time of reading).The writing is great - I haven't been a reader of high-fantasy fiction in decades, but I have still thoroughly enjoyed the story so far. I believe this is because in this game, your decisions, well, erm... might matter? This is a key point: while other games claim to have 'decisions that matter' simply because player-decisions have some visible and immediate affect on the world, in Avadon 2 you are often forced into difficult decisions and then given no clear indication of what effect (if any) they had. This isn't to say that nothing happens- NPC's will mention your prior decisions and give you the impression that certain things may yet come to pass because of them, but you are left wondering until such outcomes do (or don't) occurr.With all the above said, I will admit that it took a while for me to get drawn into the game world. In the beginning, it appeared simple and I took it at face value - I was probably 30 hours in before I began to realize that the world of Avadon is truly constructed of shades-of-grey (and perhaps, like a good book, is constructed to allow the viewer/gamer to reflect upon their own world, should they so choose). For anyone not interested in contemplating the morally-ambiguous complexity of safety-vs-freedom and power-vs-control the story may remain simple.Combat is tactical and (mostly) squad-based. You will usually control 3 characters in a turn-based battle system that can have difficulty adjusted to suit your individual taste (I kept things at 'normal' and found combat satisfying, if not overly difficult).The game world is a scattering of regions, each containing 5-8 maps or so. Regions are all connected to Avadon, which serves as the primary hub and base for missions. Side-quests galore exist (I've been trying to do them all, which is probably how my hour count got so high).Prior experience with Avadon (or other Spiderweb games) is totally unnecessary. I own Avadon 1, but have never played it. My only other Spiderweb experience came from playing through the majority of Avernum: Escape from the Pit on an iPad (though I never did finish that one).My only real complaint about Avadon 2 is the lack of UI-control customization. I would love nothing more than to be able to toggle Windows open and shut with the same key. Additionally, I'd love to be able to stop accidental touch-pad clicks from closing important dialogue windows (I've several times now missed out on reading some vital piece of conversation because I accidentally shut the conversation window and the game offers no way to undo such actions).In summary - the game is fun, cheap, and surprisingly engaging on various cognitive levels. I recommend this to anyone, but particularly to smart 30-something gamer dads like myself."

It is, however, a strangely engrossing and surprisingly complex (in some ways) RPG, which has more life in it than you'd expect for a game that looks the way it is. If you'll forgive the fact that Spiderweb Software have been using the same assets for over a decade, you'll find a decent game with a solid story and decent gameplay mechanics. A minor complaint for me is that combat is too easy (and this is coming from someone who had to cheat to beat Baldur's Gate) even on hard, but it wasn't too much of a barrier to my enjoyment of the game."

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.One Hour Reviews - Game 14Avadon: 2: The CorruptionPurchase Date: 6/17/2015I just picked this game up in the latest Steam Summer Sale for half off.  Normally I wouldn't buy a game before playing the original, but this game is from Spiderweb Software, and if you have ever played any of their games, you already know what to expect.  I can see how that might sound bad.  After all, I often see complaints about how the latest annual edition of some game has barely changed from last year.But I wouldn't go so far as to say that Spiderweb's games are cookie-cutter.  It's just that each of their games are inspired by old school role playing games like Ultima.  They look to recreate this kind of experience, but with some elements that you would expect to see in more modern games that make their games accessible.If reading lots of text sounds boring, this game isn't for you.  If you are looking for a game with cut-scenes and lots of voice acting, this game isn't for you.  If you don't find moving around on a grid in turn-based combat to be fun, then this game also isn't for you.I played and reviewed the first Avadon right before this one, so that I could compare the 2 games and give an idea of what's different.The first Avadon offered a choice of 4 classes, which I compared to the basic archetypes of a Fighter, Wizard, Thief, and Priest.  Avadon 2 adds a fifth class, the Tinkermage, which as the name implies is kind of a tinkerer type class with some thieving abilities mixed in.  I picked this class for my playthrough.One small difference I appreciated from the first Avadon is that now you can choose if your character is male or female for each of the classes.  In the first Avadon, your gender was based on which class you picked.  There still isn't much in the way of any character customization.  The character looks are predetermined based on your selection of class and gender.The interface looks exactly the same as it did in the first Avadon.  A minimap is displayed in the top right corner.  The map can be hidden, or hitting Tab will display a larger version of the map.  Character portraits are at the top left.  A series of icons can be found along the bottom, with static icons on the left for common actions, and icons to the right for assigning hotkeys.  It's a familar looking interface, not just from being the same as the original Avadon, but from many other RPGs as well.  Don't expect to be able to move UI elements around though; everything is statically placed.Like with the first Avadon, the game starts you out in a tutorial mode of sorts, with prompts to give directions on how to move around and do basic things.  Also like the first game, I quickly found myself in my first combat.  The combat early on is super easy and is really designed to explain the basics of combat, and introduce you to using abilities.I mentioned I picked the Tinkermage class.  I started out with 2 abilities.  One let me place turrets that would shoot at enemies, and the other ability basically acted as a heal for any turrets I had already placed.  Abilities come with a cooldown timer, meaning that once an ability has been used, it can't be reused for a number of turns afterward.  This kept me from peppering the field with turrets, which understandably would be a bit unbalancing.Something I neglected to mention in my last review is that you do have a party in Avadon.   Both Avadon and Avadon 2 will quickly introduce a second character to your party.  Sometimes these characters will be computer controlled, but most of the time you are directing the actions of everyone in your party.Obviously I can't really judge a game's story based on a one hour review.  But I will say I enjoyed the opening of Avadon 2 more than the original.  The first game starts out in  the fortress of Avadon and my first quest had me killing rodents in a dungeon, which is pretty standard way to open a game.  Avadon 2 by contrast had my character running for his life to try and get back to his keep to report an invading force.  It made for a more exciting opening.As I mentioned with the first Avadon, this game isn't for everyone, but I appreciate that these kinds of games still get made, and I will happily continue to recommend them."

I have played hundreds of CRPG's over the past 20+ years, on dozens of different consoles and this game really ""did it"" for me. Avadon 2 is no ""Divinity Original Sin"" but I still enjoyed it nearly as much, the game is a blast if not a little rough around the edges like me.Avadon 2 is a rather large CRPG, is has a deep and intricate storyline which I found pretty original among CRPG's. Avadon 2 has wonderful ""original in style"" character creation, character building systems and the game even has some secrets ??? : ). It has challenging combat which scales greatly depending what difficulty you chose and which takes place using a Grid Based, Turn Based, Action Point combat system. The combat in Avadon 2 feels very similar to the combat in the early Fallout games (1&2)  but the fixed viewpoint is a little more Roguelike in nature. As I eluded to with the secrets comment earlier, exploration in Avadon is fun and there are fights, loot and secrets to be found by the patient and meticulous types of players.I should warn people who are new to this series, that games like Avadon and Avernum are not for everyone. If you are the type of gamer that expects an RPG to hold your hand the entire time and to essentially function more like an interactive graphic, choose your own advernture novel, this game is going to send you to bed without supper and you will be crying angry tears as you lay awake. I could best describe the tutorial aspects combined with how rapidly the difficulty scales and fluctuates in Avadon as ""raw & brutish"" but the challenge makes the game super fun. All Avadon and Avernum titles are created with the assumption that those who play the games are not only good at reading, but that they enjoy reading.So to wrap this review up, I totally recommend buying this game as long as you read my warnings and are still curious. It is worth the full asking price, but you may feel a little better if you got it on sale. The combination of size and detail make this game a decent time sink, so be prepared for some fun, gritty CRPG gameplay and make sure to go into it with and open mind and a sharp eye."

The story is well written, funny at times and has nice twists.It has a good upgrading system, varied maps, tons of weapons, crafting, magic, looting etc.The only thing that is missing is nice background music that fills the gap of having no voice acting or a narator in the game and to hide the basic environment sound loops (it's all text).If you like oldschool rpg's then this game should be in your library."

And if you dont know what SSI was, you missed one of the best eras in CRPGs. If you live in a country where these games were not released, forgive me. Then go get them somewhere on the internet.)Its Spiderweb. If youve played one of developer Jeff Vogel's games, visually/interface/sound wise you've played em all. You know what to expect and it isn't much.But you weren't playing this game to be wowed by the graphics and sound, were you?If you were, go somewhere else so you don't clutter the forum with your complaints. Id rather not hear it.But if you like immersive, in depth plots where you actually have to read and imagine what your character sees, and you like gewtting swept away be an amazing world and story,then go for it, you wont regret it."

I have played them all and appreciate the graphical imporovements they make with each game. Where they really excell is the storyline and the conflict presented to players, there is never an easy choice. Avadon also engages you with the decisions that you make and draws you in. This is an old school style Dungeon Crawler where you play with at least 3 different characters from various classes to present a  balaced fighting team.I appreciate the choice of Easy to Hard so that I can play my own way as well as there being inbuilt cheats in the game if you get stuck. If you dont like reading a lot of text then I dont think that this game is for you. Play the demo on the developers website if you are unsure and then purchase it here. It is a big sprawling world with lots of surprises. I am really enjoying this game."

This says I'll be playing it for a while, which is good: I like longer games. But it also says that there will be a lot of slow exploring and fighting, which is less good. However, I loved the story in the first one and I'm sure this one is more story-driven anyway. We shall see."

I sometimes forgot how good graphics look like because I keep playing old style games.  :D  Overall, this game is fun and good.  Kind of linear map wise, but overall fun.

It has a very rich story and I didn't realize how much I missed until after the game was over.  To me, it's a nostalgia game.  Kind of like the old SSI Dungeons and Dragons games.  If you're old like me, that might appeal to you.MANY words of caution though.  This game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard.  Some games like to hold your hand.  This game uses its hands to choke you.  That was just Normal difficulty.  I eventually said, ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and lowered it to Casual.  From there, most fights were a breeze but there were still boss fights that were kind of tricky.If you play, try it on Normal first.  When you're fed up with it, drop to Casual and enjoy the story.Oh and always have lockpicks on you."

For me, that means we have on our hands another excellent CRPG. And while complexity of politics and intrigue still not up to Geneforge standards, in my opinion, the game still delivers interesting story and great gameplay.My only complaint about it would be that graphics are somewhat hard on eyes, due to low contrast of some elements of the world and fonts that are a bit to small maybe for modern displays.Do try the new character class, Tinkermage. It is most enjoyable!"

In reality, this mechanic requires you to start a fight in one room (and take damage), then you will be ""blown"" to the next room to start another fight (and take more damage). There have to be at least a dozen rooms. You never finish the fights. There is no chance to heal or save. If you die, you will obviously start again right before this nonsense. There is no way to exit this area to level-up more or search for additional items to complete this are (which is required to progress the story).There is absolutely ZERO indication that some nonsense like this is about to occur and that you should have a massive stockpile of items.Pros:You don't have to play it"
