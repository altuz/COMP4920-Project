The book contains extra info on how the game was built up, how the developers started with many ideas, a horroristic game with monsters, and how they ended up with a survival story. It was a long road and you can find many interesting concept arts about this in the book. If you're really into the game, you'll surely enjoy seeing all the awesome behind the scenes stuff."

76561198048974498,Recommended,233410,32410808,Posted: 14 June,all,rjmacready,"Before I begin the review I have one simple question for the developers: HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ COULD YOU LEAVE THE PET MONKEY OUT OF THE GAME?! There's countries in the world where people are thrown off buildings for lesser ""crimes"".Now that those unpleasantries are out of the way, I'll review the quality of the actual product on sale here. First up, it's a mobile app which doesn't appear to go full screen, so getting used to the somewhat ""windowed"" presentation is a bit of a pain. It also doesn't ""save"" or ""bookmark"" the last page you were at, meaning you have to remember this for yourself, then use the Contents page to fast-track back to it. Not exactly ideal.There's some novel interactive touches, like polls which feed back instant internet-based survey results, and photos you can pan around 360 degrees; a spirit of innovation which is regrettably sullied by the videos which lazily link out to YouTube, meaning you'd better have some extra bandwidth up your sleeve if you wanna get the full experience.This said, the content is nice enough, and of evident interest to anyone who either adored the game or plans on making games of their own. Is it worth two bucks? Guess so. Half that price on sale, easy. Though the more penny-pinching among you could probably save yourself the money by just Googling and Youtubing much the same information. For the rest of us who don't mind paying a small price for the quasi-convenience of it all, it's a nice enough package, if quite a ways from ""essential"".Verdict: 6/10."
,Recommended,233410,9120268,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,Senno,"Fans and gamers were spoilt with Tomb Raider - the rebooted origin tale of the titular Lara Croft - and this wonderful behind-the-scenes digital book companion will offer great insight into how it all happened. Veteran journalist Geoff Keighley provides a relatively comprehensive look at the design process, showcasing many concepts that never made it to the finished game, as well as artwork, sketches, interviews and reports on how Crystal Dynamics recreated the video game icon.This well designed application is best used on a tablet computer, but can be enjoyed just as easily on a desktop. Additionally, there are interactive elements, such as panoramas of the developer's studio and a music mixer. Much of the video content is actually streamed rather than downloaded with the application, but I found the content both new and good quality.While everything is well designed and easy to navigate, I found the content lacking. The whole book can be read in just over an hour, and there is little beyond the abandoned concepts that proves truly captivating. For those who have followed previews, the content could be considered lightweight. And for those who haven't, there isn't a great deal on offer to make this a must-buy.For Lara Croft fans, this is a fine addition to a wonderful game, and for those interested in the development process, Tomb Raider - The Final Hours offers a glimpse behind the curtain into the industry and the pressure to reboot gaming royalty. Overall, however, this is just an optional add on that offers little value for money and should only be purchased as part of a collector's edition. There just isn't enough content to justify its asking price.For the fans.6.5/10."
,Not Recommended,233410,11344143,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,kamk /idle,"I would recommend it,but it has some problems.videos get streamed from Youtube. Which obviously means you can't watch them offline! Nor any time later if they remove the videos.the interface is really annoying. No scaling options for the text, i.e. the ""book"" goes fullscreen, but only takes a quarter of the screen, which is quite bad for users with any common 1080p display, and even worse if above.the ""ingame"" video-player doesn't have basic options like a pause button.readability of some text is awful.If you like the game, and you're interested in some more content about it, i'd say it's absolutely worth the 0.49 on sale (or 1.99 regular). The delivered content is very good, the price is absolutely okay,but sadly they ruined their great work with a really bad interface.TL;DR:5/10 - good & worthy content, but bad delivery.P.S.: you can watch the videos from the ""book"" here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXD6VRSrUxQ"

Lots of interesting stuff, interactive bits and all around great value for less than 3€, and with last day sale I even managed to grab it for 0,60€ so almost a steal!

Overall, however, the information, media, and interactive elements make this an interesting read.  I'm not certain I would consider it a game, though.  Maybe Steam should have an e-books section?"
,Recommended,233410,21626488,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,Artibius,"DLC verdict: Get it on saleComment:Contrary to my previous belief this is not a real DLC for the game. Instead it has its' own entry in the Steam Library and starts up with an executable file. It DOES NOT ADD TO GAME. What it does is that it shows us a documentary of how Tomb Raider was made. With that comes concept art, unused/cut content, the backstory of the franchize and the devs. There are also videos which open up and most of them are a narrative series lead by Zach Levi as he shows us the people involved in TR. Unfortunately most of THESE ARE YOUTUBE VIDEOS (7 in total). Meaning that you will not be able to view them if a video is taken down/broken/restricted in a country. I already had 1 link to a private video there. So it boils down on how much you like Crystal Dynamics and documentaries. If not much, you can pass and won't miss this. For fans - get it on sale!------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this DLC review you can find more in myReview Corner."

To put it simply, there isn't. But what's there is really good. If you're a fan of the tomb raider series (and thats every game mind you) then you will enjoy the content in this. There are lots of cool exclusive, behind-the-scenes videos to be seen here. There is also a final hours series of videos that include interviews with people at crystal dynamics etc. However, be warned that whilst the final hours videos aren't included on the PC version of Tomb Raider 2013, they are included on the PS3 and XBOX 360 versions of the game. Not sure about the definitive edition.Back to the book however, the information is well written and interesting to read. There are also lots of interactive sequences, such as one where you can compare the in-game Lara's face and the model's face that she was based on.Positive+ Interactive Sections+ Easy to Read+ Behind the Scenes VideosNegative- Not much contentConclusionA good and interesting look at how Crystal Dynamics reinvented the Tomb Raider franchise, reccommended for fans of the franchise but be warned that there isn't a huge amount of content on offer."

I really enjoyed the implementation of the videos and the behind the scenes look at thier studios. I really believe they are taking the franchise in the right direction. There are many reasons why Tomb Raider has become my single favorite video game and in part because of the wonderful community that surrounds it. Overall, making this documentary wasn't needed but it was an excellent piece to an already near perfect release. Oh, and the new face of Tomb Raider is absolutely gorgeous as the tradition of the character."
