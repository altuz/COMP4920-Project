76561198042268023,Recommended,233550,7779725,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Fisticuff Mcbuff,"Another World (Known as Out of This World in 1991)is one of those nostalgic oddballs that you never expected to be re-drawn.  The game puts you in the shoes of a scientist Lester Knight Chaykin. A lightening strike messes up one of his experiments and he is transported to a brutal alien sci-fi world, where he is pushed into fleeing from the alien inhabitants with the help of an unsuspected new friend. This is basically all the game has to offer story wise, but this isn't an issue as the game doesn't need an amazing story for you to stay interested.The new art style is beautiful. While the game always had a beautiful art style, the 20th anniversary edition cleans up a lot of the pixels and replaces it with jaw dropping smooth backgrounds bringing a breath of fresh air to the cult classic. Although the few characters the game has may seem basic in design, they still offer charm and hold true to the original game. A smart choice the devs of the 20th anniversary edition made, was allowing the players the ability to turn the classic graphics on, for all those that get a nostalgic boner replaying it in its purest form.Now of course before you go out and buy the game, I must warn you. This game is very veryy hard, and expect to die and die again. Now for this game I would recommend using walkthroughs whenever you get stuck as there is many different paths you can go down that may get you confused and frustrated. Hell even if you use a walkthrough I'm sure you are still going to have a little bit of trouble with this game. Frustration aside, the hard difficulty is very rewarding whenever you finish a puzzle, and it won't feel like you've wasted your time when you reach the end of this journey. With a walkthrough you should be able to finish the game in around 1 hour (Unfortunately it is quite short) and I imagine without a walkthrough the game would last you maybe a couple more hours... Maybe. But to me the game is worth it."
,Recommended,233550,12114802,"Posted: 15 September, 2014",all,Cheeseness,"Click here for the full review(Steam's character limit doesn't allow me to post the full thing here), and if you've played the game, please check out myAnother World survey!In 1991 I first played Another World (also known as Outer World and Out of This World in some regions), a game that would have a greater and more lasting impact on me than any other.On the surface, it seems clear that Another World is a product of its time, and does not align well to some modern dominant design sensibilities. At the time though, it was pushing the envelope with its use of polygons and 'pixigons' and broke with many established motivational paradigms of the era, relying on a desire to explore and drive through the story rather than achieving a score or preserving lives.In spite of its vintage, there are things that developer Éric Chahi was able to achieve in Another World that I believe are still relevant, enjoyable and worth aspiring to, even twenty one years after its release.Upon launching the game, the first thing that stands out is its atmosphere. Within the first moments of the intro cinematic, much of the game's tone is set, as the protagonist Lester (who is only named in the credits) is depicted arriving in his Italian sportscar at an isolated lab on a dark and brooding night. Lester immediately comes across as being successful, independent and yet lonely as he is greeted by the lab's AI and seats himself at a solitary workstation. The cinematic's score echoes this, playing an eerie isolated melody leading up to Lester's appearance, which is joined by a purposeful military percussion as he enters his workplace. As the experiment begins, rhythmic tensions builds before suddenly and unexpectedly, Lester and his desk are vapourised, leaving a charred crater with dissipating charge arcing across its surface.The game itself begins with Lester and his desk materialising beneath the surface of a deep stone pool, a stark contrast to his technically advanced (and air filled) lab. The sense of displacement is real and highlights that Lester is no longer in an environment that he controls.Another world has very little incidental music, using the intro cinematic to provide an initial sense of tone and pacing before giving way to sound effects. The first several scenes offer a full soundscape, with forlorn wind whistling through a rocky canyon, punctuated by seismic rumbles. All of the game's sound effects feel raw and visceral, adding to the game's air of danger and urgency. As the game progresses, ambient audio becomes more sparse, relying mostly on footfalls and laser fire to fill in the space. As a result of publisher pressure from Interplay[1], the SNES port (and derivatives) feature additional in-game tension music that deviates significantly from the style established in the cinematics. In addition to being out of place, I feel that this also detracts from some of the game's sense of loneliness and isolation.In contrast to many other games of the era (Civilization, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, Lemmings, Street Fighter II and Sonic The Hedgehog, for example) Another World has a comparatively understated 16 colour palette with recurring dominant blue hues that help support its atmosphere of isolation and loneliness. Its muted tones depict an not only an unforgiving and unmoving world (in which Lester with his red hair stands out), but also one that can be eerily beautiful.The game capitalises on its low-fi presentation, using implied detail over actual detail in a way that allows the player to project and interpret things rather than have them explicitly defined. It's difficult to know how much of this is a happy coincidence due to technical limitation of the time and how much was intentional minimalism, though there are a number of moments where the game gives the player fleeting glimpses of something separated from normal gameplay (using the short city view or black monster cutscenes as an example), enough to only give a sense or impression of what's shown.Lester is presented for the most part as a ""silent protagonist"", leaving his character open to player interpretation and projection. Beyond highlighting how out of place he is, the only definition the game gives Lester is when he is shown briefly emoting during his first encounter with members of the alien race (who presumably are indigenous to this planet, leaving Lester the real alien).There's a degree of history and heritage to the indigenous people depicted within the game, who at once display aspects of technical advancement alongside cultural barbarity, with energy weapons and teleportation providing a stark counterpoint to the apparent slavery and bloodsports.All three lines of dialogue are delivered in an alien language, two delivered by aggressive guards and one by the companion encountered by the player early in the game. This companion is shown to be amicable, caring and resourceful, and is undoubtedly the most developed character in Another World.There's a degree of implied co-dependence that Lester and his companion share, and though Lester does not show direct response in game, the manual included with Another World contains a page from Lester's journal expressing concern.I'm yet to see someone play through the game without feeling a sense of connection to this character, empathy which I believe speaks to the success of Lester's ""silent protagonist"" role.The pacing of Another World's gameplay is structured so as to heighten the impact of the game's tension centrepieces. The placement of encounters, obstacles and save points gives the sense that flow and pacing were heavily in mind as the game evolved.As mentioned earlier, the game relies on players using trial and error (often resulting in death) to explore possibility space and discover solutions. For example, most players' first death will occur whilst they are absorbing the shock of Lester's transition from an air filled lab to beneath the surface of a murky pool. Invariably, all first time players I have observed are quickly pulled down into the depths by a mass of tentacles reaching from below. This first death introduces the notion that this new world (and the game itself) is not a friendly one, and that Lester's immediate task is to survive.In modern context, this death oriented learning would be considered a negative aspect. At the time of release, the popularity of titles like Dragon's Lair and Sierra's line of adventure games, which heavily featured player death, made this much more accessible. To help make death feel less negative, many of these games employed special death animations or cutscenes as a reward. In particular the death messages/puns and animations in Sierra adventure are highly celebrated. Deaths with cutscenes in Another World are short and in line with the survival horror aesthetic, showing a glimpse of tightly framed jaws or claws in a way that implies the violent outcome without directly depicting it. Several types of deaths don't feature cutscenes and tend to be more graphic and bloody, though the zoomed out perspective gives them lesser impact.Unlike Dragon's Lair however, each death in Another World (with the exception of combat encounters and platforming obstacles) provides a learning opportunity, and as such, technically isn't an end-state. This perspective feels to be an important aspect of finding Another World enjoyable and rewarding.Two years before Another World's release, Jordan Mechner's Prince of Persia solidified what would be known as the ""cinematic platformer"", a style of platformer known for relatively realistic movement and more maturely constructed storytelling...Continued onCheesetalks"

This is an enduring piece of computer game history that remains as beautiful, stark, striking and unique today as it was when it burst onto the scene in 1991. This is a landmark computer game.So what, you say? So was Doom, and very few of us are still playing it today. So was DONKEY.BAS, the famous early IBM game with the racecar switching lanes to avoid burros in the road. So was the Crowther and Woods Adventure. The history of computer games is littered with significant milestones, making for a very cluttered highway to the past. Right. I understand. But when you find one that's still fresh and avant-garde exactly as it is, today? You could drop Another World into the indie game market anew, and it'd still turn heads and inspire conversations. The adjective ""timeless"" is overused, but this game is truly timeless.It's an action adventure game. There are no instructions. You're meant to jump in, blind, and interact with the world around you as a mystery. There's no inventory, and precious few 'save points.' You used to be a scientist working with a particle accelerator, driving a Ferrari, then...well, something happened, and you ended up Somewhere Else. Somewhere bleak, hostile, cold and inhospitable to its denizens, let alone to an outsider. What does it all mean? You will never be told. You'll never receive an explanation, never encounter a single creature who speaks or understands your language. You will interact with many objects, and figure out what they are and how they work on your own. Good luck! You'll need it.This is Eric Chahi. This, right here, is what this man does so very, very well. The immersive simple-controls action adventure game, set in a bleakly alien other world. Chahi is Bill Watterson's noir doppelganger -- the stylized clifftops and mesas of Spaceman Spiff cartoons become bleak obelisks in a desolate and hostile natural wasteland. His ecosystems are shadowy and predatory, but tantalizing. Exploration into a very nasty and hostile Mother Nature's parlor has never been so deliciously tempting.When we played the original Broderbund Karateka, Mechner's freshman masterpiece, there was always a bit of dread wonder as to what would come down the pike, what would be waiting to meet us and attack us. He was the inventor, as far as I know, of the video game cutscene, and Karateka was one of the first games to introduce us to enemies ""down the way,"" seen before they were encountered directly. But while Mechner foreshadowed, Chahi *teased*. His natural ""other world"" was silent, grinning, waiting for you to get stuck in its deadly web, and it offered you few if any clues as to how to survive it.If you made it to the second scene of Another World, you felt quite accomplished.There are few rest points to breathe. The action is breakneck and maddening. You will feel the protagonist Lester's heart pound and his lungs ache from exertion. You will savor the first quiet moment and rest, because you'll need it! This game is short not only because it's an older game, but because the player couldn't endure hours and hours of it on end. If trial and error in realtime isn't your thing, if repeating the same scenes over and over to get them just right frustrates you, if you want the game to work with you as opposed to standing over you silently and smirking...this may not be your action-adventure game. If you want the game to end with all questions answered and all mysteries put to rest, this is definitely not your game. What you learn about this amazing and very thoroughly developed alien world, you will have to infer from your breakneck trip through it, unguided. You will be left with many, many questions.The game ""Limbo"" could never have happened without Chahi's work in its cultural DNA.It really doesn't matter if this game is ""for you"" or not -- it's a legend, and a work of art that every gamer ought to engage, at least once in his or her life. Love or hate the White Album, you have to have listened to it to call yourself a fan of rock music. This is the Mona Lisa of action-survival games of the 16-bit Renaissance, and the fact that it stands as a great game twenty years later, with only minor updates to address the huge resolution jump in modern displays, is telling. Check this out. Even if it's not your thing, it's a game you should know about, and that everyone should own."

Its hard to belive that was 23 years ago, and the game is still great. The graphics, animation and ambiance was ahead of its time back then, if your an old fart like me wanting to recapture your youth,  or just interested in the classics then I highly recomend this if you have never played it."
,Recommended,233550,17796247,"Posted: 30 August, 2015",all,Mr Torgue High-Five Flexington,"One of the first games I ever played in ye olde times of Amiga and unsliced bread, Another World is one of the giants of that era, standing tall over other games at that time for its art style and cinematics - both in real-time and in cutscenes.The basic premise of the story (if you aren't aware of it) is scientist Lester Knight Chaykin (weird name huh) went to work, experimenting at what appears to be a cyclotron facility. A lightning storm interferes with the particle accelerator, there is an explosion, and Lester finds himself and his desk on another planet.This Anniversary Edition is good in that it retains the art style of the original game. The graphics are a bit chunky, but pleasing to the eye - if you can put up with Minecraft graphics then this is even better. I have it on Windows 7 and have experienced no issues, which is miles better than trying to play it on an old, glitchy Amiga, where you're trying to figure out which Kickstart disk will actually get it to boot.For its time, Another World pushed the boundaries. Even though there is very little music, what there is has been done well, helping to immerse gamers with passable sound effects and beautiful scenery.So bam, you're in this new, strange world. Thankfully the controls are easy enough to work out. Direction controls, jumping, sprint, and attacking. It's a world full of dangers, and there are various ways to die, but I wouldn't say it's hard.It can be made trivial these days with the ease of access to guides and walkthroughs through the internet, but Another World's interface was very much a 'work-it-out-for-yourself' at original release. There is no HUD of any sort, except a breath meter when you're underwater. There are no clues as to where to go next, or how to do it. Even the aliens speak another language, as you would expect.It can sometimes take a bit to get used to the controls - the laser pistol itself is complex enough. Rapidly tapping fire will shoot numerous lasers, holding it down briefly and then releasing will form a brief energy shield in front of the tip of the gun, and holding the trigger for a while before releasing fires an epic laser bolt. Naturally the enemies you encounter have the same options available to them, thus combat can get tricky fast if you don't know what you are doing. Enemies also have plasma grenades that can roll straight past shields - while I've heard Lester gains access to them later in the game I've never used it.The gameplay is broken up into several types, not just combat though. There is escaping from jail, rolling through air ducts, messing around with the weapon controls inside a tank, running away from a tidal wave, kicking aliens between the legs ... it has stood the test of time admirably, and is truly fun in every sense of the word.If you've never played such a classic, old game, then here's a place to test your tastes. Whether you like it or not, you will walk away enriched by your experience."

I remember playing this on the super nintendo when i was a kid, it was one of my top games because it was different, stylish and cinematic.I will always have a special place in my heart, and this version works like a charm and has a one button press on the spot switch with the 'remastered' version.No technical issue insured i could have a nice nostalgia trip, witch i am glad i took.I recommend this to the nostalgiqs."

,Not Recommended,233550,8292788,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,Chef Excellence,"I played this game back in my Amiga days when it was top-shelf material, and it was one of my fondest gaming memories. Unfortunately, I think nostalgia's gotten the better of me this time; Another World has aged extremely poorly.The visual design is still glorious for all its dated minimalism, and the simple narrative still compelling, but the gameplay goes so far beyond mere clunkiness that experiencing it again only served to remind me that Another World actually wasn't very much fun to play back then either.Here's how it works:1. Explore an area.2. Be killed outright by something without warning.3. Watch a death animation.4. Restart just before the bit that killed you.5. Execute whatever actions needed to progress with zero room for error, hoping you get it right this time.Repeat until annoyed.Not a big deal the first few times it happens, but after a while you realize that you're spending more time waiting for the game to let you back to it than playing it. Trial-and-error puzzle platformers still exist today but they tend to make up for their shortcomings by keeping things as frantic and fast-moving as possible, where the pacing here could best be described as glacial. But it's pretty."

,Recommended,233550,12388766,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Twerty,"Another World has been remembered for over two decades now because of the uniquely cohesive experience and sleek vectorized visuals it offers, from a time where graphics and storytelling were often terse and stilted.While this game is short, not much longer than two hours, those two hours have been solely designed by French artist Eric Chahi, and intimate attention has been paid to the detailed backgrounds, foregrounds and animations. Pacing and level design have been carefully decided to fit the overall theme.This comes from an era where all this fit on two floppy disks -- this entire game had to fit in just under 3MB. So while music and sound may seem sparse, and some areas seem underpopulated or underdetailed, just realize this entire game was the same size as a modern-day high-resolution background image.As a result of being designed around these limitations, what the game does have and does do, it does very well. Another World is a game that manages to have both atmosphere and style, in a tightly-knit package.As for the actual gameplay, it is enjoyable -- combat is intense and quick, leading to frequent deaths but the kind of feeling that will keep you on your toes. Puzzles are sometimes unusual, I think more an indication of the era the game came from -- puzzle logic even in most story-driven games for the time (point-and-click adventure games) were often unforgiving and exacting. So while this game has some odd puzzles, its quick respawns and common checkpoints often allow you to figure out the way through quickly without too much frustration from quick successive deaths.Overall, a surprisingly unique and strong narrative for the time, relying on virtually no written or spoken word. As for it's price point: 10 dollars is not unfair to ask, and those who have played this before might be willing to drop that much for the nostalgia factor. For most other people, 10 dollars can certainly get you a lot more than two hours of gameplay. But, as a milestone in video game history, and as an experience that still stands on its own merits, it's still worth giving it your time -- it doesn't ask for much.P.S. Another World will likely be going on seasonal sale at 2.50USD from its current 10USD price point, as it has during the Summer 2014 Steam Sale. If you're on the fence, I'd strongly recommend picking it up during the next wave of seasonal sales."

As a narrative experience is a complete masterpiece, an art piece in bits, with an exquisite design, setting, action and scenes. As a game its major flaws is the lack of response in the control, understandable by the time, but not in this re-edition, that can become a very frustrating experience, and more than once would make you want to throw the whole PC through the windows. The comic like level design also force you to do exactly as the developers thought in order to complete an scene, so basically no level of freedom here. Even if you die 10,000 times like me, it won’t last for more than 3 hours, so you should definitely give it a try."

First, you get the original creator of the game to work on it, none other. He still has the original files of the game programmed on the Amiga, so what he does is this: he loads an amiga emulator in the present to open the original files and edit them...yeah....Then you try to upgrade the game in every possible way...without changing the game (!!!) Meaning, this is still the original game, the same gameplay and sequences of the original. The graphics are still made the same way of the original (commodore amiga polygons) but taking advantage of modern hardware, putting unlimited color, 1080p resolution, upgrading the sound effects and music to digital where you can, replaying the music in high quality, and just leaving the few voices in game just as they were. Adding tiny details in the backgrounds screens whenever possible without changin the original... and on top of that, you just add the option to push a button in game to look instantly the original non remastered version to see how it all changed (and not changed at the same time) in all levels.This is how you make a remake (remaster) of a game. I still won't pay full price for a 20 years old game... but with a little discount it's a total steal.I say this because ive played the original another world in it's sega megadrive inception, in 1993, so if i buy a 20+ years game, that i loved, it's because i want to have that same game, no other modern sh...but at the same time i want to have maybe (if possible) some perks, some upgrades, that bring the original to modern age gaming (besides being compatible with current computers).This 20th anniversary edition does all that. Totally recommended if you played the original. If you didn't ,also recommended , as a trip to the origins of adventure gaming, and as a different experience."

I literally just spent 20 minutes replaying a puzzle over and over and over again which I had already solved but died after solving.The game world is not sidescrolling, it is split up into scenes, and I would find that while walking into a new scene there would be a trap laid right at the edge where I enter, grotesquely goring me without giving me a chance to react.

You only have one gun, which has three abilities: single shot, barrier shot and barrier destroying shot. It doesn't seem like much, but it's everything you need. The game is carefully crafted, from the precise jumps, to how your shields are projected just close enough to you so you can shoot around them.I could carry on listing things this game does brilliantly, but you just don't understand it until you feel it for yourself. I'm gobsmacked that this game was made by one dude. It's just brilliant. Never once did I feel like it was the game's fault for me dying.

But all the little pieces of interactivity on are there for some reason.- I think this anniversary edition feels great. You can change with the press of one button the visuals from the original version to the remastered backgrounds and polygonal characters.- Also you can choose a from a remastered audio or the original with or without music (the creator, Eric Chahi, said he prefers his game without music).- Modern controllers works nice (I recommend DualShock 3 or 4 digital directions for a better experience).- It has bonus content (Artwork, Making of and PDF's with scanned development notes).- Hard difficulty is harder than the original.Cons:- It has some new checkpoints for newbies and sometimes they mess with your game state. So you have to kill some enemies again (and I don't mean the ones re-spawn because you need to complete a mandatory task).- We WANT ""Heart of Darkness"" please!! :)I plenty recommend this game for nostalgic people and those who can handle old games like Prince of Persia for instance.

For younger gamers it might be not clear why, because in comparison to modern titles AW is of course ascetic and visually poor, but at the time of it's release in early 90's it was a little revolution in platform type of games, further continued by Flashback and many others, mostly because of animation and movement of a character, but also due to diversity of adventure and puzzles - every level is something different, you're not doing boring stuff here.As regards remastered version, the most important thing is that, unlike new version of Flashback (which is a bit dissapointment by the way), it doesn't change the game design and mechanics except adding optional higher resolution (you can switch it during play by pressing ""p"" key) and levels of difficulty.Before i started to play, after more than 20 years, i had thought that it was going to be just a little nostalgic return to Amiga times, but this game ""still got it"" and it took me for a couple of hours again - i just had to finish it once more and i hope i'll be able to do this again at it's 50th anniversary ;)"

This was coming from an era when the most graphically impressive game by comparison was the original DOOM. It was in a class all on its own. It paved the way for the more cinematic games of today.All that said, this Out Of This World/Another World does not stand the test of time, at least as a 'game'. I would only recommend this game to people with an appreciation for gaming history or anyone with a nostalgic connection. Even then, not at full price (wait for a sale).The game is fairly short, it plays on the clunky side, and there is a dependence on trail-and-error for progression. I bought this knowing its flaws and I do not regret it. I never owned the full version back in 1992 (just the shareware) and I intend to finish it.In the 20th Anniversary edition there are enhanced/remastered visuals and sound.

You may wonder looking at it so many years later what made it special, it's tough to explain as there are lots of things about it I really appreciate. The buddy that helps you along your jounrney (literally named Buddy) is a perfect example of a sidekick, someone that is not constantly offering you hints or interupting the game but rather a small motivator that helps you out of sticky situations, the artstyle is great and even today passes, clever level design and puzzle solving and finally genuine difficulty!

I say slightly because even though they smoothed out the blocky graphics and animations, it still holds a dear place in my heart as they kept the original art style for the time that the technology would allow. Playing this game brought back a lot of memories as I remember playing this on my brother's Sega Genesis 20 years ago! And, most annoying of all, I never beat the game back then! Time restrictions due to tv-limits and homework, coupled with the fact that there was no save option, made the game nearly impossible for a kid like me to beat. So, proudly, I am now able to say I beat the game!Sure, it doesn't have the snazzy graphics, enthralling plot (there's no real talking throughout the whole game), or variation on gameplay that many of today's games offer, but it was a great game for its time and I can remember that thanks to this anniversary edition. What the game does very well, is pull the player into 'another world' through an immediate introduction of a science experiment gone wrong that transports the player. The characer has no personality, but the goal of trying to guide this lost soul through a strange world is enthralling enough to pull a player in, and forgive the game's lack of contemporary graphics. Infinite respawns upon death, back to the last checkpoint, make the game fun to play and explore, although the game is short. A skilled player could probably beat the game in under two hours upon their first attempt. Quickly executed button pushing requires a certain amount of skill, and some of the puzzles are fun to figure out. A few of the puzzles will most likely require help from this new-fangled contraption called the interwebs...probably a fad :PI would recommend this game to anyone who wants to see what a great game from 20 years ago (that can still hold its own) is like!Ratings out of 10: 1 = low, 10 = high.Graphics: 4 (a 9 if this were remade today)Sound: 8 (sound makes up a huge amount of the game's atmosphere, especially since there's no talking)Story: 8 (I may be a bit biased, but I can see this as a great sci-fi novel)Gameplay: 9 (Experimenting your way through a foreign world was a puzzle in itself)Execution: 10 (Gotta give credit to the game for being such a well-done game for its time. Didn't really see much in the way of glitches or problems.

There's lots of trial and error, consisting of repeated deaths until you figure out what the hell it is you're supposed to do. In fact, this trial and error accounts for most of the game's length. A player who's done it before can finish the entire story from beginning to end in less than 15 minutes.That said, I found the story and environment engaging enough to merit pressing along (and looking up the occasional hint) until the end.

So you regularly have to double check if you already did something.The story is pretty cool and the way the game tells the story is quite unique, especially if you take into consideration the fact that this was released 20 years ago.While playing you're able to switch between the new and upgraded graphics, or the original graphics.

If you haven't yet had the pleasure of experiencing this title in the past two decades, then you owe it to yourself as a gamer to do so as soon as possible.Using vector graphics to produce in-game cinematics that tell a minimalistic story of a scientist who is transported to, you guessed it, Another World, you are forced to try and survive in this harsh and unforgiving environment. While the title was brutally challenging, it provided one of the first truely interactive cinematic experiences. You can feel this game's legacy in franchises like Uncharted and Heavy Rain.The 20th Anniversary release of this masterpiece brings it to a new generation of gamers with the added features we take for granted, such as checkpoints and achievments, while keeping it the same game we know and love. You can play the game in the original resolution, or play with upgraded graphics. The new graphics don't hurt the original either, as they keep to the same art style we remember. The checkpoints are useful in that we don't have to finish the game in one sitting like we used to, (though alot of us know this game well enough that it wouldn't take very long). The achievments are great for pointing out things you might not have known about the game, and this version also comes with a host of bonus items, like the ROM of the Amiga version, a behind the scenes video, artwork, and soundtrack.I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this game. It's well worth the money, even if you've purchased one or more of the dozens of ports that have released in the past, thanks to a plethora of new features and bonus content. Playing Another World yet again brought memories of a simpler time flooding back, and I never grow tired of exploring this alien planet.

But they suck. So let's talk about my opinion.I enjoyed it. I wouldn't consider it as great as some other people made it out to be, but I think it was a unique video game experience that I'll definitely play again in the future.Another World follows a professor working on some experiments late at night, when a thunderstorm breaks out, and you're stranded in another dimention... another world, as the title implies. You first attempt to survive, but then you're captured by the ruling government in the area, and you make your new friend... Mike Aruba. Game Grumps fans know what I'm talking about.The game is relatively simple. You can run, jump, stomp, and shoot and the challenges stick primarily to those abilities, save for some exceptions here and there. But I enjoy Another World for it's difficulty being enough of a ramp that you can still grasp what you have to do.But there are points where Another World is just being f***ing unfair.There are certain portions where you have to have enough foresight from dying earlier, that you know what to do. Sometimes you don't even need that. You need so much foresight, that in the context of Another World's story, it seems a little odd that the professor knows that he needs to open up a tunnel for water to flow, hit a cave wall to fill up the cave water (even though that clearly is only visible to the player), and that he needs to pull a gun on one guard, and then let one guard throw four grenades before killing him. It doesn't make me hate the game, but these odd choices for solving puzzles did take me out of the experience here and there.Really these are my complaints, because the experience of Another World is actually... pretty damned enjoyable. You feel contained, alone, and nervous until you meet your alien friend who helps you in many dire situations, and you silently bond with him and you help him through situations, and he does the same for you. It's a truly video game story mechanic that I love seeing played out.The art style is also pretty great. I like the 20th anniversary blocky textures (having seen the very pixelated graphics of 1991), and the hand-drawn backgrounds that go with them, though sometimes they don't always match up (Like when the professor walks through the uneven terrain of the cave like it's a normal floor). The lighting and color palette are also varied enough that you don't feel like you're going through the same place the whole time. It feels like you're making progress, like you're moving ahead and acheiving something.Another World is, what I'd consider, a video game must for people who want to play ""classic retro"" games that actually don't bog themselves down with samey Mario-esque conventions, and want to immerse you in a story. I'm actually surprised I didn't find Another World under the ""video games as art"" page on Wikipedea. I think it deserves to be on that list. Good on Eric Chahi for making this game pretty much by himself.Another World is a good game. I like the simple storytelling, the platforming, and the relationship between you and the big alien friend. I wasn't a massive fan of the puzzles here and there, and a few achievements were too easy to get (I snatched all the achievements in my 2 hours playtime. Seriously). I'm giving Another World a recommendation, along with a solid score of 8/10."

In that way, this game has a lot in common with Sierra ""quest"" games, which can all be beaten in a very short amount of time if you know exactly where to go, but each minute of progress takes 5-15 minutes of trial and error gameplay to get through.The design and storytelling were completely groundbreaking when it was released in the 90s, and are still fantastic to this day, although the sound design doesn't really hold up as well as all of the other elements.Great as a lesson in game design, but $10 for what is 15 minutes of gameply stretched out to 1.5-2 hours of trial-and-error is way too expensive nowadays. (still better than the $120 adjusted for inflation it would have cost 20 years ago!)"

His only ally in this foreign place is a fellow alien prisoner. Through trials and tribulations they come to understand one another and they help each other progress in their escapes so that they may both find a path home.This is a classic that I originally had on 2 (TWO) floppy diskettes and it is still as unforgiving, but fair, now as it was then. Like ""Space Ace"" and ""Dragon's Lair"" memorization plays a key role in progressing successfully through the levels but fortunately the game won't be eating your quarters, just your avatar.The game oozes with ambiance and danger with every step taken (literally in certain levels) and is a master piece of design in every way. The visual upgrades in the Anniversary Edition are a joy to behold and do not detract from the original gameplay in anyway. If you want to play one title out of retro gaming lore that did not originate on a cartridge first, Another World is a title you should consider for a play through."

Still, it stayed in my mind for quite some time.After finally playing the 20th edition I must say it should be required gaming by anyone at least once. It's completely worth it and  it was so ahead of it's time it's not even funny. The atmosphere needs to be experienced to be believed. The art, the animations and the HD graphics all mesh together into a picture that speaks louder than words. It also has a killer soundtrack and sound effects that complements it, and a basic, yet addictive and satisfying gun mechanic. The only bad part is that it's too quiet throughout the game because there's barely any music.I would still wait for a sale though. After your first playthrough you will play it again but you will finish it around 30 mins. It's too damn short. Simply there's no incentive to go back to it. Everything is exactly the same and you will feel that all you're doing is repeating the same actions. Even in hard mode is still mostly the same with only a few extra surprises. I really wish the game was deeper and longer, with added music for the stages like the console versions and it would've been perfect."

I am not talking about the visuals (good artistry is always stronger than good graphics, and Another World looks quite nice in its simplicity, with or without modern glossing-over). I am talking about the game itself.Probably back then it was a breakthrough, a cornerstone of a genre that didn't exist before it. But now you can't help but see that game industry went a long way since then. Controls are clunky, unresponsive and just weird. Fighting is erratic and is mostly ruled by chance. Correct decisions can hardly ever be deduced - the game presupposes you to try over and over again with little to no though behind your attempts, until you stumble upon a right decision. It is difficult, yes, but its difficult is not challenging (which is pleasant); it is baffling, incomprehensible and annoying.So, if you have fond memories of Another World and Flashback… better leave them be.

The gameplay was at times frustrating the learning curve is about 1/2 hr; but I enjoyed this 2D platformer. All achievements are attainable some can be missed but you can always go back. If you fail at a certain pont of the game at least you can pick up the gameplay from that point going forward. I was thoroughly satisfied with this game and reccommend!! This game gives me a sense of nastolgia.8/10.

That's if you know what you have to do though, if you don't then this game will take anywhere from 10-20 hours, and while it will be hard and frustrating, it's so satisfying when you figure out one of Another World's many puzzles.Another World is a lot like the original Prince of Persia where you have a reallisticly animated character and you just control him to navigate through a sort of maze like world. Where Another World shines though is its atmosphere, you're on an alien planet and pretty much anything can happen, you're taken to caves, prisons, alien colosseums that all look breathtaking with the enhanced visuals in this version.The game is very obtuse and has mechanics like the gun you use that are hard to understand at first but they're very intentional and make sense, you're on an alien planet and the character would have no idea how these things work, so why should you?If you can look past those things, you're gonna have an amazing experience all the way to the credits."

The gameplay can only be described as ""if you don't do this one thing, you're not playing correctly"", however I personally don't mind this. I love games that are challenging. Whenever you find out how to progress throughout the game, the overall feeling of success that you get makes this game feel worthwhile. It's very short and sweet, and I feel that it deserves more love than it gets.The improved graphics of the anniversary edition makes the game feel more stylized, however it does come with the graphics of the original SNES port.I wouldn't say it's anything extremely ground-breaking, but it's a fun little adventure with incredibly complex gameplay that feels very satisfying."

Now this doesn't mean I don't find it good or dislike it completely, but has its charm. I will explain some of the good things I like in this game and in the end, why I put a dislike checkmark.Synopsis: The game was made by a french guy name Eric Chahi and was made for the Amiga which was a really old computer back in the days, so you can imagen this game is also old.  The game was praised by the interesting cutscenes and plateform interaction. You play as Lester (the unlikely) a ginger guy who had a lab accident and sent to an another world (insert family guy reference) You meet up with a humanoid looking Sangheili (if sangheili and human had a baby) named Buddy.I don't know if Lester called him buddy since they don't speak the same language but I always thought it was Mysaruba since that's the first thing he spoke to you, then again maybe he was saying thank you. The plot is really simple, excape from planet...Tatooine from mine slavers (I think) and that's about as much plot as you can say, it was a simple interaction plateform game.Good: Is a cinematic plateform and I can see why it was pretty interesting about the cutscenes and the atmosphere the guy put into the game, The graphics is good in fact it looks more like ""alone in the dark"" graphics, for the time and the backgrounds were ok, but only better if is HD. The music is good atleast the very few of them and the controls are responsive.The game has no hints so holding your hand is a no, but I like it because you're a human and in times you have to make real quick decision to escape and using your mind to see if the object will do something, so is a good brain exercise. Also since you're only human you die once but that's ok because the game doesn't start over it just reset to where you're checkpoint land so which means you have unlimited lives and plenty of checkpoints.Bad: The game IS hard, NOT by gameplay, no is very easy to navigate and such, hard by being confusing at times which I'm talking about the puzzles themself. The game really doesn't hand holding here so you're on your own. Is good at times when you want to accomplish something on your own but in times you just don't know what to do.I know Eric did this because the game is really short if you completed with breeze, you could completed in an hour or twenty-five minutes! The average for those who doesn't know how to beat the game it would probably be a few hours or even days which again I could agreed the difficulty but then there's just some unfair stuff. Like I mean there are some areas you have to complete or do in order to progress it and you tried to think hard and press anything but you just couldn't so you look up in the guide or if you're a 90s kid talk to a friend and see if someone have the answer.Then you know the anwer and say to yourself how the hell should I know that this rock would rigger this or that stupid lamp will fall at the soldier's head!?! Yes, this game is more of trial and error but the puzzles that throw at you just made me want to say, is this right what I'm seeing?Yes, again I don't have a problem with thinking on my own but for those of us who wants to move forward to a new area and doesn't want to look at the same frame over and over again, with countless deaths on enemies or stuck by a dead end it grows boring fast. Especially when there is not much plot in the game and the two characters are one-sided, there is not a lot of immertion to the world! Like really do we know any of this Lester guy? I don't know his name after I looked in the Wiki, do we also know a reason why he build a portal? Who are the aliens, why did they want to enslave their own kind, how far are we, what planet are we from! These are things that left unanswer, and don't give me excuse that there are no dialogue or no characters to interact, is a cinematic game! just add a few cutcenes showing some plot detail or some area backgrounds that explain the plans of the aliens or the very least a journal that Lester could carry him along to read?There is little plot or immertion to feel about Lester's situation or the new world as much as Half-Life 1 can tell-and that game explains better than Another World in terms of show don't tell. Now I'm not going to complain about that issue all day, oh no that's not the full reason why I returned it that's just a big slice of it.Going back a bit on the difficult I would say for those who wants to move on a bit faster, should add a highlight system to highlight objects, now there is the difficult setting but I don't really find a difference to the settings? I don't see a two hit settings to not go back again to the checkpoint or less enemies, none? Unless I'm missing something than I apoligies. One last thing and this is a small nitpick is that they don't include like a laser bar to track how much ammo you still got or when you're swimming you don't know how much air bubble you have so you have to guess.Now all of that should include the 20th anniversary of the game and frankly I find it lackluster of the ""special edition"" No commentary of the original creator? No concept arts and most importantly no Heart of the Alien which is a sequel to Another World, why? I know Eric made the game but didn't want to include the credits and I heard the game wasn't really good but still, the ending of the Another World is a cliffhanger so it should include the sequel in the package, the game is becoming rare since it was a Sega CD game.Honestly when I saw a LP of this and I thought the sequel looks a bit better than Another World in terms of more cutscenes and details to the world. Buddy as the main protagonist and the ending for me was a bit surprise for me and I like it, though maybe that's why it wasn't popular for the ending I guess.At the end a graphics update and a remaster music isn't worth 10$ is not even $2.47 worth because it didn't show it was worth the price if they include both the games. for those who want it for nostalgia then sure why not. but for those who are curious and still wants to try it wait for a price drop. This game gets a 2.5/5 star ratings, It's more of a mix feeling toward the game and I wish I could put a mix check mark but I think a down check is a bit worth it in my gaming experience. Maybe I don't really see it but I've played a lot of old-school gaming but this just have to pass off by the lack of contents and unfair frustrating difficulty."

The game plays with a lot of trial and error, some confusing segments, as well as poor jumping controls. This makes the experience poor and the game's events are not too notable. This is the heart of things, though there are some novel positives. The weapon uses only a single button to produce a shot, shield, and charged shot via how long it is pressed. The few cutscene animations are smooth and beautiful; you'll likely treasure them and not want to blink. The majority of backgrounds are gentle on the eyes with nice colors."

The 20th anniversary special stays true to it's original form, though updating graphics and sound for a slightly more crisp feel. While it satisfies some gamer's needs to return to the roots of their childhood, it would simply fail to impress the standards of most in today's hi - tech gaming market.The controls are awful with a capital A. Seriously 'deadlight' has better controls. It constantly feels like your controlling a character who is wearing some type of invisible tin man costume and whose jumping ability is seriously limited thanks to a prostrate operation.Game play is similar to other classics like Dragon's Lair, but make no mistake this is definitely not Dragons lair. The difference? Dragon's lair would often give you visual clues on where you need to jump to, point your character to etc. This game is so obscure and obtuse you'll spend most of your time watching cut scenes of your character being thrown into the fatal end of a worst case scenario.Game play is short 18 mins to complete game, but with the difficulty of the game including watching walk through's as your Yoda master, you will probably get 2 hrs out of the game at max. There are three settings, 'easy' which is hard and walk through needed, 'medium' which is  harder and will have you raging till you blow blood vessels and 'hard' which is really Impossible without Valium constantly pumped into you through a iv tube.The whole 18 minute story is completely told through cartoon animation about your character Professor Lester who is able to play around with space time thanks to a particle accelerator experiment and get transported to an alien planet where everything is his foe. Seriously! Literally everything from rocks, worms, water, everything wants to kill him. The only saving grace is a lovable alien your locked up with and who you bond with simply because your able to rock a cage and release him and then listen to all his grunting noises.Professor Lester takes on this Alien world like his John Mc Clane with a Star Trek Pistol being helped by every cliche under the sun until closing credits where he wonders off into the sunset and lives happily ever after.This 1990 remake gets a thumbs up for those like myself who reminisce over the yesteryear's of playing it, but when I place myself into a gamer's shoes playing this game for the first time, I cannot help but give it a thumbs down especially in comparison to normal price of $10.00. It's not worth that much. If you really would like to experience this part of gaming history for yourself, definitely wait for a sale..."

I feel, however, that after 1.8 hours I've seen as much as I need to of the janky controls, horrible combat, and all around mediocrity of this fossil.Don't get me wrong, I respect how original and revolutionary this game was, I really do.  I completely understand why it recieved such a following in 1991.  It's cinematic storytelling style was incredibly interesting at the time.  This having been said, it's not aged well.  The story (at least the first couple hours) is shallow and not especially gripping.  The controls are awkwardly designed, almost as if they were restricted to only using 2 buttons and the arrow keys to do everything they wanted.  The core mechanics are unintuitive, the combat is as aweful and irritating as it is frequent, and the platforming is highly disinteresting.On top of this, the 20th anniversary edition offers an ""HD"" graphics mode that actually makes the game look worse.  The walk cycle looks weird and broken, the backgrounds look extremely unpolished (sometimes even unfinished), and weird sprite layering issues which aren't visible with the original graphics (because of the limited colour palette) become painfully clear.  I'd heard that this update of the game contributed little of value to the original work, but I wasn't expecting this truly pathetic display.  It looks alright in the screenshots, but believe me when I say that when it's fullscreen and things are moving it looks horrible.  That's probably why there's no video on the store page.TL:DRAn interesting peice of gaming history that is probably better kept in a museum."

The difficulties also come of as daft and silly, the first obsticle is to jump over some very small worms, but the protagonist can only jump about 4cm up, so they are a lethal hazard to him. The problem is compounded by the far-between-save-points. It feels like the designers figured that this was a very short game and they had to complicate things to buff up playtime. This is not a challenging or difficult game. It is an unforgiving and sadistic game.The only thing I really learned here is to never again try my all time favourite ""Flashback"".

,Not Recommended,233550,12945940,"Posted: 14 November, 2014",all,sequence,"I love classic adventure games, 2D platformers, and re-releases. So when I saw the 20th Anniversary Edition of Another World (a.k.a. Out of this World) on sale, I swifty snatched it up. I have fond memories of playing through it on (a) SNES (emulator) as kid. I cannot deny that it's a very charming, ambitious and cinematic game, but I also cannot deny that I found my (incredibly short) time with it insanely frustrating and immensely disappointing.I'll start with what it gets right. This game is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere, settings and sound design are immaculate. Éric Chahi has crafted a brilliant alien world here, oozing with originality and depth. The characters are loveable, the cutscenes are groundbreaking and well exectuted, and the environments are varied, colourful and stunning.  The game is very minimalist, but not in a righteous, narcissistic hipster way, featuring no dialogue or heads-up display. Lester can jump, run and attack. The story is basic, but endearing, and is definitely aided by the cutscenes. You play as Lester, a scientist who screws around with some complex technology and lands himself on a planet, with a hostile alien race (and environment) out to get him. With the help of a rogue alien (lovingly nicknamed Buddy), you must escape. Simple, but effective.  To think that this game came out in 1991 is amazing, and still makes my jaw drop. Another World is definitely ahead of its time.But so, so much holds it back. The game itself is ridiculously hard. I love a challenging game, don't get me wrong. But I like to be punished for my own mistakes, not because I didn't somehow know not to jump down that hole, but that other hole. When you get everything right, it feels totally organic and satisfying. But when you die 5 times before realising that you're not doing what the game wants you to do, it's fricking annoying. Here's a scenario I found particularly irritating. The following is an internal dialogue I had with myself, with many expletives removed:""How am I supposed to know what this lever does before I pull it? Maybe I should press it now! My buddy is being beaten up! Okay, I'll pull the lever. What the hell? A beam of light? Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ the guard is coming for me. Yep, dead. Well okay, obviously I have to kill the guard with the beam of light. Oh fricking hell, now I have to do this whole section again. At least I know what to do. Guard, beating me up, COME ON LESTER CRAWL CRAWL CRAWL JESUS YOU'RE SO GODDAMN SLOW. Okay, lever pulled, guard's down, what should I do now? I'll pull another lever. Oh look, a hole in the ceiling. Alright then. Guess I should crawl back, but how do I get up there? Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm getting shot at! HURRY THE ♥♥♥♥ UP LESTER! ♥♥♥♥ING HELL I'M DEAD AGAIN NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS ENTIRE THING AGAIN GODDAMN #$%*#@#!""One thing that drew me to Another World is that it looked similar to the first two Oddworld games, despite the obvious theme difference and aesthetics. But while the Oddworlds were quite difficult, they were at least fair; you could at least SEE what was going to kill you. In Another World, there is so much trial and error, and when you screw up, you get booted back to the last checkpoint, which in some cases is irritatingly far back.And the length, good God the length is pitiful. I know it says I've played for 2 hours, but I haven't. I probably passed the game in half of that. The other half was dealing with the constant, and I mean constant, crashes. Word of advice: don't play this game with an Xbox Controller. Otherwise you'll have crashes literally every 2 or 3 minutes. Play it with the keyboard, which will at least minimalise (but not remove) these crashes.And for being the 20th Anniversary Edition, there really isn't much here. You have the ability to switch from the original Amiga/SNES graphics to a HD redo in-game, à la Halo Anniversary, which is nice, but it looks so... out of place. You have beautiful backgrounds juxtaposed with blocky South Park-esque characters and it just doesn't flow. It's like having cartoon characters on a live-action background. It looks wrong. Sticking with the classic graphics is the best bet for visual consistency.There's no post-game content either. And a lot of the music is removed from other versions of the game, and in its place is... nothing. What? 20 years? I mean come on, I get that you wanted to use the original soundtrack, that's fine. But in areas where there's no music, why couldn't you just add a couple of songs in from other entries for a more complete experience? In fact, I'd go so far as to say as this is one of the more incomplete versions of the game. The SNES version had more (and far better) music, a more consistent (however slow) framerate, and had more cutscenes, which help establish the backstory. Come on, guys! It's been 20 years! I'm not asking for the world here but when I think of a re-release, I think completeness, not stuff cut out.It does come with some good extras, but these aren't even accessible in-game. There's a making-of documentary, which is actually really interesting and I highly suggest you watch it. There's one picture and a soundtrack (what's left of it), but most interestingly, Amiga ROMs of the original game, which I find incredibly cool. If you want a more coherent, classic experience, then give that a try. But for me, there just wasn't enough here. The achievements are arbitrary, the presentation is lazy, and there's really nothing at all here for fans of the original game (in fact, there's less). I really wanted to like the game, and I still appreciate it for what it did for the adventure genre all those years ago, but I cannot get past its ridiculous difficulty, bugginess, laziness and lastly, the price. This game is definitely not worth $10.2.5/5"

,Not Recommended,233550,33875300,Posted: 29 July,all,Mr. Matt,"Ha, I finally beat this darn game after stewing over not completing it in my youth when it launched as ""Out of This World."" Did I have to use a walkthrough? Unfortunately. One of the puzzles is requires that you either accidentally stumble upon the solution, check a walkthrough, or try something that the rest of the game never, ever has you do (which ends up being the solution).In case anyone's wondering, I'm referring to needing to wait for a certain enemy to roll multiple grenades at you, which will blow up a floor below, and if you kill him, it's impossible to progress unless you get yourself killed and start that seciton over.You might say ""Oh, well rolling grenades is a clue! That's why that ONE guy rolls grenades at you!"" Haha, oh you presume this game would do something so clever! In a better-designed game, you'd be right, and that would be a great clue. Instead, this game doesn't have it benefit you tonotkill enemies until this checkpoint, several minutes prior to the end of the game. The game 100% encourages you to kill enemies as fast as humanly possible prior to this checkpoint, because you will die in one second or less if you don't react quickly to a patrolling enemy.In Portal 2, there was one puzzle in the entire campaign that I had to look up one part of the solution online, and it still makes me ashamed that I had to do it. The game had all the clues there and it was designed well, it was my fault, and I fully acknowledge it. In Another World, however, the game just doesn't convey that puzzle solution, and when I looked it up, I felt no shame; only anger at the game and whomever designed it for putting such a terrible puzzle into the game. It was a jackass move.Am I only put off by the one horrible puzzle, though? Nah. The controls feel weird even though they could have adjusted them to feel good since this is basically a remaster, the reach of certain enemies (ground mouth things) is difficult to estimate when jumping, the game can be finished in 20 minutes or so if you know what you're doing (I like brevity), BUT the developer just made the game control funky and be rather difficult to pad out the playtime and hide the game's short playtime.I finished in 3.7 hours, and that was with me messing around on the Internet with the game minimized at least half of the time, and eating a snack and doing some exercising, and even getting stuck and shouting obscenities at the screen for some of the more frustrating parts.I'm glad I played the game through to completion because it's been haunting me since I was a young'un, but I don't recommend it to the average player. It feels kinda like INSIDE if INSIDE ramped its difficulty up to hide how short it is, and instead of having clever puzzles with clues as to how to solve them, it had some puzzles that are nearly impossible to solve except for stumbling into the solution or reading it somewhere.Just play INSIDE instead. That's some good stuff and it's surprisingly similar to this game. Maybe this partially inspired it? Who knows. I think INSIDE is much, much better, and highly recommend it if you want some of the stuff this game offers (running around avoiding getting murdered, solving puzzles, and trying to escape)."

It also for one, puts you in a perspective of a normal human being with very human vulnerabilities, which makes the game challenging.It's just that a very-well-made platformer for 1991 does not equate to a good platformer today. The controls are just way too clunky for today's standards and I cannot enjoy it at all.I understand this game will have its nostalgic values among the older generations of players, but its values are just that - nostalgia.

If you're looking for a fun, interesting 2D side-scroller, please, for the love of God, look elsewhere.To elaborate (read: pour salt over wound), the gameplay consists of jumping (read: hoping the jump button works), running, setting up shields, knocking down other guards' shields and shooting your laser gun, that sometimes seems to run out of ammunition before requiring a visit to a electric room (read: ammo-refill checkpoint) so that you can progress with this awful waste of space.I wouldn't recommend that you buy Another World - 20th Anniversary Edition.On the technical side of things, there is Steam Cloud support (which is almost unnecessary considering the amount of content in this game) and Steam Achievements support.

The player and the protagonist, Lester, are equally isolated from the game's surroundings - there's no HUD, there's no explanatory text besides the menus and closing credits, and you're left to discover how things work by yourself. Unless you're a savant or playing from a walkthough, you WILL die - many, many times - and you WILL be frustrated when you can't get that water jumping sequence just right - but the payoff when things go -just right-, trust me, is incredible.Another World balances reflex action sequences with methodical environmental puzzles perfectly, backed up by a checkpoint system. The soundtrack is mostly background environmental material, and the utterly beautiful flat-shaded polygon graphics are stunning: if I were to sum the game up in a sentence, I'd say it's strange, it's alien, and it has a compelling narrative that's entirely told through 'showing' and not 'telling'."

When I played this game in the early 90's, I just thought it was neat.  When I played this game again recently, I was still impressed, even when I removed the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.The mechanics are simple, and although there is little direction given, it is not impossible to determine the course of events that need to occur in order to advance.  Sometimes it does require trial-and-error, but the checkpoints (or chapter breaks) were frequent enough to not be too much of a nuisance compared to other games of the era.Of course, the presentation is still out of this world (sorry). The storytelling in this game is probably the best example I could give of what got me hooked into having a video game tell a cinematic story.  The story itself may be basic, but the fact that you could show a story that did not rely heavily on dialogue or narration and have a flow that kept interest in the game throughout almost the entire journey blew my mind as a kid, and I was still impressed when I booted it up months ago.If you haven't already played this game before, I still recommend it.

Perhaps it is even too old to judge... but I will attempt to do so anyway.Yes, I recommend this Amiga/Atari ST game that's been released approximately 23 years ago. But why? The controls are really dodgy and often unresponsive (which is a problem during fast-paced action), there is little feedback and no autosaving if you are going the wrong way and the game is extremely frustrating in general. You start the game off with some basic controls and you have to find out the rest all for yourself.But what kind of game is it? It's Action/Adventure-like, true, but the main idea of this game is to tell the user a story. This is a very intensely narrative-based game. Developer Cachi himself said that and gives you impressions of what his process of creation was like. This is included with the game; concept art and a ""making of"" video.So the game is a narrative-based, cinematic game that tells you an amazing story... and GOD, does it do an amazing job at that. First of all, the lack of information and little feedback causes immersion and suspension of disbelief to arise greatly. It sucks the user right into the story and makes the player immerse into the character of Lester, the game's protagonist. The music, sound effects, storyline and graphics really add up to a wonderful and unforgettable experience. The Amiga vector graphics were unique for the time and create a simple, yet strange and beautiful feeling to the game that I haven't seen anywhere before. I do not want to spoil the story in any way at all, you have to play this yourself. Believe it yourself. Be there yourself, and experience it, but I can say one thing... Another World is a game of high narrative quality and will definitely give every player an unforgettable experience, in whatever way that may be to them."

The waiting and loading times are quicker, making it quite a bit easier to play.  I remember the game as insanely difficult, and having to wait to restart after you die, was torture.

Once you have beaten the game a few times you can complete it in a fairly short amount of time but thanks to the difficulty levels and graphics/ sound options avaliable (you can toggle between the original graphics and sound or the new hd ones) you'll probably want to replay this game quite a few times.

However, I am not recommending it because of technical issues...I use a Mac for work, and videogames are a secondary function on it. I installed this game on the Windows 10 side, and the resolution was messed up when I tried to change it to my native screen size. I tried restarting and using different resolutions, but they were all not fitting correctly. I decided to try it on my the Mac side.I can say that the game ran great, no problems with resolution. However, with my XBOX 360 controller that works consistently for games that use it, Another World would stop recognizing it after 15-or-so minutes of play. I had to switch for a keyboard, and that was not good at all.Normally, I wouldn't care enough about technical issues to not recommend a game, but this deserved it because Another World needs complete immersion. I was taken out of my focus with these issues that inhibited a full one-shot playthrough that feels necessary for such a cinematic platformer.The game itself: brilliant. I remember seeing it as a demo at a department store, and it looked intimidating! There was no way I'd play a game with deaths that looked so lifelike (at the time). Once I realized I could purchase this on Steam, I knew I had to try it out.Well, as you can read below, I launched it and was way too weirded out (see: uncanny valley). However, later that year, I forced myself to play Limbo, that made me feel the same way, but I didn't let myself quit. Now, because of that and Inside, I was prepared for Another World.A combination of it being no longer scary and the awful technical issues really dampened my experience. I wouldn't say my two-and-a-half decade dream was crushed, but it was not as intense as I once imagined. Maybe I was better off not playing this game, but I do think it was good to put that chapter to an end.I highly recommend playing a different version of this game.30 June 2016: I can't play this game right now. I had to quit. The deaths feel way too real. I feel like I'm watching a real human die over and over. Why did I buy this game knowing this would happen?I'm going to make myself finish this game someday, but I'm not looking forward to it."
,Recommended,233550,15247436,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,Dark Blue Monkey,"Another World is one of those games that divides people squarely into ""those who played it and it blew their mind"", and ""Those who didn't and are now looking at it thinking, 'why are all the people who played it raving about it so much?'"".In its day, AW was simply astonishing.  Other games for the PC at the time simply didn't have the stylish graphics which were becoming popular on the consoles.  Most stuff for the PC was either a straight 16-colour sprite-based port of an Atari / Amiga game, a simulation of some kind, or text-based.  There were a few notable exceptions, but nothing which came close to touching the graphics of AW.  Genuinely ""next-gen"" games were released for consoles, and the PC was left for the geeks.Then along came AW.  It brought proper sound, console gameplay and nice-looking graphics to the PC screen.  It played like the sort of game your mates had on their NES.  Not only that, but it made their NES look rubbish to boot!So, it's 2015 now... How has it fared over the years?  Well, to be honest, not bad.  It's still got that stylish quality it always did, and with modern games circling back round to the ""silent protagonist, plot through action, not dialog"", games are looking more like the trend AW (sort of) started.  Also, with the plethora of indie games bringing the graphics back from the DirectX11-fuelled power-hungry pixelfest, to a more garage-made polygonal flat texture-level, AW is looking very cosy in my steam library.The gameplay was always fairly minimal, you can run left and right, shoot, jump (in certain places), kick, and do a rather cool alt-fire-shield-thing.  The controls are even more minimal than that, with just arrows, action, and ""jump"".  Getting used to the controls can take a few screens, as usual...  All that sounds very 'meh'.   Where the game pulls you in, is the story.  Like a lot of ""fish out of water"" plot hooks, the surroundings are familiar-yet-different.   On a tatooine-like planet, with nasty and good aliens, you have to navigate the linear levels, unfolding the storyline.  It sometimes feels more like a stylised Visual Novel with action elements.  Think of Abe's Odysee but with polygons, rather than sprites.The beginning of the game really sets the tone of the game.  The gameplay prompts you to learn three new skills on the first three screens, just to survive... then, just as you're thinking ""Okay, I see where this is going"", the game stops you and then the real story begins.  The addition of Steam Achievements is a nice touch, as they gel nicely with the  flow.   As you progress through the game, each area feels different, gives you different puzzles, and it's seldom that you feel bored.    If there's one gripe, it's the save feature which makes some of the harder puzzles a little repetitive.   Unlike modern games which have floating boxes saying ""Click this button!"" and dumbed-down stuff like that, AW has an (effectively) mute sidekick who you work with in parallel to solve puzzles.  The hint is usually him just pointing at something then running off, leaving you to figure it out.  It's frustrating when you die, then have to re-watch a short (2-4s) cutscene, or re-do a simple task that can take 20 seconds, only to run onto a screen with something hard, and die in 1 or 2 seconds.  Rinse, Repeat 4, 5, 10 times.....   It's quite old-school in that way, and some of the puzzles do make you grind your teeth as you have to re-start for the umpteenth time.  But it's immensely satisfying when you do get it, and find that (unlike Prince of Persia), the next section is completely different.The ending hints towards a sequel, and I know I, and many of my friends were absolutely gutted that one never appeared in the UK.  They apparently made a sort-of-follow-on for the SEGA, but it never appeared on the PC properly.All-in-all, this is a very finely crafted game. The 25th anniversary edition upgrades the graphics, and tweaks the gameplay in minuscule ways, but doesn't affect the charm at all.   My advice is to clear your diary for an evening, shut the door, turn out the lights, grab a can of Cola, and settle in for a jolly good adventure.I ended up buying this game three times.  The original, the anniversary, and then again on Steam, I love it that much.   I've probably completed it four or five times too.     A wonderful, atmospheric, stylish well-paced, well thought through game.  I can heartily recommend it."
