I've deleted all comments to reflect this, but if I'm happy with the review then I'll leave all subsequent ones.Distance is a fast-paced racing game that focuses more on the survival of the racer than beating other people. The campaign is, at the moment, short and odd. It ramps the difficulty up pretty well but cuts off suddenly - however this is being worked on by the developers.The car itself offers high mobility and control, with a boost, jump, and even flight - although there is an overheating function that builds up gradually while flying and boosting. If the car overheats while flying it will stop flying, and if it overheats while boosting it will simply explode and you'll die. It should also be mentioned that the car has thrusters, which allow it to flip, spin and push itself down onto the track.The tracks themselves are either premade by the developers, or are made by the community and are posted on steam workshop, the best of which are featured on the menu screen in-game. The developer-made tracks are almost all used in the Campaign, and are all very high quality.Speaking of quality - Distance has excellently optimised graphics. I can't say anything about the VR in the game as I do not own a Virtual Reality headset of any kind.The soundtrack is fantastic - at least, in my opinion. Then again, music taste is subjective.I would recommend Distance - although the price of £14.99 is a little steep, so in turn unless you're a fan of racing games I would recommend to wait until a sale."

,Recommended,233610,13934872,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Bad Whippet,"What is it?A futuristic racing speed/style game very much in the style of Space Haste and Megarace and other one-time futuristic racing classics, but without opponents and set in a dark, neon vibe.  Atmospherically, this is the best sci-fi racer I've played.  The game offers a single player story campaign, arcade racing mode, multiplayer and a fully fledged Level Editor in which you can build your own tracks.  The Steam Workshop is already integrated, offering an infinite resource of game content far beyond what is already offered in the game itself.  Best of all, you can specify any random phrase or word in the editor - and a track, with scenery and such as in the campaign will be added for you.  While it IS just as easy as typing a word and racing the resultant track, there is some sophistication built in: using certain words in your 'phrase' will add more sprint sections, particular effects, or more flight etc.  It's utterly brilliant and you don't have to be a boffin in order to use it (well, I used it - 'nuff said...).  There is also a full-blown track editor too if you really do want to craft your own by hand.How difficult is the racing?The racing part has absolute precision controls and difficulty in the single-player campaign curves gradually.  There have been past similar titles where you can find yourself bouncing from one wall to the other, but not this one - it's lovely to play.  Jumps and flips are taught by button-prompts on-screen.  Flight sections can be a fair bit tricky however.  Straight flight is easy enough, but the roll mechanics of the vehicle are very strange and I find it very tricky to fly around corners without rolling uncontrollably and spiralling to death.  It takes some skill to play these parts, but practise does pay off and reaching the end of the campaign feels like a genuine achievement. Until then, expect a challenge - especially with gravity being a thing when you're not sure which way up you're facing!  Falling to crash UPWARDS is often the only time I realise I'm completely flipped.  It's crazy and it's silly - but above all it's fun.  Gamepad ninjas will blaze through it, and then roll around the floor laughing at the rest of us with our 50+ attempts to get through that maddening flippy dodgy section without burning up.The game offers full controller support, including racing wheels and gamepads.  However, while the game can be played with a wheel, the best experience is experienced either with keyboard or gamepad for lighting-fast reaction play.A word of warning: if you suffer from any photo-sensitive condition like photo-sensitive epilepsy, this game might not be for you because there is a lot of flashing neon.  Watch the trailer videos first and judge for yourself.About that Early Access thing...The single-player campaign is rather short at the moment and, on its own, is not enough to warrant a typical AAA full game price.  However, there is a ton of content already in the Steam Workshop (some 700 new tracks the last time I looked) and these are seamlessly integrated with the game's 'Arcade' mode, plus the infinite possibilities of randomly seeded tracks, you'll never be bored.  As far as multiplayer goes, it seems really popular but check the game forums (I don't play multiplayer so I can't offer comment on this).  As a single-player product though, Steam reviews are giving an ""overwhelmingly positive"" for a very good reason: it really IS a great game already.  If you enjoy Wipeout-style games and not troubled by a lack of AI racers, then this should definitely be in your collection - it's worthy even as an Early Access title.Highly recommended!"
,Recommended,233610,13380524,"Posted: 15 December, 2014",all,[KR]Silvio Rodriguez,"Distance is one of those few racing games that feel really unique.There is normal racing, wall jumping, no gravity, flying & jumping.These are all ways for you to finish the different tracks (And there are a lot due to a good community), many tracks have more than one way to finish the race, and sometimes one of the options might be better, other times it's the same or just up to your skill.The game offer a few different game modes, spring which is normal racing, go from start to end, you can respawn if you fail and so on. The other is challenge, it's like sprint but shorter and no respawn, so prepare to fail quite a lot. There is also stunt, the least attractive game mode this far, where you are just suppose to do different stunts to gather a high score. There is also a multiplayer only game mod with the name ""Tag"" or something like that.Tag works like the classic child game where one or more are chasing the others trying to ""tag"" them, however here it's the other way around, everyone is chasing the one with the forcefield, and you win when you've held the ""tag"" for three minutes. Quite fun.The car is customizable when it comes to colours, I do hope they add more customization though, since it's always a plus. But for a early access game this game works really well! It never crashes unless you've tabbet it for quite some time.All maps have a high score screen where you are not only competing against your old record, but also against all other players who play this game.

Not that you can tell this is a beta, it has the functionaly of a finished product and is extremely rich with features.One planned feature not yet implemented that I'm most excited about are replays!  The game, as you can probably tell from video and screenshots looks absolutely gorgeous.  To have the ability to watch back (hopefully from external views!) a race in replay mode will be divine!  The engine appears extremely optimised and on my i5/970 runs extremely smooth, not even the smallest sign that any component is breaking a sweat!The current campaign is quite short but also acts as a tutorial or introduction to the various moves at your disposal.  Although it is short it is extremely fun and very atmospheric.  The lighting rythmically flashing in time to  the dark techno pounding out your speakers and the weird static effects hurtling you through the environment really create for a highly enjoyable experience.  They are still adding to the campaign, but it's so fun I've replayed it a few times.You've also got leaderboards, online play, time/score challenges to keep you more than occupied.One problem I had initially was with the controls when attempting to switch surfaces to drive on.  Using the control pad to switch from floor to wall for example meant using the left and then right analoge sticks.  Previously this was my only apprehension about the game.  After perusing the forums a couple of other players recommended to switch the controls to advanced mode.  Now this frightened me a little!!  The game requires enough skill as it is without adding to it!!  Advanced mode meant that I now only have to use the left analoge stick to wall-ride.  So I can steer, jump off the road and then use the left analogue stick again to adjust my angle in the air to meet the wall.  Previously movement in the air would've been with the right stick and it felt extremely unintuitive.  Maybe this information can help someone else too.Full release is planned for later this year.  There's really no reason to wait, the game is an absolute stack of fun and a dream to look at.  Sci-fi racing at its best!!"

The devs are great because they listen & communicate to the community and add suggested features to the game.Pros:+ Great gameplay+ Great level editor variety+ Great communication with the communityCons:None that I think of.Overall, definitely buy this game if you are a arcade racing fan!"

Neat!It is at this point that you realize during your lesiurely drive somebody has slipped you some very bad ganja.

Buy it YESTERDAY, but don't expect a super-realistic driving game or even a MARGINALLY realistic one. I don't even think the cars have breaks--but if they do I've never used them.A pretty unique game that feels less like a driving or racing game(due in large part to the slippery and unrealistic car) and more like a sort-of... Sonic-y runner with survival elements. Irregardless of how the game feels however it is inarguably one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. The game is challenging at times but for the most part is very fair, even in most of the workshop levels I've played, and it introduces a pretty cool universe(though one which reminds me too much of Tron to call it wholly original) that I REALLY want to learn more about, as well as some mechanics that I can't really say I've ever seen before.You'll find yourself frequently and seamlessly switching from driving on the ceiling and on the walls, only to jump off two and a half seconds later and flying over an endless void. After a while, you'll land on solid ground again-- and if the planets align, you'll be actually horizontal on the GROUND and not on a wall or the ceiling, and nothing will be trying to kill you. At which point you'll probably make your car JUMP and do a couple flips for bonus points. This is the game's biggest asset, in my opinion. Everything just works--and works so very, very well. Jumping from a walll to the floor or vice-versa has some occasional hiccups, but otherwise the physics engine is constructed so well that the game just FLAWLESSLY and instantaneously responds to your commands in a way that I'm too illiterate to describe. The controls just feel so right... I'd even call them close to flawless. When you're a car, it drives like a car--a car that can jump, flip, and drive when half of it gets shredded by laser beams, but a car nonetheless. When you leap into the air and deploy your ♥♥♥♥ing WINGS, it feels like a plane. The game instantly transitions from a really solid(but floaty and weightless) arcade driving game into a really solid flight simulator--but it does it so well that you don't even notice most of the time.Another huge plus is the striking art style. It feels reminiscent of Tron, but it has its own unique flare that defines it as its own, like most of the rest of the game does. It looks really overly shiny and neon and it's not something that I'm usually very fond of, but it works REALLY well. The screenshots and footage on this page seriously do not do the game credit in this respect.The obsticles in the game are also pretty awesome, in combination with the car's damage model. Imagine Metal Gear Rising where Raiden's sword is a grid of laser beams, and you are the watermellon. Obviously your car does not like to drive as well if it is split in half, but it can take a lot of abuse as I recall.The lore and universe in the game gives me mixed opinions. The developers have made it clear that they'll probably change a lot of the ""story"", but as of the time of this writing the game has a really solid universe and what seems to be the beginning of some AMAZING lore to build off of, but it doesn't really do anything with it. It attempts to almost tell the story through the tracks as you race through them, and while it translates pretty well in some ways, it doesn't really allow you to get a good idea of where you are, why you're there, and what the hell is going on around you, and it certainly leaves you drawing blanks for specific details. Story is by no means of any importance in a game like this and when the tracks are designed so well that they should make AAA publishers feel inferior, I really don't mind too much, but I simply can't help but lust for more lore. Hell, I'll sebtle for a two-issue tie-in comic for god's sake.In conclusion, the game has its faults, but I'll be damned if I can name any of them. I'm too busy trying to beat my backflip record.In a car."

(Unlike in the previous game, Nitronic Rush (which I recommend too), you don't have the ""interactive"" music where it does some more sounds & notes when you jump : I personnaly liked that a lot but I can understand that it's not added in this game)- Intense speed sensation when in fullscreen and with the right setup.- A tight gameplay that will challenge your skills and reflexes, I think that's one of the most interesting gameplays I had on a race game. You get the fiber really fast and once you have it : badass race at every corner.- The decor (mostly in space) really matches with the music and the speed : combining colors and speed brings you into a psychedelic experience that is really enjoyable and made me feel a bit of that 90s vibe I got in Nitronic Rush.EDM, Speed and Space what can we ask more to have a badass experience ?Now let's list some of the bad points that could be improved :- More content (like the story).

Robot Car was speed through the city, avoiding danger, harrowing death traps, hostile defense systems, and a strange alien entity hell bent on destroying Robot Car.So it's basically Brave Little Toaster, only faster.Distance is a driving game where your main objective is to reach the end of the map as fast as possible without crashing or slowing down, the faster you go, the better your time ends up being. There is also a story mode where you have to go through a long gauntlet of tracks, but as of writing this review, the story mode isn't 100% completed.Each track takes the form of a long street filled with twists, turns, loops, and traps, and your car has all of the abilities necessary to reach the finish line without turning into that strange red substance I find on my mattress. You have turbo, jump, flight mode, the ability to descend quicker, and wall/ceiling riding.Much like the clothing I steal from the back of goodwill trucks, the controls in this game are tight. Taking corners, drifting, flight, and jumps all feel satisfying and easy to pull off. There's nothing more satisfying than going full speed from wall to cieling to floor to wall to floor without slipping or crashing into the wall like a drunk suburban girl who can totally hold on to that mechanical bull.Distance's biggest bonus is it's multiplayer. Not only can you race others for best time, but there's a workshop in place where other players can upload the maps they made. These maps range from stinky maps that suck to maps that put all the tracks in the main game to shame. Some times you're tested to the limits of your skill as the creator throws everything he can think of at you without making it impossible.Should you play Distance?Yeah, probably, do what you want, I'm not your dad. Distance is fun, fast, thrilling, and basically everything I want in my outrageous action games. Refract Studios, the developers of Distance also made another survival racing game called Nitronic Rush, which you can get for free off their website if you want a taste as to what you might get in Distance.

""hey. what the heck. looks cool"". I couldn't have been more wrong.This game is more than good. It's Absolutely Outstanding.From the moment I started the game I was greeted by disclaimers saying it was an early access game and may change. and to report bugs if I saw any. Off to the main menu I went and by goodness was I surprised on all the features it has!You can change the graphics to black light, film grain. shell shaded. <- (which is my personal favorite) and you have a feature to pretty much bass boost your game into completely shaking the maps. which is. Let me tell you. Just the best.My first few tries at racing were. pitiful to say the least. But wait.. racing would mean you have competition?

This may even be my favorite racer of 2014 (Although, to be fair, there weren't too many racers in 2014). The track editor seems really confusing to me, but apparently not to others because the tracks on workshop are ridiculous. Also, 3 hours may not seem like a lot of time for this game, but considering the short ""campaign,"" most of it is workshop levels. Of course, keep in mind this is still an EA game and there are bugs (like being able to take advantage of flight and skip entire portions of track) but overall this is a fun, refreshing game.Disclaimer: I came into the game with absolutely no expectations. I had never heard of the studio or the previous game.Summary: Distance is a game that's reminicent of a combination of Trackmania and the Hotwheels stunt games. Even in this state, it's very polished. My one complaint thus far is the lack of content, however, like Trackmania, this game offers a full fledged track editor even this early in development. If you like survival racing games but you're concerned of the shortness of the campaign, wait until the full launch. If you like the aformented but enjoy creating content yourself/playing other player's content, just get this now.Gameplay: The gameplay consists of survival racing, where you manuever your car around obstacles and flip the car to reach other surfaces. Very fast paced and fluid. Only complaint thus far is sometimes it felt like the car flipped too slowly, but it's minor. Also want to note the attention to detail here. When a lazer cuts the car in half, it actually feels like that half is missing and the car is considerably harder to drive.Graphics: Game looks pretty nice even now. There are more graphical options than most AAA titles that come to PC. Optimization is okay right now. On a 760, 3770, and 8GB of RAM, I'm getting 30-60 fps.Story: There is a story, but frankly I skipped the cutscenes."

And the very nice transitioning of music between segments and courses (and when you crash and burn).So far I have only downloaded one community track but it was just as good as the ones that came with the game originally.  I tried the map editor for only a few minutes so far just to see what it was like.  Honetly, it's going to take a lot more time to get comfortable with the massive amounts of tools at your disposal in there.  But that is a good thing, I think.Im not completely sure at this time, but I think I read someone else mention there are only 6 people making this game or something.

,Recommended,233610,13322988,"Posted: 11 December, 2014",all,Inkly,"Quality of early access game:Very high, the devs keep adding content and have the game already very polished from the get-go so you don't feel ripped off that it took them forever to finish the game.This game has full workshop support!Glitches:To be honest, it already feels like a finished game, it just has a few glitches here or there that are mostly User interface.There IS currently a very obnoxious part of the game where you have to go to the workshop > collections > all collections and subscribe to all of them so the people hosting the multiplayer games can host pretty much anything.This is the result of the fact that downloading host maps in-game is currently not possible.Have you played Nitronic Rush?Yes?Then this is a better, faster, more polished version of that with multiplayer, fun new gametypes and the best damn level editor you've ever used.Haven't played Nitronic Rush?Distance is an (currently as of writing this) unfinished early access racing game by the digipen grads that made Nitronic Rush as their capstone project.Gameplay:You drive a car that seems to be a mix of an electronic sports car and a jet pack, as the car itself can not only fly but also has small thrusters on every section of the vehicle which are 100% necessary as the roads will end suddenly and this forces the player to literally jump, spin, and twist to another track section. The controls are tight and feel satisfying when you pull off a trick or make a perfect landing.It's about going fast and avoiding MANY obstacles, which can range from pretty much anything and everything. If you get hit by a laser the game will remove parts of your vehicle realistic, and you can keep going to try and rebuild at the next checkpoint, it's often hilarious!Graphics:wow, just wow. The game is absolutely beautiful. I haven't seen such amazing reflection (specular) mapping on anything in video games in, ever. The game has some CRAZY filters and lighting that results in areas having feeling to them. I.E. a VIBRANT red area that is very in your face with it's obstacles will make you tense up and concentrate as you dodge as much as you can. While a cool blue zone, even if it has more obstacles, might make the game feel a bit more relaxed.Even in multiplayer the game is very atmospheric, allowing creators of custom maps to be extremely creative.Story?There IS a story, it's very abstract. Not as in it's trying to be artsy, instead it goes for a more vague, mysterious and atmospheric feel. Without spoiling anything, I think you'll enjoy the story if you like video games that don't shove the story down your throat. Do keep in mind, as it is early access, the story is not currently complete and only has about ten levels. Which will actually take you a good hour or so to complete them all, much longer if it's your first time playing it.Multiplayer:Yes, it has multiplayer. Currently players cannot collide with each-other. Instead every player shows up as a real-time ghost, which surprisingly doesn't actually make the game less fun.There are a few issues here or there unfortunately, as the physics for the game are connected to the frames-per-second, you may collide with walls or pieces of track even though you thought you landed just fine. Do keep in mind this has happened to me only two times in the over a hundred multiplayer races I’ve driven.The other game modes are pretty fun too, reverse tag is just a big game of keep-away, It's pretty fun, and results in some silly moments.Difficulty:This game is has a very subtle difficulty curve. It starts off easy and explains mechanics as you go by, then it gets surprisingly difficult. When you finally get used to the difficulty of the game it semi-mellows out to the point of making it easier but still challenging. Once you get good at it, you'll start trying new shortcuts and attempt tricks to skip parts of tracks. The custom maps however range from incredibly easy, to insane in how difficult they are. If you get a large amount of them and play with some people (or friends if you have those) you'll have a blast.Conclusion:Distance is fun, REALLY fun. It breaks many of the assumptions we have for racing games and makes the game feel fresh and new with it's style and feel of originality. It's very atmospheric, and that personally is very appealing. The addition of multiplayer and custom map support is genius and makes the game feel fresh almost indefinitely. It may not be finished but it sure feels like a complete game at this point.9.5/10 One of my new favorite games. Can't wait for them to finish it!P.S. If you want to have a demo for this game, Nitronic Rush is the best way to do that, it's free; just Google it."

In a nutshell: You're a car, and♥♥♥♥♥♥got ♥♥♥♥ed up somehow, so you have to un♥♥♥♥ it by driving really fast. And that's about it because early access.Gameplay wise, it's solid. You have two sticks, two triggers, and two buttons. Fairly simple, but then you learn you can drive on walls by jumping onto them, and it's really rather good. You can also fly, and that opens up a whole world of opportunity for track skips.Graphically it's pretty good as well, so yeah.The soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect from this sort of game: Lots of EDM and dubstep. And surprisingly, it works. However, if that's not your thing, then you can play your own music so that's good too.But what's really, really, super good about this game, is that the developers put in a random track function, which generates fairly short tracks to race around based on a seed you put in. This essentially turns the game into the video game equivalent of potato chips: You start with just one, and then you do another, and then next thing you know it's two hours down the line and you've eaten the whole bag.And the workshop's pretty good too I guess.Overall 9/10.

From looking at the screenshots one could think of it as a racing game, and they would be right... for about 20%. Distance is much more of a platformer/flight simulator than it is a racing game. It's not really about getting to the finish line as fast as possible, it's more often than not about getting there _at all_.The narrative of the game alludes to the game world being a virtual one, being corrupted by the virus, and our car, being an antivirus algorithm of sorts, has to get to the core of it to restore it (or at least, it was this way in its Nitronic Rush days). The virus, naturally, tries to prevent itself from being deleted, and sends obstacles our way which just so happen to look like lasers, saws and other pointy things capable of slicing our car in half. Literally. And the best thing is, this doesn't mean ""game over"" - you still can control what's left of your car and, if you're lucky enough to make it to the checkpoint, your car will be restored. Good luck with it while airborne though - cars with one wing sliced off usually don't make it very far...Apart from official maps and ones made by fans in Workshop (which are great as usual) there is a cool feature named Trackmogrify, where you can ask for a specific track (e.g. ""long tricky green track with lasers""), and the game will generate such a track for you. No kidding.Overall it's a great one-of-a-kind game vith awesome visuals and soundtrack, and I can't recommend it enough. Try it, chances are you won't regret it."

,Recommended,233610,33287080,Posted: 5 July,all,RockstarCRO,"This felt like the game Cloudbuilt met TEC met HotWheels (for PS1) except with better graphics. In other words, this game is a speed-based trick game that will have you flying and parkour-ing (is that a word) off walls. For early-access it feels like its on the right path, but checking some comments, users have been mentioning this game hasn't been fully released for a few years. I would say make sure to do your homework on this one before you decide to buy it.Distance can be considered a racing game. It takes a lot of elements not traditionally found in racing games and really uses the environment to amplify the danger of racing. I'm not talking about taking tight corners or overtaking on a turn, I'm talking about avoiding lasers, random blocks that will appear, flying objects that will plant themselves in front of you and tracks that will assemble as you drive. The game feels familiar as the driving scheme is effective and simple, but the abilities the car used in conjunction with the amazing environment makes for some solidgameplay. The control scheme of the car is more tight than loose. For the theme of the game it works really well - otherwise I would be complaining if this was Dirt 3 or Shift 2. I like the rigid turning style only in certain games that rely on tricks. The car has a visual bar at the back to notify the player if they are over-using boost. If you over use boost, your car will blow up. Jump is another feature in the game that can be used at any time. This feature will be needed when you need to wall or roof ride. The car can also fly when required. Flying is relatively easy and the player can literally go anywhere when they are in the air. Be careful though, the flying scheme uses boost as well and can heat up the car pretty quick.Thevisualsare pretty rock solid and follow a neon sort of Tron glow. The effects in the level are pretty intense especially at high speeds. The scene is sort of like a picture when you're speeding along dodging lasers shooting from the sky and giant saws ripping through the floor back and forth. The graphics are sharp and the levels feel decently full of effects and animations. Thesoundswere done pretty well. There are levels where you will be rocking out to the music and other times where you will be a little afraid because the level, the animations and sounds are all eery. The game does a decent job immersing the player in this random neon-Tron universe.Overall, the game is good - but there is still a lot of work to be done. The adventure mode, arcade mode and split screen is fun, but I feel more needs to be added to make it a well rounded game. I see potential for mini-games and other online/local modes. One can only hope as an early access back-er. Again, I liked it - I felt like I paid a little too much - so definitely wait for a good sale and definitely do your homework. My advice to the dev would be to continue to add different environmental effects (track appearing as you drive sort of stuff) and maybe battle elements the car can do against other cars ?RATING : 6.9/10GameplayB-Story / CampaignC+Visuals / User InterfaceBSounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+"

It's still in Early Access, but the experience (in my opinion) is already extremely satisfying. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes or for hours on end. Currently, there isn't a whole lot of official content, but the amount of community maps is absurd, and most of them are amazing. For now, the (still in progress) story mode serves as a kind of tutorial which runs you through the official maps.When you go online, there usually aren't many (or any) hosts, yet invariably, within ~3 minutes of hosting your own server, people will quickly begin to join. I don't know why people are reluctant to host matches, but they're there, and ""if you host it, they will join."" Furthermore, the community is friendly and helpful.This game is perfect to get your mind off of things, as you'll quickly be engrossed in the satisfying mechanics/gameplay. It has a strange ability to demand your attention, present you with mass chaos and intense gameplay, yet somehow be very relaxing at the same time.

Nitronic Rush was basically Distance except with a different story, car, graphics, and music. Now the car mechanincs were exactly the same, this is obviously a good idea for Refract to do. I really liked the way Music played a big role in Nitronic Rush and it sorta does in Distance, though not as much. I can't tell if I miss the narrator from Nitronic Rush or not, it was pretty funny to hear him narrate all the tricks you did. (""Holy Teledo!""   ""Sad Day!"") Moving on, Distance is truly a unique and wonderful game, posing a challenge and new gameplay style. I haven't seen many ""Survival Racing Games"" Before, and Distance is a good one. Everything Feels really smooth and the levels are satisfying and Challenging at the same time, not to mention that multiplayer is a lot of fun. Even though the Adventure mode is really short, I can guarantee that you will have endless play time. This is because the game has a level editor, and ""Trackmogrify"", which is an element where you enter a word or phrase, and it generates a track for you to play. The VR support looks nice and any new updates I can expect to be just as good.

I understand that a lot of fans of the original Nitronic Rush want Distance to be very similar, but that's no reason not to add a separate battle mode - why not have the best of both worlds?In all, definitely a ""must own"" in my books, and it's something that I'll always come back to for a quick 'fun' fix :)"

,Recommended,233610,21416935,"Posted: 23 February, 2016",all,Det. Dicksmack²,"Back in 2011 a small group of 11 DigiPen students created a survival racing game. But this wasn't your typical racing survival experience. Players were thrown into an aesthetically pleasing digital world where you had to avoid various amount of obstacles as you drove fast, spun, flipped, flew, through an infected computer mainframe that doubled as a city. The game was released to the masses soon after DigiPen awarded it 5 awards including Game of the Year, Best Junior Game, Best Graphics, Best Physics, and Best 3D Visual Design. It won many awards from other Indepedent Game award shows in the following year.What originally started off as a freeware final project for school has evolved into a sucessor worthy of it's asking price. Distance is entirely built around the control scheme and physics of it's older brother so veterans will feel right at home with this installment. And, since it plays like it's predecessor, newbies won't feel overwhelmed. This is the kind of game that's easy to pick up but insanely difficult to master. So far the devs have shown a lot of promise in new design choices and the game is updated quite frequently. For example, one significant improvement is the change to cutting hazards. In Nitronic Rush, lasers and saws would pretty much destroy you in a single hit. Now, the devs have changed that so those hazards use a dynamic damage system to actually destroy the car without ruining your run. It's so absolutely crazy to be going at full speed, cut your car in two like a banana, and try to maintain control towards the next regeneration checkpoint.At the moment the game's campaign is unfinished but that doesn't mean other elements aren't completed. The developers generously included the entire development kit within the game itself and integrated the Steam workshop. This allows anyone to create their own tracks and, as an added bonus, gives experienced game designers the ability to add unique and original content to the tracks they make allowing for endless creativity. And, thanks to an active community, endless replayability. All this and it even has multiplayer... all for a deliciously low price of $20."

A driving/platforming/flying/puzzle game in a beautiful (and at times dystopian), TRON-like world.The game is mostly about driving and jumping over or dodging road hazards, but with touches of flying. The puzzle element comes into play on rare occasions where it is not obvious where you are supposed to go.  You can use your set of driving/hopping/flying moves to find the level's exit portal.  You can also sometimes jump on the sides of walls and grip to them.  It can leave you not knowhing which way is up.  That is what the 3D compass display is for.The level aesthetics, atmosphere and music are all excellent.  It can be very trippy.  Not in a psychadelic way but more of a zooming through a chill, digital soundscape kind of way.The only negative I can think of is in terms of it's control configuration system.  The game works great with the Steam controller's trackpad for steering.  Turn the steering sensitivity all the way up so it does not dampen your trackpad input.The problem is the game wants to use only your keyboard or only your game controller.   While editing your profile you can not mix and match Xinput controls and keyboard controls.  And the game has a bunch of controls to assign.The game does respond to both Xinput and keyboard inputs.  But pressing something on the keyboard disables the right trigger until you move the analog stick (via the track pad in my case).  So it only listens to one at a time.  It is still early access so I hope the devs can make this more flexible.Control weirdness aside, I highly recommend!"

Here is my review of DistanceDistance is being developed by Refract Studio which also made Nitronic Rush ( a free game ) when they we're in DigiPen as Student, so Distance is a sequel of Nitronic Rush.Distance have in content- A short adventure mode who learn you the basics tricks of the game- A Arcade mode with others mode of racing, Like Sprint, Stunt and others.- A Level Editor where you can create your owns track and share it on the steam workshop- Like i said above you can download tracks from others user on the Steam Workshop, you have more than 1600 tracks on it, all i can say these track are really nice and some are hard but can be done by using what you learn in the short adventure mode.About the adventure mode which can be completed in 30-45 minutes, but this one have some decent tracks with decent music. I really liked it. the difficulty is not hard and you learn all the tricks you can use in others levels. My favorite adventure mode tracks is the Monolith one. When you completed this mode, you can go in Arcade mode than sprint, to re do them and get medals, and unlock 3 more levels ( depend of the medals you get )The game is using the Unity engine, which run pretty nice on lower end pc or laptop. If you plan to buy it, i suggest you for the moment, to use the Experimental Build which run better on low end pc.About the Level Editor, this one is really complete you can use the music you want on your tracks, and others cool feature :).I hope you liked my review, and then probably you will buy it. The game is still in Beta ( Early Access & soon in stable build ) but the developers always listen their community, even on twitter and steam forums.The game cost 20€ or 20$ depend of your country, but you won't be disappointed of Distance."

It has some superb, abstract track design reminiscent of any of the TrackMania titles, but adds in the insane speed of a Need for Speed or Burnout game combined with obstacles taken right out of a kart racer. It could also be safe to say it's the Tron: Legacy we never properly got and then some, cuz it's got the bells and whistles but is a much more enjoyable and entertaining experience. That's also a major disservice to this incredible beta to an incredible game.The Early Access version of Distance offers quite a lot for a small package, including the makings of an adventure mode that add in a Journey-esque dash of story... if Journey had lots of giant sawblades, lasers, and death-defying jumps in a cyberpunk setting, on top of a traditional Arcade mode that games seem to have lost touch with in recent years. And of course, there's the aforementioned multiplayer which throws in your traditional races as well as a briefly novel tag mode and a stunt mode that takes another queue from Burnout minus the exploding cars. Buy and large, the main reason to play the game is for the ""Survival"" or ""Speed and Style"" modes, where it's testing your reflexes and split-second maneuvering around traps and finding clever (and stylish) ways to beat a track in the quickest time possible. Mastering these stages is a delight and even just killing five minutes to feed a need for speed while jamming to some intense electronica that makes you feel like a badass when you nail those impossible jumps is an insatiable feeling that makes me always want to come back for more.It's just a shame the current version doesn't have a lot to offer when looking at the official offerings, but the game's taken a life of its' own with the community created maps. It's just a small shame that one of the problems the game suffers, and what goes into common community level design, is the confusion of good map design with unfair memorization challenges. It's these types of maps that make for way too many unofficial tracks that feel overbearing, sloppy, and infuriating when compared to the more official offerings that have good ebbs, flows, and difficulty curves in each track that were both challenging but also more than possible. However, that's not to say that there haven't been rising stars in the community mappers as there have certainly been tracks that rival even Refract's stages, which make slogging through the sloppy maps worth it when you come across that solid, tightly-designed gem. But as it stands though, the map-making scene isn't as vibrant as, say, most of Valve's games or Unreal Tournament, so the Workshop might feel barren, at least until the game picks up in popularity and creative level designers.That said, this game, frankly, deserves a lot more of that popularity, because it's just an absolutely fun game to play, with the bonus of being a great looker with a damn fine soundtrack. Refract might be one of the new Indie kids on the block, but they are certainly no amateurs at making a great racing game.Distance is worth your time, your money, and your commitment to beating your own and your friend's high scores. In this day and age of more realistic, simulated racing games, it's time we had a game like this to come along and remind us we're playing video games for the overwhelming, exciting, and expansive possibilities of the medium and not needing to be bound by realistic settings, physics, and speeds.So, can you survive the distance? You should jump behind the wheel and find out."

The 'Adventure Mode' which is the campaign at the moment is quite short with only 11 maps which took me just under 2 hours to complete, but these maps were very good at introducing me too the game slowly and made the learning curve very small while still teaching me many new mechanics in each level. In addition to the Adventure mode there is Arcade Mode which allows you to replay levels over and over to get better times in both Official and Community maps.The community maps in this game are very exciting and just as good as the official maps. Many dedicated people frequently make and upload new maps to the steam workshop which is great as it keeps the game new and fresh. All these community maps are playable Online aswell as single player.The online mode is great, although there is usually only 2-3 servers up at a time with a maximum of 6 players you can easily set up your own through port-fowarding. With friends this game can become very competetive, even if you dont have any friends that buy this game with you the community is awesome, you meet new players everyday aswell as playing again with the ones you met the day before. Everyone is extremely supportive on those levels where you are the last to finish and everybody is spectating you but you just can't get past a bit, they say what you should try and even if you DNF you have the next map to beat them on.Overall it is a great game with or without friends even though it is currently in early access and i cant wait to see the future additional content to be realesed with the updates to come.TL:DRPros:- Fun- Great learning curve with the Adventure Mode guiding you through- High mechanical skill cap- Competetive- 5 different game modes- Sprint (racing)- Speed and Style (racing but you do flips to get more points)- Challenge (racing or short very difficult tracks)- Stunt (do flips and get points)- Trackmogrify (random gen levels)- Supportive and nice community- loads of community levels uploadedCons:- Small player base leads to only 2-3 servers at a time (unless you host your own)- Is in Early Access"

Even better than Motorstorm.The first thing that struck out to me was, before I even realized how tight the jumping was, that I could even jump at all; I'm not used to that! Yet here I am now wishing that almost every arcade racer took advantage of this mechanic.Another thing I love is how Refract makes great use of Motorstorm-style boost mechanics rather than standard nitrous, where instead of running out of extra speed, you keep going and going until you overheat and blow up; sure, it's not realistic, but hey, it's much more fun and superb this way as it is.And finally, the sheer intensity and awe you generally feel as your vehicle strolls down the levels are a sight that I honestly cannot match with any other game within this genre, or any game ever for that matter. I mean, your car keeps going even when sliced in half by lasers!

On the one hand -- excellent initial idea, simple but very ""tasty"" visuals, catchy gameplay and absolutely gorgeous soundtrack. On the other -- there's definitely very little of in-house made content, and this is the most serious issue.When I played Distance, it reminded of Trackmania in a way, an old one, without all the bells and whistles -- a 2007 Nations, for example, and while the physics here are, well, rudimentary -- the feeling is pretty much the same. But while Trackmania was intended to play online, it still had heaps of content for single player mode. In case of Distance, I was finished with its Adventure Mode in less than an hour.Online mode is something else. Well, that if you'll be able to find public server. And if you'll be able to connect to it. Because there's no official servers or dedicated server software, people should host sessions from their own computers, and since pretty much everybody are behind a NAT these days, it makes a task of finding suitable server really difficult.Ports are okay at the very least -- as Linux gamer, I'm very pleased with how smooth and troubleless game runs on my not-so-fast-by-novadays-standarts-rig. As far as I know, Mac version runs pretty much the same.If eventually campaign will be like four or five hours long, then I guess my money were well spent. I'd like to believe that this is how things will turn up. For now, you'll have to dig deep into Steam Workshop, looking for decent maps."

Were it not for my adrenaline-rushed self preservation instincts kicking in, I might have tried to land on one of the many cyber buildings dotting the landscape- in fact, i ended up doing just this by accident a few times during gameplay.The campaign is still a work in progress, but I find that a short and sweet campaign for this game is the best ticket anyway. It doesn't explain much, and I'm still figuring out how I managed to ""kill"" the first boss, but I did find myself distracted several times throughout the first few levels, trying to read the signage and propaganda scattered across the map. Once again, it reminds me a lot of Tron, especially the internet levels, as it should.In the background, you can see whatmightbe planet Earth, but the geography is bizarre. In the distance I see what I can only assume are inhabited continents, but beneath there's only a maelstrom of some kind, with an ominous symbol in the middle that looks suspiciously like the ""Alliance"" symbol you encounter repeatedly through the game. Further on in the horizon, pillars are visible. What could they mean? Is this all a computer simulation, or is this our horrible future?But if our eyes are real, how can mirrors be real?10/10, would go the Distance as many times as is automotively possible."

Especially during the multiplayer (I'm not the first one complaining).*This game would benefit if it featured a 'drift' system. As it is now the breaks feel a bit off and stiff. I think drifting would make this game extra intense (maybe even awarding the player with points/small nitro bonuses for a good drift?)*The engine/nitro sounds were a bit soft and dissapointing, especially in comparison with Nitronic Rush, which felt much more faster.*In Nitronic Rush there were big spinning blades on which you could drift/slide.

If i had to choose the top 3 racing games i've played this decade, i'm sure Distance would have made it second or even first position.Enough with the compliments, let's talk more about the game.Distance is a futuristic racing game like nothing else. You are in control of a car that can boost, jump and fly (yeah, it's a transform). The game has a storyline that feels a bit artistic. It has no narrative, just you, the stages and the musics (that i have to say, it fits just perfect with the game). Since it is still Early Access, it isn't complete yet, but i can already see it developing really good!The arcade mode seems to be really good, even better when played with a friend or in online mode. And now with custom tracks made by the community, i can't even describe how big is the potential of this game.BUT, it has it cons (for now, it might change in the future). In current stages, there is no bots in arcade mode. I feel like this is needed in every racing game, mainly in this game! I want to play the arcade mode when my friends aren't avaliable and online mode isn't quiet what i'm looking for everytime.The storyline NEEDS a narrative. Sometimes you feel a little lonely when traveling through the stages and the music is low. The storyline of this game shows potential and a narrative like the one in Portal games would fit just perfectly.If i would recommend this game to everyone in this planet? OF COURSE!

In these modes you will have different ways to play like SPRINT, Speed and Style, etc. I´m not going into details but those are different ways to get score in the tracks. There is another mode that is really crazy, you could type a word or a phrase and the game will create a track based on that! hahahha amazing.The Workshop is another STRONG FEATURE here. The game has a very good community that is not only following the game but also providing quality content. The tracks are organized by Difficulty, the play modes and explained a little by the creators. The result is....A LARGE QUANTITY OF VERY GOOD TRACKS TO DOWNLOAD AND ENJOY.VR Review:Regarding VR FACTOR.The game is very well prepared for VR.You have the PoV from the cockpit and you can select a 3rd person cam that could be adjusted freely.You could adjust the VR SS directly from the game, the resolution, each of the effects, texture quality, etc.Besides all those factors...the game FEELS very smooth and fast.Regarding the speed on VR: this game is REALLY FAST.Still REDOUT is a faster game than this, but the reflexes and reactions that you will make here are unique, and you won´t find them in any other VR game.I´m explaining you this so you could think about your SICK factor. In my case at this point I could say I´m immune.If you can tolerate it, I REALLY RECOMMEND IT for VR. There is nothing like this in VR.If you tried it, and got sick, remember that you could still play the game without VR. So in the end you could still enjoy it and maybe try small VR sessions to train and improve your resistance. ;)The only complain that I could mention at this point regarding the game is that it still being developed, and the stock content like adventure is not yet complete.

Most of it is made by people who have the mentality of mastering the games mechanics so you'll have to do so also but once you do it is a game of pure bliss."

,Recommended,233610,21050911,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Straw,"I'm going to start out this review by saying that I have a lot of faith in this game.Despite Early Access, Distance has shown a lot of promise and is alerady an absolute blast to play. There are other, better reviews that discuss game mechanics and what it has to offer, so I'm going to skip that and ask:Do any of you, like me, remember the show Acceleracers?Formed by Hotwheels, this was an animated series that was, in my opinion, one of the best to existance. Basically, the top racers from around the world are chosen to form a small group known as the Acceleracers. They use a portal to warp to other dimensions with prebuilt tracks that they can race on. Each of these dimensions had a different feel and driving technique needed to master it. If you got to the end portal before the one hour time limit and before anyone else, you gained an acceletron; a small card-like device that gives your car ""superpowers"", and is in line with the theme of the dimension that you gained it from.Anyway, the series was insane not because of the tension between the human racers, evil robot racecars that tried to kill them, a secret society formed by the main character's own dad, and the amazing plot, but because of the stunts that all the cars pulled off in the show. Vert, the main character, is known for his car's jets being able to give him a boost upward, effectively ""jumping"". Additionally, cars were souped up with things like nitrox (a glorified version of nitro) and things that allowed them to fly, shoot a grappling hook, etc.One of the most memorable things is when, in the final movie, was when Vert was directed by Tesla (the guy overseeing all the human drivers) to go through one final test. I'm not going to spoil it, but anyone who's seen it should know what I'm talking about. Anyway, it's a 1 on 1 race through every single one of the dimensions, and the thing is that Vert doesn't have any acceletrons. So, it's his pure memorization and skill that he needs to speedrun through the entire Accelerace before time runs out.This game captures this perfectly.Almost every game, I imagine myself as Vert driving, nimbly avoiding all obstacles, using boosters to jump, and maintaining a rediculous high speed while knowing that one slip up could destroy me and my car.Additionally, in the series, there were always memorable moments of cars getting wiped out, flying out into rocks, smashing themselves off the road while the other cars kept it cool and just drove like life depended on it (which it did). There was even one scene where a car was lasered in half, and cars flying off the edge of the narrow track into oblivion. Sound familiar?Anyway, it was not the look or feel of the game so much as the fact that I had finally discovered an accurate representation of Acceleracers I had always been looking for. Whoever knows the show will be amazed at how many moments you've thought, ""wow, just like Acceleracers"", I know I have.Not many will know what it is though, I'm sure of that. But anyone who does, this is the game you've been waiting for."

There are several diffrent features to this game (I haven't tried all of them only a few) VR, Track Editor, Trackmogify (Random Track Generator) and online play. The controls are incredibly responsive both on the keyboard and the controller (Logitech F310). Gameplay-wise the modes are diverse enough to be different, but similar enough that they are easy to pick up and play. The graphics with high graphic settings look absolutely beautiful. BUT BE WARNED, if you don't play on a very, Very, VERY, powerful computer, frame rate may be pretty bad if you play on a core i3 laptop in comparison.CONSWell, there isn't really a CONBut if there was, then I would say...Price.$19.99 might be a bit overpriced for you, it's not bad at all because of all the features that are in the game. It's a good time to mention that Distance is a spiritual sequel to Nitronic Rush, an older game from 2011 by the same folks that made this game.

This is the only early access game I've ever purchased and in spite of that, it still manages to deliver an amazing experience.  I have no idea what the story is behind the game and if you're like me then you'd rather not know simply because the sci-fi wasteland environment the game provides is so immersive that so you'll end up creating your own story in your head.  The electronic soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect: gritty, pounding tech-house that totally puts you in the game.  As for the controls, I played with an XBox gamepad and it worked perfectly with that.Complaints?  When you shift to drive on the ceiling, it can some times be rather 50/50 on whether or not it works.  Suggestions?

I also will say that I can't stand the keyboard controls for the game, but that's just me. Try it yourself.The racing gameplay is fast and fairly easy to pick up. Running through the tutorials once should teach you everything you need to know. I do wish there were better, crunchier sound effects for vehicles hitting things (especially on landing a jump), but that's just me being a bit nitpicky.This game's main issue (in my opinion, of course) is its level editor.Ooh boy. That UI. It's an absolute clusterfrak of buttons, poorly organized pieces and annoying camera control. Stretching, squashing, scaling and rotating pieces feels finicky at the best of times. Not to mention it has the major problem of making it extremely difficult to tell where anything is in relation to anything else.No, I do not think it's acceptable for a game that banks so heavily on user-created content to have such an annoying toolset to use. It's not like a lot of this couldn't be fixed, either - just organizing the pieces in something that vaguely resembles a logical manner would be a great start. Why is the *End* piece near the top of the selection, and why is the *Start* piece buried much further down? Why aren't they right up front? This is just one example of what I mean - there's plenty more where that came from.The icons also often don't do the best job conveying what piece you're actually clicking on, and the text is all strung together into one blurb - stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like this should not be this way. At all.And before you say ""There are guides available,"" I will say that a game that banks as heavily on its toolset as Distance does should have a UI that's intuitive enough for a person who's never touched or looked at the game before to be putting levels together within a couple of minutes.Try to imagine, for instance, if something like Planet Coaster or Trackmania had a track editor that, rather than being user-friendly to the point a person who's never played a video game could get a handle on how it worked, was instead a headache-inducing mess. Those games would be awful just because of that - so why does Distance's level editor have this problem?What the hell does this game gain by its level editor being as confusing and frustrating to use as it is? Nothing, that's what.Overall, I would buy this game to race. The level editor is utterly unintuitive and I find it's a headache to do the simplest tasks with it.But the actual racing, flying, jumping and whatnot feel fantastic - though I prefer a controller for it. Then again, apparently top-tier players love the keyboard controls, so I might be in the minority."

The first person view is even crazier than the third person and personally I find it easier to control my car, from the first person view, even though having spacial awareness from this view is a bit difficult. All in all it's a awesome game. The music gets you pumped once it gets going. I feel like this game is a hell child born from a threesome Rocket League(with it's car jumping mechanics and boosts), Burnout(because it's the only game I can recall that's environment could really bone you over) and Tron.9/10 Would crash into lasers again."

I've only got 7.5 hours so far, but I'm going to enjoy this game for a long time. The community levels/support is probably what will keep this game fresh for me even longer than the SFRUSH series (back in muh day). The game is very polished as I would expect for something that's been ""out"" for 2 years. One complaint I have is the slightly lazy turning physics... at extremely low speeds the turning radius for the car is absurdly huge which makes recovering from a slide into a wall much more arduous and difficult than it needs to be. The only other whinging I can do is over lack of styling/car choices. It'd be nice to have more vehicle choices (preferably with limited tunable stats to suit play-style/track-specific setups)."

,Recommended,233610,13748906,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Plasmawario,"Distance is an indie game like no other, taking racing and platforming to the next level. Made by some of the same creators of Nitronic Rush, who graduated from Digipen, these dedicated developers work every day with lots of passion on this outstanding game. I've honestly never been more hooked on a game such as this one, thanks to it's amazing gameplay, community, build-in speechlessly-powerful level editor, and random track generation system, you are in for lots of replay value with over 2000 community workshop level submissions and it's ""trackmogrify"" mode which allows you to enter any seed you want, and a track is generated based on what you put in (modifiers can be used to alter the difficulty, length, etc.). You are able to customize your car by changing the car colors, but unfortunetly, no custom cars are possible due to complications with leaderboard compatability, hitboxes giving different physics (which can give different leaderboard results and can screw with the top times.). Good news, there is confirmed one new vehicle model for all players in the works, and another, backer-exclusive vehicle, to be in the game prior to launch (these new car models will have the same hitboxes as to avoid messing with leaderboard times being screwed with). For the level editor, it is one of the easiest-to-learn, easiest-to-use, most powerful editor you will ever get your hands on. You can change many settings of any object available such as, but not limited to: Colors, emit colors, lights, rotation axis and speed (animator component, axisrotation if supported, or rigidbody if supported), spline road mannipulation, simples (can change bumpmap strength, emit texture, texture scales, togglable collisions, transparency, colors, reflect settings, etc.), particles (also very powerful with many settings such as texture, amount, colors, speed, acceleration, gravity, lifetime, offset, etc.), event triggers, addable components (a system where you can add special properties to any object that allows extra effects and spiciness to your map), and many other features that are too many to mention on here. A couple other major features of the game are Arcade mode, and Adventure mode. Arcade mode currently has a couple gamemodes like Sprint, Stunt (currently getting a big revamp as of 6/14/17), Reverse Tag, Challenge and Trackmogrify. Sprint and Reverse Tag are the most popular gamemodes. Sprint mode is straight-forward where you must get from point A, to point B in as little as time as possible. NOTE: Unlike most racing games, Distance does not bind you to the track against your will. Your car has 4 abilities: Boost, Jump, Fly, and Grip. These abilities allow you to move off the track and drive along the walls of buildings and any other piece of environment to carve your own path to the exit. Some players may tell you ""Skipping is back and no one should do it"", that is not true by any means. The game's core mechanics set the stage for skipping tracks, and the devs themselves encourage skipping if possible (Not telling you how to play, you can choose to not skip if you want. But you'll find that the global leaderboards will always have its top times be made by skipping). It is a big part of the game that some players don't realize, and it should be a known thing to everyone. Reverse tag mode is exacly what it says on the tin. One player has the tag bubble, and everyone is trying to get it. First player to 3 minutes is the winner. Challange mode is basically like sprint, except no checkpoints, and no respawning, and short tough tracks. Stunt mode is where you must rack up the most points by performing the best/most tricks out of anyone within a time limit. The last gamemode is Adventure mode. Although it is currently short and unfinished, when this game exits early access this year (the current goal is this year, and they are damn determined to get it done this year. They have even hired recently 3 community members to help finish adventure mode while the original devs work on the other things). Adventure 2.0 will be published as one giant update instead of small incrimental updates.To wrap it all up, i'm going to compile a list of all the things mentioned above:____________________________________________________________________Gamemodes:- Adventure, Sprint, Challange, Stunt, Trackmogrify, Reverse TagLevel Editor:- Build-in powerful editor that is easy to use/learn (the same editor the devs use to make their levels)- Simples 2.0, Particles, Spline roads, Event triggers, Components, Buildings, Teleporters, Biodomes, Customizable skybox/fog/ambient colors/lighting, and lots more!Customization:- Car hull color, glow color, hull2 color, and sparkle color- 2 new vehicles are confirmed to be added before release (one a public car, the other a backer-only car) Both cars will use the same hitbox as the original to avoid screwing with the leaderboard times with different physicsReplayability:- Over 2000 workshop level submissions- Trackmogrify allows random track generation simply by entering a seed and watching it generate!Replay system:- Watch/race against ghosts offline in any any track that has been played!Adventure 2.0:- Massive update containing a completely new adventure experience, all new/updated music, tons of new level editor assets and components- Near-release before Distance leaves early accessCommunity:- We have a discord server available where a majority of our community hangs around. Come join us! (look atsurvivethedistance.comor in the steam discussions for the invite link)Updates:- This is a passion project by the devs. There are updates to the game and that ill persist post-release for a good while. This game has been in development for 5 years, and been in Early Access for ~3 years. Please give it time, this is an indie team and they are working hard every day to not rush this project and give us the best-quality product they can. Updates are being made. (Some take longer than others, it's just the way it is) Just take a look at the change logs when an update is made, or you can follow the devs on their twitter. Alternativly you can join the Distance discord and keep up-to-date there.____________________________________________Hope you find this review helpful, and i am proud to be with such an amazing community and follow the greatest devs on EA. Truly excels at being an Early Access title and feels like a finished product as is. But will not leave EA until it is good and ready."

Maybe Trials Evolution but this game by far is better than that game. Distance brings the intense back to racing. I'm so use to racing on some real life tracks but Distance is so much more better than that. When you very first play it and can be a little difficult but once when you know what you are doing then it ends up being the greatest. I really feel like a game like this can really help your reaction to stuff around you while playing driving games. Probably only downfall is that you only got one car and it sounds like it doesn't have a engine. Probably in the future I would like to see something like that but other than those 2 downfalls this game by far is the best racing game on Steam and I am so glad to get this game in the Early Access stage so I can see this game progress.

It leaves me wanting for more of a story mode that is not avliable at the time of writing the review. (7/18/2016). The game also has a functioning multiplayer which works great and syncs very well with people online. The steam workshop for custom tracks is awesome as people have made tons of maps (wether they are good or not is up to you). The game has potential but it needs to be further expanded.The Devs seem to be here and enjoy what they are doing. So i would expect further updates.(Quick side note, it has virtual reality support so you can go first person in the car while you drive which is cool AF lol, like driving a futuristic car in a hotwheels crazy world. You can also drive in first person mode while not having any virtual reality equipment but i dont think it would be as cool)If you have ever seen the TV/Movie series ""Hot Wheels Highway 35"" and ""Hot Wheels The Acceleracers movies 1-4"" . It feels as if it were inspired by the movies as it has similar car design choice and level design. But that just may be a complete  coincidence. This is just a positive note from my side it makes the game feels nostalgic in a way because i watched the movies as a kid."

The current build of the game under review (beta 4139), though only in Early Access on Steam - does contain PLENTY of content to keep gamers busy. The beta version of Distance houses a pretty barebones story mode called ""Adventure."" It definitely IS an adventure, and there is some story to soak up here - though not a whole lot. The beginning narrative introduces us to the idea of the protagonist - which is some kind of sentient platform-mobile that looks like a car. I say looks like a car: because you'll find out over the course of the ""adventure"" that you have a pretty substantial range of mobility options at your disposal. As with any platformer packing some advanced mechanics, Distance starts off by treating you like a toddler. You'll have an accelerate button and be able to steer... and that's about it. But the savvy driver is soon abundantly rewarded with wave after wave of new obstacles and mechanics with which to bypass them. You'll learn how to boost right away in order to get over certain sized gaps that you wouldn't normally be able to traverse. You'll then find out that your sentient platform-mobile can sprout some wings from either side and leisurely fly in any direction. This adds a HUMONGOUS amount of range to the options you have in conquering some of the tougher challenges, although I was both disappointed and understanding when I found out that flight would occasionally be deactivated in order not to break certain difficulty barriers in Adventure mode. Additionally, boost and flight work off of the same meter, and allowing this meter to fill causes you to hear an ""Overheat"" alarm. Overheating too long causes an explosion and a reset from the previous checkpoint. Luckily, however, checkpoints are very liberally placed throughout each map in Adventure mode.Without spoiling any details of the very barebones ""story"", which is really more of a setting than anything, I would like to say that there is an underlying horror vibe present in this dystopian neon wasteland - but it's cool, and doesn't feel too heavy-handed or like any conceits were made in order for it to make it into the game.At the abrupt end of the included 10 or so levels of the ""remember, it's beta"" story mode, you'll find that you feel prepared to march straight into some of the other gameplay modes Distance has to offer.Just in the beta version of the game, there is a huge amount of replay value already present. Distance offers a pretty well thought-out, though basically what you'd expect multiplayer mode that allows groups of (currently) up to 6 players to go all Sonic the Hedgehog in maps, either: created by the developers, created by the community using the in-game level editor, or generated by inputting ""seeds"" into the ""trackmogrification"" tool: which randomly generates levels based on strings of letters. Each of these categories offer immense replayability and are sure to keep anyone coming back again and again since the game provides such a high-level of ""Wow, that was so cool"" moments.Multiplayer is purely racing. There are several modes, such as a tag mode, a challenge mode, and a sprint mode. Tag mode consists of players trying to be ""it"" as long as possible, challenge mode consists of trying to clear tons of obstacles with no checkpoints turned on, and sprint mode is just good old classic ""race-to-the-finish."" Each of these modes is pretty spectacular, though the game misses out on achieving near-Mario Kart levels of competitive frustration since there is no collision detection between vehicles. You can see everyone else alongside you on the courses - you can even see when they SPLAT right into a barrier that popped up out of the ground while they confidently sped past at 500 miles per hour, but you can't bump into them at all. It's the equivalent of playing with a bunch of ghosts. That small complaint aside, the multiplayer is still very engaging - and the inclusion of text chat between participants allows for some nice banter in between matches. One glaring omission, however, is that there is no option when creating a multiplayer lobby on or offline to disable the platform-mobile's ""plane"" function. [EDIT: There is an option to disable flight, but it must be selected at the time of level creation rather than by the server host!] This created a situation for me where a room full of people called me a ""track-skipper"" because I flew from one tricky portion of the map to another (the equivalent of using a mushroom in Mario Kart to speed through rough terrain for a shortcut). Sure, this is probably common sense for most people, but I used the tools at my disposal, given by the game, and then found that this was looked down on. For good reason too. In some cases, because of the layout of a track - an opponent could finish a race in 30 seconds while the rest of us trudged on for a full 2 minutes, simply because he found an opening to ""skip-track"" to the exit. [EDIT 2: I have been assured by members of the Distance online community that ""track-skipping"" is very much a welcome part of the multiplayer experience as I originally hoped.] This, however, was a very small hassle - and the community seemed to be understandingly aware that the omission of an option to turn off flight in these multiplayer lobbies is an oversight simply not implemented in the beta phase of Distance.Also, worthy of mention is that aside from the online multiplayer aspect, there is also the ""highly coveted among PC gamers"" option to play in splitscreen offline.After you've taken the community-created tracks for a spin, you may feel compelled to try your own hand at creating an amazing course filled with danger and explosions - and, thankfully, Distance includes a vast level editor - simple enough to get started in without much training, and advanced enough that you could basically create your own standalone story with the tools at your disposal. If you thought with the advent of Super Mario Maker that maybe an F-Zero Maker was around the corner - I hate to burst your bubble; but Distance may be the closest you ever come to realizing that dream.Lastly, this experience is a visual delight and both audio and video build off of one another. The buildings pulsate in vibrant color to the resounding beats of the techno soundtrack. The environment moves in a showcase of sublime aural rhythm. I did notice that the boost sound coming from the platform-mobile was a little loud and kind of whiny when it hits top speed. Textures are clean throughout and obstacles on the track ahead of you are easy to see - even when they're flying at you in what seems to be an instant. There were a couple of times I felt a little turned around, but with clear visual cues - I found myself back on the right track quickly. As for optimization, I tested the game on my desktop with an nVidia 980TI and i7 2600k @ 1440p/maximum graphics settings and easily maintained 60fps throughout my time playing. I also tested the game at 1080p with my laptop packing an nVidia 860M and had 0 drops below 60 FPS - even when the screen erupted in a magnificent neon explosion in front of my eyes.Distance is one of the most purely fun games I've ever played. It can be very easy; it can be blistering difficult - but the undoubtedly adrenaline-filled excitement is sure to impress most. At a suggested price of $19.99, Distance is totally worth its cost right now: In Early Access. To sweeten the deal, it routinely goes on sale on Steam.Gameplay - 91Multiplayer - 77Visuals/Art Style - 89Sound - 82Extras/Modding Tools/Community Content - 71Content-to-cost at $19.99 - 88For what it's worth, I give Distance on PC: an 83/100."

A fast-paced, electronic-music fueled, somewhat story-based, flying, hopping, boosting, interdimensional, tricking, warping, and overall insane racing game of the future! The adventure mode campaign at the time of writing is pretty short, and they don't promise any kind of long drawn-out campaign but the official tracks that are in now are pretty high quality handcrafted and themed. There's also procedural tracks which I haven't tried out yet, seeing as currently there are over 700 community made tracks in the steam workshop - there's definitely no shortage of quality content. Add to it the ability to play your own music that the tracks' lighting and certain elements will sync to, and you've got an overwhelmingly positive game here.My only complaints are the difficulty of adding your own music, you have to manually type in the path of the folder you want to play, and being that I use itunes for my ipod - some of my music are m4a files which are not supported by the game. It would be much nicer if there were a simple folder browser and some other formats were supported but it's not a huge deal. Could always make a separate folder just for this game and convert my files with dbpoweramp to mp3.I've never really been too much into techno but the music in the game is pretty good atmospheric semi-psychadelic. Music that I like that I think goes really well with the game is Infected Mushroom (I'm the supervisor and Vicious Delicious) , Shpongle (Nothing Lasts...

Gravity being a very affected party of this game; you need to understand how the physics of this game works if you want to play it properly.

I can say that this game is very enjoyable as a ""I have spare time and I'm not doing too much,"" type of game. Almost like listening to music or watching Netflix while you're idling in your game server trying to get rid of that TF2 item you don't like.The only problem I have with this game is the Multiplayer. You have to set up your own server and typically invite people to your game, because there are not a lot of random public servers to play on. They are all typically private for friends or a group of people. If they had a matchmaking feature like Left 4 Dead 2 does, then that would make Multiplayer a bit more appealing in my eyes.Overall, I do enjoy this game, and hope that it's carried out in development further than what it is now.Wonderful potential here, just don't end up like a lot of other Early Access games that are, very unfortunately, ""In early access"" for two and a half years and never actually goes anywhere often. Yes, that was a shot at DayZ. Sorry!"

I suffer pretty severly from panic attacks (often leading to mild seizures) from time to time, mostly at night after dreaming about situations more ♥♥♥♥ed up than Im willing to describe.  I wake up sweating, my chest in a vice, diaphram contorted demonically, mind racing, heart about to explode...  I stumble out of bed, into my chair and manage to flick on my audio interface, boot up my computer and log in to steam.   Distance only takes a few moments to start and the music is soothing.  I always start with the first track, I forget the name... Broken Symmetry?  Regardless, the slow build up of piano, filter-modulated white/pink noise and easy curves wittle away at my stress.  Upon finding a sense of calm, meditative trance begins to set in.  The beat kicks up and I find myself no longer panicking, but positively charged, ready for challenge. My adrenaline flips polarity to positive and I am back to being ME.  No worries, no stress, no job, no lonliness.  Just pretty lights and sounds, a simple goal, and a sense of peace.I have not tried any workshop tracks, but I would love to see something in the form of straightaway tracks like the first few, with little challenge and more empahsis on cinematic thrill.Initial Review-------Playing this game is what I imagine driving a Tesla might feel like.Sexiest sight/sound match in a racing game since Extreme GAdventure needs to be more.. erm, adventerous... I loved the build up intro but it was the same as arcade otherwise.  Maybe there could be some enemy responsible for the obstacles, cliche but it would be cool to have some depth. I would also love to see some sort of upgrade system or at least some aesthetic customization, it would make 20 dollars seem acceptable.  I got it on sale at 15 and it's still a stretch of money at this point in the development, that being said I do not regret the purchase at all.Will update."

People are lost to the unrealistic stupid fun genre that is arcade racers, Distance by Refract Studios didn't only remind me of that same rediculous fun I used to have in arcades, but grew on it in so many wonderful ways.in 2011 the small indie studio released Nitronic Rush, a fun experiment using a physics engine built entirely by them in C++, and it was awesome. I got my friends to download it and they all loved it, it was such a refresher from the generic races that have been coming out in years past, the ammount of insanity involved is something I hadn't dealt with in a long time.Then came Distance, made by the same studio under the name Refract, and it gave me that same rush as the first game. The game has cars going at a rediculous speed, set in a world similar to that of Tron, with flying cars, stunts, an amazing multiplayer and one of the most challenging but entertaining single player's i've been offered in a long time.If you're on the edge about this game, just know you wont be dissapointed, Distance is one of the most refreshing experiences i've had in a long time, and im confident Refract Studios can only make it better."

Unfortunately, even if they flesh out the `story mode`, there is little to do in this game other than proceed to the end of each track, each of which seems to be composed of cookie cutter components.  There are no deeper goals, no unlockables, no sense of progress, and no sense of reward.  There's no chaining combos, or learning new moves, or devious AIs, or special challenge levels, just an endless runner that happens to have wheels and loading screens every 3-7 minutes.Am I in love with the controls, the moveset, and the motif? Absolutely.  Can I spend hours browsing the workshop for more levels to add more content? Yes, but custom levels alone cannot expand the experience to the point that this game graduates from tech demo to actual title.  When every level feels like a repeat, and the only game mode is shallow, I can't recommend this as a full priced title.Sure, the game is in early access, and things could change, but the developers seem pretty clear in their direction, happy with the trajectory and `Overwhelmingly Postivie` feedback so far, so adding depth to the game doesn't seem to be on their radar at all.  If I thought it would change, I would hold off on the negative review and see, but I find the possibility highly unlikely, so I'm going to go ahead and say it's not worth the full price, and it probably won't ever be.In short, the gameplay is amazing, there just isn't a game to go with it."

After all, it is currently my favorite game, I play it a ton, it's anamazing game, and it gets updates regularly.I do not recommend you buy the gameright now.  The most recent updates introduced a number of bugs into the previously rock-solid multiplayer, causing occasional crashes.  The updates were rushed in from the experimental build to catch the Steam Summer Sale crowd.  This is understandable, since the game deserves way more players than it currently has.  However, Refract needs to push a few more fixes down the line to flip my review back the way it should be.  At the rate their small team works, this should easily happen within a month.Trust me, this is a game you will want to buy.  This is the first major breakage in stable I've seen from Refract since I've owned the game, so I doubt there will be another one.

While I would like to write out a short story on that, it's just a case of this game still being early in development. What's there is already great, and you're buying what's advertised. Flashy neon graphics that make me feel like I'm playing a GOOD Tron game, if one ever existed. A snappy electronic soundtrack to go with it. Gameplay that needs reflexes just as quick as the car you're driving (exaggerating just a bit, it's actually very forgiving but you'll need to be good with your reactions, because once or twice the game throws an obstacle in your face like a friend tossing a basketball at your face and shouting 'think fast'.)All in all, fun, but STILL IN PROGRESS. The single player is short, but we are told this is because it is incomplete, simple as that. Even then, the developers tell us that they want the campaign to be short, so if there's not meant to be much more beyond that, then likely the game will focus on user generated content (rather interesting level editor and steam workshop support! The editor may be difficult to grasp, not out of difficulty, but out of the sheer amount of options) AND its online mode.Which leads me to the next thing to talk about. Upon selecting the online arcade, the game tests your network capability. Both me and my American friend were told our networks weren't too great (limited connectivity to NAT servers), and his works eith every game imaginable. Clearing up a few ports to host a server is one thing, but being unable to connect to any server at all is another. If we knew which ports or remedies would solve the Network Capability test, then we'd be having a blast. Until then, we can't connect to any servers whatsoever. So beware of this if you're buying the game with a focus on its online.Until it gets fixed, I'll have to shelf this for now. Great game! Can't wait until it improves."

When I play this game, I am constantly being remminded of Trackmania and how the cars felt when climbing up steep ramps and walls.  This game takes it further by adding in a jump feature allowing for some awesome manoeuvring over gaps and jumping from wall to wall like a car ninja.

Speaking of molten metal, the lasers are merciless,and thoroughly awesome. You can slice your car in half down the plane of symmetry andstill recover if you can steer your glowing hunk of car thru a green regeneration hoop.Gameplay is intense but forgiving, even for the casual gamer like me who's a novice atracing games and flight simulators. Skills like the 90° wall jumps, mid-air rotation, cominginto and out of a glide, etc. take practice, but they won't frustrate you into rage-quitting.My only complaint is that it has all EDM/techno-style music, which can get droning andrepetitive (in my opinion).

I'd highly recommend using a gamepad, it's much better than playing with a keyboard for this game.The music, while it's not what I usually listen to fits perfectly together with the game itself and the atmosphere it creates. One of the things that surprised me is the fact that it runs really well on my second, older pc, which means that for such a beautiful looking game it's really well programmed and not hard on resources at all.The level editor is complex, but great once you get used to it. There's a lot of really cool and interesting tracks in the steam workshop already which I highly recommend checking out. It also makes up for the fact that in the game itself there aren't that many different levels yet.The controls are very good for driving, but flying and walljumps are difficult to get used to in my opinion. It's pretty hard if you use a keyboard and still not easy with a gamepad (in my case an xbox360 controller).I highly recommend Distance for anyone who loves racing games and I still recommend to try it out at a friend's for anyone else.I rate this game at a solid 9/10."

Many game modes including random levels and a level editor, and multiplayer support.  Right stick click resets view in-game.This game is now my second-favorite VR game after Elite Dangerous.  It does have a couple rough bits and the campaign is ""short"" though I found it quite satisfying even at the current length.VR enthusiasts will note that there's many interesting VR games but many of them are a pain to set up and operate; bad control schemes, no positional resets, etc.  This game only has one minor problem in this regard: the reset key/button does not work except during gameplay.  This is the only major problem in the game.  Otherwise, all menus can be operated with a controller or a keyboard, a reset button is available on the controller (Right stick click in), and the game is ready to rock out of the box.FInally, there's a very fun random map generator that I am really impressed by.  You can generate a level with any phrase (Try ""rainbow road"") and you get a unique level.  You can play these levels against other people online too!  And there's a POWERFUL map editor included, and any map you download can be played online as well; the game will automatically send the data to other clients even if they haven't downloaded the map before.I REALLY love this game!"

The dark themes, the kinda awkward display, the crazy things happening everywhere; that was not what Nitronic Rush was about. But, as I played, I started to accept Distance for what it was: a masterpiece (that still needs a little work, but that's what Early Access is for).The music is amazing. Like I said, darker than the prequel, but amazing. The first song I heard started of beautiful. Then, it got even better, introducing me to the real soundtrack. I was amazed. I don't even know if there's any way to get the soundtrack, but I want it.The graphics are good. I don't care much about graphics, but in the artistic sense, not necessarily the quality sense, the graphics are better than most. They are able to set the mood so well, and make me feel whatever they want.I haven't even played multiplayer, so I can't comment on it. But the thing is, you don't really need to to get your money's worth. There are a fair amount of levels, and beating them doesn't mean you're done. I've spent hours slowly getting better at Nitronic Rush's measly six levels, and I'm not afraid to admit that I still am. I know, from what I've seen, that I will have the same experience. But wait, there's more! There are a crazy amount of custom levels to get, and I only have a couple, but that's got to keep you entertained! But it doesn't stop there! Trackmogrify offers a track to match your specific search terms, for more crazy fun! Now maybe we're over-glorifying it a bit. It's not a perfect tool, and the levels are never as unique as the community ones, but I still think I could use it a lot.Now let's talk about gameplay. This game can make me rage a bit, but not too much. Mostly it's just super cool and thrilling and sometimes a bit scary. I'm serious, I could compare this to a rollercoater, but I'm not good at analogies. Who gets tired of doing tricks on a cool car in a crazy neon area? Who gets bored while constantly dodging sawblades at hundreds of miles per hour? Not anybody I'd reccomend this game to.We've talked about music, graphics, replayability, and gameplay.

Set in a dystopian world, with futuristic backdrops and a car that looks gorgeous, you'll find yourself spiralling off track because of the pretty neon lights and flashy colours in the world around you.You'll spend most of your time pulling off incredible twists and rotations just to keep yourself on the track, and get that great time on each race. Even if you do fail miserably and miss a jump (which will happen a lot), you can rely on the games most interesting concept, flying cars. which, in a pickle, can get you out of any tight situation.I have to admit, the adventure mode is a little light at the moment, but the community is large and always coming up with new mind-bogglingly difficult levels for you to challenge yourself on. You can never say ""I have no levels to play"", because there will always be something strange and interesting for you to play.Even in it's early access state, Distance is a game that should be on everyone's radar, and I'm rather excited for the official release.

For a game in progress - It was absolutely worth it.I had so much fun sitting hours and hours, playing community levels, playing on online servers, just flying around in my car, doing very fast sprint levels with style and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of every level. This is the core of this game and it was very succesful, and I believe this is going to be a great game. Besides... this one thing.Playing all of those community made levels really made me want to make one of my own. The level editor is probably the most confusing editor I've seen in a while, even after the tutorial it took me a lot of time to position things correctly - like checkpoints or particles. Sometimes they don't spawn where you put the cursor if you build too high, other times it just takes years to position them right. Just like the teleporters - it took me ages to understand how they work, and how to position them right.Refract studios, you have an incredible game and an amazing idea, but you have to help us keep expanding it. There must be ways where we could make this editor more simple and more explanatory (If that's even a word) .

The sense that you are always progressing and improving your game is far better to me than the techincal jargon many other racing games are all too familiar with. There is also a sense of hidden lore (note that I haven't completed the campaign mode yet) because of the aspect of driving alone in this highly futuristic city. There are certainly some secrets hidden away in the plot for this game. It is also challenging enough to keep me on edge and the custom soundtrack feature is very cool if you have a specific taste in music in your games

,Recommended,233610,23947144,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Gatwinder,"Gameplay-wise, the game is less about racing, more about finishing levels as fast as possible. There's a difference. The base levels are excellent, the learning curve is easy, and the community made levels range from terrible to amazing with the majority (in my opinion) being amazing. More often than not, you'll be driving through these levels and resetting the entire race from the beginning if you die once, as most high score badges involve perfect runs. Oddly enough, I found this game almost as relaxing as Euro Truck Simulator. Almost.Visually, this game is very appealing to me. Think Tron. There's an in-game option of adding your own playlist which literally involves just linking a folder on your C:/ drive so the game can access the path, which I think is priceless. The base story mode can be done in an hour, so if  you want to get the most out of this game, check out the community made levels and the soundtrack the level-makers provide. Aside from that, the sandbox level editor is confusing to me (as all level editors are, I'm just not of the right mind for them) but it seems easy enough for other people to make some really beautiful levels.Improvements? I think this game has an excellent concept and would love to see up to 4-person local co-op, but I can only dream of a day there were more mass local co-op in many other games. I think the online servers could be improved by establishing P2P servers instead of player hostings for the sake of consistency and ease of use. Last, I think there should be a lap-based mode for legitimate racing as it would draw a more competitive crowd to this game, would mitigate the severity of dying, and would further promote the use of the car tricks to get ahead of other players via boosting (because I get the feeling items, like in Kart racing games, will not be added at this stage of development).Come to think of it, if this game had a mode that functioned like a Mario Kart game for the sake of lap or single stretch racing, but kept the gameplay mechanics and visuals as-is, I'd♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants and proceed to buy a 4-pack."

I can't say too much about it as I haven't played a lot, but from the time I have played, I've really enjoyed it. Here are some pros and cons to the game:Pros:- The music is really nice. If you're into any sort of electronic music, the game has some decent songs in store. If you don't enjoy the songs the game provides, it's simple to choose your own songs from your computer- Good levels. The levels are fun, fast-paced and keep you on the ball constantly. It's easy to get caught up playing many different levels without realising where the time has gone- Fast-paced. This game is incredibly fast-paced. Every single second counts and misjudging a jump, a turn or an obstacle can be very problematic. This makes it very fun as the level of focus required is great.- The community. The community is constantly creating new levels and this provides all kinds of fun, with new designs constantly coming out- You can create your own levels. If you want a break from the action, you can create your own levels to submit to the steam workshop for you and other people to play.Cons:- The design capabilties of the cars isn't too expansive, but the design of the car doesn't really matter, but for those who like cosmetics, this may be somewhat annoyingOverall, this game is really good, and I'd recommend buying it in a sale as the price is a little much.

,Recommended,233610,29618519,Posted: 31 January,all,Pretty Good,"Distance is hard to describe so I'll keep this brief. It's nothing like well-known racing games. It is far removed from Wipeout, F-Zero and any other racer that comes to mind. The closest comparison would have to be the Trackmania series, since both titles are all about getting through courses at the fastest time and have truckloads of user-made content. But Distance has deeper gameplay than Trackmania, and isn't about chaotic multiplayer challenges. Distance has more in common with platform games than racing games, and is superficially comparable to the day stages of Sonic Unleashed except that unlike that pile of garbage, Distance is an amazing game.As pointed out by others, if you are unsure of what you are getting yourself into, try Nitronic Rush. A free predecessor to this game."

It's everything great about video game car physics, plus more.  You can jump, you can spin, you can fly, and for the most part you have the freedom to do so whenever you want.One of the greatest things about this game is definitely the freedom.  I don't like when racing games are just a track you have to go fast on.  In this game, though, if you get bored of the normal drive you can jump off the side and drive over all of the buildings and props alongside the track.  Granted, in the game world there aren't going to be a lot of extra places to go, but still.  Navigable scenery is a plus.There's also the unnecessarily entertaining aspect of it where you can continue to drive after having your car sliced in half lengthwise.  That's a bit of an oddball feature that makes for some fun."

Create a few different playlists from the workshop maps and have fun playing wiht friends online or make a public lobby so other random players can join in on the racing/parkour fun.Side note: some people might say Distance's MP is nonexistent, but those people would be wrong. What is true; is that you have to be on at the right time zone to be able to find people hosting a server or have a group come in to play with you.ALSO!!! Do the tutorial!!! I know lots of people might hate or would want to skip it, but it'll help largely in the long run. You might fail a lot your first few tries, but trust me. You'll get better.

,Recommended,233610,32691218,Posted: 23 June,all,ZipionLive,"Daaaaaaamn this one is good ! If, like me, you like the design and atmosphere, and sound design of Thumper but you don't have the reflexes of a robot, this might be the game you were looking for. Not that it has no challenge - it actually gets pretty hardcore on the latest track now available - but its driving game mechanics is by nature more forgiving than Drool's core gameplay based on pure rythm.The game's motto and description describe it quite well : it's a survival racing game. All you have to do is get from point A to point B, but many traps will be laying around on your path. Lazers, saws, grinders and walls popping up 10 meters from you are the most obvious, but the track itself gets pretty tricky. The road suddenly stops ? Well, might as well ride a wall or even the ceiling, the gameplay allowing jumps and various methods for controlling the car mid-air and even flying on some portions.But what impressed me most is how deeply the music fits what happens on screen. Unlike Thumper, Distance is not a rythm game and as such music doesn't directly come from your actions - though sound effects are really well integrated. But it is still highly dynamic with music dynamically changing to fit the atmosphere of the track, getting more violent as things get tricky or more minimalistic and strange when the track allows for contemplation.Note : the game is currently in early access, but the gameplay is already perfectly balanced and probably matches the final product. Developpers are now adding tracks to make the campaign slightly longer, but a track editor is available as well as steam workshop, meaning the content is already almost infinite. Which means there is no reason not to jump in already !"

You won't regret it), lovely soundtrack (want this as a DLC or free update once it comes out of beta), and even a full fledged track editor with some of the most fine control over the course I've ever seen.It's also great that the controls are completely customizable. You can change the accelerate key to numpad 0 if you want. Another benefit is that PS4 controllers will work wirelessly without needing to use DS4Windows. All you need to do is pair it. (If you put ""PS4"" in your control scheme name, you'll see PS4 button prompts on screen) Other games should let it work without wrapping it. (If you wrap it with DS4Windows while wireless, you'll get a lot of double input)Played levels that absolutely blew my mind, and others that made me want to get some airtime with my PC. You'll never know what you'll get. It's great.The editor takes a lot of time to master, but once you learn the ropes, you'll be making fantastic tracks. Again, I've never seen such fine control over it.There are annoying bugs, but it's still in beta and I respect that. However the upsides of this game greatly outweigh any negatives. If a 970 can run this on max graphics no problem, then you shouldn't have much trouble.Would I recommend? Absolutely. Buy this."

Distance puts you in control of a vehicle that can fly with wings, has jets on all sides, can wall ride, jump, flip, and do anything in between. The controls feel fantastic, the music is amazing, the enviorments are immersive, huge and explorable.There is an adventure mode that acts like the tutorial and tells the story of the game (which is actually quite good, especially when you realize it's being told through a race track), however the real fun begins when you enter the challenge maps of the game. The developers respect player skill and are not afraid to give you a real challenge. Add in community levels and steam workshop, and you'll have replayability and new maps forever.I can't love this game enough, if you feel on the edge about it, I'd highly reccomend trying out Nitronic Rush. It is free and it is the predecessor to Distance. It functions relatively the same as Distance, and will give you a feel for what you can expect from Distance.

The immaculate child of Tron, F-Zero, and dubstep put together. Ever since I got hooked Nitronic Rush (the game's free predecessor coded entirely out of C++), I have been waiting for a true sequel or at least multiplayer of some sort. Then I heard about the Kickstarter for Distance Alpha and I was ONE DAY LATE!!! The game has been in development ever since the last Nitronic Rush update in 2012, maybe even before that. And now they release this game as Early Access? Hah! This Indie game is more full and complete-looking than many AAA titles on the market today! Distance is practically the only game I bought on steam for full price, because I think it is worth the full $20.(Note: in the world of $60 AAA games like CoD, $20 for a multiplayer game like this is pretty darn good)GameplayDistance is ""racing"" game but most of the time your objective is to simply survive the track. Fall off the beaten path, and it is up to you to get back on. Your car has boosters, rotational thrusters and even wings, but that doesn't make it easy. You are constantly riding on walls, doing tricks off jumps, keeping track of gravity, and avoiding evil robotic obstacles. These include but are not limited to: giant buzz saws, rollers, spikey rollers, lasers that cut your car in half, robots that fly ahead of you and land in your way, walls that pop up from the ground, and my personal favorite: the lamp post.The faster you ride on a wall, the more you stick to it. When you make a checkpoint, your overheat-meter goes down and your car is regenerated if it got cut by a laser. You can also reduce your overheating by landing tricks.The game supports singleplayer and online multiplayer (an upgrade from Nitronic Rush), sports a user-friendly level editor, and even allows splitscreen with gamepads (a nice touch). Downloading community levels is easy via Steam Workshop. There are the normal racing game modes, and some different ones like ""tag"", and ""speed and style"" where doing tricks will reduce your overall time.FlavorDistance would be nowhere NEAR what it is today without its awesome, intense flavor! The setting is very Tron-inspired. As you ride down the colorful circuit-y roads which twist and turn through the cybernetic cityscape, you can't help but admire the fact that everything is flashy and genuinely cool. Even some community level creators add a different flavor to the game with their levels; they will thrill you with all manner of trickery. Many things that light up in the game pulses with the intense beat. Which leads me to another topic:The Music. Oh God the music is amazing. It falls in that dubstep/techno genre. It blends SO WELL with the visuals of the game. And lemme tell you something: I hate dubstep, techno, or whatever it is with a PASSION. But for some reason the music in Distance, its just different. I can't explain it... but it sounds great.Distance, by the way, is appropriate and available for all ages. There is no language, gore (obviously), or even words spoken by a person. The community level designers are clean. You don't even need a mouse to play.I love Distance. It should be clear to you by now. PLEASE BUY IT!! The one downfall of this game, (mainly because it is in early access) is that it lacks a full player base, sometimes I cannot find a multiplayer game at all. It needs more players to survive. I feel this game can become a prime example to the gaming community, of how Indie games should be developed, put on Early Access, and released. That is why I recommend Distance to every gamer.TL;DR: Buy Distance."

Naturally as the predecessor of that game, I'd expect just as much from Distance, And they delivered. not only is there a stronger sense of speed, they also enhanced the engine, allowing for some crazy gravity-defying roads and unique obstacles that launch you, explode you or just plain cut you in half and let you struggle to the next checkpoint. Now I'm not saying the game is perfect, there are a few tiny things that bug me. First of all, the colors don't seem as extravegant and intense as I remember them in the first game, also it get's anoying randomly exploding because you are riding along the wall to just barely pass by a sawblade.

It has a short adventure (story sort of) mode that's going to be expanded in the future, right now it functions as a bit of a showcase and tutorial but it looks like it has great potential to be a really unique single player experience. It has workshop support so there's a whole bunch of user made tracks to download for the various game modes, which I think is one of the best parts of this game. You won't get bored with a lack of tracks any time soon.The only slight problem I have is that there don't seem to be very many online servers (4 is the most I've seen, 3 being passworded) but I imagine this will be remedied once the player base grows."

How to describe it?If I were to summarise it in one sentence, it would be ""It's like Dark Souls and Tron had a baby, and the baby was a game which was allegedly a racing game but was actually an adventure game where you play a car in a post-apocalyptic cyberscape"".  Which is certainly an idiosyncratic description, so perhaps I'll go into more details.Graphically, it's gorgeous.  The art design is incredibly strong and the different areas of the city feel very distinctive - and the challenges you'll encounter vary based on sector.  The audio is likewise near pitch perfect.  The controls are tight, and the game always felt fair.  Yes, I died a lot in some sections, but it always felt like it was something I'd done wrong, rather than the game punishing me for bad luck.  That's high praise and speaks well of their design ethos.As it stands, the game is somewhat lacking in content.  I burned through Adventure mode in about an hour.  It was incredibly polished and I encountered no bugs - it's just not very long.  So if you're looking for a full game, hold off until it's out of Early Access.  However, once it's finished and if it lives up to the current high standards, I would freely recommend it."

Best advice is keep calm and pay attention. As difficult as this gets in Distance its key. Theres a way I feel that a Hotas Dualstick controller system would do a lot better with this game than a Keyboard or Xbox 360 controller would. Thats the negatives so far.Positives are quite a few; Take Tron, a light touch of the Horror genre, and the Matrix Highways and the portals from Dystopia and you have Distance. The in game suspense gets quite affective at times. I put down the campaign a few times just to get my head clear from the in game 'stressors' but once I figured out what I was doing its quite fun. I enjoy racing games and this made my engine purr. Refract, I salute the skill put into this so far. Glad to be supporting you know, hopeful for your bright future.10/10"

Two problems: 1. The boost doesn't really feel like much of a boost, in many areas there is not much of a sense of speed, so when I boost, I dont feel it. 2. The rotate mechanics for moving to walls and ceilings feels off using the right stick. I would prefer using the shoulder buttons for rotation.

Maybe you're like me and you just wanted a nifty racing game with bots. Unfortunately, there aren't any bots, and I haven't minded one bit, nor have I touched the multiplayer.The tracks are all beautiful. I've downloaded 75 workshop tracks and all but three of them were fun, some were absolute gems.The controls are doable, I use a gamepad with a custom sort of setup that works for me, you'll find one that works for you.It's almost a puzzle racer, because you have to figure out how to solve the particular sections of particular tracks. And when you do, doing it at super high speed is very fun. That's why you don't need bots; the survival/puzzle racing aspect of the game makes it engrossing enough to where you forget you're alone on the track. That coupled with the awesome soundtrack and the amazeballs neon/whatever tracks makes this a really addictive, fun game.So if you're like me and you're on the fence because of the lack of bots, go for it. Price-wise, I bought it on sale. I'll almost certainly get 20 hours out it though what with how many community maps there are, but I'll certainly get 10 satisfying my 1$=1hr rule.

Playing through the Adventure mode was very painful. Took too long to train you on the controls and I felt like it was holding me back. Ended up saying screw it and when into arcade mode. Man was I at home there. Fun times and let me free to play and enjoy. Played a few tracks and decided to not ask for a refund. Also very happy with how well this runs on my Linux Gaming Rig with a Radeon 7870 and open source driver.

Then I found Distance.Distance, for an Early Access Game, has almost all the characteristics of a full release. While some parts still yet have to be implemented, such as the complete Adventure mode and the replay system, it is made up for in other areas. The graphics and the soundtrack ARE AMAZING. One minute you're driving on an eerily quiet road, and all of a sudden you have the hard-hitting beats bearing down on your eardrums as you start finding yourself jumping through portals and trying not to explode into a hundred pieces. That's hard to find in a game nowadays.Multiplayer isn't that great of the moment because of the little number of players online, but if you do get to play with someone, it's great fun.Run out of maps? The community's got you!

It feels like Wipeout 2048, Burnout, and Trackmania had a strange love child. Yet somehow, Distance manages to be something all it's own.If you're a fan of over the top racing games or the arcade racers of the early 2000's, you'll absolutely love this game. The levels created by the developer are well thought out and look incredible, and the large number of fan made levels are quality from what I've played thus far. Refract does a great job integrating fan made levels into the different online and offline modes. Distance nails that neo techno vibe that looks equal parts Tron and Amplitude. The levels also pulse along with the music, which is a nice touch.There is something viscerally satisfying about the controls. A huge component of Distance is mastering how to ""jump"" from one piece of track to the next. Tilting the car, and learning how to work the controls is a fun uphill battle. I've played many games in this genre, and none of them handle the way Distance does. There is also the way the car starts to fall apart in between checkpoints. The sense of speed gives me flashbacks of F Zero, but the arcade style controls are much more remeniscent of Trackmania and Wipeout.If there was one criticism to be had for Distance's controls, it's that the drifting mechanic doesn't feel right. You don't really need to drift because of how the game works, but my brain is so programmed to from years of playing racing games. It feels like the game registers any attempt to drift at any speed as the same thing, which is a little frustrating. Also, I think Distance would really benefit from a ""bump left"" and ""bump right"" function. The game feels a lot like Wipeout to me, and without the ability to double tap to move out of the way of an obstacle, something just feels a little off.This is all nitpicking though. Distance is a phenomanal game. If you love time attack or arcade racers, I highly recommend picking this up. It's the best early access game I've ever played, and probably the best racer to ever come out of early access. This game will only get better over time. Better to pick it up now than when it's $40 or $60 in a year. It's worth every penny."

It has enough base mechanics with the thrusters and jump. Which by themselves are simple concepts but the creativity put into the dev made maps make all the levels feel unique and fresh. But creative is a word that needs to be saved for the community made maps. This game has easily the best set of available community features since forge in halo. Most of the time you spend in this game will be constantly trying out new community made maps that range from recreations of iconic race tracks from other games to things seen in film and tv series. Not to mention this games soundtrack is stellar. While not effecting gameplay to an extreme it adds an atmosphere not felt in many other racing games. There are not a ton of games that impress me with their score ad this is definitely one of them. Only downside to this game that I see is the the graphics aren't very clear at points and the gameplay can be a little repetitive if your only playing on similar dev maps or player made maps. This game is decently more of a game to sit a relax to. The intense hard levels can be interesting but a lot of times it can just feel frustrating due to the sheer amount of controls for your vehicle which makes deaths unsatisfying a lot of the time. This game has a rhythm to it that I like in the well made levels, but you will definitely waste your time on some bad levels. This is an above average racing game with excellent community features for me this is a 7/10 for the amount of things you can do with the community features which is what holds it up."

If you like what you see. It feels as cool as you can probably imagine. It doesn't get dull.The only time it gets dull is when you start to memorize a track too well. So? Download a bunch on Steam Workshop. There's like 5 more tracks every week.Some of these tracks will suck and I still don't know how to get rid of those ones. But most of them are pretty good.

Think if Audiosurf had more freedom, and a more intense third-person-car-timed-race feel.I look forward to future updates, and will keep playing the game, because it hasn't lost it's replayability yet.Cons:Not many from what I've seen.If they had to improve on one thing, it'd have to be the controller navigation on the ending screen showing all the end scores and rating of the level.Maybe being able to include your steam music library and playlists, as I'd love not to create another folder for every album I download or buy, just to sort through all the music I have, which is over 2700 songs.It'd be nice to have a browser for desktop music, as the navigation to your music is dependent on left and right movements of the dpad or the arrow keys, having to find the right song is a tedious process, having to copy paste in the text from the Windows explorer top text bar, EX: C:\Users\*username*\Desktop\DistanceMusic."

The movement mechanics of the car are actually suprisingly intuitive after the first few times that you use them, and these enable really cool tracks. Seriously, the tracks in this game are tons of fun to race on, even if you die a lot.And that's another thing: dying. Dying is quick and easy and can be self-triggered if you find yourself in a bad situation. I don't know how common that is in racing games, but it was quick enough that it didn't kill the pacing as long as I didn't screw the pooch on driving too hard. You'll lose SOME time, obviously, but it still feels really quick and easy.At this point, the story is barely developed, but that's not a huge problem. The game tends to tell its story through the environments anyway, and it's amazing to me how well it manages to convey unease or awe through the use of music, noises, and visual effects.Getting new tracks off Steam workshop is really quick and easy as well; you can even do it from the Steam browser in-game, the game will check for new levels, and you can play pretty much instantly.If there's any complaint I could make about the game, it's that the developer's levels (the official levels) are a bit too easy overall, and there's not that many of them. To get a real challenge I had to look to the Steam levels, but the community is really pretty good, so you can find a lot of difficult and inventive levels on the Workshop.So, in short, if you like racing games, I would say Distance is good value right now even in its unfinished state; it's a barrel of fun and provides enough content (by way of the Steam Workshop) to keep you entertained for hours."

,Recommended,233610,13336280,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,Nite_Traveler,"This game is really, really fun. I'm not big into racing games, but watching the trailer wowed me enough to buy this one without hesitation, and I don't regret it. I was psyched to see the game run perfectly on my Nvidia Surround setup without any tweaking, and this made the experience all the more immersive.I started with Adventure mode which moves you through the levels, learning the controls a bit at a time. For the most part, they're very easy to pick up on, and extremely fun to put into action. You can boost your car for added speed, jump over obstacles, and even sprout ""wings"" and start flying, for limited distances. You're also able to flip the car 90 or 180 degrees onto other tracks. All of this while racing at breakneck speeds on a psychedelic course full of deadly lasers, blades, and other obstacles. Checkpoints cool your car down and save your progress, and there are some other cool effects that I won't spoil. The game kept me constantly surprised and I was on the edge of my seat, thrilled after surviving obstacle after obstacle, going faster than ever. It's seriously exhilerating to play. The soundtrack only adds to this - driving beats that match the style and pace of the game perfectly. I would like to find out where I could buy the soundtrack, though I was able to find a previous album for the original game on the artist's Bandcamp page. Really excellent music!The one downside that I've found to this game is that some of the flips you have to do are pretty unforgiving. I thought I was doing well with them in one particularly flip-heavy track, only to reach a point where I died dozens of times trying to get it right. Gravity was just not allowing me to reach the other side of the track before falling into oblivion, and I think it's because I had lost my speed from earlier in the track, so continuing from the checkpoint wasn't working. I had to back way up and speed up from there, and then I made it. Throughout the levels, there are a few particularly difficult moments like this, and while I've gotten better at them, they can still take you out of the exhileration and into frustration, if only until you get past them. But just like any game, you learn a bit more every time your car explodes, and mastering those techniques and pulling it off feels really, really good. I would boil it down to this - if you think you would enjoy the survival part of ""survival racing"", than this game is for you. If the thought of watching your car explode over and over while you lose any chance of beating your best time sounds annoying, you may want to look elsewhere. But you'd be missing out!Not all of the traps are a bother. The lasers and blades are awesome. Not too hard to avoid with some deft maneuvering, and even if you do get sliced, it's pretty cool when your car is cut in half but you still make it through the checkpoint (and your car regenerates). Great concept, and it adds to the excitement of the racing by making you think, how the hell did I just survive that?I've started on the time trials and those have been fun too. There are also a few other modes, plus custom levels that others have built, and that you can build yourself. I look forward to checking those out. For $16, I feel this game is a steal. Definitely has a lot of replay value and would be a fun game to share when friends come over. I'm happy to see that the devs plan to release this on PS4 next year. It's definitely worthy of a wide audience."

The answer is... yes. Not only did I get it, I got far beyond my expectations. This game isNitronic Rush 2.0and hot dang, is it worth the money. It's stunning visuals and flawless gameplay alone make it worth the money. After the disaster that was last game I bought that happened to be Early Access (StarForge), I was a little paranoid, but once I swallowed my fears and picked this up I realized that this is a shining example of an Early Access game done right. While in its current state it may not have the most content (The actual campaign itself only lasted me about 45 minutes) doesn't mean it isn't worth the buy. The game itself in its current build is incredibly stable and beautifully optimized. I was able to run it on ultra while managing to stay at a constant 60 FPS with no problems, which is rare for an Early Access title. Now most importantly, the gameplay. The gameplay itself is incredibly enjoyable. Anyone who has played and enjoyedNitronic Rushwill agree. Basically its parkour cars. Carkour? I don't know. Anyway, driving in a long Tron esc environment with everything out to get you is amazing. It goes as far as standard-y obstacle-y road blocks, to giant, glowing CIRCULAR SAWS, to laser beams all trying to kill you in one happy package. Speaking of the laser beams, they are by far the most enticing obstacles I've ever seen. Whenever you come into contact with one your vehicle will get cut accordingly. Not even joking. It's like Metal Gear Solid Revengeance: Car edition. Whenever I saw one I always had a little debate in my mind, ""should I just risk it and get cut in half just so I could look awesome driving a now cut in half car?"" (the answer was almost always yes). This made the game enjoyable and added quite a bit of variety. There is even a bit where there is zero gravity, which for me was a magical experience to be able to just admire the graphics while I float through space. This game is worth every penny. Get it.Review summed up:Is really good. Throw money here now.11/10"

76561198041121039,Recommended,233610,14316281,"Posted: 3 February, 2015",all,TovarishGaming,"Ok so I began to get excited about this game long ago when development was first announced.  As one of the seemingly few Racing genre fans left out there, this was high on my list for arcade style shenanigans.  When I saw it up for Early Access, I just had to try it for myself.Firstly, let me start by saying I didn't know it, but I've been waiting my whole life for this game.  The flying mechanic is awesome and it brings a totally unique spin on survival racing genre.  The look is fitting, the soundtrack rocks, and the graphics are modest but sweet.  If you enjoyed Extreme G on the N64 or any of the F-Zero games, or games like them, you should enjoy Distance.  A big thing that's different though that I haven't seen often is what makes it a survival game.  There aren't weapons on vehicles or combat in any traditional sense.  Instead, your faced with a myriad of interesting obstacles to overcome.  Some of it is track memorization but there's plenty moving around and enough nuance that it's going to take on-the-fly skills to get a good time in this game.  Ok, so it's kind of a dream come true, but what's wrong with it?For fairness sake, I need to talk about what I think isn't so great about the game too.  For starters, I think the multiplayer is going to be a tough sell since people have to host their own servers.  That's hard to get people to do even for games where it's expected, like FPS games.  I hope a dedicated few make a nice online scene for the playerbase, otherwise we're gonna have a hard time playing together.  Secondly, there's still something to be desired in the handling.  They've got a really solid base for how the controls feel (I'm using a game pad), but there needs to be some more precision to it.  Everything feels just a little bit soft, so hopefully they can tighten those knobs.  Finally, there needs to be better programming to handle bumping into stuff.  If you full blown crash, you're out of the race, and that seems to work fine.  It's when you ram a wall, or awkwardly get turned upside down, or stuck in a corner, or land funny from flying, that you find yourself pressing buttons that don't help.  There needs to be more protocols for what happens when X fails.  This is of course beta, so stuff like that is already on the to-do list I'm sure, but that will help a lot with the replayability of levels and it will make failure less frustrating.All in all, this game is a solid buy for any fan of the racing genre, particularly those older arcade style games that were focused on external stuff like survival rather than pure-racing.  I will be spending plenty of time in this title.  I think there's a lot of room for improvement but the game has a really solid foundation and so with proper support I'm excited to think we'll get an iconic title out of this one.PS: I'd like to add that they really did a nice job with the mechanics and how they teach them to you.  They took all the advice I see directed towards newer developers (not saying these guys are new, I don't know the company's history) and they used it to their advantage.  The overheating system in juncture with the restoration circles is beautifully simple and very well tuned.  The story mode teaches you all the crazy things you have to avoid in a perfect way.  Very non-tutorialy while at the same time being an excellent tutorial.  - Nice job on the basic mechanics."

The only downside I've found with this game is that the main 'Campaign' or what ever you would choose to call it is very short (took me less than 2 hours to complete), but on the other side the devs have left it to the community to ensure that there's alot more enjoyable playtime through community made maps. The devs have thought outside of the box on this one, and the game is very satisfying to play in general, but I think it lacks just a little bit of speed. I can't help saying this, but I wish I could get a higher top speed at some points.Still -Music is great 10/10Layout is great 10/10Physics are great 10/10Map creator is great 10/10Buy the game, you won't regret it."

The art design and music are great so far, the city has a distinctly Tron-like aesthetic and the music in each stage really brings out the atmosphere. Despite having no story to speak of it's stages string together a visual narrative that not only keeps you from getting bored but brings out a modicum of emotion as well. The tracks are well composed, nothing is unfairly unforgiving and one is rarely left scratching his head while stuck somewhere wondering what he's supposed to do. All in all I'm excited to see the final product.My only major complaint is the controls, or rather the way the game introduces you to them. Early on if you are using an XBOX controller it instructs you to use A to boost and X to jump. And early on this is fine, later you also need to quickly use the right stick which proves difficult. What the game doesn't tell you is that you can also use the shoulder buttons for boost and jump freeing your right thumb to do the tricky bits. But relearning the controls half way through the main game is kind of annoying. (As the game is in development this may all change)"

,Recommended,233610,21541449,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,Zilby,"Distance is, to say the least, a fantastic game. It's got super tight controls, a great aesthetic, engaging soundtrack and a massive wealth of community content. This is a game that I can easily keep putting more hours into since there's a pretty much non-stop stream of new surprisingly high quality courses to run through made by the community. The ""beta"" tag really only refers to the shorter single player mode, as the rest of the game is incredibly well polished and plays amazingly.There are a few downsides:If you want to be good, this game is HARD. But there's also a lot of fun gameplay to master. You start by becoming good at avoiding obstacles, then you get good at using your thrusters to rotate your car in a pinch, and finally you can learn more advanced techniques like using your boost to direct your movement in the air and using your thrusters while on the ground to make quicker turns and stick to walls and such. Even beyond that is far more advanced techniques, but those are really only used if you want to do shortcuts, not really for just going through a difficult course normally. However, if you're not confident in your gaming skills, you can always stick to the easier courses, just be aware that most servers tend to run courses that are on the more difficult end of the spectrum. If that's the case, just find some easier courses in the workshop and set up your own server, there are plenty of beginner players out there that will gladly join you for some races.The servers oftentimes are pretty few, especially in the off hours. I usually find myself starting up a server most of the time, but after a couple of races I'll usually have gathered 5 other people to fill the server. In the really dead hours though, you're lucky to find even 3 people online to join your server (however to be fair, most people aren't going to play this game at 3am EST).There are some bad courses. For every amazing course, there are 3 horrendous ones to take its place. On the bright side, people rarely choose these courses when they're running their servers, so most of the time you only race on the truly exceptional courses (if you open your own server every time, you can of course control it so that you ONLY race on the good courses, but you don't discover any new content that way aside from browsing the workshop previously). What's cool though is that once you race on a course from another server, it's added to your library. If you don't like it, you can rate it negatively and delete it later, but if you do like it it's great because you can just keep it and play it later without any extra steps!Finally, I know that most people won't do this, but playing this game in the first person has been AMAZING. It can make it more difficult to do corkscrews and flips and such (although in some cases it actually makes some tricks easier), but once you adapt to it it truly becomes an incredibly immersive and engaging experience that I could easily recommend to everybody."

Keyboard controls are sorta mushy until you turn off digital input smoothing and ramp up control sensitivity, menu animations just need to stay turned off for everything ever made at all times THANK YOU, and for whatever reason they changed the key for wing deployment.  While we're at it let's just turn off ""Flight Landing Assist"" because autopilot is for the weak.  After that, you're back in control, and the game becomes super fun.The game is still fun with all of this stuff stuck at default, but it WILL screw you over in tight, technical strings of precise maneuvers.It is an indisputable step forward for the franchise.  Everything is more polished.  Everything is smoother.  Meaningful features have been added and implemented thoughtfully.  Meaningless features are nowhere to be found.  This is how sequels are DONE.So what if you haven't played Nitronic Rush?  The music and sound design are superb, and it has very good, and fairly challenging track layouts.  The tracks are a good deal denser and more furious than just about any racing game I've played, F-Zero GX notwithstanding.It falls squarely into a difficulty I like to call meditative.  Nitronic rush was similar in this regard.  It's not insufferably boring everywhere but the corners like Gran Turismo, and it isn't way up there in the unbridled and unrelenting insanity that F-Zero GX revels in.  It chooses a path where you must always remain focused, but never trespasses into mental fatigue.The best advice I can give for you to determine whether or not you like it is for you to play Nitronic Rush all the way through, once, then peruse the hardcore levels a few times.  If you like those, and you like how it feels as you watch yourself progressively improve, you'll like Distance."

You are are a car in a system, getting from one point to the other.  A very simple concept, but the way it was executed in Distance is simply beautiful.The main point I wish to address in this is that the car can be sliced in various different ways from the dangerous lazers found along the tracks, and you can keep going, even with just two wheels! Even the concept of the car flying is invluded in this game, which adds to the overall experience of the game, making is definitely worthwhile.Though the game is not very large, it is a ton of fun and has the inclusion of steam workshop, which adds to the entire fun of the game, constantly giving you more things to do, and explore and make your own tracks to enjoy with.There isn't much else to mention, the music in the game was fitting, but nothing to be really worth mentioning.

It isn't like your normal racing game, of course, you do have a track... because no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherelock, ya gotta drive on something, but the track isn't empty. It isn't a cart racing game either, as there are no weapons except for smashing your opponents into obstacles. What makes this game ""survival racing"" is the fact that the obstacles don't merely make you ""crash"" (which they can do if you hit them at light speed), they can chip away at your vehicle as well. If you cruze through a vertical laser, you're gonna get cut in half. Of course, you can still drive this way, but it isn't exactly a comfortable way to drive, as you've lost all of your previous control.NOW TO THE PROS AND CONSPROS:1. Getting cut up instead of insta death2. Flight, it adds a different dimension to racing3. It tends to run well, and if you're having trouble, just mess around with the settings, and it'll still look beautiful with lower quality graphics.4. THE COMMUNITY TRACKS! Some of them are outstanding, and really fun to mess around in, and the community for this game is amazing.5. CAR CUSTOMIZATION! Stand out from the croud with your garish Pink and lime green car.CONS:1. The car is a bit, floaty sometimes... maybe a drift mechanic is in order.2. Going quickly can feel a bit... slow, IDK why, but... maybe that's just me.3. MORE DEV MADE TRACKS PLEASE! The custom bits in them are uniquely awesome.ALL IN ALLYou should get this game.

But I have to say this is one of the few gems inside of this program. Distance is just plain addicting. I can just spend hours on end replaying the same levels (Or going through the library of community made tracks on the workshop! ) over and over again. The car itself is amazing allowing you to boost, jump, fly and rotate giving you many options for sick tricks that you can do. The teleporters I have to say is another one of my favorite things about this game, nothing is as  cool as doing a flip through a teleporter and dodging multiple blades and lazers before landing it or suddenly being taken to an area with Zero Gravity or where you're upside down. Did I mention that the car also lets you ride on walls and ceilings? This game is fast paced, and very awesome if you can stay up to speed and stick to your reactions as you dodge anything that blocks your path. It has multiplayer already in the game from the get go which works pretty well for an Early Access game so far. The game also lets you customize your car to a limited extent along with an easy, but deep level editor. Also if you were wondering, you can go first person as well! There's no interior just the front of the car but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's tough but cool as hell to drive in that view. Recommend this game to any of your friends if you own it, this needs a larger community to support it!tl;dr: Game is like hotwheels, and trackmania with it's own little twists (Teleporter, and the car.) Very fun, awesome tricks. If you've been hesitant on buying it, don't hold back.I'd give this game personally a 10/10. Can't really find anything I don't enjoy about it. It's one of those fun, addicting little games you find that you can't put down and keep coming back to. Going from highspeed races, to doing sick stunts with your friends, along with making a level or two if you have the creativity and time.

When i was a kid, there was this browser racing game called need for madness. the game is about doing laps and coming in first. You can play in two ways: 1. race and come in first place or 2. destroy every other car. You have a damage bar and a power bar. the more power you have, the faster your car would go and the stronger it would be but it's constantly draining. so there's ramps all over the map and to fill it back up again you need to do tricks much like in distance. This game is like Need for madness and Audiosurf combined. You can also ♥♥♥♥ing fly around. As soon as  i saw the trailer i was hooked. This game has alot of potential.

If you like that you will like this.Distance is a Tron-esqe racing game where you speed along floating roads and fly through obstacles at very high speeds.Gameplay-10/10The gameplay in Distance is absolutely flawless. The controls feel fluid and are very responsive, and I know that I am in control of my car at all times. The gameplay consists of driving along roads at high speeds while dodging obstacles like buzzsaws, lasers, walls, spinning cylinders of death spikes, and so on. While you usually just drive along roads, you also can fly. Everything about the driving and flying is great. There is also a boost system that reminds me of Excite Truck, which was my favorite racing game until I got Distance. Also, if you get cut by lasers, you can still drive with half of your car. That's probably my favorite thing in Distance.Story-N/AThe adventure mode isn't finished yet, so I can't really review it right now.Multiplayer-10/10I haven't encountered any lag in multiplayer yet. You have to get to the finish as fast as possible, trying to beat the other players. However, the other players appear as ghosts and cannot effect your vehicle, making the race into more of a synonomous time trial.Graphics-10/10The graphics remind me of Nitronic Rush, but have a glossy new feel that fits with the atmosphere very well.Overall-10/10For what it is, Distance is a fantastic game. Even though it is essentially a remake of Nitronic Rush, it does everything right. It runs well on lower spec PCs, you can play it on Mac and Linux as well as PC, there's a level editor with workshop support. Just keep in mind that it is a racing game."

Escape into your monitor or span it along 3 monitors or♥♥♥♥♥♥even a large flatscreen, it's one hell of a ride. For me, each level/map/sector has its own unique feel and difficulty.If you play with a controller, it'll be a breeze, however if you're a keyboard user it'll take some getting use to. The controls aren't an instant WTF DO I DO. The game slowly introduces you to new tricks and tips for controlling your sexy little car.The physics glitch out at times for me, when I'm performing wall jumps my car will instantly flip around when I launch off the surface and it'll slide toward the gravitational pull of the map. If you're on a map with a portal and you go backward thru it, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop or sometimes spawn below the map (but you can blow yourself up and try again). The flying mechanics could use a bit of work as well. At times when I deploy the wings off a jump, the car will start rotating and gaining control of it can be tough if you’re on a keyboard.There is a lack of content for this game, but hell, the maps they've got are great and you can finish them in multiple ways with different paths. I've spent some time doing the time trial races and it's really addictive.The multiplayer functionality is good, however I haven't played it much but it is pretty fun (I'll update it as I play more online). There's usually a few (4-6) servers that have games loaded with their own maps. When racing online, there is a time limit, so if you're spectating a new dude you won't be sitting there for hours waiting for him/her to finish.All in all, I pretty sure I missed a few key aspects but nonetheless, it's a very fun game. The graphics are spectacular, the soundtrack is immersive it's a unique experience that I've lost myself in. I really hope the developers make more content for this game, it'd be a shame if they didn't because this software has potential."

It's also the perfect game for VR:  the cockpit provides a wide view not only ahead of you, but beneath you thanks to a glass window in the floor that you'll be using a lot more than you might think.  Like Radial-G, you'll also find yourself looking up through the glass above you to see where the track vertically twists and turns in three dimensions.Runs like a dream (a rare but essential thing for VR games), plays awesomely.

This game will send you swirling though various tracks that loop, swoop, spin, and invert. You can stick to the track however it bends, but this won't achieve any record-setting lap times. To be the best, you must leave the track. You can jump onto walls and other obstacles around the world to find the quickest way to the finish line; you can even jump straight to the ceiling if it's not too high above you.That said, many workshop levels are simple roller coasters, requiring you to hold the boost without letting go.

It's not a racing game, but an obstacle course/run type experience with incredible ambience and graphics.....feels like a young Kubrick if he took the end-movie aesthetics of 2001 and then did Tron.The game's official levels are about 2 hours' worth of gaming but the level editor and the community workshop make this game almost infinitely replayable. The general ambience and neon aesthetic makes this potentially both exhilirating and relaxing at the same time....it's really an addictive experience.About the only negative I can imagine is that there are some later official levels which require a lot of tricks and dexterity. If you don't play for a bit, it can be easy to forget how to pull some of the stunts off, which ultimately requires replaying some official levels to requaint yourself with how to jump from one wall to the next while spinning and hanging upside down....stuff like that.....which if you're in the mood for ""relaxed techno cruise mode"" may not be what you want to deal with. Fortunately there are a ton of workshop levels that cover every possible style and experience the game has to offer.I remain impressed....this may be one of the only Early Access titles I have picked up to date that was both well worth it and which I really frickin' love."

I love games that test your reflexes so this game would appeal to someone who likes AudioSurf, Ballistics (an extreme racing game from the 2000's), Star Wars: Pod Racer or Wipeout. The game play particularly reminds me of Wipeout with tracks that are all twisty and bendy that if you're not careful can really disorient you. Tracks can have alternative routes though there is something within this community that annoys me in that all the top leaderboard players skipped entire levels by flying off the track and skipping straight to the end.One of my favorite features is Trackmorgify which generates semi-random tracks based on the seed you enter. Later I discovered that unlike most games which just hash an entire string and stuff it into a random number generator this one seems to break up your seed into parts and looks for certain keywords to guide the generator. That being said I double dog dare you to beat TeslasExtremeLongMarathonDoubleHelixCorkscrewDescentDownIntoScaryElectricShardDoom from beginning to end without skipping to the end.The gameplay is simple but extreme and reminds me of classic arcade games.I definately recommend this game!"

Also one of those games you can feel like a god in as you recover from falling off the track or just beat that hard map or going fast and not making a mistake.Once you've completed the story be sure to go online to the lobby there should be at least one going most of the time. Same people mostly. They will have the maps and it will download for your own list as well.Has a fantastic soundtrack.Playing online. There is no collision with other players. Would personally like it. Some of the players in the same lobby know how to grip fly pretty dam well. (Where you fly upside down with your grip boosters not using wings) to the point they skip most of the map. It's a skill one am not really interested in. I prefer riding the map unless the creators decided to be a mans gentiles and make dead ends or fake exits or just hide where your supposed to go. Not a fan.I can't really think what is bad about this game it's just simple yet well done but feels like it's missing something's. Maybe collisions and for the story to be finished buts it early access. Also when watching players it's look Dum as they drive upside down n do 100 flips when they aren't.The community are nice enough.All in all it's fun to play now and then 7.5/10

The graphics are great, and everything feels nice and fluid. Like other reviews have said, this game looks like a racing game where you try and get to the finish line as fast as possible, and while it technically is that, the real point is if you can get to the end at all.The only thing that is slightly negative with this game is that the campgain is under development, and is on the short side right now, but the amazing workshop support fixes that. In fact, one of the leading reasons I bought this game is so I could play the workshop levels (Cough) ACCELEERACERS NOSTALGIA (Cough cough).Overall, this game is worth your money and I would highly reccomend it.Also, this game has VR support, so go nuts."
,Recommended,233610,14858165,"Posted: 12 March, 2015",all,Twist,"Distance is a high-octane reaction-based arcade racing game set in what I can only assume to be a computer program with a sick EDM (primarily techno) soundtrack to go with it. A spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, you have only seconds to react to what's in front of you and sometimes not even that much time is given. While sometimes frustrating with no particular payoff other than beating your times, Distance is an exciting game with a cool setting and a great soundtrack.Gameplay: 8.5/10: Distance offers a variety of game modes including a short campaign, arcade sprint, stunt and style races, versus race, and split-screen up to four players. Each gameplay mode, outside of the multiplayer, is mildly lacking in replay value (unless you're a perfectionist and want to get to the top of the leaderboards which I personally could easily see myself attempting). When you enter the multiplayer it becomes an insane race for first, style points, or who can pull off the most wicked stunt. The last time I felt a game play this smooth and fun was Split/Second and that's what this game reminds me of... only if it were set in Tron.Graphics: 8/10: The setting is stunning and the tracks are intense to race on. Neon colours flash past you as you go from 0-250mph in just a few short seconds and the environment keeps up with the action you experience. However, upon closer inspection the environment isn't the most detailed setting, with speed of levels (no laps) and need for concentration aiding in the distractability from the environment itself. The car itself is physically stunning and fun to look at, particularly when you activate the thrusters or flight ability. When it explodes for the umpteenth time, you might be a little remorse at the fact that it constantly splits into the same fractal polygons and rains over the landscape below, but if you can get over that sort of thing you might just find yourself immersed in the reactive world around you, which brings us to our next point.Sound: 9/10: Arguably the star of the game is the notion that the environment reacts to the pumping techno beats and seems to simulate a synesthetic experience. The developers turn sound into visuals which vastly aid in drawing you in to the overall experience. I even found myself reacting and driving to the beat, which for some reason was always perfectly timed to the rest of the level, even if you were to crash with a digitally explosive sound. The soundtrack is genuinely something I find myself coming back to the game to enjoy over and over and over again. The car sounds beautiful and is perfectly matched to its sporty design. I keep returning to the game just to hear the music again and again. I love it that much!Last WordsDistance is a fun game for perfectionists but if you're into unlocks and specials outside of what you purchase, you'll want to look elsewhere. A visual and audible synesthetic experience that draws you in, Distance is the perfect spiritual successor to some of the most fast-paced and intense racing games on the market.8.5/10 - Give it a go, especially if you catch it on sale!"

I usually don't play racing games (I have none on my steam account), but I decided to pick this one up. The atmosphere, the colour, the mystery, and the overall mind-bending aspects of this game make it my favourite game that I've gotten so far.At first glance, it will just seem like a colourful driving game, but seriously, I have found EVERYTHING that I've wanted in a racing game here, it's fast paced, challenging (but not too difficult once you get into it), and certain aspects like spinning around to jump on upside-down surfaces, or suddenly having the gravity turn off and learning to adjust your playstyle make it super addictiveThis game is also packed with lore, but it's never explicitly shoved in your face. The story mode seems to be about some kind of society that released... something, but that's all I've been able to figure out so far. I don't want to spoil anything either, but every detail of the adventure mode is packed with information about what happened. The adventure mode makes me feel like I'm delving into the past, trying to uncover what happened to this society. I've actually played the adventure mode three times now just because of how awesome it feels, it's so fun, and there are a lot of parts that feel so ominous, like I'm watching the end of the world but I don't entirely understand how it happened. The starting cut scene, that just shows the car starting, gives tons of information on the story, but you won't realize it unless you play it through again, and even the loading screens give you a glimpse into what is going onOverall I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Every aspect of it comes together to make a masterpiece. One thing I'd recommend is making sure you have the right hardware to be able to run it, because the game is just so freaking awesome and having any sort of lag would take away from the experience (you can change the visual settings and that does help, but again the game looks so amazing on full quality)10/10, I can't wait to see this game when it's completely finished, despite how polished it is already"

I used an xbox controller as a gamepad, and played in the first person mode. As a small disclaimer, I do not find myself motion sick very easily, but I did not feel any motion sickness at all until I turned on a few settings. There are a few settings in this game that could cause sickness with artificial movement, however these can be turned off. There are a lot of competitive modes, and I do not feel at any disadvantage to others when playing, however, there is a 3rd person mode as well, and different scaling settings if you feel uncomfortable.PROSGameplay works very well in VR.Great visuals and music.The game isnt a normal racer, and does take a good amount of skills in order to complete many tracks (watch a few videos and you will understand.)1st and 3rd person options, and both have scaleable units.Options that may cause motion sickness can be disabled.Information is displayed nice and clear in the car itself, although this becomes a little less readable in 3rd person.Many small details that make the experience very enjoyable.CONSA very small possible disadvantage due to wearing the headset.Difficult to text chat while wearing the headset, no real support for typing in VR. This is more so a hardware limitation than a software limitation, and there are work arrounds. Text box is easily read while ingame, however.Sudden crashes may throw people off since the camera stops instantly and you watch parts go flying."
,Recommended,233610,29131136,Posted: 8 January,all,bnelson333,"This game does a lot of things right. If you like ""arcade"" style driving games that are very responsive (albeit not very realistic) like the Burnout series over say, something like Forza, you'll like this game. It's fast, it's responsive, you don't spend your entire time against the walls and it's generally pretty fun.Graphics are pretty smoothe and visually appealilng, although a bit too ""dark"" for my tastes.Overall, it's a solid driving game and the flying/jumping adds a really fun aspect to the game. But where this game loses the appeal for me is: it just doesn't make me want to play it. There aren't a lot in the way of goals, or trying to master the levels, or things like that. The levels are also uninspiring from each other, they're all pretty much the same thing.It's one of the best driving games I've ever not wanted to play... if that makes any sense.I'm still going to recommend it because they did one thing right that a lot of games don't, and that's the actual racing. It's solid. Maybe make up your own goals and you'll be fine."

I want to see people cutting apex's on turns shaving off 0.1 seconds in a lap to beat a world record not flinging themselves across the map in some insane stunt to get 3 minutes off a lap time.

But I feel it has a way to go.I've got >2.5k hours on TM2 stadium, so anything which is likened to that I'm naturally interested in.And I've probably not spent long enough on it to really judge, but the things that immediately occured to me (comparing it to TMS, as that's my prime reason for being here) are;+ Great graphics; yeah - dig that Tron %$!- Dark graphics - can't see where to go == skill? Rly?+ Interface is pretty slick- But this *is* TM I'm comparing it too..- Controls (using XBox like controller) seem bad; more digial, less analogue. TM is designed for KB, yet it manages to support analogue input sublimely, too.- Physics seem a bit light. This is tenuous, as I admit I've not really played enough to really get the feel of things.+ Flying - Oh yeah; there's a whole shedload of distance to be got from that, if it's used right.- Speed - No; I don't agree so far. Unless you hold boost down all the time (which you can't) it seems a tad pedestrian. Maybe I've just not got far enough into it yet.+ Soundtrack - I really don't like this kind of music.

The graphics were astonishing.there were a few intense and awesome maps and a creative Community so we could use  the workshop. I saw the latest update and started to play it again and saw all those changes. To ability to put in your own music, the boombox mode which turns your car and the world around you in a music synchronicing beatvisualizer, the option to customize the car a little bit , the little detail like the star screen on your car when you are staying at the same spot for a short time... i love all of these ! I realy love such details and i am very very happy that you can see that this game is still evolving, i swear, this is gonna be one hell of a game when it is finished.But the best thing about this new update is the Trackmogrify mode. You just type in some random words, number , sentences , whatever you want...and the game creates a racetrack. Type in stuff like ""rainbow road"" and fell free to have a nice journey on a colourful , rainbowcolored track... type in ""lightning storm"" to get yourself into an intense storm full of lightningstrikes.This mode got rid of a big problem Distance had. After a while you had yourself through all levels and there wasnt much to do. This new mode gives you an incredible, endless amount of new tracks you can generate in less than a few seconds and can be quiet funny. Now Distance isnt just a good game anymore. It turned into a very good game, full of potential. If the designers behind this gem are still updating it in the future and bring even more content out this game will be on my top games of all time, it has so much potential and i can see that the creators have some neat ideas and i am excited for the future.Graphic: 10/10 , very beatiful and uniqueGameplay : 8.5/10 , unique and awesome gameplay, but i feel like there is potential for more and different modes, the new Trackmogrify mode is a good start!Sound: 10/10 , nice futuristic sounds, clear and good qualityMusic: 9/10 , very fitting, has a electronic style and sums up the level you are playing but not much variety of soundtracks BUT you can bring your own music into the game now which is absolutly awesome. The game even responds to your music in very different ways , like visualizers.Variety: 8/10 , thanks to the new gamemode , the workshop and some implemented level you have a nice variety of different tracks, but i have the feeling the game could use some more ""Items"" to put into the world. New traps or stuff like that ;)Story: 4/10 , the game has a short adventure mode but its more like a longer tutorial. There are some interesting scenes , levels and more in it but there isnt realy a good or long story, but this game doesnt realy need one, because it isnt a game which is designed for an overwhelming story but for the pure amount of fun you can have whilst playing it."

,Recommended,233610,22799856,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,TntMatthew,"Distance is a racing/parkour game where you drive a car which can boost, jump, rotate, and fly, and can even drive on buildings and walls, and it's awesome.While the game is in early access, you might want to ignore that tag; the dev team is active, and they plan to release the game before July this year. The game is pretty stable despite the fact it's in beta, and I haven't really found that many bugs, which is good. Adventure mode isn't complete yet, though, and there's still some refinement of the core gameplay mechancis that needs to be done - but other than that, the game's pretty much complete.There's two main game modes available - Adventure and Arcade.Adventure mode is meant to be a short story mode that also works as a tutorial for the basic game mechanics. It's currently incomplete, but the devs are hard at work on it. They don't want to spoil the full story, so they're keeping their progress on Adventure in their private internal build, and they'll release it to the public in one big update close to launch.Arcade is essentially a collection of different modes. Sprint is the main mode, where you have to get from the start to the end of the level in the quickest time possible. Speed & Style is pretty much the same as Sprint, but doing tricks to earn points will give you a faster time. Then you have Stunt, where you have to do tricks and get the highest score; Challenge, where if you die, you're out; and Trackmogrify, where you enter in a seed and the game generates a track out of that. There's also Reverse Tag in multiplayer (more on that later), which is a free-for-all battle mode where you're fighting for control of a sphere that gradually gets larger over time.While most of the game modes are fun, Stunt mode is pretty dull right now. All you really do is 1) fly in the air 2) do a bunch of spins and flips 3) land to score points 4) GOTO 1 until time runs out. The devs were planning to improve this mode AFAIK but unfortunately it might be scrapped for launch as they don't have a lot of time left now to work on stuff like this. Fortunately, they don't plan on stopping updates after launch, so this mode may return in an improved state afterwards.One thing that's pretty cool about Distance is that this isn't your traditional racer where you're restricted to the track -  this is more of a parkour/platforming game than a driving game. There's no invisible walls blocking you from skipping the track, allowing you to come up with potentionally faster routes. The road is really just a basic guide to the map layout, and being able to deviate from that route and come up with your own is pretty much the entire point. It's not covered well in the tutorial or in the videos above, which is why many players seem to miss this. I like this part of the game a lot, though, so I hope it's covered better in the full release (Actually, in the alpha, which I sadly wasn't a part of, they had tips in the loading screens, one of which was ""Feel free to drive on buildings and walls, the roads aren't always the quickest path"" - something like that needs to be re-implemented IMO) so more people are aware it and also that newbies won't call out the speedrunners for ""cheating"" when they're using a skip route.I mostly play Sprint mode, where playing the game itself is really enjoyable. I don't really know how to explain it, though - Jumping between ceilings and floors while dogding giant saws of doom and destruction at high speeds is just a lot of fun for me. I've found the game to be even more enjoyable now that I've learned the skip routes, but I still don't really know how to descibe my enjoyment or why I find it enjoyable. It's just fun.Also included in Distance is a powerful level editor with Steam Workshop support. It's a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do you can make some really cool stuff. Want to see for yourself? Just check out the workshop. There's a ton of excellent community made levels, so if you get tired of the official levels, check 'em out. Even if you're not tired of the officials, check 'em out. There's some great stuff that's been made, and because of that it's pretty much impossible to run out of content.As I mentioned a bit earlier, this game has a multiplayer mode. You can play splitscreen with friends, or you can join online servers hosted by other players, and even host your own. I haven't personally tried the splitscreen mode, but I have played online. When it comes to the multiplayer in Sprint/Speed&Style/Challenge/Trackmogrify, you're not really racing against the other players - it's basically the same as if you were playing solo, there's just other peole there. Stunt is a bit more competitive as you're trying to get the highest score, and Reverse Tag is only available in multiplayer, because it's basically a battle mode. There's no collision with the other players in online, but there is in splitscreen. To be honest, I like the no collision - it's nice that you can't be knocked out the way by other players. It just fits this game's style of gameplay more, where you're really racing against time rather than other players.I wouldn't recommend this game if you want it soley for the multiplayer, though. It's more of a singleplayer game - plus, the servers are player hosted, and that added with the fact the community is kinda small right now, there tends not to be many servers most of the time. Playing solo is still a blast though, so it's not all bad. At the very least, the small community means that it's unlikely to find someone being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and from what I've experienced the community is generally positive and helpful.The graphics are pretty nice, but some of the settings can be really intensitive. If you're experiencing low framerates, be sure to turn off realtime reflections, as that's a pretty big performance hog. There's a few bonus effects, like a stylised outlines option that increases saturation and adds an outline to everything, giving the game a slightly more cartoony look. There's also a film noir effect that makes everything black and white, and a cinematic letterbox option that adds black bars to the top and bottom of the screen to give the game a more, well, cinematic feel.The music is awesome, in my opinion. I don't really know much else to say about it as music is entirely subjective, but I just really like it. I'm a fan of electronic stuff, so it's definitely nice to me. It's also catchy and memorable (to me). As I just mentioned, though, music is entirely subjective, so your mileage may vary.There's also VR support, but I haven't tried that myself. I don't own a VR headset.Pros:[+] Very stable for a beta game[+] The game is just really fun, for me at least[+] There's no invisible walls, allowing you to come up with faster routes[+] Powerful level editor[+] Loads of community-made tracks, meaning it's basically impossible to run out of content[+] Splitscreen and online multiplayer[+] VR support[+] Graphics are good[+] Music is greatCons:[-] Stunt mode is kinda boring[-] The level editor is a little difficult to get the hang of at first[-] A small community and player-hosted servers means that there usually isn't many online games available[-] Some graphic settings significantly reduce performanceSo, yeah. I've spent the past ~2 hours on this review, and it's really long, and probably sucks. But still.I also recommend Distance's spiritual predecessor,Nitronic Rush, which is free and was developed by the same team, among others, as a student project at DigiPen. It's slightly different, but the core mechanics are the same, and it's also pretty fun (though I have not played NR as much as Distance)."

The only downer is that even on my high end rig (5820k, gtx 960, 16gb ram) the game will freeze and stutter on occasion when playing. Might be something to do with the game not bringing all the resources it needs into ram and then looking at the slower ssd for the resources, just a guess.-Update-Well, after nearly a year of playing since I wrote my last review, I have to say... I'm still impressed. The weird hangups have disappeared for some reason, so there's that. Not that I'm complaining... I also find the multiplayer function very nice. It's quite a lot of fun, plus you get to try out a variety of different maps made by other players. I do wish there was more server activity but eh, it certainly isn't the end of the world. The only complaint I have is... well, it isn't the game itself, it's the fact that the soundtrack still hasn't been released for the steam version. I bought the steam version, obviously, and if I want the soundtrack I have to go and purchase the premium edition from the official website. That's kinda ridiculous imo. I'd buy the soundtrack for another $10 without hesitation, but paying another $30 so I can have another useless key is kinda stupid. Just give us the option to buy the soundtrack itself."

I'm digging the concept thus far, but am kind of bummed on some of the supposed, what the community calls, ""skips.""  Yeah, yeah...I've read the arguments for them, and I don't completely disagree with the reasoning.  I get it - you're supposed to be able to explore a bit, climb buildings, etc. But when it defeats the purpose of having the tracks in the first place, then something needs to be done with the levels to make the tracks mean something.  I'm not suggesting getting rid of the abilities of the vehicle, but merely for the ""official"" tracks to be better designed so that everybody is not racing on who can skip the most.  A possible solution would be to make certain checkpoints required, and to map additional required checkpoints onto already known ""skips,"" thus making them more of a ""shortcut"" that happens to raise the difficulty level to shave off some seconds.  That's my opinion, anyway.Furthermore, I very much miss the couch sessions I would have in College playing 4 player battle mode on Rush.  I realize this probably isn't in the plans, but it would be hella cool if this game had something like it.Overall, for the discounted price of $10, I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. Hopefully the finished product might address what I consider an issue, but it seems like the ""community"" has already spoken.  I still prefer Rush, but then again, I paid $50 for it when it came out, so this is well worth it."

I spent almost half an hour just driving around exploring.-Music is amazing, and fits the atmosphere of the levels near perfectly.Con(s):-Needs more occurances of certain things, AKA: The machines(?) that flew around and got in your way, and you had to jump through hoops (Literally) to get past them. Also needs more no gravity areas, possibly even one in the credits level.Overall impression: Amazing game, love it to death. Was everything I hoped it would be and more. 9.5/10."

With the amazing colours, music and intensity then all I can say is that you will love this game.This is like the geometery dash of racing. It's also got some awesome damage system to your car, kind of like phyiscs.I have barely played this game and I absolutely love it already. All I wish for is some server support because right now you have to host the server yourself or find someone else that is hosting one in the browser which is okay but sometimes people can all end up hosting and no one will join due ot it.The only dissappointment I have with this game is the Adventure mode. I am well aware that it isn't finished but when I first saw it I thought I'd be exploring a dangerous city with my car and making my own tracks ( Chosing certain paths) But it turned out to be a bit more like a story mode which is fine with me just wish there was an open world exploration feature like I explained.Another suggestion would be maybe some online in this mode with maybe weapons??? LIke a neon cannon. I am letting my imagination take me away here but it's still a thought.So yeah I definetly recommend this game. Simply amazing."

,Recommended,233610,29346961,Posted: 18 January,all,MatteCrystal,"One of the best Racing games of this generation, It's like and extreme version of hot wheels with an emphasis on skill and surviving the track.If you get anything from this review take these first 2 paragraphs into account. The game is absolutely insane, never in game have i had so many moments that make you want to clutch your heart after a near miss of a saw blade or the gut wrenching feeling of taking a jump to just to realize you didn't take gravity into account and are now falling from the track. Even better yet tho is the feeling of making these mistakes and then through quick and crafty maneuvers recovering from your mess up without simply resetting to the last checkpoint.Now it seems that 3 of the main reasons people down rate this game are as follows. either they think the story is far to short and not worth the money, the online community is to small and have little servers running, or that they cant stand the music. Well let me explain why these should not effect your opinion. Firstly the story mode, Obviously its still incomplete. what they have is nice and when i first got the game a played it a bit and only did the story mode. after about 2 or 3 hours i finished it up and i to had the feeling that it was ok but may not of really been worth the money. However the Story mode is essentially just a tutorial to get you ready for the really great stuff. You see distance has and absolutely insane editor and some of the maps you play will feel worlds different from anything you've play previously. Many of the community levels have a higher difficulty level than the story mode the process of learning and attempting to play these levels are the best. What you play from the community levels will make your opinion of the game jump exponentially high. Now yes the community is small but its a strong community. I've rarely got to the server list and not had 2 to 3 games to join. Its not the kind of game that needs tons of servers. sure it could be a bonus if they had more but everyone is just playing a bunch of maps generally ranging from 5 to 15 mins levels and then rotating to a new level. Finally the music, personally i like it but more then a few people complain that they just cant stand it. Thing is the dev has an option to point the game to your own music library to play in game. With this enabled you'll get all the flashy effects of having the background lights of certain levels sync to your music or if you chose to enable it you can have music bars on your car window that move to the beat of the music. All In all its a great game, keep in mind theres a reason most of the bad reviews have such low gamplay hours. They didn't play the community levels, they didn't bother to learn how to play the game, or they didn't bother play online after seeing so little servers etc. Theres a reason the fanbase of this game while small is so strong and a reason for its 94% positive rating.The developers continually update it and what they have currently is just amazing. I believe the story mode is the last major thing that they will be adding to the game although i could be wrong as they my have even more up they're sleeve. They have many modes Sprint being the most prominent.The Sprint mode is Simply get from point A to point B. generally they'res a clear path and checkpoints to take however if you have the skill, knowledge, or luck you can take your car off track in an attempt to find a shortcut.trackmogrify - This mode lets you input any seed and it will randomly generate a track using it. It actually works surprisingly wellChallenge - a mode where you have nor resets, checkpoints and only one life on small tracksStunt - do tons of tricks to get the most pointstag - get the tag for as long as possiblespeed and style - do the track as quickly as possible with lots of trick pointsAll in all its a great game with tons of replay ability and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new racing experience unlike any they've had before."

Usually when I look to play a racing game I'm expecting fast, adrenline pumping action and while the game didn't lack the action everything added together was a thouroughly calming experience.I feel this game has great potential, and no I don't mean the ""It'll be good someday"" potential, but a game that's already good that can become top notch.

76561198002205513,Not Recommended,233610,26130344,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,GreySavant,"I've been enjoying this game for its Tron-like ascetic. In the game you play a digitized car, zooming around death-dealing obstacles. My favorite part is when I careen into a laser; it cuts my car in half, but I manage to skid my way into the next checkpoint, regenerate, and continue to finish the race.I hope when the game has its official release I'll be able to recommend it, but I can't yet. That's because of the mechanic of track transfers.In most levels of Distance you're asked to leap from the horizontal track to a perpendicular or parallel one. This action feels rewarding when successful, but the trouble is twofold. First, these track transfers are hard to see coming. In some of the community-made levels, signs near and on the track make them clear. However, in many cases they just look like a simple jump or flight is required, and by the time you realize what the game wanted it's too late.Second, gravitational disparity makes the jump feel wonky, and it's extremely hostile to beginners. In Distance, sometimes you're racing straight downward in relationship to ground. Othertimes, you're perpendicular to it, and you're spiraling around so much that the only way to be certain of your position in space it to look down at a compass graphic on your car. If you don't, and you try to wall jump, you'll slew off in a random direction and miss the landing. Given that it's hard to see the track transfers coming at all, I never had time to look down at the compass before making the jump. This results in obstacles that feel impossible to get past the first time, or the first hundred times."

It was a game I wanted to play in VR (and VR only) with my G29  steering wheel.Sadly it didnt work with my wheel and the VR aspect was off center (and I could find no way to re center myself). I did trybriefly with a xbox 360 controller but that just isnt for me and felt...wrong (and keyboard and mouse isnt an option in VR for me).The games still in early access and I acknowledge things are subject to change but if you want to play in VR or with a racing wheel...hold off. I had to refund. I do hope to be able to buy again once it's out of early access (and VR + Wheel works how I'd like it to) but if you're a VR / wheel player...wait a while.I'm sure some players will question this review but I really do only wish to play in VR and with a wheel. I have no interest in any other playstyle nor do I want to spend hours setting the controls (if they can be tweaked) due to the 2 hr refund limit.Like I said..I'll try again when it's out of early access and update this review accordingly.

When you jump, you can't hold forwards because you will faceplant your car, if you hold backwards you do a half backflip landing on your back, it feels annoying.The visuals. Yes I did say that the visuals were good in this game, that's because they are. But it's a trainwreck when you're driving; there's so many things happening around you that you don't know where to go. I often asked myself if I was about to drive into a wall or not. There's also no useful visual assist in the game. Whenever you learn to do a new shiny thing in the adventure mode, it tells you that you can do that thing, but that's also the only thing it really tells you. It doesn't show where you have to go, there was a point where the track split in two and of course, I drove in one of the directions (they connected at the end), but it told me I was driving the wrong direction. Apparently you had to jump up, and fly upwards, in the middle of where the track split.I asked myself ""What the -profanity- is going on in this game"" about every 30 seconds, because it felt like that.Will I recommend it to a friend? No, I won't. Unless they fix some of the issues I won't be picking this game up again.I came into this game with an open mind, but I am disappointed."

This honestly wouldn't be an issue since this game is in Early Access. However, the game has been in EA for years. Too little has happened in too long a time to make this game worth anything more than ~$8.00Also, there are no laps. Once you reach the finish line, that's it.

Games that rely on multiplayer to drive the game but stay in Early access for over a year is unacceptable.At this point there is no reason to play single player. It's an over glorified tutorial for community made multiplayer maps. There are no unlocks of any kind so what is the incentive to play single player at all.

,Not Recommended,233610,15618463,"Posted: 29 April, 2015",all,NitroSoldierX,"5 is an average game to me.So I give this game a 7/10Two things can make it betterPoints1: Throwing in a patch where players don't have to go out of their way to forward a net-code through their router just two get a public game.  That seriously needs to be fixed.  Even if the game is in beta form, most players might not stick around just for that reason.  I would add 2 points if that problem was fixed.2 Find something definitive to seperate Adventure from Arcade. I'd add one point if something that would make us actually want to play adventure, is patched in.  Some reason for why we are where we are and why our cars can do what they do would be nice.  In my opinion, to know more about my car would make me feel more investested in its usage. Every flip, or bounce, or sky manuever would give me higher levels of phychological investment, if I only knew, why these cars could do this.  Sure the game is still exciting.ReasoningNot asking for anything extravagent, but even inputted dialouge to help explain these things seems nice, whatever is done, if anything is done, I'd trust Refract to execute it well. If explaining the car seems like a bit much maybe only give details to us in layers like in the loading screen, not just the car blueprint but the script for what it does in more detail and why it is there with arrows pointing to that specific part. I don't know what those things are marked ""A"" ""B"" and ""C"" for because nothing explains them. Everything else about this game looks and plays excellent.Other than those two things.  This game is awesome.  Keep up the good work, and I would'nt deduct anything from this, but if Refract could maybe dumb down track editing to like a Halo style map creation, or Trials Evolution.  That would be great as well.  I'm not to tech swavey when it comes to this game's level editing format.:::EDIT:::Actual GameplayI forgot to add this in but its about the actual gameplay.  It runs very smooth and with all the good reviews pointing out how great the car you control handles I considered whether my input on that matter was needed.  But I'll do it anyway.I've never played an arcade racer with a car that handles with such precision WITHOUT making you feel like the track controls the car.  This game makes me feel like I control my car at extreme high levels of speed on the tracks riddled with death traps.  There are portals that warp you to another location, or verticalitty.  It took me awhile to figure out I was racing upside down because everything looks right-side up.  And that is pretty cool.  As long as you have speed, you will never fall off the track if you arn't most likely defying the laws of physics.  If you do lose speed, better hope you can open you car doors and use them like gliders.  Not all tracks offer the feature, and on some tracks you can only open the doors at certain parts.  It is executed nicely. There is also a bounce menuever where you spring yourself off the surface to jump over a death trap or get yourself to a higher seperate plane. The tracks can split, or sometimes you can just flyoff completely and find a new path.  This game offers space.  And that is my favorite thing in any racer.  Great handling, and outrageously fun and spacious tracks.:: EDIT, AGAIN ::TLDR:In short now, I did give this games a thumbs up.  The port-forwarding lobby creating situation still isn't fixed at all, which should be the priority.  As I said above, this game wont last long while porting ourselves to make it work is just a nusaince most people wont bother with.  It's still fun to play even solo, but for new comers looking at online play, if you want a good arcade racing game and dont care about playing cool tracks alone, I'll say get it, for $5.  Other than that, I can't recommend.I say repeatedly the game is awesome, that's because it is a good arcade racer.  But I'm a multiplayer guy having me portforward a code for a game that is on it's online lifeline (probably because other people don't want to bother to port-forward as well) is just not worth it. The online on this game will be dead before it gets out of the beta stage.  I'm willing to bet.Save your money."

It sounds cool, but it's not executed well. There is never enough space to do it. There is nothing keeping you on the ceiling, either, so if you mess it up (which you WILL), then you're dead.The flight controls are too sensitive. To accelerate forward, you must hold down the Up Arrow key. That's also the key that causes you instantly dive forward in flight. After going over a jump, there's a good chance you'll kamikaze straight into the ground.And speaking of jumping, there's a jumping feature. Nothing feels more satisfying in this game then boosting off a ramp and pressing the Space Bar to send your car high into air. It feels amazing at first, until you realize that every land area after a jump has a low ceiling, meaning you plow straight into a building for trying to have fun.In the end, the game isn't buggy and the graphics are phonomenal, but the gameplay is lackluster."

Distance on the other hand is a much better game mechanically, but my problem rests with the speed of the game, Levels drag on for ever, the random level generator generates boring stupid levels, and to top it all off it's just plain unfair at times.Another thing basically removed from the series of games is, when I played Nitronic Rush, I would fly around looking for shortcuts, missing as many checkpoints as possible, If you try that in distance you will fail horribly, as the game almost forces you to stick to the path (I know this is a weird complaint for a racing game)4/10 - Good mechanically, boring.

The highly praised audio felt boring and distant, if you will - and I'm into electronic music. Playability is fine, although the car feels very strange, it moves almost like on rails or something. No slipping or anything at all.All of this could be forgiven if only there was _content_. But there just simply isn't. I played through the single player ""campaign"", and it was probably one of the most boring hour of gaming in years. This game seriously needs AI competitors. Someone to tackle into the lasers. More speed, lots of it. Weapons. Explosions. Forget twisting in zero gravity and those stupid jumps into the ghost world or whatever it was. Bring us more action. And if guns and fire isn't the thing here, at least make it clear what is.I'm having hard time deciding what this game tries to be. Is it trying to relax or excite? Currently, it only bores. Not recommended, although there is potential, it just needs a lot more content. A lot.Edit:Some more info about my gaming history. I loved Flatout: Ultimate Carnage (it had great sense of speed).

Because it had mandatory checkpoints you had to go through so you couldn't skip half the track using a jump or find a ""weak point on the track""In Distance, this isn't even remotely the case.  Multiplayer consists of people just jet flying to skip a good portion of the track as a ""shortcut"" which makes the game dull and uninteresting.This sucks because the music and art direction are superb, but it's a complete garbage when it comes leaderboards and time trails.

But in distance everything is just to easy, and it takes forever to find a hard track on the steam workshop, i miss the challange that NR offered me, i miss those tracks like loopy, kill it with fire or insanity rings (just to name a few).In short, distance is way better than nitronic rush in general, but i just that this game would be even better with those things NR did better"

This game will grow on you. It for sure did grow on me.This game has a dev team that listens a great community and is just plain fun. It also has some more advanced skill stuff that allows you to progress to tougher tracks and gives it more longevity. Compared to your average racing game it is much more action packed and is far more innovative. I for sure recommend this game.One of the main things that turned me off early on was the Adventure mode... It seems to be meant as a tutorial, however it quickly becomes too difficult for a newb and starts to feel like some frustrating puzzle game. I began to think the whole game was like that. Thankfully it's definitely not. I had simply strayed into a more advanced skill section than I was ready for.My recommendation for players is to play adventure mode to get the hang of the controls, but as soon as it starts to feel hard switch to Arcade -> Solo -> Sprint or Transmogrify. For the devs, might want to separate the tougher stuff from the tutorial, IMO. And maybe make a skills challenge mode to practice more advanced skills.Another big reason I changed my vote is that the devs and community are very responsive. When I asked for more settings for the Transmogrify random tracks I was sent this address:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19FYXnXRm9SWmzm-KjSx3dThvDLn2rYktWRbaz_Ugu6kIt gives seed words to give me some control over the random tracks.I was also told that I could just leave the seed line completely blank and the game would provide some seeds. I think that is now my favorite way to play. I can even look for seeds that I happened to especially like, or maybe dislike, for future reference.Anyway, I would still like some in game transmogrify settings, and for sure a favorites list for transmogrify tracks...But the main thing I want to say is that the more I play this game and the more my skill improves, the more I really enjoy it."

,Not Recommended,233610,22986223,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,Blueberry,"Distance is an alright game. My mind is more in the middle between positive and negative review.Visually the game looks amazing. Plenty of lights and colors that aren't too bright or hard on the eyes. Thanks to recent updates there's more map variety instead of the same old ""neon lights in a dark city"". Sounds design is pretty good when doing boost, activating wings, landing tricks etc.. and a very robust library of maps thanks to workshop.Here's where the game comes short for me. Ironically, the mechanics of the game don't allow for a whole lot of movement. To clarify, there's plenty of things you can do like fly, flip, roll etc. To make it over gaps, stick to walls or find a shortcut. While all those things sound good on paper they didn't transfer very well ingame. I found that after doing most of these tricks to complete maps faster there was a very familiar pattern going on. Whenever I do a trick it has to be in a verticle movement. When doing a 90* t flip onto a wall it's usually right infront of you, when doing a 180* flip it's infront of you, when flying the track  will always be insight infront of you.What I'm getting at is that there's no real horizontal movement. You can't jump and turn your car left or right with boosters, only up or down. There's no drift mechanic to make up for that lack of boost either. One of the reasons this is a problem is because maps can't have sharp turns otherwise the player will be forced to slow down and lose all their speed. While some people will try and justify this by saying that roads turn and bend left/right. However if the road is turning  for you then that really defeats the purpose and you may as well be on a straight road anyway.Moving on, the multiplayer of this game isn't really anything special. I played this with two of my friends and every race was generally close. While they were close they weren't that tense. The problem was that there was no real way to get an edge over without knowing the map before hand. There's no special boost for doing harder tricks, or any power ups/weapons to slow them down. Everyone is on the same playing fields driving the same looking car going on the same route. While some maps do have shortcuts and different roads to take we would often pass them buy because we didn't know the maps. While some people will say ""just play all the maps and learn them to get better"". If everyone knows the shortcut and uses it then it really isn't much of a shortcut is it?Customization is absent, there's only 1 type of car and you can only change it's color. Customization would have been nice to try and stand out a little more.Verdict: If you wanted to pick this game up to do time trials and solo it's pretty alright. If you wanted a really fast racing game to play with friends, try something else like Redout or TrackMania."
