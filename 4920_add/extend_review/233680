People with no talent can make interesting paintings in seconds, while those with skill can produce amazing picasso-esq poitraits in minutes. You might want to conisder picking up a small graphics tablet for an input device, also.Or you can be like me and just get high and drunk and doodle, and then when people ask what you do all day, instead of having to respond that you're always sitting on steam, you can proudly say ""I, sir, am an artiste"" as you laugh and twirl your mustache."
,Recommended,233680,13812195,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Othrandur,"Black Ink has become my favorite drawing/painting application and I do recommend it, but you should be aware of some of its limitations before you decide if it's right for you.The first limitation is that it requires a powerful graphics card to operate. Don't expect to run this on your laptop, much less your Surface tablet. The lag will make it unusable and some brushes won't even render. If you're looking for something to take with you so you can paint under a tree by the lake, this isn't the program for you, unless toting a massive rig on a picnic is your thing.The second limitation is that the selection of brushes is very limited and not entirely satisfactory. While the software is certainly able to handle them, it contains no traditional brush/knife/spatula effects, giving you instead a number of flashy, but not very useful ""computery"" ones. Bleank's forums include a ""brush exchange"" where you can get another 20 or so brushes, but half of those are just experiments from people who are learning how to define brushes and most of the rest are interesting, but exaggerated effects of limited applicability. You might find about half a dozen actually useful brushes, including an impressive flame brush, a decent graphite pencil, and a nifty comic book hash shadow brush. The forums also contain a few tutorials on how to make your own brushes. How effective these will be depends as much on your own skills and background as on the tutorial itself. Making a custom brush is as much a technical endeavor as it is an artistic one.The third limitation is that there are no geometric tools whatsoever: no lines, circles, arcs, rectangles, spline curves, etc. Their addition would make the program enormously more useful for certain types of illustrations, especially if they were given parametrizable ""organic"" effects (like random variations) in addition to being rendered with the current brush. Given how easy it is to do this (yes, I am a software developer and yes, I have written drafting programs in the past), it's difficult to justify their absence.Also, keep in mind that you will need a drawing tablet and a pressure-sensitive stylus to get any decent results. Mice and track pads just won't cut it. This is true of all paint programs, but not everyone will think about it until they've tried and struggled with an inadequate input tool. I'm using it with a medium-sized Wacom Intuos Pro and it works great. You might consider upgrading to a stylus with tilt sensors because some brushes are tilt-sensitive and you'll get even better, richer results. Because Black Ink works best on large drawings, I recommend a large writing surface as well, though that's largely a matter of personal taste; I prefer to have room to move my arm rather than just my wrist.But even with these limitations, what it does, it does very well. I am particularly in love with its layering feature. In addition to letting you stack backgrounds, foregrounds, and various intermediate slides, it's also great for experimenting on one layer without damaging parts that you want to keep. Which brings up the fact that Black Ink's undo feature works very well. This seems like a trivial observation, but I've used programs that make you want to throw the computer out the window either because they undo too much at once or they can't undo enough.So I certainly recommend this program to anyone who wants a pleasant sketching/drawing/painting program, but I also recommend to Bleank to add more conventional brushes (and why not some more unconventional ones, too?) and a small panoply of geometric tools to make this a more complete and satisfying product."

If you're looking for Corel Paint, you're in the wrong place.  In fact, the more abstracted or impressionist you work, the brighter this program shines.  This is because...2)  This program IS designed to take advantage of the DIGITAL apsect of digital painting.  At its strongest, Black Ink uses algorithems to do what would otherwise be impractical with other drawing programs.  To get the most out of this program, you MUST take advantage of that fact, otherwise you'll wind up frustrated.Because of these two things, you must know that this program is not for every digital painting nor every digital painter.  But if want to make non-realistic paintings that take advantage of the digital nature of digital painting, this is definietely the program to do it on."

I have never used a painting application and been inspired BY the painting application itself before Black Ink.To get a good impression of this product and its developers visit the Black ink forum:http://forum.bleank.com/viewforum.php?f=3The following is based on my personal experience and user feedback I've read in the discussion boards.Be aware that this software is:- In development. Updates roll out on a regular basis, and u2 (developer) is highly responsive to suggestions and issues. Some tools you might depend on may not be included in the current version.  For example, at the time of writing this review there is no smudge tool but it is slated for inclusion.- Highly GPU intensive, but from what I can tell most dedicated gpus work fine.  Check for compatibility.  If you're not super familiar with computers or other painting applications, know that this is unusual.  GPU vs CPU will mean that just because other painting applications work for you, it is not guaranteed that this one will.  It did not work at all on my laptop, but works wonderfully on my desktop.  Try the demo.  Paint something HUGE. ;)- Has node-based programmable brush controllers.  Your typical sliders (color, size, opacity, etc.) are still there, but you can go under the hood to customize your brush by tying the behavior of various brush parameters to the input of your choosing.  There is a lot of untapped potential here.  If you're the experimental type or mathematically inclined, you have to check this out.- Focuses on non-realistic painting, but CAN do realistic just fine.  For either type, visit the brush section of the forum to see what the community has created."
,Recommended,233680,17269183,"Posted: 28 July, 2015",all,utopius21,"TL;DR:Black Ink has limitations in its current state, but is a joy to use and feels like the future of digital painting programs.The Full Review:First off, let's talk about the lack of features. Here are some of the common complaints about Black Ink's feature set that I've seen on Steam and elsewhere:Not enough good brushes out of the boxNo fill toolNo blending brushesOnly 8 layers availableNo maskingAre these valid? Absolutely, each is completely true. The team is working on some and some are way down the list of needed improvements, so we might never see them.But for me, none of that matters.Why? Because Black Ink is just a joy to use, even in its current, limited state. It feels like the future, like someone 10 years from now is sending back a digital painting package to give us a preview of what things are going to look like in their day.Let's talk about some good and bad things about Black Ink.Here is what I love about Black Ink:I have never used a drawing package that felt so smooth. Everything from the brush strokes to the menus sliding in and out to moving the canvas around just feels cool.The brushes that are available are perfect for concepting out designs. Just enough randomness in them to give you meaningful happy accidents.It's FAST. 10k canvases with 5k brushes are just as smooth as 1k canvases with 20px brushes. I've never had a brush stroke lag, ever.Tweaking the brushes is actually very intuitive once you understand the node based system.It has the best shortcut system of any app I've used. I love that everything used for painting is on the left side of the keyboard, and that you don't have to click the drawing pen down to activate them. Once you are holding the key it is active. This makes the software feel smoother and faster.Features are well thought out. I am the first to complain about the frequency of updates (and have in the past), I do wish they came more often. But what I love about the dev team is that when they implement a new feature, they make sure it is awesome before releasing it. Every new feature that has been added is well defined, well thought out and implemented in a way that makes you feel like it always belonged there.The dev team is really responsive. Look in any thread in the discussions page here on Steam and you'll see responses from them. They are very aware of what is happening and what people want.Ok, so from my description you probably think I have only praise for Black Ink. But there are certainly things that bother me.Things I don't love about Black Ink:As I mentioned above, updates are great when they come, but I wish they came more often. Three times a year just isn't enough when you are in early access in my opinion.The color picker sucks. It takes 3 clicks to choose a color, most other programs have the color wheel right there. It's a one click operation to select a color. The lack of color palettes is something sorely missed as well.I do wish there were more brushes that were just normal painting brushes. While I appreciate and really like the crazy experimental ones, it would be nice to have an airbrush, a textured paint brush, and a few other without having to shoe horn them in myself.A fill tool would be nice (coming in the next release apparently)Even with these flaws Black Ink remains one of my favorite drawing programs. Do yourself a favor and at least get the demo here on Steam. I think you'll find it to be one of your more satisfying painting software experiences."

Having dabbled with the brush setups this program is capable of producing a level of fine detail that also lends itself to all types of artwork, including something that looks almost photorealistic if required. Amazingly this can be acheived simply changing the settings of one brush throughout.At first I will admit it was a struggle to get to grips with anything other than experimenting with the stock brushes to create weird and wonderful doodles but once you learn how to modify brushes to your liking the sky really is the limit. Compared to the price of art software of a similar quality and scope this program really is a steal."

Seriously, toggle this feature on and off. This is the one and only thing I can say I actually hate about the app. Sadly I really really HATE that behaviour.It's basically a very slick digital painting app with very limited editing capabilities and a single, very fast, robust, and customisable brush engine.It's fun to play with but I can't get my head around the brush editor and I hate the brush size behaviour.It's very good at what it does but it is kinda awkward, and expensive, and Windows only.It would be unfair to review it on tasks it's not designed for so that's it."
,Recommended,233680,8622687,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,b3b0p.r0b0t,"Just getting started with this software, and I love it.I'm a studio artist with painting, animation and filmmaking experience. I often work digitally. I've used Photoshop, Corel Painter, and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro (PC and tablet) to complete projects. Black Ink has enough going for it that its become my first choice in a very short time. I've only scratched the surface, but I'm particularly fond of the node-based brush editor. The ability to undo tool setting changes is a very smart feature I suddenly want in everything. Drawing on very large canvases is clearly more responsive than in Photoshop. Hot key commands are intuitive, and well implemented. Philosophically, I'm glad to have a tool that is uninterested in simulating physical media. Oil painting is great. If you want to paint with oils, get some oils. Drawing on a computer ought to be a different animal.I'm looking forward to/hoping for a much more robust palette management system before the commercial release. If there is a way to create a palette with more than eight colors, I have yet to figure it out. I would also like to see a (minimal) vector drawing toolset, so I can be precise when I need to. All that said, this is a beta. It's supposed to be a work in progress. Currently, all the tools are there to do some exceptional doodling and quality finished work.Stability has been good for me so far. I have a very powerful Windows 7 Intel Xeon machine, lots of RAM and a Quadro 4000, for what it's worth. I would expect this software to run well on a laptop, but haven't tried. I would LOVE to have Black Ink on a Cintiq Companion, if I were to spend $2,000 on a tablet. I might never draw on paper again."

I will update this review if I draw on Black ink again and put links to my artworks in case they are good.Outdated review :In my opinion: very efficient and modern drawing software if you have a powerful gpu. I usually work with Krita but when I need to draw on very high resolutions, well, Black Ink stays smooth and reactive while Krita can take 10s to display my stroke XD.Some notes though:- I already stated it but some people still seem to miss that it requires a powerful gpu, otherwise it is completely useless!- The brush system is very powerful but can also be tricky and time consuming. Note that there are not many brushes so you'll certainly end up doing yours.- Keep in mind that this software is young => not much resources on it (tutorials, brushes, ...).- It is a completely different way of thinking so if you don't like new stuff, this may be a bad idea."
76561198041881347,Not Recommended,233680,31967820,Posted: 26 May,all,Fooyeah,"First of all this program runs very smoothly on my machine, although it will crash when trying to do more complex things.I am a professional Graphic Designer and I usually work with Adobe programs and Autodesk. I also feel this program is a decent digital painting program for small-scale imagery. And that is where the problem with this program is. As a graphic designer when working on a digital imagery that is not vector graphic you utilize very high resolutions. This program cannot handle very high resolutions such as 8K. It works somewhat but will crash when trying to mask shapes at that size. Many of the brushes also do not accommodate such large resolutions, most are just capable of doing 1080. So as a professional this program is not that useful for creating works of art that could be used as assets for the ever increasing demand for higher resolutions. I do however feel that the designers could work to make this program capable of such high resolutions, however I feel this would probably require more powerful computers capable of keeping up with the graphical demand.In conclusion, if you are an enthusiast who doesn't mind the lower resolution and does not want to pay the price of running Adobe this may be a very useful program to have.As a professional I could not recommend this program because of its limitations, it shows you really do get what you pay for. However it can be fun and makes work fast for small-scale and concept imagery, so it might be useful to have if you don't mind spending the money."

If you can draw fairly well without looking at your drawing hand, a cheap wacom or Huion tablet will do. If you're having problems with hand-eye coordination, you could try for a higher end graphics tablet with a digital displey (such as the Wacom Cintiq 13HD), or practice a lot more with the current tablet you own; However, graphics tablets aren't required to use Black Ink.If you have a weak GPUI would recommend a different computer art program that isn't heavily intensive on weaker GPUs.FeaturesBlack in has a wide array of brush settings that can be manipulated and saved on the fly. you can change: shape and size, scatter, hue, patterns, pen stroke, etc.You can even create your own brush settings using a series of mathematical calculations (which all brush settings are made from).Black Ink images are very large, allowing you to save your creation in large image formats without pixelating your work.Black Ink can temporarily back up your work if you lose power or if the program crashes.Just be sure to save your temporary back up immediately after loading it.Conclusion:If your looking for an abstract or conceptual computer art program, Black Ink work very well for that.

Beyond the basic pen functions, there's no real advanced functionality available. Forget about dynamic zoom or adjusting brush size on the fly.Whilst a GPU accelerated art application soley focused on digital art is a novel idea, you'll be infinitely better served by the usual Photoshop, Corel Painter or even Manga Studio.

For example, I just tried it out a bit on my Surface 3. Not the Pro version, the piddly Atom based 3. There are some odd scan-lines over the canvas, that disappear whenever I'm drawing in little sectors, or when I'm zooming. But relatively smooth, and less laggy, than my I7 laptop.

(Probably one of the best art programs on Steam) The goal of Black Ink to focus on user friendliness and tool/brush creation and allow for infinite creative freedom, rather than imitate programs such as Illustator and Photoshop. It is however still in development and has a number a flaws. That being said, I have a few recommendations.-Cloud SupportThis is likely my biggest concern. It's kind of a pain that I can't access my work/brushes from multiple computers.-Workshop SupportI can live without this one but it would be a neat addition. Workshop support would allow artists to share the brushes they've created. (Although it would in some cases be counter-productive, as people could easily abuse the workshop.)-More Tutorials/Digital ManualThe lack of tutorials is a bit of a problem. I still haven't fully grasped all of the controls which has made my work a bit limited.-Photoshop/Illustrator based tools.This suggestion is a bit d!ckley on my part seeing as it would sort of defeat the program's purpose but in my opinion some of the tools seen as Photoshop and Illustrator could have uses such as modifying a scene in a way just brushes can't. It'd also help people who are getting into Graphic Arts (Such as a student like myself) slowly ease into the program.-Simpler EditorWhen I say this I'm talking more about presentation rather than changing the actual editor. It seems to be based around mathematics. (Which is fine) I just wish it were a little easier to understand. (I don't get math.)In conclusion, Black Ink is a program with near limitless potential and it's just 45 bucks. (That is until the final product is released.)

I know it's supposed to still be in beta, but...Black Ink just doesn't work well on a Cintiq Companion. It has very slow brush tracking and weird jumps in the line. The only solution is to disable precise stylus tracking, which means less smooth lines. It does work a lot better (and way faster) with a capacitive pen, if you don't mind loosing pressure sensitivity, that is. Also, touch support is poor, with very slow pinch to zoom and no panning. Take a look at the latest update for Manga Studio 5EX if you want an example of how pen and touch are supposed to work together.On a gaming PC with a Cintiq the tracking problems and wobly lines are also present, but at least the performance problems are gone.At this point I have lost interest in digging deeper onto Black Inks features. There are too many drawing tools out there that do work well, even on a tablet. A shame, really. I do still like the concept. Perhaps I'll take another look once Bleank finishes the software.Generally avoid if you plan on using Black Ink on a tablet/slate PC.

For me, it was quickly hitting undo and creating a new layer directly after. I've got out of that habit, and have yet to have it crash on me.Two other negatives would be the limited zoom, up to 100%, and the limited layers, up to 8.Saving your work is REALLY quick. On my computer, it happens in less than a second.Brushes are extremely expendable. Create and share your own, download some from others, certain brushes will react to velocity and pressure, etc.One really neat mode is how you can use the color of an image.Essentially, when doing this, BlackInk is acting as a photo-filter, and only applies the filter wherever you paint.This can create some really cool photos and effects; Although if you're planning on 'filtering' an entire photo with a specific style of brush, it'll take a while.

With a little, but much needed, insturction on the interface and advanced options, you can get spectacular effects with little time and effort (and half the time, by accident).What I like:Running on my graphics card makes this run so smooth even with big canvases and complex brushes. Creativity and experimentation pays off big time. Downloadable brushes from the site are always fun even if you dont want to mess around and make your own.What I dont like:Hard layer limit of 8... this can be worked around with multiple documents and merging down (there is a planned update to raise the limit though). Super brush customization is intimidating and seemingly unproductive at first. Lacks a traditional paint bucket or 'magic wand'.Final thoughtsRunning on the power of the graphics card has some interestiesting results, like problems with really old (7 year old) cards and considering it a ""game"" for screen capture and streaming. Updates  are slow but always vastly improve the program. If you like what you see it is definatly worth the trial."

Although I personally haven't been able to use it for finalized art as of this build, what this program is absolutely amazing at is for creating concept art. You can use any number of different brushes to make a rough silhouette shape, and then fine tune it until it has enough detail for you to refine it further in another program.However, just because I haven't been able to finalize my art in this program doesn't mean it's not possible. I've seen some really impressive artwork done with this program, and I look forward to every update they provide.

Luckily there are a lot of tutorials (some are even made by the developers) which can show you some tricks and how-to's.There are not many brushes at the beginning, but you can easily create your own brushes or search how to make some, after a quite time they will become better and better the more you work. You will get used to your own brushes, it will be really interesting with new brushes created. (By yourself)One big problem is that you have to practise drawing with a mouse if you never did or/and don't own a pad. I can give you one hint which is that you shouldn't give up, even when the first images don't look how you imagined.The developers are really friendly and polite (I have already wrote with one) and they will give you hints aswell.If you use photoshop too you can try to combine those for making pictures.

With Black Ink I can make really, REALLY digital-looking art from scratch. Right now Black Ink is pretty bare, with a lot of basic fuctionality missing (such as shapes and color swatch sets), but there's enough there so that if you want to straight up paint this program can do a lot.However, my biggest wish right now is for more customized brushes. The community has made a few neat ones, available at Bleank's forums, but it's nowhere near enough. This program's uses math-based brush work, meaning you can go completely nuts with a stroke's parameters, as shown in official YouTube tutorials and the trailers. Dozens of ""controllers"" and numerous options for each create a staggering suite of options. I was simultaneously blown away and shockingly overwhelmed. Having brush sets (a feature not in the program, at least for now) with even a handful of similar, crazy brushes would make this program easier for people like me, who don't want to spend hours making their own perfect group.On a side note, because Black Ink is GPU-based, it cranks my computer barely less than the Witcher 3 at near-max settings. Not a huge deal, but worth noting for those with mid-range or lower video cards.All in all, this program is absolutely amazing and is doing a better job for the ultra-digital look I want than Photoshop could ever attempt.
