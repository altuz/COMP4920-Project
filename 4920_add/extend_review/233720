Anyway, you control his fingers and thumb using the keyboard, which works well at simulating a hand. The controls can get a little frustrating, however I think that was a little on purpose. Now, most of you are all wondering the same question: Does it have a good story? Yes. It shows a man who poses a lack of hand motor skills and has a dream of becoming a surgeon, the best surgeon, but you are the only one who can fulfil his dream.The story and game play intertwine nicely and always makes you ask the same question: Was it worth it? As you stare down at the life insurance fee, was it worth it...? That aside, the game has three different types of surgery: Heart Transplant, Kidney Transplant and the Brain Transplant. They all are extremely fun and varied and include funny references, while you Tomahawk Chop someone in the skull. There is also a few secret levels, which I won't tell you about since they are...secret. Just go easy on the heavy (I've given my condolences to enough Team Fortress characters).In a nutshell, Surgeon Simulator controls well,  Has frustratingly-fun levels and even the starting menu provided for several minutes of fun.NOTE:This is my first review, so I know it isn't that good, however I hope to get better as I write more."

,Recommended,233720,13676314,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Most of us are well short of the level of education and subsequent anatomical knowledge required to successfully perform a heart transplant. Still, who wouldn't mind experiencing the awesome wave of heroic accomplishment that washes over a surgeon each time he or she saves a person's life? Surgeon Simulator 2013, a game from Bossa Studios, won't help you be a surgeon. It won't help you save lives, either. Hell, I'd even go as far as to say it has a negative influence on your personal knowledge of what invasive surgery actually entails. What it does do, almost in spite of itself, is haphazardly simulate the thrill of ripping a man's heart out of his chest and replacing it with another one.Surgeon Simulator 2013 replicates surgery the same way Enviro-Bear 2010 simulates a bear driving a car; with one hand and deliberately obtuse control. You play as Nigel Burke, or, more specifically, you play as Nigel Burke's left hand. Each of Nigel's fingers are controlled with your fingers on the A, W, E, and R keys, respectively, while Nigel's and your thumb is left to the space bar. Yes, that's completely insane, and yet also sort of logical position for your hand on a keyboard.Surgeon Simulator 2013's clumsy control is more of an endearing hook than a frustrating point of contention. It seems impossible, but, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head, an operational degree of control is gained with a bit of practice. Plopping Nigel’s hand down on a scalpel and watching him haphazardly pick it up like a cave man holding a pencil is both effectively hilarious and functionally acceptable. Hovering the hand over an artery and dropping it to replicate some sort of crude sawing motion looks absurd, but typically manages to get the job done. Playing Surgeon Simulator 2013 for a couple hours grants an almost expert level of control, but being a novice is almost more enjoyable simply because of how ridiculous everything appears when swinging Nigel’s dumb hand around the operating table.It helps that Surgeon Simulator 2013’s proposed method of surgery is almost completely unrealistic. Despite being mostly about goofs up to this point, there's a neat little game packed in Surgeon Simulator 2013. If you wreck Bob's guts too much he'll start bleeding, and if he bleeds out completely you'll murder the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and fail the surgery.Spontaneity is perhaps Surgeon Simulator 2013's finest asset. Being physics-based game loaded with a ton of props, it's prone to numerous instances of accidental mishaps. Since Nigel's arms controls like your arm if it had been numb for three years, knocking all of the extraneous crap over on the operating table is a common occurrence. Likewise, accidentally dropping your scalpel, bone saw, or plastic spoon inside Bob's chest cavity is frequently unavoidable. From getting a scalpel lodged in your palm to accidentally administering hallucinogenic drugs on yourself, Surgeon Simulator 2013 is loaded with random and surprising tomfoolery.Obscene humor is the reason to play Surgeon Simulator 2013, and it delivers that asset in spades, but down the line it actually morphs into a legitimate challenge. After failing twenty or whatever times, I was sweating bullets the first time I managed to complete the kidney transplant. The sheer amount of things that could go wrong, not the mention the sloppy control, made for a true feeling of accomplishment upon completion. It's nothing like real surgery, obviously, but I did feel the overwhelming need to high five every one around and celebrate once I finally got it right.Half the fun is mentioning the premise of Surgeon Simulator 2013 to a buddy and then watching him or her come to grips with the outrageous task before them.And there you have it. Surgery Simulator 2013 is a joke, and its creators are well aware of that fact, but it’s effectively the best game about completing surgical procedures with a phantom limb ever made."

,Recommended,233720,16045307,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Tom,"Surgeon Simulator is a first person QWOP game. You take the role of a surgeon named Nigel Burke. Mouse movements control your doctor’s hand, up, down, left, right, and rotating. A, W, E, R and space bar are all used to control individual fingers on the hand, this is used to grasp the utensils, The game play consists of the player trying to complete a number of different operations on your patient, the first being something as simple as a heart transplant.Once completing the first operations, you then unlock different scenarios, such as ambulance operations, ad space operations, which incorporate bumping round tools and zero gravity,The graphics are nicely presented and everything looks clean and polished, I don't think photo realism graphics would be something I would be looking for in this type of game anyway. The soundtrack is mainly the general hospital/emergency theme tune the whole time, I had to turn it off after the first hour or two as it just grew very repetitive very fast, all of the sound effects in game of the grinding, sawing and squelching are all very nicely produced.This game is hard, like, hard as nails hard, I am nowhere near completing it, and I have played for almost eleven hours, your hands start to ache if you play any more than an hour due to the intense holding down of the buttons and thought that goes into picking up a single item, it is unbelievable, I did try out using a controller using Pinnacle Gaming Profile (quick shout out to them while I am at it), and this did make the controls a little easier to use, but it was still stupidly difficult.I haven't found any technical issues, I would think a potato could run Surgeon Simulator; it's a well optimized game.A lot of the time I spent on this was playing with friends, just playing around seeing how messed up we could get, and that's what this game is all about, just having a laugh and giggle, it's hard to sit down on your own for hours at a time on this game just because of how strenuous it is on your hand and thought process just to pick something up. But I do recommend that people pick it up, just for the novelty value and for some couch gaming with friends.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

But there is yet hope as a band of unlikely heroes unite to vanquish this foe and send it back to the vile domain from whence it came. Play the roles of plucky Pinkie, the young but eager son of a blacksmith, Ring, the exiled princess trying to win back her rightful place as heir to the throne, the short-tempered Middle with a past shrouded in secrecy and an apparent score to settle, Thumb, the stoic and noble paladin sworn to defend the realm, and their brave leader Index, who together form the brotherhood of The Hand of Nigel, as they set forth on adventure in a world filled with peril at every turn.Face hideous, demented foes throughout the course of your journey such as the snake-like Intesties, the oozing Liveros, and the worst villains of them all, The Board of Medical Examiners. Lay siege to their fortress of bones, but choose your weapons careful, as only the right tools will grant you access to their grotesque dungeons. Mere tiny blades and cutting devices will ne'er be enough to pass, but with steadfast determination and a mighty hammer you will see your way through to the inner sanctum. Once inside be prepared to face the horrible wretches that lie in wait for you, the bosses within the bowels of each twisted lair, including Master Pump, The♥♥♥♥♥♥taker, and the most sickening of them all... Big Brain. Only when these are vanquished will you truly be able to call yourself the Hero of Infirmary and claim the hand of the fair maiden Trisha.It is not a quest for those faint of heart or lacking in skill or valour, but great rewards await any warrior brave enough to take on this challenge as you traverse the wastelands, do battle astride the back of high speed carriages, and even magically voyage through the cold, dark void of outer space on your intrepid excursions. Find glory and pass into legend, or succumb to the forces of evil and meet your doom, but whatever you do, tread carefully lest you summon the wrath of the greatest danger of all, the all-knowing, omnipresent...

People compare it to QWOP and to the extent that it relies on playing twister with your fingers that's true, but it's much more than that. Each surgery is like a puzzle, trying to figure out which tools work and don't, finding the most efficient route through it. Achievements incentivize creative play. I mean, the most amazing thing about the game is that it exists at all, it's so absurd. But I think if you get past the initial curve you'll find a compelling score/time attack game.I'll also add that if you have people over to your house, non-gamers LOVE watching this. A casual hammer to the skull here, a drill dropped in a chest cavity there, accidentally throwing the replacement heart away. It's all good.You're looking at 8-10 hours for completion of every surgery with good scores, maybe 12-15 if you want to go to A++ on everything.

In the process, hilarity ensues.There is nothing wrong with this, and I actually do think the emergent comedy of my in-game physical ineptitude is amusing, it's just not that fun to play. A lot of trial and error as I try to figure out which awkwardly held item is the best one to use to remove X-bit of anatomy, then awkwardly moving the arm around to get the correct grip on the tool, then awkwardly hacking out the bit. A lot of awkward manipulations going on, and at some point I'll mess up, or hack at the wrong thing while trying to hack at the right one, and the patient will bleed out, and I'll have to do it all over again.I can see someone having fun with all this.

You have probably seen all that on You Tube.But after about 20 minutes (varies from person to person), but the chaos gets old really quickly. And then comes the frustration.You'll be trying to actually finish a surgery, only to be constantly pestered by your character's inability to perform simple tasks, such as picking up items, cramming his hand into tight places, putting more than 20 centimeters between his hand and the patient, inability to peek around his arm, and last but not least his spontanious fits of cerebral palsy.Which is to say that sometimes your character will fail to pick up items despite his hand being straight on top of them when you flex the fingers, the reach of your arm is so short you cannot reach the farthest edges of the operating table, and in surgeries where the patient is upright, you can barely get your hand over your patient's head, making it nigh impossible to avoid smacking your patient in the face with whatever you're wielding. Besides that, your arm will almost constantly be blocking the view of either your tool or the organ you're trying to sever, and you will constantly drop things despite having a firm grip on them.These arduous controls are what make the game fun for the first twenty minutes of intentional chaos and carnage, but are also what makes the rest of the game time horrible, and filled with unintentional chaos and carnage.It does have plenty of good humor, though. I particullalartly liked the TF2 easter egg.I have decided not to recommend it, but this is only because I would not recommend it at its normal price. I bought it during a sale, and that is probably the primary reason I am not overly disappointed with the game.If you like chaos and mayhem and randomness, then you'll probably have a good time.

,Recommended,233720,30766179,Posted: 26 March,all,TheGhostThatWas,"Surgeon Simulator is an unrealistic and silly game. It has intentionally strange and difficult controls, which result in a very challenging and occasionally frustrating game. It's not a game I would recommend for people who will overreact and lose their temper. Some of the levels are just hard to control, or may even feel unfair. I do think that the game is the most fun to play with friends, and has the potential for a few ""funny moments."" I'd compare it to I Am Bread (same developer), or Octo-Dad: Dadliest Catch (I don't know the developer for that one.)Overall, I'd recommend getting the game on sale and then playing it as a party game. Save the challenges and achievements for yourself, if you're feeling determined."

76561198062368001,Recommended,233720,17071497,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,Dr. Daddy Ted,"Intro:I feel that the main goal of Bossa Studios for the original game, was to get a quick laugh from the audience and maybe make some money off of it, I feel the same for this version. Ask anybody that owns it about why they bought the game and they will most likley say ""Because it looked funny"". I think the only reason you would buy this game is due to the fact that it looked freaking hillarious to see a scalpel jammed into some poor man's eye. I mean, who really want's to buy this for the pure challenge of preforming sugery on a patient? I would assume you want to buy this as an escape from the daily life, to the inner realms of video games where everything that happens is supposed to be a fun experience, and I think it does this fairly well.Gameplay:I think that the gameplay is pretty hard, and the fact that it is hard is just the point of the game. The devs as gamers thought about the most annoying things you could implement, and afterward implemented them. I think that the devs never expected this to be a really good game that people played and speedran just due to the fact that it was only intended as a quick laugh and nothing more. When it comes to the Pros and the Cons of the game I don't like adressing them just due to the fact that as previously stated, the cons were intended for the end product long before the release of the game. I can't judge the gameplay of this as it really depends on your sense of humor and expectations of what a game should be.Conclusion:Since this game was mainly to make a funny statement about something, I don't feel like you should even consider playing it like a real video game, but to play it as a form of comedy that you may come back to after a hard day of work. To actually play it as a fully fledged video game is just foolhardy, and if you want a FAIR challenging experience, I wouldn't really recommend it in any way shape or form. 100%ing this thing was really pointless in the whole scheme of things, and in all honesty it ruined the experience of ever playing a game like it again. I think if it's on sale (which it usally is) go for it, there is no crime in laughing at a fake man's misery, or doing psychologically questionable things to his organs, however, I urge you to never ever play it like a real game, but to only ever play it as a silly satire on the ""Simulation"" genre of today...Side Note:If I could give this a ""Mixed"" or ""So-So"" review I would use that instead, but alas I am stuck with the current steam system of reviewing something."

However, QWOP is free. This is $9.99. I bought Bastion, one of the best games ever made, in sale for about $2.00 (I can't remember the exact price. Sue me). Speaking of the controls, the difficulty here is more artificial than anything else. Let's compare this difficulty to another difficult game- Super Meat Boy. I think JonTron says it best: ""[It's] ball-renchingly difficult, but you know what? The controls are so tight that if you mess up, it's entirely on you, and that feels good. It's great. Difficulty isn't the problem. Cheapness is."" Say you're doing the heart transplant and the heart gets stuck in the ribcage. Cheapness. That's one word that actually sums this game up pretty well.

There's a reason why it is NOT called Surgery Simulator, mainly because the operations in this game is extremely wacky and way off the standard protocol. (Surgery without gloves? Blasphemy!)You control a faceless surgeon who apparently has only one hand. (Which might also be the reason why he isn't wearing gloves, because how on Earth would someone put on gloves with only one hand without assistance from others?)Operations include heart transplant, double kidney transplant and brain surgery (which are the only ones I've unlocked so far, I hear there are secret missions that can be unlocked besides the TF2 crossover). Each operation can be repeated in a different setting other than the usual operating theatre, such as in a speeding ambulance and in a zero gravity environment.The controls are.......unique, as the keys are mapped according to which finger is used to tap each key. This means you have full finger control (finger gestures abound). But, full control does not mean simplicity, as you have to control the wrist and arm movements with the mouse. Therefore, to say the very least, the controls are very tricky, but once you have played several sessions you'll have some degree of mastery with it.Overall, it is a game with a quite steep learning curve, but the satisfaction gained when completing an operation is immense. 8 out of 10."

To the point where your not just trying to accomplish a heart surgery in the back of a moving ambulance, your seeing how quickly you can do it, if you can do it using only a fire extinguisher and a pair of scissors. Your seeing exactly how much crap you can place in the chest cavity of a patient mid operation and trying desperately to pry a kidney out from some ribs using a plastic spoon.There are plenty of frustrations, due to a niave expectation of how the game 'should' play to the occasional physics bug that can cause your hands or a scapel to get stuck in awkward situations (between ribs, in a fridge [Yes, there is a firdge] etc). Rising above these frustrations and learning from is key to getting the best from this game.This is no game of the year. But it is suprisingly intelligent and funny.

You have a grading system that grades your performance based on how much blood was lost, and how fast you did it. This offers up the way to figure out what tools to use, and when to use 'em.

Therefore, it is with great pleasure that we hereby invite you to be the first participant in our newly designed course for people seeking arm rehabilitation.We must warn you though that this course is not for the squeamish. You will pretend to be a qualified surgeon, chop up patients' innards, throw random stuff into their innards, and brutally murder them in hilarious ways.Please mail back this letter with your favourable reply. Thank you.A few months later, after having undergone the course, you receive another letter in your mailbox:Congratulations on successfully passing the course. These are your statistics:9001patients named Bob murdered333patients named Bob saved135alien patients murdered42alien patients savedOddly enough, your stats for operating on an oversized Russian hunk with crazy contraptions are not displayed here.We hope you have recovered sufficient mobility in your arm/hand to be able to proceed with basic everyday life.----------SERIOUS REVIEW:----------Surgeon Simulator 2013 started out life as a game jam, much like howGoat Simulatororiginated. Both concepts went viral, and both games were then officially touched up/made into full Steam games. The similarities end here (and I won't invoke the name of Goat Simulator in this review anymore after this sentence).I consider myself among the group of people that had a total blast with the utterly awkwardly hilarious controls and mechanics. It helps that even Bossa Studios have claimed that they did utterly 0 research before making this game - if this was a more actual simulator, it wouldn't have been as fun. (""I'll cut this patient's intestine with this hammer!"" *patient dies*)At the same time, I do recognise that the game is not for everyone - if you're looking for a game that is more ""proper"" per se, you might want to stay away.Gameplay is as mentioned above in the joke review. You control a single left arm/hand, and you have 3 different types of surgeries, each in 3 different environments. Free DLC updates have added a TF2 surgery fromMeet The Medic(Valve and Bossa Studios, you rock! :D) and an utterly crazy secret Alien Surgery. Updates have also included community-inspired achievements from famous Youtubers - Bossa Studios really reaches out to its community.One year from its release, a paid DLC has been released to upgrade SS2013 to the Anniversary Edition. There is a new environment (corridor) and two more new surgeries (Eye transplant and Teeth transplant), as well as new secrets and tricks to discover. I bought the DLC as soon as I was able to, and wasn't disappointed. I must confess that I had a truckload of giggles from hitting stuff with the radio and making the radio change station to the secretsurgeon rap. The DLC also adds the soundtrack in with the game files as well - now, I've always been used to getting soundtracks for games from Humble Bundle, but this was FANTASTIC.Again, with my lousy computer, this game doesn't really run well, especially in the Space Surgeries where my computer has to calculate the trajectories of a bajillion objects, even at the lowest settings. Oh well.--------When to buyWatch videos, try thefree demobefore considering whether you should buy the game. In case you still want to buy it in spite of the awkward controls, try waiting until it goes on sale at 75% off.Or, try trading for a Humble Bundle gift link! It's appeared in 2 Humble Bundles so far.The DLC hasn't been bundled before but the cheapest it has gone is 75% off, but with the amount of content they put in, even full price in my opinion is worth it.Suggestion: If youown a pair of Razer Hydras, use them with this. You get an extra hand. ;)8.5/10This game was previously demoed on the Who's Gaming Now?!Twitch Channel. We regularly demo indie games on the channel, consider tossing us a follow."

Clinicals will be a breeze after a few hours fine-tuning your skills.  I would say pre-med students could benefit as well if they poccess enough knowledge about surgery and have a sound medical vocabulary.

Listen, if you think I'm in no place to be judging it, take this into concideration:I legitimately got an A++ on every mission, and I got a 100% no blood loss brain sugery.I know what I'm talking about.Lots of people complain about the way this game runs, but it runs perfectly for me and I have a terrible pc. I can barely run skyrim on medium graphics. This game runs perfectly if you want to mess with the options a small bit.The game's controls are terrible.BUT THAT'S THE POINT. YOU'RE PLAYING AS A DRUGGED UP SURGEON. YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF A SOBER HUMAN, YOU PLAY AS NIGEL BURK, A MAN ADDICTED TO PILLS.Hence why he has drugs on his desk (pills) and why you can inject yourself with the hallucinatory drugs during the operations.If you still feel like I don't know enough about this game, I can tell you that I have all of the achievements :/I definately reccomend this game, it's long, it takes a while to learn, and it's fun. Slamming radios into people's ribcages is fun. Drilling a hole in your patient's head is fun. Making your patient a timelord is fun. Getting every mission A++'d is fun.This game is fun.

What it does do is add humour in the way that the controls are merely clunky and unforgiving whilst you nervously attempt to carry out surgery. The game itself is funny for about 5 minutes as the character you are controlling is so clumsy that he knocks over everything in his sight but I don't think Surgeon Simulator 2013 is really a game that is intended to be serious. What it does do exceptionally well is try and attempt to put you in a situation where you are mentally instable, drunk and have no idea what you are doing, yet manage to carry out surgery. I wouldn't say that this a game worthy of its £6.99 pricetag seeing as it really is nothing but silliness and a short moment of laughs. I guess it would give good bragging rights if you're able to complete surgery in the fastest time with the least blood lost or whatever but as a standalone game to pay money for? Nope."

Unless if you are forcing yourself to play these games to some how teach yourself patience. Lol! The most frustrating game! This is the same as OCTODAD game and other similar sim games where you try to do something and the only challenge is either gravity or the fact that the game won't let you get things done because it offers no other skill other than the game itself preventing you to play it.My experience with it was:step 1 do what they want me to do.step 2 I can't so i try something else.step 3 watching the patient die because i couldnt do what i was supposed to do.step 4 killing the patient from doing more damage to it.step 5 pass the challenge or fail and re-try.step 6 the humor fades and you realise there are too many games like these and so many others that are world's better. This is a short entertainment only.It has no challenge and no skill. It is like the devs wanted to make a game and couldn't so it handles terribly and then they slap a sim label on it. There is a lot more to a sim game besides this. Plenty of other sim games out there. Preventing a player from playing & then charging them for it shouldn't be considered a challenge at any point in time.Space engineers is a sand box game for builders but that quickly went out the window since things are moving away from you every time and there is no real setting to remove that function in sand box mode. This is not recommended for impatient people. It reminded me of this game where there is a constant in-game interruption preventing you from playing. Recommended for the patient people only.

People say that the creators meant to make the controls so awkard, but it's to the point that it's too unforgiving. I oftentimes dropped the green syringe out of frame by accident, which quickly leads to the patient bleeding out. This could be a pretty decent game with VR and motion controls, but M+K fails miserably. This novelty game relies too heavily on the poor controls as its difficulty factor, and I don't want to waste time figuring out the controls just the play the game."

But here's my review of it.For one, the graphics are nice and simplistic. The controls themselves are tricky, but that's part of the game. The tasks you must complete are nice because it isn't the exact same thing each time. It places you in different environments and allows you to use a wide range of tools to complete your given task. The music is nice and so is the fact that you can kill your patient.Once again, I don't like this game but I know many people do, and I can see why.

,Not Recommended,233720,8459889,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,SPAGETT,"So I was recommended this game recently and it's been a journey to say the least.First off, understand this: Surgeon Simulator is a mock of a true simulator.  It is mocking other simulators complicated, sometimes frustrating controls, and it excels at that.  It is also is also a mockery of surgery in general, kind of a bummer if you ever played Life and Death from '88.  To be fair, a true surgery simulator wouldn't be well received.  This game has you breaking out ribcages, allows you to throw organs on the floor (after you take them out you don't put them back in, save for the replacement heart/kidney/brain), and has you do so with the most ridiculous tools available.To some, that sounds great.  Not me.  I enjoy true simulators such as MS Flight Sim, Euro Truck, and SimCity.  In those games, I don't really find the controls too challenging, so I don't really get the joke here.  I've heard of QWOP, which is essentially a jogging simulator where you control the thighs/calves separately, and must maintain balance while doing so.  Not really my cup of tea either.  So if you like the idea of frustratingly bad controls, or might find the humor in it, give it a try.  There's a free version out there (as any good sim should have) to make sure you enjoy before you buy.It's not for everyone, but it's for some.  There are definitely some hilarious moments, such as raging on your desk in reception, answering the phone, and making all the (rude) hand gestures at the patient, but after that the bad controls lost their luster on me.Surgeon Sim gets a 2/5.TawokSteam: Apocky+TawokPSN/Xbox: Tawok"

Picking up a tool isnt as simple as.. well.. just picking it up. You will find Nigel to pick up the tool just however he wishes for (or more specificaly: how the tool just happend to be on the table).Don't dare to think this game to be a respectful (surgeon) simulator, because it's far from it. But this game isn't really bad, it has just been made to be ridiculous! And it works! For me atleast.But the controls are not the only thing that makes this game challenging. The first three operations (which are heart transplant, double kidney transplant and brain transplant) are in the surgeon room, but the next three operations are in a moving ambulance and the next three in space!! You maybe should not pay the whole 10€, (seriously, who would pay so much for a game that is so broken like it is?) Wait for a sale and then, whatever the price, it's worth your laughs! The 10€ price tag isn't there for how awesome this game is, i suppose, it's more likely because this game is so ridiculous.

After that, you can even go so far as to operate on an alien, after accidentally stumbling across the jettison codes for the makeshift zero-g theatre and being abducted from the vacuum of space.All in all, it's a great way to pass the time. The game is specifically structured so that even killing your patient is difficult short of taking a hatchet to their skull."

This is a fake simulator game. All of those crap ""games"" like Goat Sim, Rock Sim, Mountain Sim and whatever was made after this is made in response to the whole ""lol arn't sims broken!"" jokes that this game had first made. The difference being that this game has interesting, simple but challenging gameplay to go along with that joke that makes it work. Those other games don't, which make them boring and uninteresting to play. Which is why I, and a lot of others, love it to bits and defend it from the flak a lot of other ""games"" get.Extra Note: Forcing a game to have bugs does not make it funny when a bug occurs, which is why legitimate simulator games are hilarous when they occur.

You can always test whether you will like the controls on the Game Jam prototype / demo of the game, which is available for example at developer's site.In overall, I like the game much, and (in my opinion) it's one of the best games from the Steam's Greenlight program released in 2013."

The graphics are alright, not bad by any means, and the actual hilarity of whacking your patient with a hammer or accidentally injecting yourself with some type of drug was quite amusing, but doesn't make up for actual lack of gameplay as far as progression goes.Presentation: 6/10 - Didn't enjoy how the game was put together, there was no real title screen and the controls were written on a computer screen that I didn't notice for a while.Graphics: 8/10 - Didn't mind the graphics, but clunky and bland here and there though.Sound: 7/10 - Nothing wrong with them, but nothing really special about them either. The ""thunk"" as you hit someone in the face with a hammer was quite funny though.Gameplay: 4/10 - The gameplay is a novelty thing. It's cheesy as hell and becomes really tedious after a couple of minutes.Lasting Appeal: 6/10 - Don't see myself going back to this again."

The surgeon's single hand is, by design, one of the clumsiest manifestations of inter-activity ever published.  Of course this would be the very point and what makes it so much fun! The difficulty in getting anywhere because of this intentional disconnect with user input can, however, be frustrating at times.  I personally require a mouse pad the size of Central Park in order to move the arm around (even on the highest sensitivity).  It's definitely presented as a joke game, not an achievement or skill game, although those things are very much required to get anywhere.  There is no advice or direction in how to approach a given surgery, lots of bloody fun in the trial and error.  Too difficult to grasp objects in general, it can take an eon to get the scalpel in your hand at the right angle for incision.  Certainly not realisitic, and the title ""simulator"" here must be taken with a grain of salt.  Or a salt mine even.On the positive, I totally knew what I was getting into and got a deal on the game anyway, so it's no travesty that's happened here.  The game really is pretty funny, and that seems to be it's greatest achievement.  I had  dreams of a more balanced mix of sim and parody...but got mostly the latter.If  the hand were SLIGHTLY more dexterous, I would've enjoyed it more.  I'm sure it must be rewarding for true mouse-keteers that eventually hone their precision with the movements... that seems the only way to advance passed the first surgery even.  When the difficulty in progressing becomes more frustrating than fun, a game generally loses me."

,Not Recommended,233720,9026235,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,Comrade St. Nikolai,"Surgeon Simulator 2013 is, essentially, a joke. It's a funny joke when played on somebody else, but somehow loses much of the humor when it happens to you.The root of the joke is that this is a surgery game with difficult controls. Which could be kind of funny, on its own. But there's so much else piled on top of that, that it makes the game less amusingly frustrating, and more the regular kind of frustrating. The physics are buggy, for one. Your hand gets stuck in EVERYTHING, and sometimes items go flying with little provocation. Sometimes things just fall out of your hand, even though you had a strong grip on them. 2-1 odds it damages the patient and/or falls on the floor. Nothing is really explained at the start, which is all part of the joke. But the game could at least tell you that the green shot stops bleeding, because your average player is going to have a VERY rough go of it without that knowledge.One of the biggest issues for me was figuring out where to cut things. You can't just cut something wherever. You have to cut at a very precise location or you're just wasting the patient's valuable blood. Even knowing where to cut doesn't always help. I know where to cut the left side of the large intestine, but I always wind up scraping my blades all over the thing before it finally gives way. The bigger-picture problem here is that the game is just finicky. Putting a replacement organ where it belongs doesn't always ensure the end of the level. Oftentimes - especially with the kidneys - you can find yourself knocking the organ(s) all around, just trying to get it/them to register as properly in place.There are only three main surgeries in the game. These are the heart transplant, a double kidney transplant, and a brain transplant which is always unlocked last even though it's honestly the easiest of the three. When you complete one, you unlock the next one, and when you complete all three, you unlock the next location. Initially, you only have to perform the operations in an OR. Then you must repeat them in a speeding ambulance, which is evenmoredifficult than that sounds. After that, you must do them a third time in outer space with no gravity. All of these extra locations are just ways to cover up the lack of totally unique operations and draw more laughs out of the original joke, which ran out of laughs the moment you failed your first ambulance mission.And that's sort of my point. It's not that funny to PLAY Surgeon Simulator. It's vastly more fun to watch somebody else play Surgeon Simulator, and let them rage so you don't have to.There are two bonus surgeries which were added on later. One follows the ""Meet the Medic"" video from the Team Fortress 2 universe, and is available from the start. You play the Medic, and you must operate on the Heavy. It is essentially a more complex and difficult version of the basic heart transplant, with a TF2 theme permeating it. The other is actually an intriguing and completely unique surgery, but is only unlocked after you have already completed the three main surgeries in all three locations, so I won't be playing that one as I just don't have the patience to reach it.Surgeon Simulator contains a load of amusing easter eggs and has a good sense of humor about itself. Aesthetically, it is actually quite nice. Everything looks great and sounds great. When you're on a roll, everything even feels great. Shimmying a lung or brain out of a patient is a pleasing experience. It's just not pleasing enough to warrant shelling out the cash for the few operations available and all of the frustration you're sure to endure.Surgeon Simulator is an interesting game. It's certainly different. It can even, on rare occasions, be genuinely fun. I don't want to call it terrible, because it's not. But I feel like the joke is lost on the player. Maybe if it had cooperative play so that two players could watch each other bumble and laugh mutually together at each other's misfortune, it would be more fun to experience firsthand. But it doesn't, and so I can't recommend spending your own money on it. But Icanabsolutely recommend watching somebody else play it on YouTube."

THE CONTROLS you have to hover over the item you want to select after that you have to left click to go down to the item THEN you have to hold AWER to hold the item. Holding AWER was the hardest because after a while my fingers hurt. I thought Surgeon Simulator 2013 was a really good game after watching PewDiePie play it.

Tooth surgery and eye surgery means that there's too much work to do in order to get to additional levels.However, overall this game's pretty good and probably the best the ironic simulator genre has ever pushed out. People who tell you the controls suck haven't spent enough time with the game. These controls are very much masterable and once you get used to them you can perform all kinds of stuff. It's like saying Toribash has bad controls; it doesn't, it just has unusual controls with a high learning curve. Get past that learning curve and you can do goddamn ninja flips and advanced wrestling moves.If you're desperately looking at a ""simulator"" game that will actually keep you entertained for more than five minutes, Surgeon Sim is definitely for you. Unlike a legion of other games in its genre, your actions have consequences on your environment, it doesn't solely rely on the ""haha funny physics and dumb controls"" joke to carry the humour, and above all else Surgeon Sim has an actual game buried under the madness."

Seriously, Do not buy it.Like others have pointed out before me, this game is just a gimmick- You buy it, say ""haha I'm performing surgery"", and then you probably move on. You wont get your money's worth if you intend to just♥♥♥♥♥♥around like this and you're probably better off watching videos or something. If, on the other hand, you're the type of person who will try to get all achievements and unlockables like myself, the only thing you will get from this game is frustration and a lot of headache; This game controls horribly and if you play for more than an hour you will realize that the success of every operation will likely be the result of random luck or some unhealthy amount of time trying to acquire muscle memory.I don't mind putting in a lot of work in order to beat hard games but this isn't NES megaman difficulty or anything, this is just a studio trying to pass off a bad game with a bad physics engine as a challenge. It's the biggest offense of all in my opinion, because the developpers have the audacity to claim in their FAQ that this game is hard because they wanted people to feel ""rewarded"" for being able to put up with something they didn't even have to program. This game is just you struggling with some very bad physics for hours on end.It says a lot when the most famous works by Bossa studios is this joke of a game and a haha2funnylol game about bread. It's as unoriginal as it seems and you're better off steering clear of this abomination. And I don't understand the people who will try to defend it because there is no reason to play doctor's advocate here, it's just a bad game. Believe me.I'm not writing this for myself or for the developpers (since I'm sure they made mad $$$ from this already), but for YOU who hasn't bought this game yet and can still get something way better on the steam store. You're better off buying doom or something. Seriously, don't buy this, go buy something else. Even if you're into goofy stuff, you're better off playing the game where you shower with your dad and a bunch of naked guys than this.PS: It also seems as if there is an issue with mouses for this game, so if you plan on playing this on a laptop or with certain types of mouses you won't be able to grab an item and lower the hand at the same time which is pretty necessary to complete ANY of the operations, so be ready to potentially have to buy a wired mouse because of this one game."

Then the same 3 in an ambulance. Or you could tackle the newly added Meet The Medic mode where you play as Team Fortress 2's lovely german medic. And you have to give a heart transplant to the heavy (you even have to get the big heart and put the uber thing in it then uber the heart). Overall there's plenty of things you can do in this game and there's plenty of achievements for it. I love this game and will spend plenty of time playing it.10/10"

Of course, this game is a novelty - Yes, I've barely played it.The ratio of positive to negative reviews is such that I decided to make mine negative (but NOT simply because of that ratio); this is a novel game, I applaud the idea behind it. No doubt, those who check out Surgeon Simulator would understand the premise (though they can hardly appreciate it until they play it... I certainly wasn't prepared, even after having watched a few videos of gameplay) - for those who don't:You control a ("")surgeon's("") arm - You can raise, lower and rotate the limb and control each digit individually - You are meant to manipulate objects in the most ham-handed of ways to perform the most delicate of procedures - Hilarity/Frustration/Joy/Rage-Induced-Nausea ensues.If it wasn't for the fact that EVERYTHING is derpy, and not just the controls, I would have recorded this as a Thumbs Up. Just in the half hour I played, though, I kept finding my surgical tools getting stuck in-between and behind ribs that I had yet to (be able to) break (hadn’t even lowered the arm manually). That knife was unavailable until I was able to articulate another tool appropriately to free that first tool… and then the damn knife flew away upon clashing with the hammer (really, that much momentum?).The height of the arm is too finicky, as is the angle at which you hold your wrist.It could go either way:A surgeon would keep their appendage steady - This game is intentionally hard to control.The game could have cut us SOME slack - Where's the fun/challenge in that?Such pleasure still escapes me... understand, though, that entertainment is constant. During my first attempt at the heart-transplant, all of my tools somehow flew off the table (IS THERE NO WAY TO TURN OFF THE DREMEL?!), so I simply beat my patient to death with the clock, to try again... to fail thrice more.I (want to) like this game(‘s idea). I will continue to play it - in short spurts, as that is the extent of my patience with it. Provided I can eventually reckon the mechanics/necessary ("")exploits(""), I might change the Negative to Positive and add a Zen statement or two to urge others to stick with it. As it is, I wouldn't feel right Recommending it, because of just HOW extremely, er, unintuitive your interactions within the OR are - how SPASMODIC the integrity of the objects within the environment is."

,Not Recommended,233720,13927235,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,UtCanisACorio,"Unfortunately I went into this with something totally different in mind.  I can definitely see the appeal for anyone who likes to kill time (no pun intended) doing infuriatingly difficult -- though somewhat entertaining -- tasks.  Was I expecting an *actual* surgical simulation? No, not really; and to be honest the sound and blood effects are pretty entertaining on their own.  I guess ultimately my disappointment arises from the fact that the sole purpose of the game really seems to be simply the fact that the surgeon's hand is incredibly imprecise and difficult to control.  Yes, I can see to some degree the comedic value of accidentally knocking a jar into the patient's chest cavity or stabbing them in the heart when you meant to cut their esophagus, but at some point I had to ask myself, ""Am I playing this because I like fighting the game's insistence on not doing what I'm trying to control the hand to do, or because I like figuring out how best to perform the surgery and manage blood loss?"" I will tell you that the game overwhelmingly shifts toward the former, and I realized that the vast majority of the time wasn't spent figuring out how to do the surgery and keep the patient alive, but simply and almost solely trying to control the surgeon himself.  I got about halfway through before I decided I was tired of fighting the game itself rather than actually playing it.  I guess I don't understand why the devs decided to put all the effort into developing decent graphics, sound effects, music, interface, etc., then phone it in on the controls.If the point is the lack and difficulty of control, then I guess that wasn't something I understood going into it.  So if a game based on fighting with the controls to manipulate an extremely difficult to maniuplate broken robotic quasi surgeon hand, then this game is for you.  If that sounds like it would be a bit frustrating and unfulfilling, you'll want to pass on this game.  I can assure you, the comedic value quickly gets replaced with frustration, annoyance, and regret at having spent the money.6/10"

It is very difficult to pick things up at first but you adapt or give up (which I highly recommend, getting skilled at manipulating the wrist and fingers is not enough) but even when you get a handle on picking things up it throws a curve ball and the fact that somethings are lying flat and others are not causes major issues; for instance there is no way to pick up a surgical knife and rotate so that it is cutting at an angle or if you wanna cut horizontal so you hold it with your thumb and pointer and can add the middle finger doesn't matter but you will have to angle your wrist down like a t-rex and start jerking your hand around hoping its cutting the arteries but you can't see because your hand blocks the view.

I looked at the man's covered body. I took a deep breath... and removed the cover.I saw his entire chest cavity, his organs which held still as he calmly slept... and then his sickly heart. It was under all of that.I knew I had to begin.I gazed at my wide selection of tools - what was I to use? Confused under this extreme pressure, I grabbed the drill. The wrong way. Still, I went to work, placing the bit of the upside down drill to his ribs.One by one they all fractured into mere fragments, crumbling before my eyes. When I was finished, I victoriously threw the drill to the side, off of the table and into the oblivion known as the floor. After tossing bits of his broken ribs to the side, I proceeded.Having opened up the chest cavity, I tugged at his lungs and ripped them from their place, putting them to the side. He didn't need those. He had an oxygen mask on.Oh good, his stomach... chord... thing... was in the way. I grabbed a scalpel (upside down, of course) and tried to cut the damned thing off, but all I did was injure the guy. I threw the knife aside, grabbed a needle, and jabbed it into his jugular to slow the bleeding. Somehow.As his neck gushed a steady stream of blood (and yet the monitor read that his blood was staying at the same levels), I proceeded to grab the scalpel once again. This was it. The moment I'd been waiting for.I proceeded to sever each and every tube-type thing linked to his heart (they taught their names in medical school but I really didn't care to remember them) and, dropping the scalpel near his stomach, I ripped the heart from his chest and threw it to the floor, where it could keep the useless drill company. Nobody would need that thing, anyway.Finally, I opened the chest on the table and viewed its beautiful treasure - the new heart. Grabbing the heart, I steadily moved over to the patient's chest... Yes, this was it...I dropped the heart in, and... yes. YES. It. Was. Done. I got an A and moved on with my life.That's the story of my first heart transplant.---Buy this game. Srsly. Du it m8.Why? Well, it's a ridiculously fun and unrealistic game about ruthlessly smashing people's bones to access their organs which you simply rip out to get out the ones you need. All you have to do is get those stupid ribs out of the way... (The hammer and drill work well for that btw.)And, when you get frustrated at how pathetic your hand-controlling skills are, you have the opportunity to rage as well! Instead of doing surgery, you can simply have fun seeing how many funny gestures you can make with your hand, see how fast you can drain the blood from the patient, or jab yourself with the blood-thickening needle (the green one) and apparently become drugged.Seriously, though, if you want a game where you can either put the pressure on as you struggle to finish the objective, a game where you can relentlessly break bones until every piece is transformed into bone-fetti, a game where you can drug yourself and/or throw everything off of the table during surgery, a game where you can slap your patient and even flip them off, and/or a game where you can see how quickly you can achieve brutal murder as a surgeon, or even more, then this game is for you. Which means it's for everybody. Unless you don't like gore. Or doctors. Or watches that like to pop off. If you're a doc-guts-watchaphobe, then please stay away from this game. Otherwise, get it now. It's worth every penny."

The developer seems to have assumed that people will enjoy the fact that the control system is unreliable, unfinished, and inconsistent. (The basics of the game were developed in just TWO DAYS as part of a competition, and it shows.) True, it is funny the first one or two times when you accidentally sever the patients' oesophagus instead of removing a rib. (At least I THINK that's his oesophagus, it's hard to tell.) But when you find that the first (and ONLY) operation available to you can't be completed due to this ""humour"", you quickly stop smiling. The only reason I discovered a second operation to try is because I became so frustrated with the operating theatre that I went back to the reception area and started messing around with the objects there. If you somehow manage to insert the video cassette into the player (how quaint!), you get a bonus operation made available to you. This game is definitely a funny joke, for about five minutes. The question is, who is the joke being played on? The cartoon patient? Or the buyer of the game?Please DON'T buy this at full price, you'll be regretting it within a few minutes.

,Not Recommended,233720,22873232,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,Jon.Topps,"I understand that this game is supposed to be frustratingly awkward and difficult. I understand the whole point is that you derp your way through the game with limited success. However, it's just pointlessly unmanagable. I've watched YouTube videos where they perform the surgery I'm on. Then I go in, do the exact same thing (use a scalpal at a certain location), and nothing happens. I can do it for 5 minutes straight until he dies, and it won't cut, but others can do it in seconds.Also, certain things seem super bugged. For example, YouTubers can pinch the lungs and rip them out, from under the ribcage (shouldn't be possible, and looks super buggy in the video), but this is NEEDED in order to do the surgery fast enough. I try doing that for like 20 minutes and don't manage to do it even briefly one time.Another point, the things you need to do are really specific, and nothing else registers. For example, there will be a ton of intestines there, but only one tiny spot is actually able to be cut. If you drag sharp things anywhere else, nothing happens except blood loss. So really, you're just randomly using different tools on different parts of the person, until you find that ONE sweet spot. It's really just trial and error until you get it, and even then, it's so buggy that when you do the correct thing, it probably won't register.The whole game just seems to be either really buggy, or the devs made it so incredibly touchy that you can only successful do things 1/100 times. Too frustrating in my opinion."

Use two hands IRL and half your keyboard space, plus your mouse, just to control one hand that doesn't even have a full motion range. Sound ridiculous? It is. Oh so hilariously ridiculous...This is a game for those with a very broad sense of humour, or a well-hidden sadistic streak. When you tear out Bob's lung with a hammer, you have to either laugh, vomit or smile inwardly with sadistic glee. If you chose option one or three, then Surgeon Simulator is well worth the pricetag. If you chose option 2.... then don't watch the trailers.The gameplay is really really hard to describe adequately; but it's like the drinking game version of the boardgame ""Operation"". Basically, you're taking bits out of Bob (all three patients are apparently named Bob), and then you put a couple of bits back in. All on two time limits - an actual clock, and the ""hard limit"" of how much blood Bob can phyiscally lose before he/it dies.And Bob will die a lot. Sometimes you'll even get an achievement for killing him. But there are a lot of ""oh great the drill is stuck in him, I'd better get the hammer to pull it out... great, now the hammer is stuck too, hand me the circular saw"". Eventually you get an understanding of how each tool works and how each body part works; and after a messy time learning all these things you can start performing surgical feats.This game requires a mix of thought, motor skills, practice and patience. The patients, fortunately, are provided - make no mistake, if you tried performing surgeries in this manner IRL you *would* be going away for a long time. In fact, the thing you can leave at the door is realism - a working knowledge of anatomy may be helpful; but I'm thinking more of the kind of knowledge a butcher has than that of a medical professional. If you are a medical professional, leave all that Hippocratic Oath and ""duty of care"" stuff behind in Surgeon Simulator; at least to begin with. One day it will come in useful as you make precision moves to complete the surgery, but in the early days it's just a case of beating and stabbing the internal organs around until they fall out.I do reccomend this game as a casual, light-hearted bit of entertainment. Some people may like to take it further and develop the skills to be a ""pro surgeon"", but a lot more players will just enjoy stabbing poor Bob with a drill. And that's an entirely valid way to play Surgeon Simulator; you can get all your money's worth and more out of that kind of slapstick ""hmm I wonder what happens when I..."" messing around."

Any game that feels tedious and frustrating generally isn’t going to convince me to try and master it, a tutorial or free play would have been nice and allowed me learn the controls but without it Surgeon Simulator doesn’t promise anything worth hanging around for. The videos on YouTube are more fun than the game. I found the videos hilarious and couldn't resist buying the game, once playing, you realize just how bad the controls are, which I understand is intentional, but when it comes to getting stuck on level 2 for 90mins because the controls are so bad, you quickly lose interest and any ""fun"" value is long gone. I do not regret buying the game as I believe this company has potential and would like to see what their next endeavor is; I do like to support the intention behind the humour in gameplay, hopefully next time it can be a little more refined. I think it's unfortunate that they seem to pride themselves on how fast this was produced, it would have been better if more time was put into it."

Stuff clips through your hands, you can clip the lungs straight through the ribcage because it is so terrible. I have accidentally instant-killed a patient  because a tool clipped through the skull and got stuck inside the brain instead of breaking the exterior in the brain transplant operation. This severely lessens the fun, as you have little control on what mistakes you make. The force required to break bones also seems terribly inconsistent.Bonus points subtracted for pulling a petty publicity stunt with this trump stuff. Lelelele edgy political satire.It has obviously crossed a line. This isn't just run of the mill parody... this is just straight up harassment.This game is a neat idea, but it works extremely badly.

It might be funny, but the game has the worst control, tutorial and music among all these games I've ever played.To elaborate a bit, first, I really dislike this hand's movement/animation. This is the most clumsy hand/arm I've ever seen in both reality and any fictional work. Does it belong to any human or an ape? Can't believe its from a surgeon, it's a bumper car actually and can overthrow anything on the table. I broke my fore arm many years ago, then I couldn't clench my fist, which was still no worse than this pig hoof.And as for tutorial, there's no tutorial at all, so everything is so confusing, and I don't expect it to get any better later. Who can tell me how to do grab anything precisely with this claw?And also the repetitive stupid music! I am trying to save someone, it should be sth. that' really nerve-breaking, if these's any at all. I wouldn't listen anything close to it during any operation if I were a surgeon.Then here comes the definition of a simulator, which I believe can truely present sth. that's usually unfamiliar to a player in reality. But the game's more like a farce, not enough introduction of surgeon/surgery to a player with no medical background. Maybe I am too serious about games, but I would rather watch a slapstick and operate sth. carefully in a serious medical simulator, two things separately. So at least no cartoon graphics, and more gore needed!Glad I didn't succeed in sending out a copy to a friend of mine."

Possibly a simulation of trying to manipulate tools using a cotton-stuffed rubber glove, that is attached to strings that you kind of ""control"" with a keyboard. It is absolutely unplayable. The best I could do is drag the lifeless stump hand around knocking crap over. Picking stuff up in any useful way was an amazing stroke of luck when it happend. This type of game may be better suited as a cat toy simulation or something like that, where you could just swipe at things on the floor with your paw. Possibly get points for swiping things into targets? That would at least make it playable and get rid of the need for finger movements which really don't work. I can't imagine spending the amount of time it would take to simply learn how to pick up and use the saw... if that is even possible. Maybe it's not, I don't know. I could only handle playing it for 15 minutes, so it's possible I just don't get the humor or the ""fun"" of it, or I need 7 years of intense study and practice to master the controls enough to pick things up. Maybe that's how it simulates surgery? The amount of time it takes to be a doctor? Maybe.I would give this a score of 10/100. 5 for the interesting menu setup and 5 for not crashing."

Arm hits the patient's body and can't go low enough to reach kidneys. Angle the hand as far down as possible, still can't even touch the kidneys to take them out.I can use the controls just fine. But when you do everything correctly and the game still doesn't work, there's a problem. It's not my fault that wrapping my fingers fully around a tool fails to pick it up, and it's not my fault the hand hits an invisible wall that prevents me from taking the kidneys out.I'm not saying this is bad because of the controls.

Donald Trump surgery is where I draw the line. I’m good with political jokes but this was too much. I liked the heart of stone vs gold… the makeup set made me sick... the miniature trump tower made me laugh. But overall I sat there thinking, this is a billion-dollar man who is running for president. PRESIDENT. The most respected chair in the United States. To dish out this kind of satire/criticism/whatever you want to call it so willingly is so remarkably sad. This is not based on my views on Trump alone, anyone running for the presidency should be respected and understood, not bashed by the public and media. Where is the dlc for Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, Jim Webb, Darrel Castle, etc… This is poor taste."

Yeah- that was me around 10 minutes ago trying to play this game.Never before has a games control system enfuriated me so much. Have you ever been in one of those situtations where you know exactly what to do, but for some reason- you just can't do it? My ""blockade"" in this situtation was the controls, they are just terrible.The aim of the game is in the damn name, it's a surgeon simulator. You have to operate on patients with your hand, performing operations such as a heart transplant, for example. (How realistic).To move the hand, you use your mouse, which of course seems ideal however it turns out that each finger on the hand is controlled by a key on the keyboard, all of which seem to be in random places and are easily forgettable. This makes trying to pick up items borderline impossible.I'll admit, you get used to the enfuriating control system after around an hour of constant pumping frustration and the achievements in this game are somewhat humerous, an example being an achievement were you give the surgeon the finger (no, not like that).The game is cheap in price, so I can't complain that much, but honestly, I didn't have a great time playing this for the short time that I did and probably won't ever attempt it again as it stressed me out more than a single mother with 9 crying children."

The goal of each operation is to remove a failed organ and replace it with another, often with realism taking a step back for the gameplay. The controls can be likened to QWOP with its confusing and awkward controls, although getting a feel of them doesn't take too long to do each of the operations. Each operation can be summed up as break this bone or cut exactly here on the organ and remove it, and is loads of fun trying to flail around your hand. Graphically and musically it plays as parody of TV medical dramas like the first game with good music and funny yet semirealistic medical objects and organs. There's a small amount of operations with some variations, but the appeal is in the controls, physics, and humor. As an update to the popular web game, the full version of Surgeon Simulator 2013 brings humor and silliness to surgery to a very enhanced and appealing experience."

Difficult surgeries take longer, and if new players would be stuck in some areas...

It's a mixture of humour, difficulty and a lesson to teach gamers how life is so preciou... how fast and in what ways a person can die. Some of the achievements and surgeries are hard to achieve/unlock, and the easter eggs (Trisha that b*t*h left her phone number in sh*t*y places), and you have to be very creative to find them (or, actually, just use some internet). What I found the hardest in the beginning were the floppy disks, phone calls and videos. If you fail a surgery/achievement by a slight chance, you will be giving deep sighs and soon make a middle finger to poor Bob. Please, don't swear at him. He dies for us everytime we fail a surgery, or 'complete' a surgery...frankly speaking, no one would possibly live with their chest wide open.

At the moment of this writing, it is very short. Eight levels long, with  only three different procedures. The last two are variations of the iconic heart transplant. For someone that isn't adept at using their keyboard and dexterity, this game is hard. So basically, if you aren't prepared to take time to get better at this game, don't buy it and don't badmouth it.I think I paid full price for this, and I am more than happy with it. It's hard, but not unfairly hard like in Super Meat Boy or something like that. The game gives you tools and tells you you need to do X. Now I found doing was the easy part. I just had no idea how to do the procedures.So overall, this game is good for a laugh, you feel great once you finish a procedure and it provides a unique control system to master. If you're thinking about buying this game, go ahead and do so. If you're still not sure, I think the demo is around online."

Based on the life of a surgeon, you will be thrown into surgeries with little to no training in situations which are less than ideal such as a moving ambulance in which everything and anything inside the ambulance is flying everywhere and not to mention the back doors of the ambulance are wildly swinging open.Ignoring the settings which happen to pretty varied, the main aim of the game is for you to control the surgeon's arms and perform the different types of surgeries. This is easier said than done because controlling your character's arms are harder than trying to juggle standing on a chair whilst on a moving vehicle. This is what makes the game so fun and enjoyable, it is difficult but not impossible and you get plenty of laughs when you see all kinds of things falling into the patient.It is a short game but the bonus level is nice and fun addition. There is a grading system on each surgery based on how fast and how well you perform the surgeries so for all you hardcore gamers you can try and best all the surgeries. Nothing bad to say about this game except for the fact that it is short. It's a good addition to your steam game library."

The controls alone warrants a playthough and with silly instrament and hilariously frustrating levels I would recomend you get this game to everyone. Thsi game is also littered with secrets and copious amounts of clipping wich some people might say is a plus becuase it adds to the sillyness.  Some parts of the game are also quite frustrating becuase of the absured difficlty.  The game is very fun and is very rewarding 7.5/10
,Not Recommended,233720,8677799,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Bison Zabi,"The title itself is misleading. For those looking for a genuine realistic 'Surgeon Simulator'; then look elsewhere as the procedures come off as cartooney antics. Your average surgery involves smashing and ripping open a persons body without care and then plopping in a replacement organ or cutting  something out with brute force. While I am not personally annoyed by this, it would have been better had the developers chose a less serious title for the more wacky humor involved in the entire concept of the game.The controls are a huge factor for many who have played the game.. You could rename this to: Re tarded Limp Hand Simulator 2013, as it's major turn off to really enjoying the game. Every interaction between the limp hand and an object usually comes off awkward. You'll never be able to properly hold something like a bonesaw unless its angled in a proper position. Nor will you be able to use it properly (sawing bone) as it has the same effect as the hammer, where you just destroy anything that is in front of you.In short; if you're looking for a game based around surgery with a lot of depth, then I can't recommend it. There are other surgeon games that are vastly superior; one of them being the Trauma Center series found on the DS and Wii.If you're looking for a tongue and cheek humor game that doesn't take itself seriously yet suffers from awkward controls, then you'll find some value out of it. However only buy it when it goes on sale."

Truly a game to play for Achivement Hunting and for a challenge because they are difficult and they release updates once in a while for it so you can never be bored"

Of course, successfully completing a surgery is that much more satisfying simply because it’s so damn hard.This game ramps up the difficulty by giving you a bit too much control. Each finger on Nigel’s hand can be moved independently with the keyboard, his arm can be moved up and down by left-clicking, and his wrist can twist any way by right-clicking. While not horribly difficult to pick up, it is a challenge to control, and the resulting chaos is hilarious. Your surgical tools are not much better. You’ve got the obvious choices like scalpels and a bone saw, but you’re also provided with other, less customary tools. My personal favorite is the hammer, which is a great way to get past that pesky ribcage."

If you don't like long reviews but want a laugh somewhere..still read on. If you just wanna dislike my review because you hate reading, I could care less.Let's just take a moment to remember all the fallen Bobs whom have died for Nigel to be a true doctor. Finished? Okay good, because right now we're going to search Bob's brain for several reasons why this is a good game.Strap into your scrubs, trainee, because you're about to take over. Our best doctor has been taken out in a tragic gunfight and so you're in his shoes. Fix this patient, Nigel Burke, you're our only hope. I present to you, Surgeon Simulator.Now last time I checked this is the only Surgeon Simulator out there game wise on Steam, but don't let the name fool you. Not only do you have to carefully remove a certain patient's body parts in several areas and in several different locations, but you have to control a one-handed doctor whom seems to have no idea where the sharp part of the tomahawk the hosptial has lent you into the patient's skull. Nigel seems to have this inability to control his fingers without your assistance.As many of the reviews say, this is another QWOP game, but that's where they are wrong. This game is easier because if you lodge your hand in between the patients rib cage, you don't die from having somehow recieved a brain tumor. You have to use certain keys like QWOP, but you're in much more control than it's believed to. Some may find this easier than others of course, as this game does take a bit of mastery to actually complete. For example you may be extracting Bob's heart and you won't know where to cut the arteries connecting to it, seeing as you can't rip it out, so you swing your mighty scalpel until you cut whatever and pop goes the heart but at a cost of a ton of the patient's blood.The game is rather frustrating when you can't find the things you are looking for, but that just makes it all the more fun. Can't find your bonesaw anywhere? No problem, let's use the electric pizza cutter to cut open his ribcage and slice through the veins. No hammer to whallop the skull? Alright, let's use the axe and hopefully split his skull while hoping to cut the brain stem.There are a ton of fun things this game has to offer and many different ways to improvise your surgeries. It kills time while giving you a laugh as your buddy controlling the mouse throws the spare heart against the wall like a wet paper towel.9.7/10. Watch Rage Quit on it, it's what will want you playing with friends."

Through all the broken ribs, disemboweled stomachs, and new hearts, I have had a blast, and still come back to play the old and new surgeries for almost nostalgia, & being the first game I've ever 100%'ed, it holds a lot of pride, frustration, and joyous laughter, with myself and with my friends, and some of my family. Anyway, no single thing on Earth is perfect, even this game which I've talked up more than a fire tornado filled with sharks. Some of the very few flaws are the nigh impossible to achieve achievments, holy crap, I nearly ripped my hair out in anger for being one second off, or one pint of blood loss too much, and figuring out how to unlock the alien surgeries is a nightmare without a guide. And the controls. And Meet the Medic. And nearly impossible teeth in ambulance surgeries....However, these do not, or atleast should not, distract from the fact that this game is an original masterpiece, and I use that term very lightly, and it truly was a fun and interesting experiance for me, and I love it."

I understand the difficult controls and the difficult way it is to grab things, but clipping in this game is really annoying. There is focus on such a small area that clipping is an utter eye sore. A silly game is not a good excuse to let bugs slide like this. Is clipping fun, interesting, funny, or entertaining? Not really. It looks like lazy development.And then you have your hand getting stuck on things like coffee mugs, bones, etc. Most stuck related issues can be tied to clipping, in the first place. It's like the engine doesn't know what to do when your finger gets stuck in the side of a coffee mug. The mug vibrates in confusion in your hand as the Unity engine racks its brain trying to figure out how to fix the situation. A good few shakes will get it off, but I'm not really feeling how this helps the atmosphere/humor of the game. Just prevent polygons from going through other polygons.Besides my complaints, it's a fun game to play. The different enviorments are very challenging and interesting. Graphics are pretty decent, even with their cartoon-like qualities. The main menu is fun and creative. Plus $10 is a fair asking price, however this game goes on sale very often. I got it for around $3. Just add it to your wishlist and wait."

Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a dark-humored game that pits the shakey hands of Hardly-a-Doctor Nigel inside the body of your patient, Bob. From ripping brains out with your bare hands and stabbing organs with whatever tools you can manage to fit in your hands, this game is meant to be a medical nightmare. I highly suggest it as a silly, yet challenging, mini-game-esque game to run when you're bored of shooting up baddies.

I was confused at first about the controls, but the cool thing about the reception area is that it's a little sandbox full of interactive objects as fun as the actual surgery.When playing Nigel, the left handed surgeon (and quite like Dr. Nick Riviera), I explored the sick and twisted sense of humour of the game devs.  The game gives you full control of his hand and allows for movement across three dimensions.  The achievements, while sometimes hard to earn, are clever and reference certain pop culture that, when put in context of the surgery Nigel performs, is sick and twisted in the very best way.The only real issues I have had with interfacing involve the awkwardness of the hand controls.  When I sit down to my laptop computer, the first thing my left hand does is gravitate to WASD with my little finger on the shift key.  The AWERspace controls take some time in getting used to.  As for verisimilitude, there's no surgeon in the world who would perform surgery one-handed without wearing gloves.  But, that's not my problem (Dr. Nick Riviera washes his hands after surgery anyways, that's when there's most blood on them), nor is it any issue that I don't have to replace any of the vital organs I've been dropping on the floor.The game is full of hidden gems, one of them a clever reference toTeam Fortress II.If you're a dedicated fan of House, M.D. or other medical shows; and don't care if your patient survives or not, then this game iw worth your money."

Your keyboard will serve as your hands for this comedic simulator, each key bound to a finger. Best of luck actually having any kind of skill at this game, I've played it quite a bit and am yet to accomplish any level of skill for any of the surgeries within the game. Also, if you're expecting a realistic simulator, move on.GameplayThe gameplay does its job of being a wacky comedic style. You will miss injections, accidentally break bones, and probably rip out a few vital organs that really didn't need much attention given to them; it all adds to the comedy though. Surgeon Simulator manages to do what its supposed to do really well, and provide a fun experience for however long you can put up with these nonsensical controls.Graphics & SoundThe graphics are nothing amazing, but they do the job. The sounds are far too serious for a title this comedic, but I think that's all part of the charm. The graphics and sounds within Surgeon Simulator 2013 will make you think like you're doing your job properly, but I really wouldn't count on it.Storyline/Campaign/MissionsThere's no real storyline to this game, just a medical file full of many missions (and extras!) for you to get the most out of this title. There's enough content in this game to keep you going for a few hours, if you wanna' finish the whole game in one sitting. Otherwise, this is well worth the price.ReplayabilityHonestly, I can't find myself wanting to go through the pain over never being able to complete a level in my many days of gameplay, but I'm sure you will! The sense of completion Ican only imagine is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming history, so I can't see you wanting to go through that pain again.Game FeatureRating (/10)Gameplay9/10Graphics & Sound8/10Content6/10Replayability5/10Optimisation (Options Menu)5/10Value for Money ($9.99)8/10Overall7/10Additional NotesDon't expect a realistic simulator.Otherwise, an epic simulation!No real potential for replayability (in my opinion).Well worth the 10 bucks!"

Not very good but not total garbage either.This first-person-perspective game causes you to play as an incompetent, possibly drung surgeon's completely numb left hand (with one keyboard button controlling each finger) and has you trying to complete simple ""operations"" with nothing but the use of that left hand. The ""operations"" consist entirely of breaking through bone and ripping out cartoon-styled internal organs before dropping in replacement organs in a fairly imprecise manner. Essentially, this game, which is not very well made but has not major bugs either, is just for laughs (both yours and those who you relate your game experiences to) and for getting bizarre and disgusting steam achievements. This game fulfills its essential comedic purposes but doesn't really do much else.+Cartoon styled graphics which strike a fine balance between grossness and humor.+Excellent sound effects add to the humor.+Fun (though extremely unrealistic) physics simulation.+Fun steam achievements.+Fairly inexpensive (though short) game.+/- Poor and difficult controls which, while very frustrating, add greatly to the game's humor.-Very few ""operations"" (6 or 7 in all) very few modes, too few options, too much secret stuff which cannot be accessed via a menu, most of the game must be unlocked causing you to end up getting stuck on an extremely hard kidney transplant (for example) before being allowed to continue on to other, often easier ""operations.""-This game has a downloadable pack including more operations dubbed ""anniversary edition content"" for 3 more dollars which contains stuff that should have been included in the original game.-This game can easily become frustrating and has a very difficult learning curve.-There's a general feeling about this game that much, much more could have been done had the game's designers been more ambitious and that the game could have been a whole lot more fun than it is."

If you ever wanted to smash someone's brains in with a hammer, you can do that in this game, and it's totally legal.Anniversary Edition Review:Breaks a lot of things in the game.  The game turns far less lenient with organ placement, and occassionally outright doesn't allow you to win at all.  The hand has far more difficulty grabing objects now, and occasionally the hand will grab around the object you're wanting.  This did not occure in the base game.  Wait until the DLC is patched and fixed before purchasing it.  The surgery's are fun, but it makes some of them more frustrating than they should be, making the game hard, not through tricky controls, but through the game not working properly."

Keyboard controls the gripping of fingers, and house controls the hand motions.  This is where my major complaint is.  When you press Left mouse button, it moves hand DOWN only.  When you hold the Right mouse button and move the mouse around, it gives you wrist motion (flex, extend, rotate).  Trying to grab an instrument takes large chunk of time which takes fun out of the game.  Further more, because the movement is awkward, you really can't perform operations the way you want it.  I understand developers probably intentionally made award control to make the game more challenging, but to me it becomes more of frustration.  Also, in order to grab onto an instrument, you have to hold the keys constantly.  I'd like to do precisive maneuvers and holding keys all the time using instruments is very impractical.Next is the game play.  There's NO tutorial on how to actually use the controls.  Albeit it makes it bit challenging and interesting at first level of impression, people with little patients will probably get frustrated easily and give up.  Also, there's NO tutorial on how to use instruments and what instruments should be used.  This also can get little frustrating, but but most tools are familiar and things you know how to use.I've read that when you drop organ, you have to restart the game.  Now I haven't been gone that far yet, but I've dropped a tool and I can't pick it up.  I find this unappealing aspect of the game.  Also, for some reason when I try to grab certain instruments game activates 3D mode.  I have no idea how it gets turned on; sometimes I was able to turn off the 3D trying to regrab the instrument while most of the time I'm unsuccessful.Game concept is good, and I wanted to like it but it fails in control mechanism which is crucial part of the game.  It's a simulation game that try to simulate bit too closely to real life with bit complicated yet crude control system.  Unless they change the game control system to make it bit easier, I would not recommend this game.Apparently there are some people who really enjoy this game.  If you have nothing better to do, and are/can be very patient, highly motivated & thrilled by extreme challenge go ahead and give it a try.  Other wise, skip it."

,Recommended,233720,8316789,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,ffrinch,"Hilarious ""simulation"" from the QWOP school of play: the joy of the game is in fighting the terrible, terrible controls to perform delicate surgery. Well, ""delicate"" might be the wrong word -- a transplant is considered a success if the relevant replacement organs are dropped into the body, despite not actually being connected (and despite all other organs having been torn or cut out).Later levels get even better/worse, with operations repeated in an ambulance driven by someone even less capable at driving than you are at surgery (implements and organs flying everywhere, including out the back doors), and then in zero gravity (don't let those replacement kidneys float away!). There are a lot of lovely little easter eggs too -- trying to operate after accidentally stabbing yourself with anaesthetic is even harder.It would be unwise to expect a lot of replayability, but it's hilarious while it lasts, especially with friends.  Frustrating controls have never been so much fun!"

It is fun for the first 10 minutes playing around with the controls but then you come to the conclusion on what the ♥♥♥♥ do I do. Nothing is explained in the game. I know this was a Game Jam game but at least put some text explaining what something does.I accidently touched one of the needles and my screen started to freak out. That was fun for the first time but not 4 other times because I touched it while trying to pick it up. The controls seem fine at first but again you need depth when moving around. It gets hard figuring out where your hand is. At least they could have added some opacity to see stuff below the hand. At first I was impressed about the fidelity of the controls and how buttons are bound to fingers. Then I realised they are garbage. A baby has an easier time picking up some stuff then you would in this game. It is better just to brute force the game than try to be precise.Overall it is hard to recommend this game. It is a cool indie project but that is it. Controls seem to fall off and it is too easily to loss a tool where you have to restart the game. The music is cool retro style but then it starts looping and gets super annoying. It might be better if you have something like the Oculus Rift but other than that this is just a novelty and nothing more.

This normally ends up with you holding a hammer between two fingers, the wrong way round, with your palm facing upwards, frantically trying to swing it at the patients ribs.I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so watched some online tutorials.  They appear to carrying out the operations in exactly the same way.I suppose that may be appealing to some people but I found it far too frustrating."
