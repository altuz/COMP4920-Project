You can name the characters after your real life friends and it makes it kind of heart wrenching when you have to put one down or they get sick or held hostage. You really get putintothe game and realize how difficult it is to scavange and survive during a zombie outbreak. Replay is great and doesn't really get all that old. Aiming is kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ if you look up videos for it you'll understand what I mean (it's so hard to explain), but you can overlook that.

,Recommended,233740,12783497,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,Litvac,"Organ Trail's pretty damn fun. It's essentially Oregon Trail with zombies and a bunch of Left 4 Dead references.I had the iOS version before buying the Steam version, and I feel like the game's easier to control on a computer as far as shooting goes. That being said, shooting is still a ♥♥♥♥♥ as far as controls go, and it's difficult to nail on the head. Some of the in-game passersby even acknowledge the problems with the controls by stating, ""These controls suck!"" (They do.) But having a mouse removed the issue of my finger blocking parts of the screen.The writing is often times humorous and references things from the original game to Castlevania. It gives Organ Trail a certain charm and unusual atmosphere. Some of the locations throughout the game are rather humorous as well (one of these being--I kid you not--a strip club), and it gives me the impressions that the developers made this purely for fun, which I find admirable. It's always nice to find a game that convinces players that the people who made it definitely had a kickass time doing so.I've noticed that, while the overall gameplay is generally difficult (even on normal), it gets progressively harder as you move further down the map, which I found reasonable, in my opinion. That being said, it's very good at screwing you over, as nothing's worse than wasting half your food and all your time stuck on the side of the road trading away for enough scrap so that you can attempt a repair on the car that ultimately fails, causing you to waste all your scrap. That actually happened to me. It's not fun. However, to an extent, the game is as difficult as your are good at strategizing and planning a course of action. You will blame yourself many times for the mistake you've made. Many times, crises can be avoided or worked around if you're prepared enough. Yet, given this, random events still occur, and if the odds aren't in your favor, you could end up doing well to being dead in a few miles. It's always important to be cautious in this game as a result.The music is also spot-on as well. Amidst all of the humor and gags, it gives Organ Trail a more solemn tone. Also, it's generally interesting to listen you and combines an 8-bit feel with a more ""advanced"" (if that's the word) sound to it. I don't quite know how to explain it. But it's really well done, in my opinion.The graphics are also very charming and reminiscent of the original games. They work really well. Not sure what else to say here. I like them a lot.Also, the Clement's Quest minigame is hilarious. It's essentially a TL;DR Organ Trail where you control the car and run over zombies as quickly as you possibly can. I discovered it on accident and couldn't have been happier that I did.Basically, to put it bluntly, despite the game's difficulty, I really enjoy this game and always have a good time while playing it. It was worth purchasing it the second time, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and a nostalgic, yet new take on a classic."

It plays just about the same as the original game did, making it an extremely fun play. It demands a combination of skill, foresight and luck in an environment that changes often, giving this game high replay value. Shooting and escape segments control surprisingly well, and random events feel a bit more balanced than in its predecessor.CONS:Zombie shtick is very tired. There is virtually no educational value in this, which I felt was half the fun of the original! The game assumes you are familiar with Oregon Trail, so if you are new to this there may be a slight learning curve in properly managing your resources.WORTH:A single game does not take very long to get through, less than half an hour. However, one or two playthroughs is not what Organ Trail is about. You could easily get 30 hours out of it, especially if you do completionist play. $5.00 is a very fair price for it.OVERALL:This isn't Oregon Trail exactly, but I'm happy there is some version of it on Steam complete with achievements, cards, twitter options and online leaderboards. It blowsSuper Amazing Wagon Adventureout of the water and is the current go-to to satisfy this nostalgic desire.SCORE:8/10Full Review Coming Soon"

Organ Trail takes it's primary inspiration from the original Apple II iteration of The Oregon Trail and opens with your character encountering Clement, a fellow survivor who kick-starts your odyssey across a post apocalyptic United States. Much like the game it parodies, Organ Trail is about balance. You will need to ensure that your party is fed, rested and your car in tip top mechanical condition. With every mile that ticks by your parties health degrades as well as your trusty station wagon. Injury and disease are common occurrences on the road as evidenced by the many tombstones that can be encountered on your journey. These tombstones are not only reminders of the peril that face your party but also opportunities for upgrades and supplies. Party members can be bitten on your voyage and may require a euthanizing rifle blast to the head. Of course, if you are a misanthropic sociopath you could always off your healthy party members and not have to worry about keeping them fed and healthy. Dotting the trail to safety are landmarks and cities that allow your party to trade, buy and sell items, upgrade your car and purchase perks for your character. You can also take on jobs to earn some cash or supplies and chat the locals up for information.Scavenging is often the easiest way to stay supplied on your journey. By opting to scavenge an open field pops up with random items spawning. Little green zombies home in on your character as you attempt to scoop up scrap for car repairs, food for nourishment, and cash for additional supplies. It's possible to defend yourself from the zombie onslaught while scavenging with a rifle. You must click and pull your mouse back which brings up a line of site on the screen which you can then spin while in a fixed position to dial your site in on the revolting rotting flesh heaps that converge on your position. Releasing fires and these controls take a bit of time to acclimate yourself to. A couple of seconds to reload between each round ensures a bit of tension as you scramble for goodies. Bosses are also randomly encountered on these scavenging excursions. They are more robust creatures that put up a bit more of a fight than your average walking corpse.The jobs that are on offer use variations of these mechanics. Some require you to defend a position by taking cover and killing zombies before they reach your position, some have you locating an item in a scrolling field while zombies swarm and the last variant has you trading gun shots with others humans in fortified positions. These mini games can feel repetitive after a while since your character doesn't receive new weapons and enemy types are limited. The randomness of these events will keep you coming back however. Also, random encounters with biker gangs and hordes of zombie deer mix things up while in your station wagon. Random interactions with other travelers on the road also spice up the core game and offer a little bit of narrative. Prompts will appear that ask if you feel inclined to investigate something on the road. Doing so kicks off an old school adventure sequence that often results in a reward of some sort. This touch adds quite a bit of re-playability to Organ Trail. While the randomness of Organ Trail ensures a new experience every time it can  also lead to frustration. It's not uncommon for tragic events to occur in quick succession and take out a party member or even your party leader. It can be upsetting, perhaps off putting for some, when a well supplied and positioned expedition fails because of a bout with dysentery and broken ribs...Ultimately Organ Trail: Director's cut is one of the best games to emerge from the zombie zeitgeist that has gripped popular culture over the past half decade."

That may sound negative, but Organ Trail basks in its own mediocrity in a way that only the finest parodies can, and for that I thank it for going to such lengths to recreate the experience of it's inspiration with zombies to such a fine grade. It's the perfect nostalgia punch, with all the love a real fan of the game could have.The extras and features sprinkled throughout the game are more than worth their salt, and while not all are as polished as I would like (the car minigame comes to mind), they all add to a package that is already spilling over with charm and substance.Worth it?

I know it was supposed to be secretly educational, but looking back I learned nothing of any value playing it. Regardless, I loved every minute of it.I picked up Organ Trail for something like 27 cents (I don’t remember the exact amount but it was low enough that I could recoup the loss by picking up change in a parking lot) and when all was said and done I got exactly what I expected of it: a silly, over the top interpretation of the classic Oregon Trail formula. I bought supplies, hunted zombies instead of the buffalo/duck hunt mini game, repaired my station wagon as opposed to an ox drawn wagon, and had everyone in my party die of the same disease as my settlers did all those years ago.If you’re looking for a quick, silly re-imagining of Oregon Trail you would not regret picking Organ Trail up in a sale."

,Recommended,233740,12317468,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,mistersneak,"Instead of going to Oregon to stake a claim on America's future, you decide the fate of a group of survivors looking for a safe place to live in a post-apocalyptic world overridden by zombies.  You travel from Washington DC, that's about to be nuked, all the way to a safe haven in, you guessed it, Oregon.  The game is faithful in every way it can be to the Oregon Trail, except where it could be made more thematically appropriate to a zombie apocalypse, with multiple additions to improve the simulation and theming.  Seriously, name a feature from Oregon Trail and it's there.  Dysentary?  Check.  Bad water?  Check.  Tombstones?  Check.  You get the picture.Oregon Trail's 'hunting' minigame, being the best part of the original, has become a bit more central to the experience with Scavenging and Jobs using it, with a few others including Defense, Surrounded and Bandit Raid events using the same shooting mechanics.When Scavenging, you no longer shoot a 2000 pound buffalo to carry back 100 pounds of meat.  Instead you rummage around a wilderness, collecting any supplies that pop up (including food, cash and scrap that you can use to repair your car), while avoiding and shooting zombies that swarm in on you.  Learning to control the flow of these zombies to reduce the amount of ammo I have to spend was a fun mechanic to master (no doubt aided by my recent experience with Gauntlet), and I must say, is probably the best way to ensure your victory at the game.In a funny way, Organ Trail is one of the most complete zombie apocalypse simulations I've played, and if you like the genre, you really should play it just because it's a fun game.  If that's not enough to attract you, maybe the novelty of recreating the Oregon Trail experience on a modern platform with a modern genre is enough.  I would happily recommend Organ Trail even at the premium price of five bucks."

,Recommended,233740,28465490,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Bobdude,"What to say about Organ Trail?It's Oregon Trail, re-upped and zombified. If you like the Oregon Trail, get this. If you didn't like the Oregon Trail, you will not like this. If you don't know what Oregon Trail is, or are neutral towards it, I'll explain.Organ Trail replaces the covered wagon of its inspiration with a station wagon, fills it up with a couple people you will inevitably name after either fictional characters or real-life friends and family, and then tasks you with getting them across the country alive. This is easier said than done, this being the zombie apocalypse and all, and you'll need all the meager help you can get.The game is based more on tactical decision-making than it is on high-octane gameplay, though there are more than a few tense moments. Everything about Oregon Trail is now zombie-related: you're attacked by zombies instead of bears (or zombie bears), instead of fording a river the highway is covered in zombies, instead of dysentary you get dysen-- okay that one stayed the same, but the other ones are different.The biggest draw that I still feel to this game is its approach to your ""leadership"" to the group. At any time, you can choose to execute one of your friends. They get no replacement, you're essentially shooting yourself in the leg here and hurting your chances of making it to the end. The main reason why you would ever do this is if they've been infected. It's a tough choice to make, and the game doesn't just let you get away with hitting the ""kill them"" button and  moving on. You have to wait until you're all sitting around a campfire, hit the button to shoot them, and then, in a game dominated almost entirely by menus, you are taken to a small cutscene of you holding a gun to the person you intend to kill. They don't resist, they don't say anything, they just stand there. The game doesn't let you just get rid of them, you have to look them in the eyes and pull the trigger yourself, then watch their body slump to the ground in front of you. It's far more powerful than it has any right to be, especially on a more intense, serious run where you've begun to get attached to your party.The game isn't perfect, though. Its general replayability is high, but its brevity means that you'll probably be spent after about 6-7 runs, which will take around 10 hours or so.The weakest point of the game is the finale; it's a final, incredibly tense mission, where success means victory and failure means back to square 1. Without giving anything away, I'll just say it's not terrible, but it definitely could have been done better, especially when it comes to how it handles your remaining allies.Overall? I think this game is worth the price if you're a fan of the source material, and if not, then it's still worth the sale price.7/10 seems fair. A modest recommendation. Oh, and there IS a Flash version online, so check that out if you want to know what you're getting into before you buy."

Conveniently located across the entirety of the United States, in Oregon. Reason being that the US is nuking cities overrun by zombies, which happen to include all of the East Coast, where you start.True to its origins, it's displayed as an Apple ][ game, with 8 bit sprites and bleeps and bloops for sound effects. The music is damn good though.Like in The Oregon Trail, you must manage your dwindling supplies and grueling pace across the long journey. Unlike in The Oregon Trail, there's a lot moregamein this game. Random events still pop up across your journey in a station wagon (hue), but are less frequently going to instantly cull one of your gang. Scavenging plays a big part in keeping your food supply high, but it's a hazardous endeavour in the 45 second long bit of gameplay an hour of scavenging is condensed into. In a bit of a twist, money remains important for buying resources in settlements and cities, and for upgrades on your character or your car, despite the zombies.Across your trek through the USA, you must monitor your party's condition, which is impacted by the size of the food rations, and your station wagon's integrity, which goes down faster if you're pushing it to 60mph. Every in-game hour of travel your party stops to rest and do other things - including breaking legs (lampshaded in a random passerby's dialogue), finding some food, sitting too hard on a fuel can or 4 and ruining them, or, infamously, contracting cholera, which just makes them lose health faster. At every stop you can check their condition, opt to rest and regain health, apply medkits to quickly heal, or put them down for any reason, or for no reason.You also get random events: your gang may be taken hostage by raiders and you need to carefully aim to kill the bad guy without doing in your friend too, or just kill them both you sicko; you have to cross a horde of zombies by either waiting for them to become docile, or going guns blazing; dodging ravenous zombie deer or ramming into biker raiders; and special encounters with people who might need your help.Most importantly, the tombstones are a thing, and they are absolutely hilarious. You can leave your own tombstone when you die, too, and then you can come across it again in a separate run.oh boy what a great dayThe base game offers a very healthy selection of content, and while the base gameplay loop doesn't change across runs, random events and the degree of refuge in audacity certainly do. If you like what it has on offer, the Final Cut DLC is absolutely worth it: roughlydoublethe content, and adding new stuff like choosing what route to take, with pros and cons, dealing with radiation poisoning if you go for the risky but time saving paths, extra skins for your character, extra vehicles to play in, and a couple other smaller things here and there too!But what doesn't change is your party's predisposition to break limbs randomly at stops."

A great trick, if you have the food, is to wait out zombie hordes that you have to pass through, it gives you great health bonuses. Well good luck out there! Oh yeah, review, review! Closing, this is a great, fun game, and if you can get it for cheap, you should pick it up."

I would call it a ""retro survival sim"": a zombie apocalypse ended the world as we know it. You and your friends try to cross what once was the USA from the East Coast to the West, chasing a rumor known as ""Safe Haven"", a stronghold where the zombie outbreak seems to have been controlled. Your job is to admin everything until you reach Safe Haven, that is gas, money, routes, including scavenging for food, at what hours you should best do so, keeping an eye out for your ammo, deciding if you should keep going to the West Coast with your bitten friend or if he is a potential menace to the whole group and should be rather put down, if you should risk breaking your car driving for another mile in the hopes of finding a better trading spot, etc., etc.These tasks may appear mundane at first, but once you soak in the rather dark atmosphere and realize how close you have become to those pixels with the name of random friends, the game becomes a tragic story of a group just trying to survive and their everyday trying to do so. And you are the leader.It's so much fun to experience and imagine the situation you go through. One moment you'll think you made a great deal buying that tire for so cheap, the next you'll curse yourself for not having rather invested in scraps. And while on the road, you'll sometimes encounter little ""choose-your-own-adventure""-like events with fellow survivors, some friendly, others not so much, spicing up the experience.Organ Trail is impressively immersive, given it's Atari graphics and lack of a deeper canon story. It's one of those video game experiences in which the game only makes the rules, while you make the story in your head, and I think this is the strongest point here.But as good as it is, it has some very nasty bugs that can bring you serious frustration. For example, I just was at the end of the game, a comrade died and the game refused to advance until I fed all of them to the zombies. As if this wasn't enough, the game got stuck after defeating the final boss. After having spend my time carefully administrating my crew from coast to coast through hordes of zombies, this wasn't a rewarding pay off. I just wish such issues were patched already, since they happen relatively often with me, let's say, every 3rd or 4th playthrough.Be it as it is, though, I can only recommend Organ Trail as a fantastic game for those who like just make up and imagine their own zombie stories while playing along."

The good thing about this game is that it is actually fun to play and it doen't just rely on the fake retro style for nostalgia. I am one of those people who grew up playing Oregon Trail in the computer lab at school (although the version I was familiar with was a later version of the game that this is based on) and this game does a good job recreating the feel of the original, and it actually improves on it. But this game is not simply a re-make of Oregon Trail either; although it is based on that game, it is also a new game itself.I think it is definitely worth its price because it is fun and has a great replay value."

Instead of traveling from Ye Olde Point A to Ye Olde Point B, you're traveling across the country to get to a self-proclaimed ""Safe Haven"" that sort of acts like the Oregan Territory in this particular version.

It is an improvement not just because of the zombie aspect and the nostalgic graphics, but also because of the constant Chuck Norris jokes and the subtle oddity of the strange abundance of car parts owned by absolutely everyone you meet, and yet the sudden dissapearence of the one you need just when you need it.As said earlier, this game is harder than it looks, as there are CONSTANT random events that will, more often than not, impede your progress to the Safe Haven. However, this means that, each time the game is played, it will be totally different from any other time.This game is a neverending supply of both fun and frustration, and, in my opinion, worth the purchase."

I can tell you that with the expansion, this game is pretty fun.  It's not particularly hard on the normal difficulty, so you might wanna ramp it up a bit if yer a veteran.  Granted, it does take some play time to get used to the swing of things, but one or two playthroughs should do for that.  What controls there are handle the way that they should, so minigame segments are easy enough to get the hang of.  The core of the gameplay seems to come more from being good at managing yer little party's survival.  There's plenty of that to be done and a decent amount of customisation to change things up.  Different road events do well enough to keep things interesting.  A couple different modes and plenty of unlockables and secrets make replays pretty worthwhile.  There are some glitches that I've encountered that can stop the game from progressing but loading the save seems to remedy that.  The soundtrack is equal parts retro, moody, and even epic.  While not terribly exciting, the game can put you on the edge of yer seat.  Content isn't huge but it's big enough to keep ya comin' back for a little while.  For the price, it's a good game."

NoI get what they are trying to do with this game, but the lack of tutorials within make it just flat out annoying considering it is a rogue like.  There are a ton of different encounters, but with the pixelated graphics and practically zero instructions on how to do any of them, you are bound to fail over and over again which usually means the death of a party member.  Given that you can't go back on any of this, it often means that you have to scrap your play-through and start over from the beginning just so you can maybe learn the controls for that particular event, blah.I like the idea of a rogue like game that follows a group over a long stretch of road that is riddled with random encounter and so on, but it would be nice if you were given some idea of what you  are supposed to do before the encounter or how the controls even work.After starting over for the 3rd time because I lost a party member to lack of instruction,  I got fed up.Leave this game alone"

The Music is a factor but so is the music. I feel like people are being eaten, things are bleak and grim in this chaotic outbreak spanning across mainland america. The game ultimately is extremely bleak and sometimes even masochistic at times, even gameplay. I mean seriously, what other game do you have where you get a choice between marrying a bride to her groom's corpse or to put her out of her misery and blow her brains out? I felt like a Devil playing this game, offing each of my members to get to my location. I felt like my Car constantly was breaking down and we had nowhere to run, even when we stopped by to examine the dead in their graves! (Which is pretty stupid, i mean why would you do that. Would make sense if it was the graves of your fellow team but its not.)The Gunplay is literally Apple 2 esque, you ""draw"" the line you want to shoot with your mouse, it takes alot of getting used to but its a mechanic chosen well, otherwise this game's combat would be very easy. You also walk at a SNAILS Pace while running from zombies, and should judge the distance of the undead with which location you should go. Juking the Zombies, its been done similar in other games and remains a interesting mechanic that makes it much easier to survive the combat portions of Organ Trail.Also the wages you get paid are ridiculous and the difficulty ratings are extremely intimidating initally, the higher ones are defintely not to be taken lightly and i'd recommend wasting a few peons on it to get used to the missions because your not getting money any other way besides taking jobs. Money is so important, i cannot unstate how much ive seen my own people die because ive been a few dollars short of a medkit or my entire car fall to pieces in a few miles. Its rage inducing but there is something in Organ Trail that i see in Risk of Rain almost, where in that i just NEED to find a way to make it all work. Its that which makes it all the more devastating or victorious when you actually Win or Lose in this game.Its hilariously cheap, to a level that i think it personally doesn't deserve but i come back to this title every now and then for another ride on the amazing organ trail.TL:DR?Fun but Nigh on Masochistic. Gameplay takes learning.Defintely a great title to get at the price. Recommended."

The graphics are 8-bit like, it really adds to the game if you grew up playing Atari 2600, Nintendo and older PC games. The music and setting is quite awesome. Instead of a horse and wagon, you are in a station wagon after a Zombie apocalypse. You are traveling across the United States in the ""Family Truckster"". You have to scavenge and trade for supplies, and of course fight off lots of zombies. The shooting part takes a minute to get used to, but once you get the hang of it you will be blowing away zombies and also bandits like crazy. It plays more like a role-playing game a bit. You have random encounters that adds to the game everytime you play. If you are looking for a completely different game to play, this one is it. See if you can survive, and try for a high score.

This is my assinine opinion, but still is valid because of the following:The game is my dream in terms of style. Fantastic job with the graphics that may have taken up little to no time to make. I just love the old style that they present. The clicking when you click on something is so important that I click my way to death, literally. Just to hear the click sound.The story is pretty loose because it just throws you into it with this cool guy at the beginning but once you learn what the game is about and how to generally play it, it becomes a severe addiction.If anyone hates spoilers then cease your eyeballs from moving any further.. Did you stop?... STOP READING!!!Anyway, the basic format of the game is to drive to a ""Safe Haven"" across the U.S., roaming from D.C. all the way to the western part of the U.S. It's all fun and games the whole way there. I mean if you wanted to have fun and♥♥♥♥♥♥around the whole time, you could. The only thing is, you'll pay for it at the end. This is how the game works. Throughout your travel across the U.S. (In a beat up station wagon, I might add) you will encounter either opportunities or events. Events are forceful, opportunities are choices. The choices in opportunity and completion of the events don't affect you, it's how you manage your supply of food, ammo, spare parts, Ect, along the way. By the end, you may have had a ball and assumed that this is it, this is you ending the game. However, the game will throw you this epic curve ball that will suck the life out of all your characters. Now, I will not reveal what the ending is or the objective. That's TOO MUCH SPOILER. However, I will say, that if you play for fun, don't play the end.Fun game for the old souls who need a good sound check and visual revamp. Best thing about this amazing game is the music.

I can clearly say that I love this game. Naming your rag-tag group of survivors after friends, and soon letting yourself be more immersed in the atmosphere and looking past the retro pixel graphics, you got yourself a zombie survival game. It's really a huge part of my own personal fun of how I can imagine and experience my friends or certain people coming along to my ride, going through starvation, infection, bandits, zombies, and the like. With the chores of taking care of supplies, you can go at the game with your own pace, either it be conservative, going at a slow pace while trying to save as much food by starving your party, or much more aggressive/safe where you go as fast as possible, pushing your car to limits, as you give a huge buffet for all your party members to keep them healthy. There are two main modes to the game. There's the campaign mode;moving from Washington D.C all the way to the west coast to your final destination: Safe Haven. Then there's Endless mode, with you going as far as possible in the fastest pace for more points, trying to keep yourself, and (depending on your playstyle.) keeping your party alive. This is honestly a great simple game, with an amazing soundtrack along with lots of events occuring along with RNGesus to dicate a slow-death, or a plentiful gold mine of food, medkits, and other supplies. With the complete edition DLC, all your fun with the game only doubles, now adding extras! Such as even MORE RNGesus to give you more ways to death, a lot more choices in what you do. An amazing parody/redesign to the original Oregon Trail. Every dollar was worth it."

If I had to describe the genre it would be towards simulation where you have to manage resources. Combine that with the quirky humor (and pixel art) you expect from indie games.My only complaint is that the gun controls are kind of strange. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I play with an unusual control setup so it's kind of difficult for me.

That said...I didn't have a good experience. Some of the mini-games upon leaving settlements are fun (e.g. biker attack, etc.), and the scavenging is interesting for the first handful of times. After that, everything just felt pointless.Resources: While scavenging, you only ever find 3 of the 8 or so resources you need. It quickly became quite boring to always find the same 3 things over and over again. I ended up with uselessly huge stockpiles of these resources to the point that they became irrelevant, and spent days waiting for traders to come by and offer to trade for anything else. This may be better on harder difficulties, but it was my first time through, so ""normal"" seemed like the logical choice.Party: As far as I can tell, there's no point to keeping your party alive other than just for the sake of keeping them alive. This is easier said than done, not because it's actually hard to care for them, but because they randomly wander off, and there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe I just had bad luck, but by 2/3 of the way through the trip all but one of my party had died this way. Maybe there's something that happens at the end if you have more survivors, but I never made it there because...With just a few stops left, my party saw ""something interesting"" happening off the highway. I chose to invesitage, and the game locked up. Just a black screen with the music playing and a little decorative pattern at the top. Apparently this is a common problem.Other reviewers here seem to like it. I found it repetitive, and all the progress I made was too easily wiped out by completely random mechanics and technical problems, making the game more frustrating than fun.TL;DR: Repeatedly scavenged for the same 3 items in order to feed a party that wandered off and died anyway. Then the game crashed. There are better games available for $5. If you can get it for a buck or two on sale, it might be worth it."

Not sure what wouldn't have worked about just clicking in the direction you want to shoot. You'd think with how much combat is a core mechanic of the game that how shooting works would be a lot more intuitive.

The shooting mechanics are a bit clunky, but when you practice you’ll get better at it. Use a mouse; using a Facebook’s machine’s mouse pad will leave your tired and frustrated. Cute music and sound effects, the pixelated graphics will grow on you. It’s a fun spin on the traditional game. It’s a good game to burn sometime on, and you’ll find yourself amused at your friends catching dysentery because we all know the only people who know of such a disorder are the people whose virtual bffs got it while playing the Oregon Trail.

The goal of the game is to make it from the east coast of the usa to the west coast. If you take into cosideration that a zombie apocalypse is taking place while you are trying to achieve that, it certainly doesn't make things any easier.The gameplay is simple but really intense: You and 4 other survivors (which you can name however you like) travel in a car from landmark to landmark. On the way from one landmark to another there are various things that can happen: You get robbed by thieves who steal your fuel, someone gets bitten by a zombie, a horde of deers appears behind you and you have to dodge them, someone gets sick, etc. etc.On the landmarks you get the chance to trade with other survivors for food, fuel, medkits, etc. You get to scavenge for supplies, repair your car or get perks from traders.All in all the gameplay is pretty simple, but awfully intense. The fact that you never know what happens on the road and the feeling you get when you are close to the safe haven but you don't know if you can make it because you are low on fuel or food is really nervewrecking and well done.Oh and the graphics and sound are phenomenal. 8-bit awesomeness from top to bottom.I'd recommend this game. The replayabilty is also pretty high, since every run is different and there is an endless mode to sum it all up. It's definitely worth 5 bucks. And if you are not sure, try out the free flashgame on the interwebs."

Along the way, you have to cross rivers, stop off in towns for supplies, scavenge (hunt), and hope your team members don't get dysentery!I never thought that a ""reskin"" of another game could be so cool; especially a game that, at its core, was a bit dorky once you get past the nostalgia factor. The hunting was super legit back then, but I don't care about crossing the country as a settler in the 1800s and worrying about my supplies.

I have 8 different game consoles going back to the SEGA Master System, and I still play them all. Any game that can offer a memorable experience with a big dose of familiarity is likely to score points with me. Organ Trail delivers.My love of zombie lore is well known, so a game that promises cannibalistic carnage is already on the wishlist. But the real reason I'm recommending this little gem is for the mental rush it gives me. I feel like I'm back in 2nd grade computer class, and Miss Eissens said we could stop the typing and play. I spent many frustrating and rewarding hours shooting buffalo and fording rivers, only for Mary to get dysentery and die horribly. The original Oregon Trail is one of those games that everyone has played, whether they're a gamer or not. Organ Trail is a faithful homage and a ridiculous zombie apocalypse yarn as well. The graphics are simple, 16-color pixels, the controls are hair-pullingly difficult to master, and even on the lowest difficulty setting, you are not reaching Safe Haven without taking a few hits. The random events include blizzards, sandstorms, and bandits. You have to keep your party healthy, and you have to make sure your station wagon doesn't break down. You'll also have to ford hordes of zombies, engage in shoot-outs with gangs, and buy and sell food, ammo, scrap, fuel, car parts, and medkits.There are loads of references to other zombie games and films, including Left 4 Dead, Zombieland, Evil Dead, and many, many more. The game has a juvenile sense of humor and a pleasing measure of self-awareness; it's possible to encounter a stranger in town who simply says ""these controls suck!""There are nearly 30 achievements and over 300 unique tombstones to find (including... YOUR OWN!), encouraging replayability. Endless mode and Clements Quest are also welcome additions to the formula, and there's in-game ""Skulls"" to shoot for while playing. Heh. Skulls. Shoot. I'm funny.Organ Trail is not going to please everyone. This game is not for the hardcore FPS player or someone who wants an in-depth story and simple controls. This game is for people who remember the ecstacy and the agony of playing Oregon Trail back in the day and thinking ""yeah, it's fun, but it could use more zombies."""
,Recommended,233740,4724144,"Posted: 20 July, 2013",all,CaptainTempest,"An interesting, parodical take on the notorious and educational Oregon Trail games. However, instead of a covered wagon of pioneers trekking from Missouri to Oregon across the 19th-century American Midwest, replace all that with a station wagon of survivors trekking from Washington, D.C. to California across post-apocalyptic America. From the gameplay to the graphics, everything in Organ Trail: Director's Cut pays homage to the classic Oregon Trail for the Apple II, but it adds its own interesting twists for a unique experience. Multiple difficulty levels, game modes, unlockables, achievements, and other various extras give it a good amount of replayability. The controls are a little wonky and take some time to get used to, but the game is solid otherwise. Amidst a sea of other zombie games, Organ Trail: Director's Cut manages to be unique by creatively merging multiple ideas, both modern and classic, to create a rewarding gameplay experience."

It's essentially the exact same thing, except with ZOMBIES! And the APOCALYPSE! Okay, that sounds way more stupid when I say that out loud.Just pick 4 of your friends to get ki- I mean, travel with you to the western coast because..... I don't know. Every city is essentially the same, except the supplies are different and people actually give you jobs. No, not those kinds of jobs. Just go across the street and pick up a box for 2 dollars while a swarm of the undead follows in pursuit, those kinds of jobs. Here's a tip for newcomers: They are a load of bullcrap. You also have to sleep alot if your friends want to heal themselves, so that's 5% of the game right there. Scavenging is also fun since you get more supplies than just meat. I'm not sure what kind of idiot just leaves his wallet right in the middle of the woods.The worst part of the game is anytime somebody gets kidnapped. If that happens, you might as well blow up your save file since I have never figured out how to get your friend back without them being shot. Every time, either I shoot him/her, or the bandit does. The random stuff that happens to your friends also makes them look like the dumbest apocalypse survivors in the world, so don't be surprised if their all dead by the time you reach Colorado.There really isn't much left to say but this game is awesome, and one of the best retro style games I've played in recent time. If you played the Oregon Trail, this is the exact same thing so it's nothing new or different, except the apocalypse and everything. Now if you'll excuse, I have to kill one of my friends who went to pee by themselves and get bit."

I do know what makes a good game, though, and this is brilliant.The aim of the game is simple; survive in a post-apocalyptic zombie-led world as you and four companions make it across the United States to the last remaining human stronghold.  Riding in a clapped-out station wagon, you'll need to gather what meagre supplies you can, keeping a close eye on your food, fuel, ammo and equipment for your vehicle, while riding from safe zone to safe zone.At each safe zone, you'll be able to rest, repair and trade, along with taking part in optional scavenger missions or jobs that put you at greater risk.  The road between each zone is littered with random encounters, from conversation set pieces to shoot-outs, from graverobbing to surviving stampedes of undead animals.What makes this game brilliant is it is the perfect balance of risk versus reward.  Low on food? You could scavenge the surroundings while multiple zombies approach, but if they catch you, it could be all for naught.  Can your station wagon survive until the next zone, or should you stop in no-mans land and attempt to repair it? How long should you keep a valuable companion alive that has been bitten by the undead?  Should you blast through that zombie horde, or wait for it to disperse while your supplies dwindle?  And should you push your vehicle faster, to save on food and get to Safe Haven? Or would you go at a more leisurely pace, and risk running low on supplies?It's important to note that this game is a fun diversion, a full playthrough taking no more than a few hours.  The mini-games are varied but very basic, as are the graphics - don't get this expecting anything more than crudely drawn Amstrad style animations.  The companions that accompany you are also nothing more than the name you give them.  It's best, then, to go into this game with a wild imagination, rather than a massive expectation of an epic zombie survival thriller.Finally, a shout-out must go to the gorgeous music, which is capable of inspiring terror and elation in equal measure.  It perfectly encapsulates the beautiful-yet-irrevocably scarred landscape that you must cross to reach your goal.For the price, definitely recommended."

I remember we had some good times trying to make that trip. My favorite thing to do in this game was to go hunting. It was so easy to point and click at the animal you wished to kill.In Organ Trail: Director's Cut hunting is not nearly as easy. You have to hold down the mouse button and pull back in the equal but opposite direction to the zombie you want to kill. Over complicated for no reason. This is my only complaint about this game though.I enjoy that this game brings back all of the old memories of my childhood while simultaneously including a modern spin on a post apocalyptic zombie outbreak. Each difficultly level is challenging but not so challenging that it is super frustrating.

I know it might not be much, but it just seem so fresh to me, and saying that I already got 3 hours in it isn't very smart of me, considering I have, by no means, been playing it non stop.I'm no expert in games like these, but it feels like a lot of content for the price tag.I'm gonna give it a 9 / 10 , because it does what it sets out to do very well.My main problem with it is just the fact that the hitboxes when scavenging are a bit messed up. The hitboxes I'm talking about is the players. Sometimes you will feel cheated, or feel that it isn't fair, that the zombie could hit you. Why would you feel like that?

Aiming is practically some sort of witchcraft, there's no way you complete some jobs, at least I couldn't. The other issue is the dullness of the AI. I beat the game and shot maybe 12 zombies, if you have decent left hand skills you will be fine, because even Pac Man had more challenging AI. So why am I recommend it?

So we start off with a game that has a very retro feel to it obviously refering to the Oregon Trail which is great because I love these old type of games. The gameplay is good as it allows you to do a lot of activities such as dodging zombie deer or repairing you vehicle. Another thing that is great is all the references to other zombie games/films such as the hand rising out of the ground when you visit a tombstone or at The Church landmark, the scenery is a reenact of an early scene from the film Night of the Living Dead, where a man with glasses is lying on the ground dead, and a blonde woman is fleeing away from a nearby zombie. The soundtrack is great as well with the 8-bit feel with a mix of tensity and a bit of ambience. The artwork for the place you get to like Chicago and The Mall are very well done keeping the retro feel to it. However there are some downsides to it as well. The controls and some of the mechanics can be hard to learn to some players so maybe an option in settings to configure the controls more would help gamers who can't get them down easier. Also I say 10$ at the beggining of the review because the dev's cut some of the great content from the director's cut into a DLC ""The Final Cut"", so if you're thinking about buying this game have 10$ to do it to buy the DLC to not miss out and some content that makes the game great. Overall this game is excellent for 10$ has more pro's than con's definitely check this out."

But this game is AMAZING. despite using an ""atari"" graphical style, and not exactually riviting in terms of music or dialouge ect, I found myself more emotionally attached to my own pixelated characters. Than any triple A zombie game out there.  As you progress, your resources get lower and lower, and things get tougher. The game gave me an odd sense of doom, but hope at the same time. And that hope is what kept me playing. To make it through.  I usually for the most part do not like indie games.  But with it's cheap price, and great replay value, I highly highly reccomended this.  I would hope for a sequel. But maybe it's better off being a stand alone game.  Whoever made this game, I commend you for the great amount of effort put into this simplistic but at the same time, complicated game.The game is primarly about resource managment, and going across the USA, in hopes of getting to your final destination, ""safe haven"" you have to survive zombies, bandits, and get supplies, fix your car, ect, it's based off one of my favorite PC game series, ""The Oregon Trail"" I might even argue that this game is a tad bit better than the original Oregon Trail games.

The full game is riddled with bugs that'll make it freeze. I have never had that problem in the the flash game version. If you are seriously considering getting this, play the flash game first. If you still like that, consider if you're willing to wade through a heap of bull in the (pretty high) chance it locks up when you beat the game. This isn't even a rare occurence, this is a well known, reported, practically game breaking bug that has not been fixed in apparently months of it being known. And what does this version add over the flash game? Harder difficulties, but they're still pretty easy; Scavenging is absolutely overpowered even with the more difficult shooting controls. Extra content as far as picking what sprite your character uses, special buyable power ups, and unlockable starting vehicles. Plus, there's a minigame that's very similar to Spongebob's Boat-O-Cross. Not really a huge step up; the only major points are the new job system and being able to pick alternate routes at certain spots on the map. All in all, if you want to play, you should really just stick with the flash game unles you get this version cheap. Even so, be prepared to deal with lock ups."

But...Organ Trail can still be a nice divergion.  I feel like the choices you make while on the road don't quite make a big deal in the long run.  The differences here between this and Oregon Trail is that Oregon trail gives you different paths to take with positives and negatives associated with them plus a mini game to complete the task.  Organ Trail has this too (if you buy the dlc) but the differences are very minute and you don't get to really experience doing the different path.  Your car just keeps milling about on the road without any input from you.  Most of the time I just skip all the messages that pop up because it's all RNG.  You have no input in whether you lose a bunch of ammo or food.  The game just does everything for you while yoiu auto drive.The different paths you take just means a faster route plus more hazards, like radiation sickness.  The towns are all the same. Some have trainers and others, upgrades for your car.  Thats really the only BIG difference in choosing a different path.Scavenging gets old REAL fast.  If you buy the dlc, you can fight off humans as well as the undead.  All in all, it's a decent waste of time.  You just wont be coming back to it over and over.  It's more of a 1-2 hr time waster when you're really bored."

You'll find yourself scavenging for supplies rather than paying for them or selling supplies to make more money for better upgrades, you'll also find yourself making tough decisions for you and your companions which could mean life or death later on and in the back of your mind you'll be thinking...""Did I make the right call?"" any game that does that makes me want to play more. You'll name your companions after friends,loved ones, famous people etc. or if you're like me you'll name them after ou people you hate and kill them outright right away(yes there is an option to kill off your companions if they're sick or not) or watch them slowly die from a bite wound or some other grievous injury.

You have to kill him as he gets bit but then you get to name your friends and you are off to go across to the country. The whole point of the game is to get to the Safe Haven; which is on the West Coast. You must balance your food and oil usage; while also making sure you have enough food, medkits, and ammo to survive. But for this, you need money. You can earn money or supplies by doing missions and cities or other pit-stops. This game can be challenging. So challenging that I haven't been able to make it to the end yet. But, it is a great experience. You will have fun trying to balance your supplies and the certain events you can come across can be challenging.

Its gameplay is similar, its ideas are similar, and it's a lot of fun, just like the original source material.Here's the thing though, Organ Trail: Director's Cut is everything the original Organ Trail is, and much much more. Rather than just a parody - and I agree fully with what the creators say they intended the game to be - it is a game that stands above and beyond its own source material as a game in its own right.It's fun, it's dark, it's darkly funny, and it's honestly quite creepy in several places. The soundtrack is incredible and Ben Crossbones' musical talent lends itself perfectly, creating a wonderous, lonesome, tense and tragic air to the whole game. Rolling into a settlement (or the remains of a city), buying supplies and fixing/upgrading your Station Wagon, or learning new combat skills, trading and scavenging and talking with strangers was great before, but with the soundtrack it turns it into both wonderous relief and soul-crushing despair as you realise these are the few survivors left, and you should take what levity you can on your perilous road to a CHANCE at salvation.Be warned however. Easy difficulty may not be as rewarding but it is fun. If you want the extra points bonuses, rack up the difficulty, but be prepared for ungodly amounts of pain, because the jump from Easy to Normal is IMMEDIATELY visible. You will suffer at the hands of the game for your greed, so be sure you're REALLY good at aiming for a start.Total recommendation, totally worth every penny in sale or not. Get it, play it, love it.

While understanding it's supposed to simulate a retro game, I still just couldn't stand the graphics. In addition to that, it seemed like a really boring game, with not much more to do than look at charts and go scavenging every once in a while, which proved to be quite a tedious and repetitive task, consisting of nothing more than your character slowly walking around and collecting sprites as some zombies, which are just sloppy green figures, walk slowly towards you. I quit playing the game after not too long, since, though I like simulator games, this game was just way too simplistic, and way too unrealistic... But after playing it some more, the game really started to grow on me. As I played, I found that it's wildly addicting. I've always been able to appreciate sim games, the kind where you just click on buttons and check stats, but this was something more. I never have liked simple things, but I found that the simplicity has a sort of charm to it. It seemed like such a boring game at first, but as I built up my supplies, I started to become quite attached to my characters. Though the game doesn't allow for much good storytelling, it just leaves it more up to the imagination. It seemed just lazy, but I eventually started to like the little things like, how you don't have an inventory, but rather a set of a few random variables, and how, when in a fight, the game accounts for no background aside from you and the zombies, just leaving a black backdrop. It really is a great game, just takes some getting used to."

I'm too young to have ever played Oregon Trail, which Organ Trail is based on. Others can tell you the pros and cons, because when I try to think of pros and cons, I can only think of personal experiences i've had playing the game.  Like the time Michelangelo from TMNT was bit by a zombie and I didn't execute him for experimental reasons. (Mainly because I wanted to see the effects of a zombie bite on a mutated turtle.) While I was resting healing up my party, he turned and bit the RED Spy from TF2 and infected him. After putting Michelangelo down, I heard the RED Spy in my head.""I don't wish to die and turn into one of those. Kill me.""Truly, it was a hard moment in that playthrough. I think that is what's so fun about Organ Trail: the personal experiences and stories that derive from the gameplay. Very, very few games can say that many stories and reviews about the game derive from the gameplay.To put it in a short way: It's an old school, road trip zombie game that can't be missed, even for just one playthrough.And I guarentee that most players will have many more playthroughs than just one.10/10 Would experiment with a zombie bite on a turtle again."

This game can actaully be quite funny. Having references from other video games like L4D2 and even Castlevania. This game is stylized as a retro RPG that would have looked like a game in the late 80's or early 90's. Lets start out with the game. There are two modes in this game.Campaign mode and endless mode. Im just going to ecplain the campaign. (since endless mode is self explanitory). You start off by meeting a priest name Clements (after shooting some zombies) then you go find your friends in Washington D.C. you get to name your friends as well as yourself (which is nice). Once you get to D.C. you have 15 or so hours to collect supplies because On the radio you overhear that there will be a nuclear strike. Clements finds your friends but then you have to put out Clements since he got bit by a zombie. So basically you are trying to get to your end destination and survive. On the way you can buy supplies, scacenge for supplies, and there will be mini games as well like avoidimg zombies while your in your car, killing bike gang members in your car and etc. there are also jobs you can do to get money and other misc. items. This game is very fun and i HIGHLY reccomend it. The only reason i wouldnt reccomend buying it is if your one of those people who talk crap about games that dont have great next-gen graphics. For me i love it, especially for its price ($4.99) Final Verdict:10/10 Go buy this game!!"

Try to get you and your party to the supposed Safe Haven in the West without getting bitten, broken or dying to desentry. There are stops along the where you can trade, sell, buy and take jobs for things as well as stopping any ol' where to scavenge. Just be careful! Those zombies aren't too friends. Nor are the dear and biker gangs that sometimes chase after you.There are no oxen to worry about. Just a station wagon that has seen better days. It has a health bar so make sure you keep it in good condition otherwise things on it are more likely to break and cause you problems. When you find auto shops, try your best to get ahold of Upgrades. Those will work wonders on your car and help it and you make it across the land.Don't forget to rest up your party too! The lower their health, the more likely they are to break something or contract something, become incapacitated, and die. Sometimes they can be bitten by zombies and as long as you can keep their health up, they won't turn. I still kill them anyway though. I don't trust them. >_>All in all this game feels like the classic with a new twist. The graphics are old, the music is chiptune and the story is belovedly post apocalytic and fantastic. Play. This.

Often times friends will die and you will not be able to stop it. One time three of my people were dragged out of my car and eaten alive.

I can be told that I'm ""missing the point,"" but frankly... I really recommend just playing Oregon Trail. It's a similar experience, but slightly more enjoyable.The problem is that most of the time, this just felt unfair to me, in ways that a game should not be. Allow me to elaborate: I was playing on EASY, because I KNEW this game would be hard. And NONE of the minigames felt like a DECENT challenge. They were either so easy as to be pointless, or difficult to the point of frustration (like the shootouts with bandits who never miss and barely ever pop out of cover... Time Crisis felt more fair to me, and that's a game that's designed to EAT QUARTERS.) Every now and then, an interesting event would happen, but more often something would just be taken from me for no reason, and I had to accept it. No strategy, no rhyme or reason. I literally once picked up 3 cans of fuel as a raandom event and IMMEDIATELY had 4 stolen from me by bandits.And these bandits are the scourge of the gods. They are always teeming, always a threat, no matter how many you strike down, and are seemingly unaffected by zombies and hold no valuables, even bullets, that do not disintegrate once slain. They can steal fuel from the tank of a moving vehicle. They can kidnap a party member (again, from a moving vehicle) and hold him at gunpoint to force a single shot rescue with no grace on the aim; you LITERALLY have to be PERFECT.The game just makes it feel like you have no control over... anything. And not in the realistic way. Shops and jobs rarely offer what you need, ammo and fuel are insanely overpriced, your party members are mentally deficient enough to break spare parts for the car on a regular basis... and unless you have an $80 perk, you can only find food, scrap, and (I believe, rarely) ammo while scavenging. And I was only ever able to learn the perk that allowed me to find medkits.In short... I found this game just frutrating and disappointing. Maybe if you're a ridiculously huge zombie fanatic, it'll be more fun. Otherwise, I think Oregon Trail is just better-designed, and all the little ""jokes"" and references can be read for just as much effect. The game has potential, but it just feels like it doesn't offer enough. Nothing bad that happened to me (okay, save one gunshot wound that I quickly patched with my dozens of medkits) seemed like it happened as a result of my input... that much lack of control, where you can (seemingly easily) lose through no fault of your own, just doesn't appeal to me."

As a ""spiritual"" successor to the ubiquitous OREGON TRAIL, the cleverly-named ORGAN TRAIL documents the trials and tribulations of five survivors in the midst of the zombie apocalypse as they suffer their way through inclement weather, disease, misadventure and the endless hordes of undead. In practice, the game resembles OREGON TRAIL only superficially, and plays much more like FTL or ROGUE; you'll spend a lot more of your time shooting zombies and evading their rotting hands than you ever spent hunting for meat or fighting misrepresented Native Americans. The bottom line is that this game is inexpensive, provides a solid (if ""retro"") experience and above all is FUN to play."

On top of that, there are a ton of nods to just older games in general, which is always awesome.)-Retro Graphics: (A plus if you like them)-Replayable: (If you only play through this once, you will only see about 10% of the humor, challenges, etc. Each playthrough yields different things, such as events, and you can take a different approach everytime. You can stock up on different items, strive to do different things, and changing your sense of morality at anytime. The only really linear thing in this game is the path. You go from Point A, then Point B, all the way to Point Z, which is the safe haven you are trying to get to. It is what happens on your way to each point that makes this game interesting.)-Soundtrack: (This game has a really good sense of approach towards the situations you may be in, and one of the big reasons I say that is the soundtrack. The game always has fitting music, and good music at that.)Cons-Gameplay: (This is a subjective con. The gameplay is interesting in that it really is true to how an older game like this would play. But that doesn't mean it is easy. My only complaint on this is the aiming. Considering you must fight off the undead with a ranged weapon, you HAVE to be good at aiming it. On top of that, you can't waste ammo, as it could be out of reach due to price, or the shear lack of it in the zombie wastelands you explore. The aiming is...weird. I suggest looking up a video of gameplay so you can see if you can cope with it. I've gotten used to it, but at the same time I shouldn't have to. Gameplay should be fluid and creative, yet natural. Honestly, I would like just one of those, but aside from this one con, if you can overcome this one annoyance, then this game is definitely worth it.)VerdictEverything about this game is near-perfect, aside from one thing. Gameplay. While everything else is so good, this is a big thing to do deal with since without gameplay, it wouldn't be a game. At the same time, you have to see if it would bother you so I suggest looking at a video of the gameplay to decide. If, afterwards, you decide that isn't too bad, then nothing else should be stopping you from getting this game aside from lacking the funds to do so. Everything aligns almost perfectly for this game but one thing, so decide from all of this if you would truely like it.P.S. There is also a mobile edition available for Android and iOS, so if you want to try this game but feel playing it with a mouse is a deal breaker, then that is the next best thing. The one thing both editions have over the free, Facebook alternative is that they are much more complete, and have A TON of addition content that adds to the experience of this game. The developer did fairly well on this title, so I trusted the mobile edition would live up to the PC edition here. Long story short, there is no game that really keeps itself consistent across all the platforms it's available on so well like this one!"

I was never lucky enough to play Oregon Trail as a kid, so any puns that are from that game I've missed. But I a VERY big zombie fan, and have played many zombie games and watched many a zombie movie. Organ trail has a lot of easter eggs that reference zombies in pop culture, whether it's from the screens that show you what town you've made it to, or even within the text itself. Off the top of my head, I remember this game referencing The Walking Dead, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and Resident Evil! The humor in this game is pretty light, which is needed because the random events can stress you out. It has with me, but once I get a pop up saying that 'someone farted', I smirk.Gameplay wise, it's pretty easy. Most of this is text based, with the exception of boss battles and side quests (shooting bandits, scavenging, grabbing forgotten items for people, and killing zombies for people). I have a wild imagination so this isn't a problem for me, but if you're the type that needs to see what's going on in a game, then that may not be so awesome for you. I have noticed spelling and grammar errors in the special events that are strictly text based. A little embarassing honestly. It took me a while to learn how to shoot right, and while it's not a horrible system for shooting, it really could be better. It's hard to shoot zombies when you're using a laptop mouse pad. It would have been cool to have melee weapons as an alternative to the shooting system, but that may be a part of Oregon Trail nostalgia/referencing that I don't get.I have spent way too much time playing this game, but that's not stopping me.

Everyone sat on some supplies a little too hard and ruined them, many held the map upside down and got us lost.   We were pursued by infected elk?, marauding bikers and at one point a Frankenstein's monster looking thing that wouldn't die.Dysentary and Cholera were ever prevalent amongst our group, the unfortunate death of a friend meant rationing was better (Mitchell, you died for the greater good).  But we made it from coast to coast.Additionally, this game comes with a cool retro-physics mini game in the extras section.10/10 - Would Apocalypse again."

It's not the kind of game you marathon -- each trip only lasts a few hours assuming you make it to the end successfully -- but good for picking up now and then and wasting a half hour at a time.Some advice: food and money are easy to come by if you scavenge at the various stopping points along your route. Go for bullets early, and do be afraid to spend a few hours scrounging up beans, bucks, and scrap before hitting th road again."

Organ Trail brings out oodles of bloodthirsty nostalgia in me, with delightful pixel art and appropriately retro soundtrack. The gun-firing mechanics and terrible random events are suitably frustrating, and the simple but genuinely impactful supply system (spend, barter, and stock up carefully) gives players plenty to fret over on top of avoiding the undead while scavenging, and hoping a party member doesn't break an arm, sit on a spare battery and ruin it (seriously, Craig, what the hell?), or get bitten. And the additional cake icing of modern day zombie genre favorites getting artistic nods and references all over really endeared me to the game, paying closer attention to background art and dialogue exchanges lest I miss one.I'd suggest this to anyone who loved Oregon Trail and is a fan of the zombie genre -- but what kind of lifeless monster would you be if you didn't and weren't?"

It's basically the graphics and decision system of the Oregon Trail mixed with the choices of The Walking Dead with some nice little interaction with the environment in a different way. I haven't played much (I'm planning on recording it for my channel) but I absolutely loved it. You really have to think and pay attention, and it's somewhat challenging."
