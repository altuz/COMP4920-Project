,Not Recommended,233840,6067666,"Posted: 15 August, 2013",all,[UGUF] Merkules,"This game is basically a standalone expansion to Revolution.  It's a much better game overall, and the workshop support is very cool, but you can't help but feel like a lot of this should have been in Revolution to begin with.The problem with the game though, is that even though it's better than both Revolution and Reloaded, it's still a shadow of a game compared to Armageddon.  Sure, it has the same number of weapons and even lets you use the Armageddon HUD for your weapons, but that's really the only areas where it matches that old classic, and even then it replaces fun weapons from that game (such as the bow) with newer weapons that, honestly, just aren't as fun.The graphics are decent, but you will have stutter and FPS drops even on decent rigs when you play games with a lot of onscreen objects/worms.  They've said for some time now they have been working on the FPS issues, but the fact I have not heard anything in a while combined with the fact that one update actually made my performance *worse*, doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.  Also, the game does not have an FPS cap on background objects, but the foreground objects are all animated at 30FPS.  It's incredibly awkward looking and makes it blatantly obvious the game was made using an engine designed for consoles, not exactly the grand ""PC exclusive"" we were promised.Even looking past that, it's just painfully obvious that you cannot have a game like this in 2.5D if you play for even just a decent amount.  You can't always tell just what it is you can actually stand on, not to mention if a chunk of landscape is small enough, you can't even see it at all (I even have proof of this in my screenshots for this game).  We do not gain a single thing going to 3D graphics, we only lose precision and performance.  Team 17, please stop trying to make Worms in 3D graphics.  If you want to do that, make another 3D Worms (and make a decent 3D camera while you're at it), because it's not like 2D graphics is some kind of forbidden thing to have in a video game these days.Admittedly, all the new weapons and tools do serve their purpose and can be useful at times (to be honest, this is the first time in a Worms game I actually *like* using the mortar), but they range from fun to boring.  And frankly, one weapon isn't even new, the Bovine Blitz was already in Ultimate Mayhem, yet they act as if it is new (maybe to 2D Worms, but they should specify that instead of just saying it's new).  And everyone who cried that the rope is overpowered in Armageddon?  The water jetpack is far, far more unbalanced than the rope ever was (and the rope wasn't OP to begin with...but the aqua pack sure is).  To be fair though, the winged monkey is a very useful tool for stopping darksiders, and it's amusing to block someone between two physics objects and then go blast them out (""Oh, are you stuck?  Here, let me help you...heh heh heh"").As for the teleport gun being the compromise to the rope no longer allowing Armageddon levels of speed?  It's not a compromise at all, it's incredibly easy to use and has no real skill ceiling to it.  It's like whoever was in charge had no idea what it was about the rope that made it so fun to use.  Had it been developed with the mindset that you need to do a lot of practice to master it, it could have been something really cool, but it's a big disappointment if you're an old roper.  Team 17 needs to stop being so pigheaded about the rope and just revert it to the way it was before, because I just don't see how anyone could think the new rope or the teleport gun are more fun, even after having spent hours using both.But let's say you can ignore all that, and are willing to play anyways.  What's that you say?  You want to play Hysteria?  Not possible because you can't fine tune the turn timer in this.  Bow and Arrow?  Haha, sorry, there is no bow in this.  Shopper?  You'll get bored when you realize the limitations of the rope.  Heck, you can't even really get crazy with something original, because...and this alone is *THE BIGGEST PROBLEM* with the game, and the series since Reloaded in my opinion...Team 17 keeps removing gameplay options with which to customize schemes.  We don't exactly gain anything worthwhile in their place either.  Frankly, the only reason this is better than Reloaded is because Reloaded's physics were just that bad, Reloaded has far more options than Clan Wars, and that game is only a few years old.I don't recommend any of the newer Worms games at all.  Not because I'm a die hard Armageddon fan (I actually preferred Hedgewars, back when it was more active), but because these games are cash grabs that have obvious signs of Team 17 just flat out being lazy, all while promising they are listening to the community and that this game will be ""the best Worms yet"".Heck, they barely acknowledge the old Armageddon fans, and make it pretty obvious they are not listening to their input on these games.  So...they want to build a game with an active community, yet all but shun the oldest fans unless they are willing to lavish praise on their half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sequels?  And yet they wonder why the series has been losing fans.  They also tend to delete negative topics on their forums (even banning users for telling people how to get refunds on the Revolution board...myself included), and I wouldn't be surprised if this review gets flagged by them.So why did I buy this?  Because I'm still a fan of Worms.  And it was cheap with a discount and trading card money.  But Team 17's rotten attitude and laziness make it extremely hard to like the new games.  I seriously doubt I'd ever buy any of their future games, Worms or not.  Not until they stop being all talk and actually make a game designed for people who don't just play casually (as casuals are less likely to notice a lack of depth or laziness on the developer's part).TL;DR version: Another half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Worms game from Team 17.  One I wanted to like but I just can't.  Avoid unless you have to have every single Worms game ever, and even then, get it for at least 75% off, as $25 is nothing short of overpriced for this game, especially considering Armageddon is $15 on steam and will last you far longer."

Expands on Worms Revolution while adding a host of both new and old weapons. They even bring back some of the classics like the Morter, and Scales of Justice, only with a twist to them this time around.Only issue I have, is an issue that I also had with Worms Revolution, and seems to pertain only to a fraction of PC's, where lag occures, often causing jumps to be unreliable (and unsafe!).

I took advantage of the package deal and got this Worms game along with several others. Note this is a first impression review.Worms Clan Wars is an 2.5D artillery game where you control teams of Worms to defeat the other teams. You use a wide selection of weaponry and tools to secure victory. Sometimes in hilarious ways. Gameplay wise this is no Armaggedon but it comes close.Even when you lose or do something daft you can always laugh about it. In one case, I was going to do a classic tactic of using a baseball bat to send an enemy worm into the water, only instead for the worm to catch onto a piece of landscape, I was still laughing afterwards.Unlike most Worms games including Armaggedon, you have several classes of Worms to use. The Soldier is basically the standard Worm, but gains the ability to detonate grenades at any time. The Scout is a weaker, but faster Worm that doesn't set of mines. The Heavy is a slow, but tough worm that does extra damage. The Scientist is similar to the Solider but can heal itself and its teammate each turn whilst producing better tools. You can configure your team to adapt to this.Online Gameplay is fun, and even when something daft happens you can still enjoy it and the clan features are nice.The only criticism I have is the modded in cosemtic options, which with some items like that Master Chief helmet can really cause the lag in an online game to go theough the roof and with a rather low spec computer it has firced me to quit several times.Definately recommend giving this game a shot!"

However, the game is branded ""Clan Wars"" but the online play (and lobby system for finding matches) is bugged. The offline game is short and not much of a challenge but does teach some techniques useful for online play.One nice feature of this game is that beginners in 3-way and 4-way games often have a chance to win and should never give in! Players tend to pick on the biggest threat (most health left/experience/skill) and this means someone with a basic knowledge can challenge to win.If the numerous bugs were fixed and more people played online  the game would live up to it's name and provide fun clan wars.."

,Recommended,233840,17068915,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,Jukettaja,"Clan Wars is probably the most innovative Worms game to date offering the same diversity of classes as Revolution albeit with some tweaks for balancing.In case you're not familiar with them:Soldiers are the same regular worms from all other games except they can choose when to detonate grenades.Heavies have the most damage and biggest explosions but are slower and (obviously) heavier.Scouts are more mobile with longer jumps and are light enough to avoid triggering mines but deal less damage.Scientists heal friendly worms in a small radius at the start of their turn and all constructions (girders, turrets, magnets, etc.) are more durable but they also deal reduced damage.Weapons variety is largely the same as in Revolution from the traditional bazooka to some of the more wacky ones, many of which have multiple uses, like the Lightning Strike allowing you to heal worms, resurrect dead ones, convert turrets and activate inactive mines and magnets. Unlike classic Worms and Armageddon the Ninja Rope functions more like a rope than a mix between a rope and a ladder, meaning you'll weigh it down and have to use your momentum to swing around. Other mobility items, both old and new to the genre, include such items as Jetpack, Water Jetpack and Teleport Gun to name but a few.As far as gameplay goes Clan Wars is an optimized Revolution meaning no lag when water sloshes about. However, both games are made in the same engine which limits animations to 30 frames per second regardless of what fps the actual game runs on. Note the game itself can run above 30 fps; only the worm animations are limited.So all in all I think it's one of the freshest Worms games out there since Armageddon."

Team17 are just after some more money and this wouldn't have been a problem if this title was indeed bringing something new and better than the previous. But unfortunately is worse, way worse than anyone could imagine coming from an engine that shouldn't have suffered in such a short time.Problems such as multi-player de-synchs, audio effects cutting off mid-game, usually after the first round, and framerate drops are plaguing it. There are very few additions in terms of weapons and their area of effect seems rather limited.  They feel completely unsatisfying. Also don't be fooled by the contraptions you see in the snapshots. They're not available in multiplayer.I won't talk about the clans because neither I nor my friends are interested in building some sort of reputation amonst unknown players. But if you're after this sort of entertainment, you won't find any people to play against.In the end, all I've got to say about this title is that if you're after shiny graphics buy Worms Revolution instead, otherwise stick with the classic titles in this series, most notable Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party, where you get a pletora of satisfying weapons to decimate your friends with.The trend nowadays seems to be: throw to the bin a good game, apply a fresh layer of paint on top of a shaky new engine, ignore some good ideas from the successful releases in the franchise, and sell it in whatever shape it is. The good old reputation won't keep this franchise afloat for too long, Team17."

It looked very fun, with its numerous weapons of mass destruction, from dynamite to a bazooka. I really thought that I would love this slapstick-humor filled game, especially when playing with friends. But, unfourtatently, after playing only about 20 mintues of it (I admit, not enough to form a very good opinion of a game), I knew that my overall feeling for the game could be summed up by one word; ""Eh"". It was only okay. It had a rather odd set up that confused me. I wasn't sure if I should be focusing on the multiplayer aspect of the game or the single-player campaign. The tutorial, too, confused me. Not that it was a complicated game, but more that unless I was in a perfect position, playing with my friends, forming clans and the like, I would not get much out of the game. Another big problem was the controls, which I tried for about 10 mintues to adjust to my liking, yet none of the combinations appealed to me. It would simply not let me change to controls to allow my mouse to play a bigger part than it was. I didn't feel comfterable with having to adjust my aim for my bazooka with the arrow keys, especially when on a turn timer. Overall, I had a lousy experience with Worms: Clan Wars, but that doesn't mean that you should not give it a try. Just do a little more research than I did to find out wether it's your kind of game or not. To me, It simply was not enticing enough."

Like its predecessors, you'll create your team of worms and battle against other teams with an arsenal of weapons. However, this game has some changes from the previous versions and that's why is worth a shot.GraphicsThe graphics didn't change too much from the previous games. Th enviroment and the characters and colorful and lively, being nice to the eyes.GameplayThe gameplay is the same of previous Worms: each player has your own turn and you choose one of your worms to do the action. You can move with the directional buttons, choose a weapon through your mouse or keyboard shortcuts and press the spacebar key to use the weapon. Depending of the weapon you choose, the effects at the opponent (and yourself) will be different, so you need to be cautious to not blown yourself up when you use the weapon. This is one of the many great things about the worms games, because a wrong use of a weapon can lead to very funny moments and even make you lose, instead of your opponent. When you use a weapon, your turn is over and it's your opponent turn. You win when every worm of your opponent is dead. If every worm, even yours, die, it will be a draw.Also, you can also use some items which help you to fight or get a better position to knock out your enemy and, different of when you use a weapon, you won't finish your turn when using it. For example, with the ninja rope, your worm can reach high places and even shoot at your opponent while escaping for your own safety. For example, you can use the ninja rope to go higher and throw a dinamite at your opponent and, before the dynamite blows (you have only a couple of seconds), you can reach another safe place and watch your opponent getting blasted. Your opponent will be damaged by the explosion and be throw at the air because of the explosion and even can fall at the water, losing all its hp. By the way, there's water and you lose your worm if you fall there. Oops, didn't I say that before?Anyway, it's really nice the huge variety of weapons for you to use at Worms Clan Wars. Plus, some of them are funny, like the powerful ""Concrete Donkey"", which, when used, a giant concrete donkey falls from the sky and go stomping every place at a vertical line, while doing a funny donkey sound.By the way, I said before this game has some changes from its previous games. Well, this time, your worms are not equal. At previous games, every worm is exactly the same, changing only its name, but at this game, there are 4 types of worms, which can add some deep to your strategy. For example, there is the tiny worm, called ""Scout"", which can be faster and jump higher, but they are weaker than the another ones. In another hand, there's the ""Heavy"", which is the totally opposite of the Scout: it is fat and heavy, so it'll be slow and jump really low, but it's more powerful than the other ones.Audio & SoundtrackThere's not many musics here, but the few remaining are nice to hear. But the Audio and sound effects are great! They are nice and funny, specially the many voices you can use as your worms voice. You can laugh a lot with these.StorylineWorms usually has no fixed storyline, except this one has a campaign mode about some worms hunting some rare artifacts. But you don't need to do the campaign, if you prefer only fighting to the death against your friends or the AI or both.The veredictIt's another amazing Worms game, with some good improvements, but keeping the old and good formula of success that made Worms a loved franchise. If you love Worms games, don't miss this one. And if you never played a worms game, try this one! It's lovely and I think you will enjoy!Rating:Graphics: 8/10Audio: 10/10Gameplay: 9,5/10Overall: 9/10"

Especially when there are way better and larger Worms titles.I had fun playing this game, don't get me wrong. But that's purely because it's Worms. It just works, it's a great game franchise. But... everything else is lacking if you ask me.The graphics are bad. Really bad. Reminds me of the era when video games that were meant to be 2D were made in terrible 3D - just because it was new and exciting. I just don't feel that the 2D gameplay and 3D graphics go well together. In fact, the 3D graphics get in the way of the gameplay for the most part! sometimes you fall off edges because it LOOKED like you could stand there, but in reality it was just part of the background. It has a few problems with bad visibility (the backgrounds are just ugly and distracting), but this one is by far the worst.Next: it's a trainwreck on a technical level. It stutters like crazy! Not because my PC can't handle it (lol yeah right), but because the FPS are limited to a mere 30 or whatever. It feels like a console port! All the worms' animations are locked to 30 (or maybe just 24?) keyframes, making it look... not particularly smooth, needless to say. There's no excuse for it. My eyes literally start to hurt after playing this game for too long. It's really that bad - for me at least.As for the weapons: It may not look that bad at first glance. And it isn't bad, but... half of the weapons you're not even going to use more than once. In comparison to other Worms titles such as Worms Armageddon, the weapons are really badly balanced. Some weapons simply have little to no use. It doesn't even count as ""situational"", because it's that difficult to even think of a situation where said weapons are applicable. And when they are, it's better to go with one of the standard weapons anyway.The super weapons are lacking, too. There are only a few of them. And worst of all, they are sort of balanced. As in - Team17 tried to make all the different super weapons roughly the same in terms of effectiveness and firepower. Why? Because you can ""buy"" them by collecting coins in crates and spending them on a super weapon of choice. This may sound good, but it's awful (IN MY OPINION!!!1). Why are ridiculously overpowered superweapons bad? Isn't that the point of a super weapon?Next issue: A maximum of 16 worms. SIXTEEN WORMS. (Compare this to the 48 worms that Worms Armageddon has to offer) That means, in a party of 4, each team can only have 4 worms. It's not terrible, but sometimes you just want to have a bit of fun. Worms Clan Wars is just a lot less sandbox-y.Last but certainly not least - the ninja rope. What have they done? The rope physics just don't fit. Ropes are almost completely useless in this game. The most useful tool for transportation is the jetpack, which lowers the skill ceiling considerably.Okay, now for the good. There are water physics and different kinds of worms with pros and cons. Don't get me wrong, it's kind of cool, but just that: kind of cool.And this brings me to the final, most important part of my review: I know exactly why I dislike this game exactly. It is very accessible and has a low skill ceiling. An inexperienced worms player can easily beat someone with over 30 hours of playtime just with a little luck. People that are new to Worms will approve and like this game. They can't be bothered with the many menus and options that a Worms Armageddon offers. They just want to casually play a game of Worms with their friends. And if the same applies to you: Go for it, it's certainly not a bad game objectively speaking.But for someone (like me) who prefers game that have a learning curve, where you FEEL that you get better, I highly recommend you to buy Worms Armageddon instead.TL;DR: It's a good game, but has terrible framerate issues and a dangerously low skill ceiling. Many features feel handicapped and executed worse than in other titles. But on the other hand, it's a lot more friendly to new player who just want to play a casual round of Worms with their friends. I highly recommend trying Worms Armageddon instead."

,Not Recommended,233840,11446151,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,DrunkSkeeterPilot,"Coming from Worms 2, this game has the two features I always wanted... dynamic water and non-destructible terrain. Unfortunately, Team17 is the dumbest game developer out there and simplified this game to death. There's only one kind of water generator and you can only have two on a map, not to mention they are huge and take up a lot of space. They also remove any terrain around them and can waste water particles filling up the space they inhabit. The rope physics might be technically more realistic, but feel terrible and clumsy compared to the W2 rope. The amount of worm customization is very limited. The level editor is clunky and does not allow for precision land design with it's weird 3D look that makes it hard to tell what is actual land and what is decorative land around the actual land. As I stated, the game is terribly simplified in options of customization. You can't make wooden beams fixed, nor make them indestructible. There are no door objects or other nifty things. The water generators are also succeptible to being blown up and cannot be made indestructible. You can't set things to float on water either. You can't set the bounciness of the terrain, or the gravity, or a dozen other options that they could have easily made available. Why? Because it was designed for consoles and ported to PC/MAC. I really really hate this design mentality. Why limit your game by stupid consoles? I love my PS3 but at least make an enhanced version of the game for PC/MAC. Team17 gets 1 star from me, for being a terrible, narrow-minded company. They could have added lots of game modes like real time combat, which would open the door for even more modes, like soccer, capture the flag, american football, etc. There's also no snow or ice, which is another example of their short sightedness. The snow theme was my favorite in Worms2. Basically, this is a decent game if you need your worms fix, but I'd recommend not buying it and teaching Team17 a lesson."

I think they will restart quick unranked matches servers too, so it will be fixed. On Wormnet you can play unranked too, so don't worry :)"

First of all, there's horrible mouse acceleration in the menus that you can't turn off. This is a problem many past Worms games have had too. Why it is there, I don't know, but it's not relevant to gameplay whatsoever, as it's mainly controlled using the keyboard.Some of the levels in the story campaign have some non-obvious stuff you have to do, using mechanics that you haven't known to exist before, like punching mines.

I don't really think thats ever going to happen because Team 17 insist that Armageddon reaches feature paritywith WWP before thats possible, and they no longer work on that game.So, this game is pretty close. It doesn't seem to run that well on my ATI hardware (my computer is fairly rubbish anyway), but its pretty good in terms of being somewhere between the Armageddon kit and the WWP kit. The physics feel pretty spot on. I don't know if thats good or bad, considering the cartoonish tone, but as a whole it all seems to knit quite well.Its true that the backgrounds confuse the foregrounds a little, but moving the mouse around tends to resolve the confusion. The museum set idea is cool, and the narrator is quite droll (funny), but the water (bottom border) is a really crappy texture/surface that is entirely unbelievable, particularly in context of the museum set.I'd give it a 7/10 production value, but as usual, with a Worms game, the real value is in having someone to laugh at your incompetence in trying to kill them. The game seems to do that exceptionally well, and allows hot seat, so it gets atleast one more point for longevity. The online component is deserted, but LAN and hotseat is what this game as always done best anyway. Its an underated gem in the Worms series."

The third dimension adds practically nothing to this game, in fact, the game would probably have looked better with high resolution 2D environments instead. The worms have a terrible knack of constantly getting stuck in terrain, even more so than in older installments.The online rooms are almost devoid of life, maybe because Team17 choose to release new Worms games so close that the community can't keep up support for them. The single player campaign is not very good at all. All the missions have you drudging through linear levels full of annoying mechanisms for your worms to get stuck in. The AI, by the way, hasn't improved at all in the 12 years since World Party either.I'm not sure about the introductions of specialized classes, it's all right I guess. The only new thing I really enjoy is the water mechanics. That's not enough. It's disappointing, but I could rather just reinstall World Party and play hotseat than keep playing this game."

,Not Recommended,233840,15485109,"Posted: 21 April, 2015",all,BlueWorrior,"being a long time worms fan, I was hoping for a refined and well executed entry. After all, it is basically the same game as previous installments, so you would think they would have got it right by now... unfortuntaly, not quite.But first, I quite liked the idea of different worm varieties. there are worms that heal themselves and worms around them on their turn, worms that jump and move faster and worms that explode harder when they... die? and they have reduced movement speed, jumping ability and has less jetpack fuel? sure, okay.It allows for some neat gameplay strategies and adds a well needed extra layer of tactics to worm matches. the physics water is also a neat feature, if not vastly overpowered, especially when using water based weaponry that can make worms slip and drown in the actual 'water' water.While it's not a bad game, it has many little issues that really hold the game back. The weapons are a little unbalanced and inconsistant. I have never been able to accurately tell how much damage a weapon is going to do: a bazooka hit directly may do 30 damage, or 50. I have never been able to find out why it does this, but it is very infuriating because it puts an extra layer of doubt when planning attacks because you don't know what the move will accomplish: it may destroy a worm or simply critically wound it.The UI is also an issue. for starters, the aiming reticule is much too big and inaccurate: I would have much preferred a simple dotted line and a small crosshair rather than the over-produced whacky one it has. playing multiplayer has some strange quirks with matchmaking too: you can't start a new game with a player in the same session, you have to back out of a session entirely and start a new one. It is uncesscesarily finicky and awkward.The singleplayer is also dissapointing. I find it funny that they expect you to go through tutorial stages. I mean it's only been 18 freaking games, I think I got the gist of it by now! I would have liked the option to skip those levels. The narrator (definatly NOT a laura croft spoof) is also a tad annoying, but that is subjective, you may enjoy it. needless to say I do not. otherwise, the singleplayer campaign is just a string of battles with objectives thrown in, usual fair. nothing special at all.Overall it's a very mediocure entry to the series that feels very unpolished and undercooked. For what it's worth though, despite it's problems, I had fun playing it with mates. If you are willing to overlook it's flaws, it's still at it's core a worms game. But even saying that, there have better worms games before this. Just get Worms: Armageddon Instead."

Expanding on Revolution's physics-based combat, especially dynamic water, this is a game that requires a change in strategy from say, Worms Reloaded. For example, in Worms Clan Wars, when a grenade is thrown anywhere that is not completely flat land, it rolls. Typically in an older Worms title, grenades would not be nearly as affected by gravity. This makes combat either much easier, or much harder, depending on how you are at the game. Either way, it requires a bit of getting used to.Clan Wars' strength lies in its customization. While Mac users are out of luck currently regarding the Steam Workshop, everyone has open access to the in-game level editor, which is excellent and very easy to use thanks to a selection of brush and line tools which make precise editing simple.Unfortunately this is a game, and an entire series that shines with its multiplayer; but the community is lacking, as of now. So, unless you have friends to play with, you may want to get Armageddon instead.If that's not an issue, by all means buy this. Especially on its current $6 sale."

I found it hard to tell what was scenery and what was part of the game.  It looks very unappealing.The AI is utterly dumb so the only challenge is navigating the maps and solving the puzzles.  It's also very CPU-intensive - it will sit there heating-up the CPU and turning-on the fans only to throw a grenade on itself.I found the unskippable cut-scenes/intros very annoying, especially when you're replaying a level you lost.I have only played story mode so far."

Not as fine as the old classic ones, but I think the good ideas introduced in Revolution are still saving it (I skipped Revolution, so these were new for me) - the water weapons, the buying system (weapons/utils for gold coins), some creative tools like Stick Up, although there are useless ones too (UFO, Winged Monkey, and Telekinesis never proved to be useful thus far). Some negative points are present, like physics/control bugs, and I didn't particularly like the graphic style either. However, if you catch this episode in a sale, it does worth a try."

The game created a whole new genre, and didn't give a chance to any rivals to compete. This game, though, I feel like it's missing the soul of Worms. It limited many options which customized weaponry, and the amount you want for battle. Another thing is, the online system seems a bit unfair, and needs to balance it so that the person who gets the first turn is at a bit of a disadvantage because the players with the later turns can get teamed up upon, and just thrown off cliffs into water. Don't get me wrong, the game still kept many of the qualities, and is still fun to play with friends."

Some weapons has been added into the game, but most of the classic weapons is still there. You are basically worms with weapons killing the other worms. The last worm alive wins. There is a good amount of strategy in the game, which makes it a fun and a challenging game. The multiplayer is quite excellent too. As the name suggest, you can now form clans to create the ultimate team. The game also features a singleplayer campaign, which is heavily underrated. There is also a lot of customization, you can change anything from how your worms speak, to what clothes they are wearing and a lot of maps in the workshops.GraphicsThe has been modernized enough to keep it classic for nolstagic fans as well as newcomers. Worms has always been a cute-killing game. There is also a lot of depth in the levels and interesting map design. Too bad they are not as memomable as the earlier games.SoundAll the guns sounds satisfying, especially the explosions. The voices the Worms makes when they die are hilarious too.VerdictWorms Clan Wars is an excellent party game, and with the brilliant multiplayer it makes it even more easy to pick up and play.It is worms, guys!
