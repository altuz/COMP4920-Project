Looking at the other reviews 1-2 hours on record of gameplay isn't enough to truly expereince this game. Round 12 + Is where people need to really review this game. If you want fast paced? This is it. Overall the controls are hard to get used to sure but for me a keyboard and mouse are absolutely fine. Once your past the learning cuve this game is a blast. Literally.The ships look truly stunning flying past then with their cannons blasting the enemy fighters. And once you are in the higher round and the cruisers are fighting each other its becomes really fast paced. And you can choose to start at round 19 once you reach it and go from there to ""Infinity"". So it does give you the option to bypass the slower levels once you clear them.All in All this game is a 10/10 for me. If you want a High paced Space shooter then this is for you. Graphically stunning and great game play.Cons? Honestly if this had muliplayer I'd be on 300+ hours by now. Its a shame they never gave it the ability for online."

You keep going until you die, when you die your score gets added to the leaderboards.Combat is part dogfighting, and part Mech mode massacre. When you are in ""jet"" mode you aren't very powerful, but you are pretty fast. Your goal is to fill up your red meter, so that you can enter ""mech"" mode. In ""mech"" mode, you become a death machine, but you cant travel great distances very fast. Your red meter will drain in ""mech"" mode per weapon fired. This red meter fills up whenever you kill an enemy.There are 3 types of strike suits, unlocked as you progress through the levels. You can unlock new weapons and upgrades, that you keep when you die.PROS-Amazing visuals, particle effects-Great soundtrack-challenging-good enemy variety-the PRICE!!!!-runs well on my PCCONS-controls could have been better-Each wave in a stage remains the same on every playthrough-Can be alittle bit hard to aim in ""jet"" modeImprovements-Needs more Gund...

SSI takes SSZ's great combat and puts it into a cheaper and a more ""arcade styled"" game.Some features about the combat:The Strike Suit has a ""Flux"" mode, and when activated, your Strike Suit turns into a ""Gundam-sort-mech"" that targets more enemies and deals more damage.It's a pure arcade space combat game, just shoot the bad guys and you are good to go.The music helps fuel what is going on in combat. It will play an ambient tune when there aren't much enemies, but once you are on a final wave, expect an awesome adrenaline pumping track.I find the game is better played with a Mouse and Keyboard, a Joystick works, but I just prefer the Mouse and keyboard since shooting enemies feels a lot easier, instead of having to constantly move your ship to get a good shot.If you have great memories of space combat simulators (ex: Freespace and Star Wars flight action games), Strike Suit Infinity could be the game for you."

Unlike the Heroes of the Fleet DLC for the original Strike Suit Zero from 2013, the player now has the chance to earn credits and to build up a fleet of his own that will support him over the course of the game.There is a total of 18 missions (rounds). You begin on the first round & move straight on to the next. Between rounds you will be able to build up your fleet, unlock Strike Suit Upgrades by solving bonus objectives & selecting the Loadout of Missiles for use. If your Suit gets destroyed during a round you lose the game and your accumulated score gets uploaded to the leaderboards.The game saves your progress if you quit or the game crashes in the middle of a round. The downside to this is that it will deactivate your reached scored from being uploaded to the leaderboard. If you want to have your score uploaded, you either have to die during a mission or play through all 18 rounds in one sitting.On the contrary, you can quit your game in the middle of a round, which automatically saves earned credits, ship upgrades, fleet setup. This allows you to continue next time exactly where you left of and play at your leisure, getting familiar with the game or to try out different setups.Playing through all the rounds in one sitting is a difficult task that requires knowledge about each rounds adversary, perfect planning of your Fleet beforehand as well as a large amount of experience with the games controls & sometimes chaotic, rough but fun space combat.If you love to compete against others, entertaining space combat simulations & a great challenge then go ahead and give Strike Suit Infinity or the original Strike Suit Directors Cut a try.

However, and to my surprise, Strike Suit Infinity is such a nice game, I'd say it's even better than SSZ, because they fixed so many problems I felt the original had.-unlike Zero, Infinity is just there as an arcade kinda game. You ascend higher into the levels and stay alive, shooting as many enemies as you can. mostly for points-you can hire escorts, from tiny ships to massive frigates, and they'll actively help you as long as you help them-you can upgrade both them and your ship thanks to credits you earn throughout the stages-strike suit mode is so sweet, and they actuallly make it more vital to the gameplay by giving you the ability to greatly extend how much you get to use it. Plus, right off the bat you get a good selection of strike suits with different abilities, since you can unlock 1 pretty early, and the other is right behind it.-overall a light and fun experienceEven though I still find issue with the controls, the game is far more lenient in intense firefights, but there's still challenge. They really did improve the core of the game. So yeah, buy it if you can, on sale or no. I recommend it regardless."

The never ending battles in different areas keep the scenery fresh. Two main gripes with the game though.1. No custom game mode as far as I'm aware (I have not beaten all the stages yet). You get thrown in a preset stage and you work through them.2. I don't like having to manage credits and my fleet. If you want (need) a good fleet to take on the later stages with, the amount they give for selecting the stage isn't enough. You need to have it built up from several earlier stages. Also, your fleet does not carry over. Buy 2 frigates? Both of them live? Well say goodbye after the round is over, and no you aren't refunded credits. Why not just have an endless battle as an option? It gets expensive and kinda takes the fun out of it.Other than that, it has all the greatness and flaws of the first game.

76561198070587093,Not Recommended,234160,28284400,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Tranklizer,"Okay, let me begin by saying that Ireallylike Strike Suit Zero. The core gameplay is fast paced, exciting, and the Strike Mode mechanic offers a open space shooter experience that no other game can quite matchexcept for Strike Vector.This only makes me even more sad to say that I can't recommend Strike Suit Infinity. The game I like is in here, it is just surrounded by a bunch of design choices that make it more frustrating than heart-pumping. I say design choices here because all of my greivances could be fixed with just a few simple changes. They are, in order of severity:CutscenesThere is no reason for me to see my ship flying into a hangar and landing before I choose what reinforcements to accompany me in the next round. Yes, you can skip this, but when I just finished blasting a bunch of enemy fighters and finished off the round by destroying a capital ship, I just want to get right back into the action. The menu for breaking down your performance and choosing reinforcements should pop up, you make your choices, and then get into the next round. The setup the game has right now breaks apart the action too much and even the later rounds are pretty short. The gameplay is exciting. Don't make me wait longer than necessary to play it.This is a very minor problem, which is why it's mentioned first, but it annoyed me just enough that I thought I should mention it.The Playing FieldI know space is supposed to be big, but it doesn't have to be THIS big. The game has a nasty habbit of making two separate waves of enemies spawn on opposite sides of the arena. The space is so huge that I have to waste all of my ship's thrust just to get within striking range of the enemies. This also eats up precious time since your performance is partially based on how quickly you destroy each wave. Subsequent waves also spawn based on time intervals rather than when the previous wave has been annihilated. So if you have to waste 10-15 seconds justgettingto the enemies, you could very well find yourself with two waves worth of fighters/interceptors/capital ships to deal with. If the arena was smaller, this wouldn't be a problem. With enemies circling around each other, most dogfights happen within a pretty small space, so a smaller field wouldn't detract from the game, but it would make it significantly less frustrating.The playing field is also a problem because in later rounds, enemies that can destroy your capital ships will spawn from opposite sides of the arenawithin the same wave. Since the allied AI is so incompetent (even at higher performance levels), it becomes nigh impossible to defend your capital ships from torpedos and beam cannons because you can only be in one place and it takes so long to fly to priority targets.The Targeting SystemProbably my biggest gripe with the game is the targeting system and the user interface with regards to enemy awareness. I'll address the targeting system first.When the enemy attack styles are as varried as they are in this game, the ability to pick out priority targets is essential. Strike Suit Infinity does this to an extent. If there are torpedo firing corvettes in the vicinity, your targeting button will select them, which is nice. This becomes a HUGE problem though when capital ships are introduced. Your objective targeting button will direct you into attacking an enemy Frigate itself, rather than the turrets on it, which are much more important targets. It isn't feasible for your strike suit to take on a Frigate or Cruiser, so why does the targeting system insist on my attacking them? It's possible for you to destroy a capital ship by yourself if you shoot the weak spots, but you can't lock on to these points with the targeting system or your missiles. What makes this more frustrating is that Strike Suit Zero didn't have this problem. If you were attacking a Cruiser, the objective targeting button would direct you to its beam turrets and flak cannons, which are the weapons that cause the most damage, and should be prioritized instead of directing you to the ship itself.The next problem I had with the targeting system and the UI was the lack of information about the enemies in the current wave. Many times, I would destroy a few fighters and think that I was done with the wave only to discover that there is one or two more halfway across the playing field that I didn't see and then I need to race off to finish them. There is no counter in the interface that tells you how many of each type of ship are left in the wave (except for capital ships, which are not only listed but have their health on display at all times, which is useful). This can be especially problematic with Corvettes which can do serious damage to your capital ships. If you were facing the wrong way when the enemies spawn, some may spawn behind you and be shooting at your capital ships without you even knowing because you're too busy taking out the one that did spawn in front of you but is so far away you need to waste time flying over to it. Once again, Strike Suit Zero didn't have this problem. If there was a large cluster of fighters, it would display how many were left, giving you a much better idea of how big a threat they posed.ConclusionThe 3d space combat is fun, at least when you are actually engaging in it, but it is held back by just enough frustrations that I can't recommend it. You should play Strike Suit Zero instead. It's much better."

Sure, the graphics are crisp and it has a bit of a twist to the whole dogfighting thing, but there's just some things about it that ruin the experience for me. For starters, the gameplay is repetetive. Blow up an enemy fighter. Ok, cool. Now blow up an enemy transport. And then you just blow things up in space until you get bored. The other thing I hate is how the controls don't center off behind the cursor so if you pitch up, you'll just keep going up indefinetely until you manage to balance your cursor completely. Maybe that's just me though. The one thing I hate the most though, is the missile alert system. Two little, not very visible text boxes with no audio queue, isn't really enough to alert to you that you're about to blow up if you don't do something. I dunno what else to say, it's just not a game I could get behind."

I had no idea what polished, fun, challenging game I was buying when I spent 3 euro on this, going to pick up main story too.In this mode you fight wave after wave of enemy ships, you unlock upgrades and earn credits to spend on better pilots or ships to aid you in your fighting. It's truly an amazing moment when you can buy the bigger ships to help in your fight, like the frigates. First time you encounter enemy frigates you're like ""whoa"", it really feels like a boss fight, taking down all the weak spots, then the game throws 2 or 3 at you.In combat mode you're a space fighter taking down other ships with missiles, machineguns etc., but you can transform in this badass mecha for a limited time to take down everything with high tech weaponry (which changes based on what Strike Suit did you choose).The visuals are stunning, beautiful, I don't care about graphics but sometimes I look at the backgrounds with awe.The sound and music are great and very fitting, I like them very much.The combat is fast-paced and pretty difficult, even if there are 16 levels, you'll be probably stuck on level 5-6 or something.I would recommend this for everyone, the price is a joke compared to the quality of the product.The only downsides I can find are :- Lack of multiplayer (local or not);- More buying options for flavour."

,Not Recommended,234160,8236535,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,RpiesSPIES,"When I first considered getting this game it was for a few things:1. Combat looked quite similar to a space MMO I used to play and love (I knew this was not an MMO-style game, but the gamePLAY is what I am feeling similar) and it also appeared very skill-based (aside from the mech-like form)2. What seemed like smooth flight controls and the sort3. Upgradeability (which was my biggest inclination to purchase this game, as I love games in which they give you the option to stat-build, pick skillsets, as well as upgrade items/abilities/etc.)HOWEVER, when I start playing this game, the feel of the game is very clunky and not as smooth as it makes itself out to look (holding S to reduce speed actually tries to make you go reverse, giving you poor camera control when attempting to slow down). Also, when in combat, the gameplay is more like your average airplane shooting sort-of game where you must lead your lasers (which I don't mind much, aside for it being in a space combat game) and the missile lock-on is very slow and unappeasing (very bland missile animation).I summed up just a few small things right there, but to address the biggest thing that pulled me in, massively disappointing me in the end was the customization and ability to upgrade your ships.Based on my reading, I knew there would only be 3 ships to choose from, that's fine, but when the only way you can upgrade your ships is by destroying a freighter in order to obtain a predetermined upgrade instead of providing a skill point or whatnot, greatly limiting your creativity or playstyle. Also, you gain points every set of waves. What do you use these points for? You use them to hire small fleets of allies and rank up their AI. You gain points at the end of each set of waves based on how many allies survived, then they VANISH. Your allies do not stick with you through the sets of waves, only for ONE SET. After selecting your allies to come with you and whether you want to upgrade their AI, you get to pick your primary and secondary weapons... HOORAY!!! But... You are unable to pick different lasers than the base selection given, and you can only swap one of your missle slots for the other missile you already have equipped and naught else. This customization may improve later on, but for the first ship available, that is all you have access to.Also, the mech form along with auto-aim (hold left-shift to snap to the next target once your current target dies + turn to face them!) is so overpowering, I just run into a mob of enemies, activate, hold shift, and shoot my primaries to end up with a combo of 8 enemy ships killed or whatnot. The mass-missile aiming makes close to no sense that I have no clue what ships it's locked on to nor do I have any idea why it's possible to lock on to the same ship more than 3-4 times (around 15 or so locks is the limit).The map size is larger than needed, at least for earlier rounds. It doesn't give you enough time to fly between objective targets (like freighters so you can get upgrades), and if you do it takes off 50-70% of the time you have, leaving you with too little time to kill the enemy wave in time for the multiplier bonus (this is not helped when the enemies spawn on all 4 cardinal direction entrances).The gameplay is very flashy, and it builds itself up a lot. I wasn't expecting much, but I got less than I wanted and I am generally displeased with the way this game has turned out to be.On the upside, the game looks very nice and follows through with being just wave after wave of combat. If that's what you're looking for, then go ahead and get it, if not, look elsewhere."

A game that's all about the gameplay and the gameplay is great. Taking down a battlecruiser in a battlesuit armed with a railgun has never been more satisfying. Game is perfect with the payoff vs effort. Taking down little interceptors feels just as great as taking down a huge carrier. Dogfighting is just as fun as switching to mech mode and putting the hurt on a capitol ship. Every mission in the game is challenging but rewarding. But it's not so challenging that it's impossible to beat but you have to really try.

With good graphics and low recommended graphic settings I bet everyone can expirence the thrill and excitement that this game provides. The price is definitely worth it since it comes with a decent amount of content with plenty of levels too get your teath stuck into.However the main problem I have is that the game starts to become repetitive after long game periods, since all you are doing is shotting down ships wave after wave. To counter this I reccomend short 1 or 2 hour periods to relax and take a break. This is mostly the reason I have a short game time since not only do I have other games but I get bored easily. This does not mean you will lose interest, trust me after a break I find myself coming back for more espacally after a hard day.Overall definitely pick it up and try it, you won't be dissapointed. If you want a more in depth version of this game I would take a look at Strike Suit Zero which I will definitely pick up in the future."
,Recommended,234160,24296870,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,It's A Trap,"Strike Suit Infinity is a very simple, wave based arena shooter. It is wave based, You have a set amount of time to destroy a wave before the next arives. Doing so rewards you with a bonus score multiplier. Failing to do so ""rewards"" you with a whole new wave on top of what you had left.There are three ships to choose from. While I haven't unlocked the third, the two I have both posess a ""Strike Mode"". In this mode the ship transforms and gains access to homing swarm missles or a massive flak cannon, depending on the ship. Launching enormous torrents of homing missles never gets old. Up to 40 can be launched at a time, leading to some truely impressive displays of vapor trails and explosions.The excellent graphics make these waves of missles even more impressive. Being an arena shooter set in space, the areas are completely empty. But the ships are very nicely detailed and the backdrops are spectacular. What really catches the eye, however, are the spectacular particle effects. Missile trails, plasma blasts and explosions are all eye-poppingly spectacular. The brilliant hues strike an incredible contrast against the darkness of space.Gameplay is tight and the controls are good. As with any other flight or space sim, I would strongly reccomend playing with a dual-shock or similar controler. There is a decent selection of weapons, and the ships can be upgraded by destroying enemy freighters.So, if you enjoy any kind of 3D shooter, I would strongly recommend this game."

Close Lover of Space Sims and Ship to Ship 6x combat.Synopsis: Its Three Dimensional Bullet Hell Lite. For those of you who have not played SSZ this is an Arcade style 6x space shooter. There are a number of flight suits to choose from each with different abilities in their Suit Mode, and individual stats that effect their performance in Flight Mode.Every 3 levels or so you get a special Stage where the enemy is Limitless and you just have to Survive, I think the round is like 5 minutes, but you get scored on your performance and can unlock ship upgrades to boost your Energy levels, shields, etc.It takes the base game, adds a few more Arcade style friendly features including a Global Scoreboard to compare your score against your friends and money that enables you to buy Allied Fighters and Capital Ships for a Stage. Allies are actually helpful and actively take part in the fight. Though it can be pretty embarrassing when they score more kills than you.Final Thoughts: 10/10 would buy the Sequel. It’s an Endless rush of Wave after Wave of increasingly difficult and numerous foes with increasing A.I. reaction that will constantly test you and eventually overwhelm you.

When sometimes a wave spawns in the other side of the arena (which is pretty large) and you turn around to get to them with all your allies, it can take a couple of seconds to even get into shooting range with the longest weapon, you would think that will make the game frustrating, but I found it to be quite the contrary. I think its an epic and tense moment, when you see all your allies ship (which they leave a pretty cool trail so you can destinguish them) charging towars the enemy capital ships, I feel an adrenaline rush... Then the enemy capital ships start firing, explosions all around you and your allies, formations breaking up, engaging enemy fighters, the dogs fight while under heavy enemy flack fire, the torpedos of the capital ships firing at eachother...

The controlls are simple and easy to grasp and the visuals can get pretty stunning when enough units take up the screen. The game is pretty  much a wave survival version of Strike Suit Zero but I actually preffer this over Zero because of the reinforcements option. Choosing the units to fight by your side adds a bit of depth to the game and it rewards you for actually protecting these units. That said the best way to mass credits is to not use them at all. So you will be constantly balancing power and cost.

Further, it has not received the improved graphics or additional strike suit that were provided to the Strike Suit Zero Director's Cut. Infinity is enjoyable the first playthrough and it has more replayability than Strike Suit Zero. However, it still has limited replay variety after all 18 missions have been unlocked.

While the game is absolutely gorgeous from its settings to music, it suffers from a few fatal flaws that made it hard for me to enjoy. The main problem would be the controls, I spent half of my time trying to make the damn craft fly straight. The other half was trying to dodge. The acceleration and combat aspects feel similar to a free roam Starfox, but the target reticle is near impossible to control. The enemies are too shifty to actually line up a shot making the dogfights feel chaotic at best. Mostly the missions consist of mayhem. If the aiming worked more like a first person shooter, I wouldn't have a problem with this game at all. But the game instead works on a scrolling system. If your crosshairs are even the slightest off centered, then the ship will move in that direction rapidly, so you constantly have to find the center of the screen to fly straight. Keep in mind that I had the game sensitivity and my mouse sensitivity set to the lowest possible setting. This game should take a page from the Tachyon games in my opinion. To sum up, this is a gorgeous game with an immersive atmosphere that put me in the cockpit, but the controls really made me dispise massive dogfights. Worth a try if you find it on sale."

Strike Suit Zero’s campaign is awesome and feels great, but we have no control over anything but our own ship. In Infinity we can allocate what kind of reinforcements we’ll be using in certain rounds and there’s a bigger incentive to try and save your teammates.

You go until you die, going through different rounds and buying reinforcements for your fleet, upgrading your ship and etc. It's not a very complicated game. Most of the appeal in this game, in my personal opinion, is that it hits a sweet spot of space fighter sim and a super flashy arcade game. The ships feel great, transforming your fighter ship into a hardcore missile massacre spewing mecha is awesome, the weapons hit hard, and it's easy to just pick up and play. I'd seriously recommend this to anyone who wants to feel like the most kick-butt pilot in the universe."

The way that combat is controlled allows for player skill to carry them through most levels alone, whereas the later levels do require some AI aid. It's fun blowing up ship after ship while also trying to keep your own fleet alive, while also trying to max out the credits you can earn to create the best possible armada.Unfortunately, there are only 3 fighters to choose from and their strike loadouts can't be edited. Only the fighter loadouts can be changed, but that only encompasses missles and plasma. Nothing that really changes how one plays the game. The only exception is the rail gun. More fighters and strike suit options would definitely benefit this game.Then again, I got it for 2 bucks. Get this instead of zero."

,Recommended,234160,30235832,Posted: 27 February,all,ニンフィア ❤,"Pros:1. No storyboard whatsoever - The bland and underwhelming storyboard kinda messes up Strike Suit Zero's experience a bit. Shredding of the storyboard and throws you into the battle actually gets better as that will not be a concern anyymore.2. Customise fleet - More choice is better anyway.3. 3 ships that have different characteristics - suits different kinds of players that takes on different approaches against enemies, which is good because you won't need to be fixed to play the game in a specific way, though arguably the game flow is still the same.Cons:1. Total♥♥♥♥♥♥ally AI - sure the allied AI helps increasing the individual survival rate of your allies, but that is the only thing they do. They don't defend ships from torpedoes most of the time (if it isn't not at all), which means you will need to always go back and forth to protect your capital ships which is painful to play with (especially when you use Strike Suit where you have VERY VERY limited boost despite it should be a speedy ship). Of course the game will be boring if they are way too OP, but at least they shouldn't suck balls like this.2. Predictable enemy loadout - The more you play the boredom due to getting used to all the enemies the game throws at you will slowly make you feel tired and unimpressed. Especially when Rail Gun is OP as hell and rather easy to unlock unlike in Zero where you need to go through Chapter 13, a hard♥♥♥♥♥round to get your prize, you can easy lazer-cut weak points and enemy ships from the longest distance possible aside from Marauder's weaponry. True the game would be ridiculously hard if you can't do that, but that makes machine guns pretty obsolete once you get this weapon."
