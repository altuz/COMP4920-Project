Permadeath and full pistol mechanic implementation turn the game in survival-horror at first, but as you progress and learn to reload your gun properly the game rewards you with the warm feeling of protection granted by the gun you hold. I'd give this game 10/10 if you look for a game to play a session every now and then. And if you don't, then just give it a try. No blood, no monsters and a lot of survival has made the game perfect in my eyes."

,Recommended,234190,9589358,"Posted: 21 March, 2014",all,BasedUshi,"Straightforward game, Complex gunplay.Receiver is a new kind of FPS with a mix of a rogue-like RPG game. The great first person shooter takes the handling of your guns unto a whole new level. This very realistic gunplay requires you to know how to handle your pistol knowing each and every step to perform an action. From changing the safety lock, emptying shells, and removing and reloading you magazine, all have their steps that wipes all the realistic shooters into the dust.Because of this complex use of guns you will die a lot, pretty often actually. It takes time and effort to put to this game in order to complete. Everytime you die you’ll restart in the beginning of this randomly generated world. If you're not a person of patience then this is not the game for you. As you might start in different places on the map don’t expect to receive the same guns, same ammo, and other equipment like a flashlight. Those and as well as placed items are randomly generated.The foes you face in this game are only robots, two kinds stationary sentries, and airborne ones which are equipped with a taser. The lack of variety of enemies can make this came quite boring for some. Knowing how to approach a corner when you hear the beep on a turret or the lights of a flying saucer can make fighting these guys very repetitive.The dark, mostly enclosed setting in a tower gives this game a fighting like theme that fits the unknown exploration well. Learning how to conserve your bullets, finding a working flashlight, and collect these tapes that hold a mystery that involves all of mankind really makes it fun for me to play. As playing a easy game is never fun."

Gun physics are AWESOME, the backstory is told through tapes which you risk your life to obtain, and the enemies scare the crap out of you, even though they really shouldn't. I love the aspect of the non-automatic reload systems, which this game does quite well. Want to reload your gun? Press at the very least 2 buttons multiple times to do so! Want to have enough magazines so that you don't die from having to reload the same one over and over again? Get the whole ""remove mag, place in pouch, take out spare mag, place  in gun, release slide(if needed)"" maneuver down! If you wanna play this game, beware that you will die. A lot. The two enemies do well in covering the randomly generated map, and when you encounter your first one, your trigger finger and aiming arm better be accurate! Locational damage plays a big part with your survival, hit a vital system on one of the two enemies and you'll be a happy camper. Er, Receiver. But hit some useless bit of metal, and you're gonna find yourself out of ammunition real soon. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys shooters where you can actually appreciate the parts of a firearm."

So far it has too do with some kind of.. war that will happen.Gameplay: Simple and bare with mechanics hardly found anywhere else.You start in a abandoned building with a pistols which ranges from a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and a Glock 10 with full auto mod. Everything is random, your ammo count, placement of ammo, and enemies.I should mention that ALL enemies make a sound and lights when they spot you. These are only two enemies in the game that I have seen.Enemy types:Sentries: are stationary, but once they spot you, they fire at you as you would expect.Drones: These little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chase after you once they spot you, choosing to close in at close range to taser you, I have yet to see with with a gun mounted on it.. or destory one.Challange: Think Dark Souls, but First Person Shooter with mechanics that fit more in a military sim. (Roughly)Replay ability: This one is a hard one for me, but it does get a bit tedious after a few tries. So it's doesn't have much replay value.Verdict: 8/10 With deep mechanics with the weapon types and detail of how it works. The Enemy types is dissapointing and the variety of weapons is quite lacking. The reply value is a bit hard for me to say due to the fact you spawn with different weapons at the start of every game and the enemy placement appears to change."
,Recommended,234190,31224258,Posted: 18 April,all,Orange Joe,"This game's an odd one. It's something between a first-person shooter, survival horror, and roguelike game, with its main story told through collectables, sort of like Slender. Because of this, the atmosphere is actually spot on, and the synthwave soundtrack only helps with that.The main selling point, I believe, is the incredibly realistic firearm physics and handling. You start with a random handgun, either a Colt M1911A1, a Glock 17 (or 18, it's kinda hard to tell, but the wiki page says it's a 17), or a Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver, and each one has unique mechanics. Firing while moving or when under fire yourself is difficult, as every outside stimulus effects your targeting. You have to rack the slides on the autopistols when reloading, fumble with the magazines, load bullets into them, and take extra care to make sure your gun is ready to fire. Every type of bullet is lethal, where even one shot can kill you. You have to target weakpoints on the main enemies of the game, which can disable certain functions of them, they aren't damage sponges. You can put the safety on, hold your handgun and flashlight at the same time, preload other magazines you can find, and a slew of other realistic features.I realize this probably sounds really annoying to most players, but I'm an absolute freak about guns and how they're protrayed in media, and this game scratched all the right itches. Either way, I say this is worth checking out for the five bucks it costs."

Problem is, that's not what the game is about. Most of my time in-game is spent wandering around, only to get killed very quickly by a robot.And then there's the random aspects, my biggest gripe. One game I started with no ammunition - at all - and in a hallway guarded by a sentry gun. I couldn't run past it, and I couldn't shoot it - I had no ammo. It brought a quick death. I'm not against random aspects to a game, but there has to be boundaries. Randomly give me between five and fifty bullets. But at least give me one.Personally, I don't think the game is worth $5 - I bought it on sale for $2, and I don't think it's worth that.

Well I'm talking about the ""unplayed games"" month. You know, like every Steam user out there, he buys a game and never plays it ever™? Yeah, true stories. I recommend you do that too: choose a month(emphasis on ""month"" and not ""day"" since be honest with yourself, you're never gonna do it ""one day"", are ye?), google random number generator and go ham! Every day a new game.And quite frankly, I like this game. I like it a lot.Why though?Well here's why:It's a proper handgun simulation quite unlike any other ones out there. And I mean it, from ejecting shells from a plain revolver, to loading bullets in a magazine, and even experiencing the recoil that a full-auto Glock has to give! I'm no Hickok45 when I'm talking about guns, but I still know the basics and rules for handling one, and since my country is no America(cuz muh europe) it's rather difficult getting ahold of one(quote difficult, not impossible), so fooling around in a virtual environment with all the right tools is a blessing.And let's say you're not willingly to either A. get a gun or B. visit America anytime soon.That's ok, since if those two options aren't on your list, then these shall do:-You are a civilian and just want to experience a handgun without actually going out of your way of actually touching one(believe me, from where I come, people avoid guns like the plague)-You are about to and/or will attend in the future either the Police or Military academy. Now remember, just because one will teach you to run after bandits and one will teach you advanced military stuff, that doesn't exclude basic training in handgun usage. For example the police in Sweden uses Walters and I'm pretty sure the rest of Europe(and America) has the Glock17 or later models. And for the military, keep in mind that not every country has the possibility of giving each soldier a ♥♥♥♥ing Desert Eagle, so they'll have to make do with what they're given.Additionally, there is a mod for extra guns. That's right! Extra.BIGGER.GUNS! As of making this review I haven't tried it out yet, so expect a lil' edit here sometime soon.Now I've given my point for the purpose of this game in the world. How about the game itself now?It's an action packed rogue-like in a futuristic funky world.The rogue-like part is essentially what gun you are starting with, the amount of ammo you carry right off, the starting spawn point and the spawns of enemies.  Your main objective in the game is to collect 11 tapes that are scattered around the level, and I'm not gonna lie, it can be pretty infuriating as one time I found 2 tapes in the spam of a minute, and another time I've spent 20 minutes looking for one to no avail.There are two enemies in the game. *ahem*.TWO ENEMIES. That's gotta be a new record for the least hostilities in a rogue-like, period! I guess you can count the third one as fall damage kek. Anyway, there is a turret and there is... Clifford's lost freesbie idfk, it's a flying drone, or that's what I think it is. Both of these guys will one shot you, as the player has only one health. The turrets are usually not a problem as long as you spot them first and keep out of sight, and the flying freesbies are the survival horror aspect of your whole life, as they will charge you like a god damn Apache helicopter, John Cena style, and sap the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your entire existence. These things will be the #1 thing which will kill you, and don't even dare try to contradict me.The guns require a lot of your concentration in order to progress. Albeit the revolver is the easiest to pick on, the Glock and M1911 sure aren't, and will take some time getting used to(when in doubt, press |?|). And even then, it requires a lot of button operations: one opens the cylinder/ejects the mag, one is used to point the gun when needed, other is for holster, yet another to add bullets, and so forth and so forth. This is the beauty of this game, since even if there are only 2 enemies, your main one is... yourself! YOU ARE WHAT HOLDS YOU BACK! To understand the gun, you must be one with the gun. A quote which no liberal will ever say since they haven't shot a gun in their lifes LMAOOOOO amirite lads or amiriteThat's some political humor right there.You haven't asked for it, but you sure got it anyway.tl;dr So what's the conclusion on this? The conclusion is that I want a sequel, and I want it now. The foundation is here, and doesn't need to be changed in any way. It just needs adding: more enemies, more guns and gun types, more diversity in level generation, more of everything, and let me tell you, if it ever happens, it's going to be one of the greatest rogue-like simulations of the century. Receiver is without a doubt, a special little gem. Everyone should own it, it's gun education afterall, unlike...gulp... religious games...This has been your anonymous reviewer, signing off.Have a swell day."

,Recommended,234190,31716347,Posted: 12 May,all,Raimu Bito ~,"Receiver is a unique FPS game by it's mechanics. It has downsides about which I'll talk in a bit, but I personally love it. In order to play it successfully you have to pass a learning curve and it worth it. It has been years since I’ve played it the first time and I still remember how to play it. It’s like a bike – when you learned it, it’s hard to unlearn it.Now, about the downsides. The game was developed in 7-day FPS challenge, keep that in mind. It means that developers didn't have time to write a story or to create many interesting levels. What they did is made solid building blocks, which can be combined together in any way, so the engine generates level while you’re wondering through it. Also, there are two types of enemies and, believe me, that’s more than enough. Standing turrets and flying electrocuting drones are deadly but fair.With that been said I want to tell you about why all the ruckus - gun mechanics. Oh dear, this is just amazing. Every new game you get one gun from three: Glock 17, Colt M1911 and S&M Revolver. All three have different characteristics which are: magazine capacity, fire-mode and damage. Glock can burst-fire and has biggest magazine but has low damage. Colt is a middle ground – does decent damage but has comparatively small magazine. Revolver is the most powerful but it’s hard to reload and it doesn’t have a magazine at all.The amazing part comes when you decide to reload your handgun. Using specific keys you have to manually load every piece of ammo into magazine or cylinder. It feels so good when you do it fast and accurate. You can put ammo into different magazines if you find ones, so you can swap faster. With revolver it’s not the case – you have to unload the cylinder and point gun up while waiting for empty cases or ammo left to fall down, and only after that you should start putting new ammo inside.Enemies, ammo and flashlights are randomly placed on the map and the important part is that every bullet counts. Burst-fire mode is good and reliable but it will leave you with no ammo in a heartbeat. The best way to do it is precise one shots into vital parts of the enemy’s bodies. You see, drones and turrets are mindless and do exactly what they are programmed for – idle until their sensor notices you, make a beep while waiting a fracture of a second and after that engage. Turrets engage by simple shooting at your direction when drones are flying to you and trying to electrocute you with their lethal tasers. The thing is enemies has their modules open so you can disable them with the precise shot. Damaged battery? Enemy immediately is shut down. Shot their gun or taser? They will actively beep and look or fly at you whitout the ability to hurt you. When you destroy their sensors they just idle never realizing you near them. Also you can disable drone’s blades so it will fall to the ground beeping at you and if you come close trying to tase you.So, what are you doing in this odd empty building? You can find not only ammo and flashlights but audio tapes. In order to win you need to gather and listen to all 11 tapes while there are more and more enemies in every new part of the building generated. Tapes play automatically when you pick them up. Nice voice will tell you what’s going on.Now, I strongly recommend to turn music and voice sounds off, so you can focus on idle sound of enemies. Since tapes are random you can listen to every one of them in multiple playing sessions.In conclusion I want say that I never gathered all 11 tapes in one session but I still try from time to time."

This would be fine and all, if exploring mechanics did not mean having a horrible atmosphere, incredibly strange controls, and a very unpolished feel.Don't get me wrong, the guns are good. But there's only 2 of them. I understand that this was originally created for a 7-day game challenge, but I believe Wolfire could have worked on this a bit more to make it complete (oh, and updates are halted indefinately until Overgrowth, which has been in development for 4+ years, is out).The environments are randomly generated but you will see the same rooms put carelessly next to eachother over and over again. And I know that there are some things that can be considered the ""art style"" but almost every room has the same bland, unfinished texture for both the floor and walls. What gives?Finally there are the controls. It would be nice to really explore gun mechanics if I was able to use them easily.

If you get back in the game after a break, you're going to have no clue what in the world you're doing, so you'll mercilessly slap your keyboard and memorize controls that should just be common sense.There are also 2 types of enemies. One is a turret and the other is some sort of flying robot that doesn't detect half of your shots and sometimes gives the impression that it is disabled when it really isn't.It's bland, it's boring, it's unresponsive, it makes no sense, and it won't change for a while."

If you're looking for solitude and escapism, this game might do it for you.Also, the story the tapes spell out for you is vague and ominous. It truly feels unreal, like you stepped into some other reality.The negative stuff: you really will notice that it's an unfinished game. They made it in 7 days, did like one update, and never came back. It suffers from jarring bugs and horrible efficiency. My dedicated gaming PC will still stutter in its texture-less world.

Not built-in though. On the Receiver steam forum someone just added a VR mod that works with oculus and vive.

This relates to the two points above.-Complex controls. I noticed that many of the people who wrote negative reviews are ones that didn't like the controls. Plus, they have low hours.

One of the tightest FPS experiences I've everplayed.Premise of the game is simple--you're dumped into a kind of 'dream world', and you need to recover a series of tapes to 'wake up' (think The Matrix meets Videodrome meets Vanilla Sky. Or something.)You're moving through a series of what are, apparently, interconnected apartment buildings, each with multiple floors that connect across. There are enemies scattered throughout, but only two types: flying kill drones, and turrets. Kill drones will fly straight for you and electrocute you at close range, turrets will shoot a spray of bullets at you from afar.So far, so generic, and a lot less content than most FPS. So why play?Well, what makes the game work so well are the detailed mechanics.First off, if you're struck even once, or fall, that's it--you're dead. Going gun blazing into a room is pretty much game over.Second, you control every mechanic of your gun with a separate keyboard key. Just arming and firing your weapon will take you a few playthroughs to learn, but when you do--it's amazing how rewarding your actions feel.Third, running requires that you 'tap' the forward key, lending a neat kinetic element to the game.Fourth, ammo is scarce, and you'll have to selectively choose which fights you want to engage in... and which to bypass or run for it.Despite the sparse world and somewhat rudimentary graphics, sound design and aesthetics are brilliant, and I haven't been so kinetically into a game since the days of Atari 2600. Bravo!It's hard to explain the culmination of all of the above elements; you'll simply have to try it out for yourself. It's unlike any oher FPS and revolutionary at what it does. I guess I would call Receiver the 'thinking man's shooter'.It's terrific; buy it, then go yell at the devs to show it a little love and update it rather than spending all their time making rabbit-fighting games."
,Recommended,234190,28653235,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Daniel Potter,"First be warned that Receiver is more of a short demo than a full game. Personally, i love its concepts, and i would love it to become a full game. Here is why.It mixes in two of my favourite things in gaming: survival horror and attention to detail.You start off with either of the three handguns: M1911 Colt, a double action revolver, or a Glock, and random amount of ammo with you. The point of the game is to wander around in search of the cassette tapes, and there are eight of them. The levels are random generated, and have enemies, ammo and/or cassette tapes scattered inside.The trick is that you can manipulate your gun. You can manipulate the slide, the hammer, take the magazine out, safety switch, and each gun works differently. For the colt and the glock, you have to check whether the bullet is in the chamber. Or for example, the colt requires you to pull the hammer to be able to shoot it. The revolver also has a hammer, but it is a double action, so it does not require you to pull it back, but you can still do it and it makes it more accurate that way.I also want to mention the enemies in this game - turrets and flying drones. The turret is stationary and it rotates. It has a camera and if it spots you, it starts shooting from its machine gun. The flying drone is a mobile version, with a tazer. One hit from either of them takes you down. Each enemy is made up of some parts: motor, battery, camera, weapon, and depending on where you shoot, you can either partially or fully take them down.You shoot a turret or a drone in the motor, it will stop spinning or flying, but its camera and weapon are still active, and if you get into its line of sight (turret) or close enough (drone), it will kill you.If you shoot its camera off, it will still fly around or spin, but it will be harmless.Also, the turret's machine gun has an ammo box, which you can shoot preventing its machine gun from shooting, but there is still one round in the chamber.Here is for the visual representation:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=328012652As for the survival horror part, i think you have already guessed it. You start off with a pretty low ammo count. You must carefully use what you have, and try to actively find more ammo.The game is pretty hard to complete though, but what matters is not the ending, but the experience. That said, there are cheats to provide unlimited ammo, invulnerability and slow motion. I highly suggest using the slow motion cheat - just type ""slowmo"" and use to tab to switch back and forth in speed."

In Receiver you play as... well a Receiver, who is someone who has survived what is known as the ""Mind Kill"" and must collect eleven tapes hidden in the world armed only with a pistol and some bullets.The game is procedurally generated, almost fully it seems, the world, what pistol and how much ammo you start with, what is placed where, is all generated on the fly, the layout of levels seem to be the same but not the placement, sort of like the game takes these block shaped rooms and places them in whatever order it feels like.The core concept of this game is simple, you start with a random gun picked out of a pool of three types, there are two kinds of robots, turrets and drones, you die in one shot, you must collect eleven tapes, as you gain more tapes, the rooms get harder as there will be more and more robots.Where the unique part of this game comes in is the weapon mechanics, this is not a normal first-person shooter, you can't just aim the gun and expect it to fire, the game simulates to some degree actual pistol mechanics using keyboard shortcuts, so to fire your gun you need to make sure you have bullets in the magazine, make sure the safety is off, pull back the hammer, and so on and so forth.Each action is done rather easily as the controls are very natural and intuitive as well as customizable, once you start playing more and remember the controls you can actually reload and fire faster, much like in real life where speed could be everything, all the guns have a real tactile feel to them, and there is nothing more satisfying then dropping a magazine onto the floor and slamming in a new one that you hand loaded before, pulling back the slide and taking down a robot as it flies toward you.Overall I love this game, despite how simple it is the gameplay is incredibly fun and replayable and is challenging but never seems to be frustrating, having very snappy gameplay and tight controls."

,Recommended,234190,8836201,"Posted: 24 January, 2014",all,Orphan Warrior Burger,"Receiver is... very interesting.In a good way, of course. When you first jump into the game you'll find yourself armed with one of three different handguns, a variety of bullets and/or magazines, and, if you're lucky, a flashlight. This is one of the key features of Receiver - everything is random. Your loadout, the layout of the world, items in the world - just about everything is random in every playthrough (and trust me, you'll be playing through a lot). There's also perma-death - when you're shot (or tazed) by the automated turrets and shock-drones, you're down for the count and thrown into a new world with a new loadout head-first.But even with these different mechanics, what makes Receiver all that interesting if you just get three guns and a flashlight? That would be the five or so different buttons needed to reload. In Receiver, you don't just hit 'R' to slap another mag in, you manually pull the empty magazine out with 'E', holster your gun with '~', slot any spare bullets you have into the magazine with 'Z', draw your gun again, hit 'Z' again to slam the magazine in, and hold 'R' for a second to chamber a round. There are a couple other buttons to do a few extra things, too, and each gun has it's own reloading mechanics (these controls being for the Colt 1911. There's a simpler S&W Revolver and Glock 17 available).While these controls sound unnecessarily clunky, and I can't say they're realistic, it adds a new horror to your gun going 'click' while an enemy is charging you. You don't wait a couple seconds for the gun to auto-reload - you have to keep a clear head and go through each step of the process. Which is why you end up respawning a lot, unless you pause for a minute and drill yourself in the reloading process. This is the key feature of the game, and much more interesting (not to mention satisfying) than it sounds. And, come on, the game's only five bucks without a sale, and if you pre-order Overgrowth (which is a great game) you get this for absolutely free. You (hopefully) won't regret it :P"

Minimalist, beautiful, hard, mesmeric. Utterly recommended.----Now more detail: Receiver is a minimalist and realistic FPS. The game features 3 different models of guns: a S&W Model 10, a Colt M1911, or a Glock 17. It also features procedural levels (generated from patterns), and randomized placement for enemies (of which I've seen two different types, so far), items and objectives. That way, you never get the same experience twice. In addition, you spawn with a random selection of items, which can make the game difficulty range from moderately easy to very hard, depending on what you get.The idea behind the game is to be as close to a realistic gun handling experience as it is possible with a keyboard and mouse. It means that the game maps to the keyboard/mouse a lot more interactions with the gun than existing titles, and also, does so with much greater details than usual FPSes. In addition, the difference in the power of each gun is very noticable, making the experience feel even more authentic.A must have."

I highly recommend that you mod this game with the mod that adds guns like the Mauser C96, the Tokarev TT33, and the Remington 870.Now, the game dips quite a bit on optimization; you can only run it smoothly on fastest/640x480 video settings, but it still is good enough. As the game generates nearby rooms, it also can lag up and make it troublesome to kill that one drone that saw you enter but you can't see hurtling towards you. It also dips in vanilla choices and the game seems very incomplete without textures to cover the blank walls and only 3 guns.The story behind the game is what you take from it, but I'll let you in on what I took from it.You have survived a great cataclysm called the Mindkill, which was an attempt at shutting down your brain with propaganda and media corruption. A receiver is a person who can turn around the negative effects of the Mindkill, with the help of a set of Cassettes called ""Clear Tapes"" to jog your mental capacity and remain on point. The killdrones and sentry drones are dreamed in to stop you from collecting all the tapes, to become awakened, and to stride carefree and conscious. While one can dream endlessly on, it takes one with true enlightenment to break free from the tyranny and claim their mind as their own.Heheh, I probably botched that up hardcore.This game gets a 8/10, with a WHOLE lotta room for improvement and even more potential.

It feels rewarding to get proficient with each weapon. I wish someone would take this concept (of micromanaging reloads and gun handling) into a more playable more polished concept. As for Receiver, yes you can put a few hours into it, but ultimately it's too frustrating. There are only 2 types of enemies, some are too easy and some are nearly impossible. The stationary drones just spin in place, telgraphing their movements and give you plenty of time to shoot them with well timed and aimed shots. The aerial drones, which I refer to as ""Flying F!@#s"" are impossible. There is just no way to see them (all) in time and they are just too fast, some rooms will spawn 4 or 5 of them. Your field of view is too small to see them and they are just way too fast and maneuverable. I think they were supposed to be an enemy who would force you to rapid reload under pressure, but in practice they either don't detect you and drop with one shot, or you empty your mag on one while the other one zaps you from behind. I really do like playing this, but its not developed to a stage where you'd really want to try and ""play through"" to the end (believe me I've tried).

The plot of the game is you are what is known as a ""receiver"" and you exsist in what people call ""Reality B."" Receiver is known as a rouge game, meaning everytime you die, you take a new body, the rooms are connected in a different order, to top it all off, you start off with a new gun in a different state, maybe even a flashlight.

Two, reloading firearms is made much more involved. Rather than the usual r to reload, you have a whole set of actions: remove the magazine, holster your gun, put a bullet in the magazine, take your gun back out, put the magazine back in the gun, undo the slide lock, switch out of automatic.Together these combine in an interesting way. At first, to get anywhere you have to use the help feature, a set of most of your keybindings that highlights what you probably want to do at any given time - especially, what actions you'll have to take to get your gun ready to fire. However after a few hours of play this isn't really needed any more, you've figured it out. Dozens of short plays ending in death tend to do that. It's a nice manual quality; it feels like I've learned to fire a gun in the usual way, practice with my hands.This was almost certainly intended by the game makers. The scarce plot serves as justification for the main goal, finding tapes to listen to in order for your character to become ""awakened"" to the true Gnostic reality, which has been obscured from humanity at large by the ""Threat"". One tape in particular tells the character that they have been mentally weakened by popular media for years, and that the tapes are only a small step. The only way to escape the destructive Threat influence is by finding all the tapes, _and listening to them repeatedly_ (a million times is the suggestion).There's a minor suggestion that the player is themselves in a deeper layer of the Gnostic heap, only able to get these messages from true reality through fiction. Considering the gun learning process, and that you will listen to the tapes repeatedly over your playthroughs, the intent is I think clear.So that's neat. Of course all games do this learning to some extent, but it's interesting to see it more or less explicitly mentioned, and applying to something more ""real world"" than laying out character stats or something. (At least, I think real guns work mostly like in Receiver? I haven't touched one in years...) Of course I'd prefer if the skills taught were something other than firearms but what can you do.The game does have problems. The graphics are primitive and glitches are apparent; for example you can jump through the ceiling in a few areas. More importantly I think, the game is pretty small. It was made in a week or such like and the lack of content shows. There are a limited number of room layouts that are spliced together to form your environment and it gets repetitive, and there are only two types of enemies. There's a load time between some rooms, that freezes the game for a few seconds; the resulting disorientation has gotten me killed many times.It's definitely worth the less-than-ten-bucks however."

As such, the visually bare environment really suits it.  Much more would be less--the game is a work of art in its own right.  The premises and specifics of the storyline are New-Agey (and therefore pretentious, if not ridiculous), but they do provide a context for playing and winning the game.  The ending kinda sucks, but it's really about the journey.The game is challenging.  Ammunition tends to be very limited, especially for the Colt 1911.  It only takes one shot to take you down, but depending upon your shot placement, several rounds may be required to take down a drone or turret.  Player character seems to have brittle bones disease.  If you fall or jump more than a few feet down, you will die. There are no checkpoints or saves. When you die, you have to start all over again in a new, ""randomly"" generated map, with a ""random"" loadout of equipment.   You will probably die numerous times before you actually finish the game.   Most of those times, you will probably feel stupid.  Other times, you will be completely out of ammunition, having started with little, having found little, having used what you had efficiently, and having died trying to get more.Game actually succeeded tricked me into listening to recordings of the same  of asinine drivel over and over again, while I thought I was having fun.

For a game that was made in seven days (albiet with some post release content), I'm rather impressed on how it came out.Sure it doesn't look that impressive from a technical standpoint and it can be REALLY hard at times, but half the fun is the learning curve. The controls are complex, but the game's help menu really helps ease you in. After a few deaths muscle memory will take over and you won't need it.It's quite an empowering feeling when you get the drop on two drones and nail them both in two shots. In other games that doesn't sound impressive. However, in reciever it is.

The game itself focuses on detailed gun manipulation that turn the automated actions of reloading, swapping mags or just checking how much ammo you got left, into detailed keystrokes that can end in disaster if used wrong in a combat situation. This is a great basis to give the game a lot of replayability even though it only features 3 weapons and two types of enemies as, like in a good action puzzler, your precise timing and situational awarness are tested over and over again even if you played through it before. The randomized layout and placement of enemies and pickups further adds to the replaybility of the title.If you are not turned down by perma-death and the inability to safe or load a gamestate and you have a soft spot for punishing first-person action combined with a fresh look at gun play, this might be the title for you."

Basically, you walk around getting casette tapes where then a man narrates some gibberish, giving context to the scenario, a la Bioshock.

And while trying to listen to the tapes while walking around the single, randomly generated level, you'll probably get shot by a turret and die.Speaking of the randomly generated level, it's aesthetically awkward.

That was a damn good game.The core concept of the game is, ""What if using a gun in an FPS was as complicated a process as it is in real life?"" and that boils down to each little part of the gun having it's own button associated with it. You don't just tap the R button and watch a cool little animation and then be on your way, you have to do all the little things required and in the right order as your situation dictates. At the start you will fumble around with the gun functions and may not even figure out how to shoot for quite a while. Then after a few minutes you may start to get the hang of it, albeit taking your time between shots. After a few hours of playing you will really get the hang of things and reloading will be like clockwork.Even the enemies, which are little robots, have a similar complexity to them. They don't just have an HP bar that empties out after a few shots. You have to hit them in very specific parts to disable certain functions of them until you can safely pass by. It's up to you to learn where your shots count the most for disabling them.The world is rather bland, however, and consists of a bunch of randomly generated rooms in sequence. You will get very used to these room as there is very little variety between them. You will figure out pretty quickly where the ammo drops can be and where the robots can be placed in certain rooms. It's the only real flaw in the game.The music is decent and gives a proper mood to the whole thing.One odd thing to note about the game is that you have to go to a separate website to patch the game.Specifically here. Otherwise the game run's very poorly I've heard. I've only played the game patched and it is recommended.If you are someone who want's a score then I give the game 5 cassette tapes out 5.

The gameplay is not unlike the '-Shock' series, where you're looking for audio tapes whilst trying to avoid and/or get-the-drop-on drones and turrets. The real difference in Reciever is in the shooting/gun mechanics.The gun you have in 'shooter' games is usually little more than a fancy finger that goes 'pew pew' wherever you're pointing it. In Reciever, your weapon is a very realistic *system* with which you must learn to interact, both successfully and quickly, in order to survive combat scenarios. This means knowing how many bullets you have in your clip, replacing a clip when you need to, not dropping bullets by accident as you're trying to refill a clip on the fly. All of this is in your direct control. No random dice-rolls... if you get caught with your pants down, it's on you.It's that direct relation of personal skill and performance that really draws you in. You will die quickly, and often. But each time you load up the game, or 'respawn', the environment is shuffled randomly. Even the equipment you start with is randomized. No two games are the same. And with almost zero load time. Just get killed by a drone that you didn't know was there until it was too late? It's okay, you immediately find yourself in a totally different place with a new weapon(1 of 3 , that I've seen) to familiarize yourself with and the lessons you learned from your previous life still fresh in your memory... now go see how long you live this time!This is a great game and I honestly think every person who's ever played a FPS before should play it. If for no other reason than to gain a little more respect for the weaponry that so many of us have grown to take for granted.It's cheap. It's great. I recommend it."

The game is all about surviving to collect 11 tapes that give background to the story, similar to collecting the Slender notes. The world is randomly generated from a series of rooms and a variety of randomly chosen preset enemy and loot locations.The biggest part of the gameplay however is learning how to use your gun, which is a very close and very fun aspect to learn. It's no longer about running and gunning, it's about preparation. How many bullets do I have? What enemies can I see ahead? How far away are they and how can I handle them best? Surviving in this game isn't required, but it's a true testament that you constantly want to strive for that.The only real complaints I have was that learning how best to disable the killbots is only really told through either trial and error or the tapes, which you can be lucky and spawn near three, you can be unlucky and spawn near none. I suppose it would've been nice for maybe the first spawn to give you access to the tutorial-like tapes, and have the rest of the levels be random, but given the turrets have odd shapes and sizes, you'll figure something out eventually.For five dollars, the mechanics are complex, the enemies are powerful, the world is ever-changing and luck has to be on your side to really get far. Overall, a graphically simple but gameplay complex game. Perhaps not worth five dollars, but a bargain at -any- sale."

This is by far its most fascinating--and fun!--feature.  It also sports a simple and unobtrusive soundtrack that, for me, draws me straight into this dark, simply rendered, rough-around-the-edges, strange, and wonderful place.The controls take some getting used to, mostly because of the complex actions they are used to perform.  FPS veterans: forget everything you think you know about first person shooters for this one.  The panic that sets in at the disheartening *click click* of an empty chamber, unloaded magazine, or an uncocked hammer, as an enemy bears down on you, is wonderful and frightening.Still, not terribly long into my first session, I found myself, mostly through muscle memory, ejecting a magazine to peek at how many rounds I have left, loading it back into the gun, peeking in the chamber to make sure I have a round loaded, taking a deep breath, and rounding a corner to fire directly into the camera of a robotic sentry gun just as it ""beeps"" in hostile recognition, seconds from destroying me.  Only after the encounter was over did I realize I was completely on autopilot.Receiver is definitely the most unexpected, fascinating, and mechanically interesting game I have played in a long time.  It is breathtaking in its visceral simplicity.  It requires a certain sense of open minded wonder to fully appreciate, and it is certainly filled with flaws, both in terms of polish (it was made in 7 days for a competition) and in terms of its unusual game mechanics.

If the developer could add the smell of gun powder and lubricant oil the game would be complete.The game:All the variables are randomized at each start. You will spawn with either of the 3 weapons available and the amount of magazines and bullets you spawn with is also randomized. Most of the stages offer more than 4 routes to get past and all of the enemies are spawned randomized.The one thing to bare in mind though is that: The more bullets you find and carry, the more enemies will spawn in the next area. As a kind of progressive difficulty I guess.The story is not that important as you are the receiver of audio tapes carrying an audio tape player. The tapes you find will progress the game and when you have collected 11 tapes, the game is complete. But don't expect to complete the game in the first playthrough.The gun handling is the main concept of the game as each action bound to a button manipulates the gun in one specific way. There's no ""R"" to reload automatically and watch a prerecorded animation play that lasts 4 seconds, you are the one doing the heavy work.You press one button to: Pull the slide back, eject the magazine, pull the slide catch down or up, activate safety, grab a magazine from your harness, etc.The first hour of the game is probably a learning process but after that, the game is a lovely charming experience of gun porn. It will be satisfactory when you manage to do a speed reload in 2 seconds and shoot a bot coming towards you.Are there ways this game could be better?Absolutely. It could use more textures, mipmapping, bumpmapping, atmospheric soundscapes and more stages and weapons but as a concept of gaming it is complete. I would love to see moouse gestures implemented as a means for the actions that have longer motions. Buttons like safety, slide catch, mag release and cylinder spin can still be button specific, but actions like pulling the slide and manipulating magazines and bullets could be mouse gestures. Hold CTRL to make the mouse button appear and start clicking and dragging.But I'm not afraid that this is the last game with this concept as other games inspired by this is slowly appearing on Steam Greenlight as well as on the web."

That pretty much sums up what this game is, from it's concept, of course.Now, let's start the real review:Graphics: Made in Unity 3D, the game has simple graphics and places that seems to be missing textures. But it's all part of the game's visual art style and concept. Enemies desing are also pretty simple and you can spot then on sight (Witch is essential in this game IMO). I guess the gun model is okay, since it gives player a good vision of what he's doing with it and where he's REALLY poiting at. Skybox is dead, but you really don't need it in this game.Gameplay: This is the jackpot in this game. The realism put into shooting, reloading, carrying and using your gun is something so nice to see in a FPS and that even most AAA studios keep forgetting that it exists. Playing this game using the device that simulates a pistol is even better. All the controls, from the keyboard/mouse/device responds pretty well and always keeps the game fluid and dinamic.Even tough gunplay is the biggest part of this game, it also haves an objective: Collecting all your self recordings so you can finish the game. But finding then is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Not only you don't have a radar, but you will die a ♥♥♥♥ING lot in this game. It IS hard. And i mean it.

It's not because the game is realistic that the enemies will also be. 2-3 shoots and you are dead. Make sure of always keeping your ammo at count, or else, you are ♥♥♥♥ed.Soundtrack: Missing. Even tough the self recording are pretty neat to hear, i just can't like this monotunus atmosphere. They could've put some songs like The Stanley Parable did (Or SuperHot) to don't let the player attention go away of the game. Mostly because that if you are not paying attention, you are dead.Story: Most of it is explained through recordings. It's not a gigantic plot, but it does it job of keeping the player guessing. Going through uncovering the secrets of the protagonist organization and himself is quite awesome and it has a nice progression...When you find then in order, that's because the only bad thing is: If you die, your found recording count will reset, so, if you want to find a new one that you haven't heard yet/don't want to hear the same thing again from a past one, good luck with that.This game is more considered a ""project"" than a game itself.

Basically it breaks down all the physical actions required to operate a gun, then binds (nearly) every individual action to a key, then puts it on top of a standard FPS control setup.So it's fun to manage bullets, but it's more difficult than it really should be due to luck. Which leads me to my only real gripe with the game.Every time you start a new game the world is randomly generated from a set of premade areas that connect in a linear fashion. Since item placement, starting equipment, and enemy placement is randomized as well, you can end up with a bad start and find no ammo but run into tons of enemies.Lastly, when moving from one prefab-area to another, the game seems to hitch for a second while it loads stuff, this has killed me so many times I think it's probably the biggest flaw.

For example, sometime's you'll take out 4 enemies with one shot each, and sometimes you'll have to dump 10 bullets into a turret's weakpoint before it stops moving.What you spawn with is randomized, which means sometimes you can spawn with a revolver and 30 bullets, and sometimes you'll spawn with a M1911A1 and 4 bullets.Where you spawn is also randomized.

This well crafted gun simulator is, like they say, easy to learn but hard to master. Learning each weapon and how it is operated by muscle memory is fluid and satisfying; I never tired of loading and charging a weapon.The minimalistic presentation of the game environment allows the gun to be the focus of the game, as it should be, but each section in the procedurally generated world has its own challenges and secrets. After some practice you will grow well versed in traversing these environments and scanning them for threats and loot, which brings its own satisfaction.Perhaps the most satisfying of all the game's elements is its actual combat. Enemies come in two types: hovering taser drones and static turrets, both of which can deliver instant and fatal damage to the player. The gameplay here is challenging, but never unfair, and the quick restarts allow you to dive straight back into the game and apply what you've learned from past mistakes. The trial-and-error nature of Receiver's gameplay gives it a visceral and ephemeral feel comparable to that of Hotline Miami, although with a vastly different tone.Like the rest of the game, Receiver's story is delivered in a minimalistic and really quite interpretive style. You are tasked with exploring the world and collecting all eleven casette tapes, which contain a wealth of esoteric knowledge, accessible only to the specially mentally conditioned, known of course as 'receivers'. Despite their monotone delivery, I never really became bored with the tapes even after repeated listens. By the time you have heard all eleven, you will have memorised a great deal of background story information, which gives the feeling that youarea receiver. The casettes mention important story threads such as 'the Threat', 'the Mindkill' and multiple realities with such passing apathy that one is forced to imagine what exactly they entail, making the story that much more interesting. Without so much being left to the imagination, the game's story could not have had nearly the same effect.All told, Receiver is a simple but beautiful game. Its developers set out to create in seven days an engaging and accurate gun simulator with minimalist storytelling and they have succeeded by all measures. Receiver is a cheap buy and well worth a look from a fan of the shooting genre."

But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.The main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet.While the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.While there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.But lets review the features of this game.FeaturesDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto modWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.Taser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage modelsAs said above before the features. This is true.Ballistic modeling of ricochets and bullet dropAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill eventThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.Become literate in how guns actually operateI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.While the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.I belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once.Now for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?For 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability."

If you like things that are super hard then GO FOR IT! But otherwise the controls are over done. That is both neat and annoying. Maybe if there was the ability to lean around corners it be an ok game. Then as well maybe a difficulty setting would be nice.

You engage at your own pace* taking short bursts of high risk. ""High risk"" can be as mundane as turning a corner. If you don't see the telltale spotlights, robots shoot you and you die instantly. Situational awareness is sacrosanct and there are no non-diegetic distractions. It manages to be tense, and then routine, which causes laziness and then death. The high lethality, immobile enemies, and detailed gun manipulation emphasize readiness. To get ready, there's lots to do. There's nothing like being ready to go with a robot around the corner, magazines topped off, safety off, ironsights up, and dying because you forgot to chamber a round. The game does suspense very well.You start completely over when you die. You collect random pickups for your random gun around randomly placed enemies in random structures**. There are ""plot"" tapes to collect but you won't realistically collect them all ever. Some are blank. It's neat how nakedly cultlike they are. Like a real-life cult, not videogame-standard delusional idiots. Mystical ideas have materialist labels. The speaker in the tapes is a gun-and-apocalypse obsessed cult leader. He says they're magical superpower-granting tapes. You have to listen to all of them a ridiculous number of times (it's meta, you will hear the same ones over and over.) Your gun holster and pouch and loose ammo is standard kit. It's almost what the Branch Davidians would sound like if they did their propaganda mail-order.Ultimately though, it's not very good. It's kind of ugly. It's badly optimized, and lags when generating a new area. There's hardly any content. The lighting is obviously wrong in places. Some of the procedural areas don't ""line up"" and connect right. One map area has stairs with an invisible ledge you have to jump over. If you jump on a bed your head clips through the ceiling. The environment can clip through your inventory. It's possible to get physically stuck where it's impossible to get out or die. There are a ton of tapes and sometimes the random number generator is just unfair. The game has a lot of problems. It's an extremely unrefined version of a neat idea***, so I wouldn't recommend it to most people. It's only five bucks and I'm not most people, so it worked out for me.*I died at spawn once because a robot spawned in an adjacent area in line of sight.**Technically procedurally random but who cares.***Because it literally is, it took a week to make."

I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but there is a major problem with it. This game is sooooooo poorly optimized it is nearly unplayable. According to the store page, my PC not only met the Minimum requirements, but the Recommended requrements (barely but still) yet the game had UNBEARABLE framerate and mouse lag. I  mean it takes almost 2 seconds for the gun to move after you move the mouse. Sure, what's 2 seconds? Well in a game where you have enemies that are flying quickly, turrets that can kill you almost immediately after spotting you and limited ammo to hit small targets on previously stated enemies... yeah the mouse lag can really be a problem. It wouldn't bother me if the requirements of my PC aren't powerful enough, but I have read the requirements and they match (so don't blame my crappy Computer that [supposedly] meets the requirements).Now onto the actual game... there isn't much. The game is very simple. Collect all the Cassette Tapes around the level, while killing off all enemies and trying to survive. The main feature is the realistic gun unloading/reloading mechanics. Everytime you need to reload or whatever, you need to manually pull back slide, take out magazine, store in inventory, take new magazine out of inventory, load new magazine, unlock slide, and pull back hammer before being able to fire your gun. Each step has its own corresponding key to hit and it overall is annoying. It loses its novelty very quickly and just makes reloading a chore. It also makes it impossible in a firefight. Also each of the three different weapons has different reloading sequences... great.Also levels are randomly generated after death. So once you die, cassete location, enemy location and type, bullet count, flashlight batterey life, and gun type all change. This gives the challenge and overall is annoying since enemies (who instakill I should add) can be right around any corner. Also bullets are in random spots so good luck finding them when you have ran out and are now running from your life against flying guys in a hallway that has a turret around the corner at the end of it. What should happen is instead of the levels randomize after death, have a randomize button so you can know the layout and actually finish a level.Overall, the game has a cool idea but the poor optimization and annoying instakill enemies with tiny weakpoints ruin a game that could have had some really tense atmosphere."

The main attraction of this game is how it handles gunplay so realistically. Rather than have you automatically reload, you have to manually do each step to reload. If you miss up, there's just more time for flying sentries or turrets to get you. The point of the game is to traverse a randomly generated maze of bleak colors to find cassette tapes that provide background to the universe.The game's atmosphere is wonderfully dark and creepy. It does a great job of making you feel alone, and the dark colors combined with the low-quality models and textures create a sense of dread and otherness that makes you really feel like you're out of your element, running through a maze you have no map of that's filled with enemies that are more location-savvy than you.The gameplay is fun and rewarding. When you first start, you're probably gonna be really slow at handling your gun. You'll die a lot, and you'll forget certain steps, completely halting any progress in loading a new magazine into your weapon, typically under enemy fire. You won't have much ammo, and will have to conserve your bullets, though eventually you will run out right before entering a room full of enemies. As you get better at the game, you'll be able to load your gun faster and be more precise with your shots, wasting less ammo.

Random weapon loadout, random level design, search for the mcguffin objectives (with embarassing voice work), and frustrating enemies that have locational damage models that mean that it's pretty much random if your shots do any good.Basically, the game is designed as youtube scarecam fodder, with all that entails.

Sometimes I spawn with a different weapon than previously, and in a different spot. You die in a couple shots from the rapid-fire turrets, and die in one hit from a flying electrical ball thing. So really, you die a lot, and veryu quickly. Your weapons do a little less damage than I'm used to, but overall a fun game.

For example, how you control your gun. There are 3 basic weapons; The M1911 Colt, the Glock 18, and a .357 Revolver (I think it is a .357) and all three have their own way of control. The Colt and Glock have the same controls except that hitting V forthe Colt will put on the Safety while the Glock makes it either go Semi or Automatic. I like the Revolver and how you can spin the chamber as much as you want with the mouse wheel. Or you can spin it before you place it back. There is a lot of stuff about the game that makes it a good game. On the other hand, I do go through a little bit of some issues here and there. For example, I get random FPS drops when going through different areas on the map, but it goes away half a second later. And I am currently having Lighting FX issues (Probably my side). Besides that, this game is definitely worth it. Especially with the recent gun additions to the game.9/10"

It's inherently satisfying to manually reload your weapon as quickly as you can, once you have a grasp on the mechanics. It's tense and fun when you hear a drone around a corner, look out for its camera light, and time it just right to shoot and disable it unscathed. There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.However, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.It's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift."

This game is basically a quicky roguelike involving a gun and I strongly suggest tapping the ? button followed by holding it down while handling different things so you can quickly learn how to take your gun apart and reload it.That right there is why you're playing this game. You're vulnerable, the gun is barely a comfort and you're constantly worried you're going to take one step too far and find yourself dead and starting over. The three guns all feel a bit different and funny enough, just like real life, I can't stand the Glock. Points for involving a revolver and the 1911 though.It's five bucks, if you're a fan of shooters or if you actually shoot, this game is at least worth a look at some point. I wouldn't mind seeing a proper game made of this concept. I like it."

You must operate the handgun properly, managing magazines, loading, unloading, cocking, safety catch, even loading the magazines with rounds. All this must be done whilst searching for 11 tapes scattered around a set of random repeating areas with enemies to get in your way. Keep in mind, one hit from an enemy and you're dead and start from scratch.

It's a quite unique game in my opinion.First thing: the way you handle the gun is very realistic, so the button layout is very different than normal games, especially when you reload. You have to press each button for certain actions; for example, with a revolver, you must1) open the chamber 2) drop all the empty cartridges (some may get stuck sometimes, so you gotta shake em/hit the key repeatedly) 3) reload each bullets 4) close the chamber.<<so there are 4 different buttons to press to reload as for other games, reload is just 'r'. There are three different types of guns: Glock, Colt 1191, and S&W revolver. They all have different ways to reload, but the same action = same keys. You will feel SOOOOOOOOO achieved if you get used to reloading well that you can reload smoothly and fast without even thinking.There are only two types of enemies in this game: automatic sentry gun & flying taser robot, which is kinda scary when you actually face them because they **cking fly at you like a tsunami. They have limited sight (so sneak when you're out of their sight and ambush? I guess. That's not a very good word for this kind of situation but I suck at English so... Yeah..) but they if they detect you, good night man (unless you have an Asian reflexes on mice or consol that you can hit certain part of robot when it's flying the **ck at you). And damaging certain parts will either break (different parts) or kill the machine.Anyways, the goal of this game is to find 11 recorded tapes and I think it's game over then. HOWEVER! I bet not a person among 1000 players can finish this game as fast as they thought it would end. As you can see, I played 10.4 hours of this game and still wasn't able to finish the game and I consider myself not THAT bad of a FPS shooter... I'M ASIAN FOR GOD'S SAKE!Uhh.... I wanna explain more but I gotta go to sleep so.... maybe if someone asks to write more about this game I'll write it in Korean and English both detailed.

,Recommended,234190,29886471,Posted: 12 February,all,dninemfive,"I got this on sale for two bucks. Definitely worth that price, and probably worth $5. It deserves a Superhot treatment, though. It's a must-have for people who like interesting shooter concepts (for example, those like me who played the Superhot alpha in 2011).Pros:- Great use of atmosphere, the enemies are legitimately imposing- The core mechanic, where you have to manage inventory and your gun, is compelling- Disabling enemies isn't just a matter of shooting them enough, you need to aim for the right place (like the camera on a sentry turret)Cons:- The point is to listen to 11 casettes, but your progress resets every time you die. There should be some way to progress after a run - when you get to like 5 and then die it's discouraging.- It could use a bit more variety in terms of enemies and weapons. I'll expand on this at the bottom.- It really needs some form of progress between levels.- Death from bullets is slightly delayed so sometimes you can't tell if you got hit for a few secondsIn terms of variety, there are three weapons in the game, which are randomly given at the beginning. The revolver is weak and slow, the 1911 is good, and the Glock is very good. You can't to my knowledge find new weapons in-game. I feel it would be interesting to find, say, a shotgun or a rifle when you advance pretty far, not to mention having to manage 2 weapons and their ammo would increase the core mechanic's longevity. Also, there are two enemy types in the game: stationary turrets and melee drones. It feels like there should be one more, perhaps a humanoid ranged enemy, to increase interest later in a run."

This game, unlike other FPS's, take the approuch of being as real as possible: Every single thing you do with the gun is another step for you to take.  Unloading a clip?  Reloading?  Safty?  All of those need to be done one at a time.  Although this may seem risky, this game does it to a whole new level and makes it interesting.  Mechanics are a bit awkward to get a handle of at first, but after about a half hour of play-time, you begin to get the hang of it, gaining some progress in the game.  I can almost memorize all the buttons required for reloading.Enemies are nothing special, though: they basically boil down to stationary turrets and flying robot helicopers from SpyGear with tazers that go *zap*.  Nothing unique, but far from being easy.This game does a good job of making it a challange without making it either laughably easy or insanly hard.  At first, the game is difficult, but then you get a hang of things and it begins to get easier.  It's well paced.Randomly generated areas also help the game's overall success.This game is fantastic for what it is.

I have a high-end rig, yet performance was somehow a problem.  Its particularly frustrating when you're playing at a crawl-pace to avoid dying (you die so easily and frequently that you're forced to), only for the game to stall for a second when you finally encounter a robot and that's that, game over.  I was frequently placed in dark portions of the level w/o a flashlight to start w/ (even when you find a flashlight, it only illuminates ~10 feet or so).  Even after maxing brightness on my monitor I was annoyed w/ how hard it was to see in the darkness.Oh yeah, and don't expect anything from the 'story', as it consists of tapes w/ an annoyingly borish voice droning on about something I didn't care about (something about how 'dangerously addictive media' had destroyed the world).In conclusion, it really is mildly interesting, and I appreciate what the devs did.

,Recommended,234190,465316,"Posted: 6 May, 2013",all,𝔩𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔴𝔥𝔞𝔩𝔢,"Created by a team of 4 in a week for a FPS game design challenge, Receiver revolves around realistic gun mechanics in a (very) randomly generated world. Despite being an FPS game, the gameplay focuses more on actually controlling and preparing your firearm and stealth rather than on modern ""realistic"" cover shooting concepts. Reloading magazines manually,  emptying revolver chambers, and juggling your inventory are actually all very enjoyable, even more so when you manage to learn the controls. The randomization is very strong, starting you off with one of three random handguns, a random amount of ammo, and occasionally a mag light. Room objects, enemies, pickups, and lighting all are randomized, making you want to explore. However, the randomization also causes issues; one game I spawned right next to a taser drone with 3 bullets. Overall, I think this is worth picking up just to experience it, especially with the low asking price."

Interesting grim and cyberpunkish ambiance despite it's low-budget nature. Rogue-like, enemies hitting you means instant-death, hence very challenging, I couldn't beat the game yet. Things often go smoothly for some while, where knowing the buttons halfway through is enough to know. More often than not you'll find yourself facing multiple enemies at once - hovering shock drones that hunt you down, and stationary sentry turrets - with only a few bullets left in your magazine, choosing to either fight or run. This can put you under some stress and make you panic. It's where the wheat is probably seperated from the chaff in this game. As it would work in real-life I assume when you not know your gun inside out."

You can start with anything from a .44 with a dozen rounds, or a 9mm with three measley bullets.The gunplay is satisfying and tactile, and the game is arranged such that you won't need to do the dozen things involved with operating a gun in a hurry. The pace is slow, and you have as much time as you like to get ready.It's possible to get up a list of keyboard commands on screen to help you know what to press and what does what.In all, a great concept, very well designed.

Even at the lowest possible graphical settings i was getting 10 fps. i can play tf2 1080p on max settings so why are there issues with this? Perhaps with a source engine port and fixed controls, i could enjoy this one.To be fair, the difficulty needs to be lowered. An infinite amount of loose bullets would be nice, and ""lean"" keys so that i could see a turret and not get shot in the face. Also there is no damage gradient, i.e., you are either dead or not, you are not ""injured"", you are killed.Also, there are no nice touches, like smoke at the end of your gun. Needs some artistic work. It seems it wants to be tf2-esque whenever you look at the enemies up close, but the gun models, tape models, bullet models, all seem to be trying to be too realistic, especially in a game where the main objective is to scavenge 80's Walkman tapes and take out cartoony turrets, all the while trying to scavenge and conserve ammo.The most offensive part is that there is no fov slider. I feel uncomfortable when i have literally 20 things around the map that can one-hit me that I need to seek out, wit the range of vision Helen Keller has when she is wearing a cone collar. And she's not only blind, deaf, and further restricted by the cone collar, but she's also dead.But the controls, oh! the controls. There needs to be a lot of double-binding. i.e.- bind opening and closing the cylinder or attaching/removing the magazine should be the same button. It's not helped by trying to decipher what key does what in the help menu when it is layered on top of itself.If you fixed these things, maybe i would try it out again.Verdict: decide on a artistic style, simplify the controls, optimize optimize optimize, add some features, lower the difficulty, and reconsider some of the existing features.Suggestions: Make a story either ofA) an 80's cop fighting crime on the streets ( all of the guns in the game already existed in the time period,) where it stressed the difficulty of actually following procedure and how deadly the fighting was.orB) a brightly colored ultra-difficult stealth game where one must find and collect the walkman tapes or whatever. Might be sci-fi or 80's themed.I don’t know what's best for the game. But here are some pointers in the right direction.BTW, I realize that this was made in a 7 day thing or whatever. I just don’t think it's complete enough for it to be called a game. A hugely expansive, elaborative, and intracite demo/proof of concept, not a game. There just aren't enough mechanics for it to be called a game. Simulator? Loose use of the word, my friend."

But a good idea doesn't mean a good game. when I first launched it, all I said was: HOW DO I WHAT? of course you shoot with the left click, but to do as easy things as reloading your gun you MUST learn a 6-7 button combination, witch makes you dead if you have to reload with any enemy around. As for the enemyes there is a turret and a drone. Its easy to deal with the turrets, but if you see a drone... consider yourself dead. There are many guns, but some of them are hardly functional. There are NO skins whatsoever, except for a few dark colors on the enemies. The fact that its a rooftop at night doesn't mean you don't need other colors than grey. After an hour I ended up just turning my flashligt on and off constantly at a wall, just so I can see something else than that one shade of grey. That is IF you have a flashlight. What I  mean is that levels are random each time, and so is your inventory. That goes so far that you can spawn without ANY AMMO, with or without a flashlight, and a game can go on for hours or just five minutes depending on lootdrop, and if you find it or not. Collectables shine and are easy to find most of the times.In conclusion I't simular to the virtual boy, it can cause headache (if you're sanity is easily disturbed hallucination)due to a lack of colors. the game is really instable both with the random generation, and with crashes.

I'm fairly certain most of you giving this a thumbs down have already bought the game /before/ I put this review here.Receiver is an interesting firearms simulator video game but it falls short of it's goals with poor execution. I suppose you get what you pay for. Don't always expect just $5 to get you a good video game.GAMEPLAY: You spawn in a random location with a random pistol with a random amount of ammo. The goal is to find six randomly-placed casette tapes in a randomly-generated map with randomly-placed robot enemies (taser-bots & stationary machine gun turrets). There's ammo randomly placed around the map. You must manipulate every part of your gun with your keyboard. There's no lean feature, so you must expose your entire body in order to get a few shots off at a robot. Considering that you die no matter where you are shot, this becomes extremely problematic. The randomly-generated maps don't fit the gameplay well; you can easily get stuck in odd places thanks to the bizzare level design. Stairs are nightmarish.PRESENTATION: The game is full of plain, blank textures which have no depth whatsoever. Low-detail textures can look good sometimes (see: Unturned) but this game is trying to create a realistic apartment complex. Without the textures, though, every surface looks like plastic. The skybox is low detail and ugly as sin. The sound effects and music are good, but unfortunately, do little to correct the visual sins.STORY: Hardly any story at all. The little story you can get is from the randomly-placed casette tapes. It's just a guy reading from a script in the most boring and monotonous voice thought possible. It sounds like he just got up at 6:30 AM and didn't have his coffee yet.THE VERDICT: You should really shell out some extra money in order to get you a better video game. This game doesn't teach you much about actually fighting since there's no human enemies. You can learn how to work a pistol, but if you're the kind of guy who finds this game interesting, you should already know how to use a gun."

Sure, it's cool when you do something right, like grab the magazine with bullets in it, push the hammer forward, put the cylinder back inside the revolver... I think you might see the problem. I ecentually got to the point where I could reload my gun without looking at the help menu but even with the satisfaction that comes with that, the gun mechanics are, in my mind, simply not very good. There are enemy turrets in the game. They are one of the obastacles that you have to deal with, and you deal with them by either shooting a camera attached to them, effectively blinding them or, shooting their battery pack, a brown box at its base, which will completely diable them. Shooting them in the camera is generaly a bad idea, since you must stand directly in front of them in order to do so. However, shooting them in the battery pack is incredibly inconsistent. I put an entire magazine into it to no effect. I eventually killed it, only to discover that almost all of my bullets, including the one that killed it, had landed in the exact same place. Also one bullet kills you and you respawn at the beginning of a completely new randomized map. I actually found turrets to be far easier than tazer drones. Tazer drones have weak spots but they incredibly difficult to hit due to their speed. They do have weaknesses, such as their slow turning or their inability to see you if you just duck behind a corner, and if you keep your distance, than they aren't normally that hard to kill. But when they are charging at you in a hallway, you pretty much just fire as much as you can and pray that you hit something vital.In addition to the random map, it seems that your ammo count is also random. I respawned several times to discover that I had no ammo at all. Once I respawned with a tazer drone facing me.Maybe this appeals to some people but It absolutely does not appeal to me. Even after I tried to learn how to play and was encouraged to try again by other Steam users, I still found no enjoyment in this title.This game is for: Gun nuts, those who enjoy extreme challenge with little payoffThis game is not for: Players looking for a story, fans of standard FPS', casual gamers"

The game while fun, has some major performance issues. I will often be on an important part of the game when suddenly I start to get major lag. This should not be happening on a game like this, as the graphics are not even that good. This takes away from much of the game's fun. When the game is not lagging (something which is a rare commodity) it is extremely fun to play. When you encounter a flying mind tech you feel this true sense of fear for your life as you either fight or run. Shooting and reloading the gun is rather interesting because every single part of the gun is controllable. While this adds uniqueness to the game it slows the pace down considerably and has nothing to help speed it up.The verdict: An exciting and adrenaline pumping experiment that is hindered majorly by its massive performance issues. While the game is fun to play it badly needs to be optimized.

That's amazing and all, and it's priced right, but I still hate it.This game was fun--at first. The only things going for Receiver are the 3 guns you can play around with, and the mechanics that require multiple key commands to execute a reload. After that, the game falls flat on its face.The story revolves around you spawning randomly in a dystopian apartment building with a gun in your hands. You have either a Colt 1911, a Glock 17, or a Smith and Wesson Model 10, as well as a random number of bullets. You have two enemy types, a stationary rotating machine gut turret and a flying drone electrocutor, neither of which are very difficult to kill or outwit. They're super-boring and get tiresome very quickly once you figure out the weak points on each one.Your objective is to search, collect, and listen to 11 tapes that are littered about the complex without dying, either from falling, getting shot or electrocuted, or, as I discovered minutes before writing this review, shooting yourself in the foot. That, for me, was the final straw in playing this game over and over and over just to try and beat it.The game is extremely challenging, and not in a good way. There is no map or GPS or way of finding out just where you are, leading to LOTS of backtracking. There is no health system; one shot or lethal fall, and you're dead. There are no checkpoints, so you start all over when the game freezes up or you get killed. That alone is reason enough not to buy Receiver; to have to start all the way back at zero after making so much progress.Receiver does one thing and does it really well--it gives the player more control over their weapons, more so than in most other FPSs out there. Is that enough of a reason to pay $4.99 for it? Yes; as long as you don't expect anything more than that from the game, you'll be A-Okay."

The goal is to complete the exploration mission while clearing rooms of bots. The bots are somewhat frustrating, especially those bots that fly and zap you with lethal tasers. Thankfully some of the bots aren't mobile...yet.It is mostly polished game that feels a tiny bit unfinished, but acceptable for $1 to $5. The coding could definitely use a little bit more optimization as it tends to lag, which makes the game excessively challenging to survive. The level design is slightly repetitive but has an interesting architechural design, although it appears to take place in an urban skycraper.

Receiver follows the formula of games such as Slender, were as you walk around a map hunting for objects, in this case cassette tapes. But thats were the similarities end. You are not a lonely wanderer being preyed upon by a menacing monster. You are armed and on the hunt. This game pays close attention to detail with the 3 handguns currently available(1911, Glock 18, and S&W Model 10.) The player controls every lever on the gun and must manually eject the magazine, load it, replace it, and then place a round in the chamber. Or in the case of the revolver, eject the cylinder, eject the spent rounds, replace them, and close the cylinder. At first this is complicated because there is a plethra of buttons to use but after a while it turns into the simple combination of E,~,Z,~,and then T/R and in a short time you won't even have to use the guide. This along with a one hit death makes for difficult experience. My main issue with the game is the lack of options. As stated before there are only 3 handguns in 3 different calibres, One map, and 2 enemies(a flying drone with a taser and a sentry turret.) Mainly this is because it was the product of the 7-Day FPS challenge and was created in only 7 days. But i hope that with the source code open that eventually this game will gain a little bit of popularity and with that, mods. All in all, the game retails at $5.00 so you're not risking much."

You have an immobile and a highly manouverable type of enemy. Especially latter ones are powerful in numbers, but even immobile foes can kill you. Your reaction-time is short and you need to make the most of a second in many cases. Sure, immobile targets are easy to hit, but if you cannot see them and need to guess where they are by the noise of their machinery, you might end up getting shot.Unlike almost every fps, you have no health-bar and one hit or even a jump from too high obstacles are certain doom.Your arsenal is restricted to the one weapon you start with and a random amount of ammo and magazines (unless of course you start with the revolver).Your aiming and timing are the most important things. Here comes why:You truly need to manage your weapon. In order to load, you need to take out the magazine and reload it manually. In case you have multiple magazines (which is not guaranteed), you can prepare spare-magazines. Still, in a heaty situation like being chased by a flying drone it's still a challenge to just switch magazines.The realistic mechanic of handling a hand-gun is Receiver's crowning-achievement and the stuff that makes this game totally unique and more challenging than the hardest PVP-multiplayer-shooters.For 5 bucks, you get an always new layout of the map, different spawn-spots for drones and ammo, the tapes and flashlights."

For a Free(ish) game made in seven days, it is an incredible game! I wanted and expected only to download Overgrowth**, but I also got this unexpected game as well. This unexpected game gave me the best experience I would have ever thought. The game is just a fantastic game and I reccomend it to anyone who likes shooter games and indie games, because this is one of the best.Graphics: 6/10The graphics of this game remind me of the Unity3D Engine. The rating is because, well, the Graphics are based on how good the game looks and although this game does not look incredibly bad, it does look somewhat realistic. When you ""slide"" the gun's ejector, it actually slides back. Great animations as well; the flying shockers (Spinning and twisting) and the turrets (Spinning and finding a target).Controls: 5/10This game just has WAY too many controls. WAAYYY too many. It is really easy to get confused and this can get irritating. The sprinting (tapping W repeatedly) is really irritating as  well, as it aches afterwards and I feel that that could be changed.Mechanics: 10/10The mechanics are great. As I said before, it is an interactive shooter game. You can do pretty much anything. That is all I have to say. You can slide the gun's slide, eject the clip, holster the gun, put the clip back on, aim, fire without aiming, fall through some floors.... okay, maybe a couple bugs, but barely noticeable and non-gamebreaking so far as I can tell.This is all I really have to say about this game, because although it is not a big game with a lot of content, it surely is a game worth playing when you are bored.

There is no option, on Linux, to change the resolution or graphic settings. Instead, you are given a small window to play in, which combined with the frequent framerate problems resulted in a less than enjoyable experience for me.

MaybeReceiver is an experimental, FPS roguelike, with the goal of collecting all the tapes in the level while managing weapons that handle some-what realistically. Instead of Pressing R to reload, you have a myriad of buttons to eject magazines, empty the chamber, refill bullets, turn on/off safety. It's all reminscent of games like QWOP and Ampu-Tea where it is difficult to play, though the game is not necessarily trying to torture you, even though the game is awfully difficult. I do hate these controls though - I don't have a big problem with the revolver, but I never found out how to insert bullets into a clip of a pistol despite pressing nearly every key on my keyboard, so I would always run out of ammo unless I found a clip, even if I had bullets on my person. Whenever you die or reset the game, the level is regenerated, placing the rooms in a different order and connection, so the rooms are still familiar, but will be encountered differently.I can definitely see a rewarding factor here, as death comes from one hit and it feels good to aim down the sights and put down a bot that could easily kill you - It's reminescent of the first time using ADS in the early Call of Duty games that became the standard for most shooters. As much as I respect this game, I absolutely do not like playing it. I like my games to be ""gamey"" and I want to enjoy the gameplay of managing the gun like a real gun, but I'm sick of fumbling around with the controls trying unsuccesfully to reload a Glock or 1911, failing to flee with the ""repeatedly tap W to run"" mechanic, and wasting ammo because a turret wouldn't die after shooting five bullets into it. I do respect that shooting a bot in its different parts will have different effects (hitting the camera remove it's vision, shooting it's ammo box removes its ammo, Shooting the battery disables it). But I know I won't be entertained by fumbling with the controls, dealing with the extreme difficulty to just listen to some tapes that will probably end up all sounding overly pretentious.That said, there community that loves this game, kind of like those who love the Dark Souls series. I don't mind the difficulty and like the fact that death is one hit, requring you to be extra careful. I can do without the paltry fall damage. I don't have any interest in wrestling controls and trying to remember 8 different buttons just to manage a gun. I'm interested in seeing some shooters try having to handle your gun much like Reciever, but without awkwardness of needing to use so many buttons and gun parts and invetory floating around your face. Watch videos of other players and see if you think you can handle what is offered - be ready to accidentally lose bullets and magazines because you're chambering and pressing the wrong button to insert a magazine or bullet. The game seems worth it's price and if you can get all the tapes, then you will have seen nearly all this game has to offer."

Since a recent update you also may spawn with either an M1911, a revolver of some kind (a bit fiddly to reload, but quite simple otherwise), and a Glock 17 (with a full-auto mod, kind of pointless as ammo is so scarce).There's a couple playthroughs on YouTube, check 'em out!anyway GET IT IT'S SURPRISINGLY ACE"

That deserves more praise for its work.What's so great about this ""Call of Duty ripoff""?For an FPS, the game doesn't focus on shooting. Not at all.It focuses on taking your time. And focuses on being as technical as possible with its reloading system.Lets make an example right here.To reload a revolver.Button 1 to show cylinderButton 2, 2-3 times to empty the cylinderButton 3 about 6 times to put in each individual bullet.Button 4 to close cylinder.With a pistol.Button 1 to take out clip.Button 2 to put away gun.Spam button 3 to put in each individual bullet into clip.Button 2 to take out gun again.Button 4 to put in clip.Button 5 to♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun, and put the bullet in place, ready to fire. (If needed.)Put that in a situation where you are in need of reloading, and conserving ammo. Then you have Reciever.This is a good thing, for it introduces a new type of strategy to your combat, and how you play the game. Unlike Run-And-Gun Simulator.The story is very..Interesting. I am not going to spoil it for you. But its not something to write home about, in my eyes. But its something that is newBut okay, every game has cons to it. What are some in this game?1.)  1-Hit-Kills. I can sort of forgive this aspect. Since the game does explain that you are horribly weak and ill. And you woke up on the top of a building, which layout you cannot recognise.2.) No more than 2 enemies. I don't care if you spam enemy 1 in one place. With some enemy 2 sprinkled on. We have 2 enemies. And that is lazy.3.) I wouldn't say this is a problem with the game. But I'm going to compare SC: Chaos Theory with this subject. Here we go.The lag. The horrible framerate. Its hard to control your guns and your escape with it. It ticks me off to be trying to run away from a flying tazer, and have a horrible FPS while doing so. Now, lets compare it with Chaos Theory. SC:CT looks very AAA Title for an Xbox to PC port. And with these quite stunning graphics, the game runs like butter on a hot pan. Reciever just feels clunky with this.

You don't like magically full magazines? neither does this game. It takes gun functionality and makes it one of the most intuitive challenges you'll face. While the enemy may be limited to mere turrets and drones, the main antagonist in this game is yourself; your muscle memory for gun-handling. Taking out a few turrets is easy, but how easy is it to remember if you fired five shots or six in the heat of the moment?Key aspects I commend are the damage states and hitboxes for enemies. Bullets may ricochet, merely glazing the target, unaffecting it. Others will damage a target, but not disable it. The feel of my blood running cold as I hear a turret lock onto me from behind, only to realize it was one I left disabled, but still haunting me. Will you spend an extra bullet for some peace, or tread on eggshells, jumping at every beep and bump in the night?You cannot risk dying. Unlike most other shooters where they toss every possible means to keep you alive (second winds, medkits, revival, unrealistic health), one mistake - one bullet - and you're done. A game emulating gun mechanics would be less of a thrill if your faulty actions did not lead to the distinct taste of failure. In a real-world situation, you have NO room for mistakes, and Receiver makes sure you understand that.I recommend this to anyone actually looking to own a gun outside of your lovely virtual collection of military surplus. Receiver teaches the minor nuances of gun handling innately through gameplay; a nice way to grasp some gun basics before dealing with a live firearm. Of course, I MUST say it is no substitute for lessons of any sort, merely a glimpse at the responsibility behind gun ownership. Though the game still persists on a ""if it moves, shoot it,"" basis, with so many factors to account for, you really think twice before pulling the trigger.The interface is straightforward and tells you everything you need to know in one place, mid-game. The help menu simply bold fonts actions necessary to ""proceed"" in-game, while keeping itself minimal to teach the willing. No flashing ""Out of Ammo"" mid-screen alerts. I found myself checking that the gun chamber wasn't obstructed during the less hectic parts more and more after an agonizing defeat brought about by my gun jamming.The game is well worth the price, and assuming the plethora of cookie-cut shooters out there have already satisfied your need for instant-action, colorful explosions, and lush visuals, Receiver is a great game for someone who has a little patience and wants to play a more serious game."

And it's one of the better cheapo games I've seen that randomly drop the cost to a dollar.  The price of every crappy app on a cell phone that does nothing but pester you to buy the ""full"" version while smothering you with ads.Due to the time constraint it's a very minimalist game, but they concentrated on what matters:  the guns, and the enemies.  If you look at it in the same light graphics wise as the VR missions in the Metal Gear games, you realize that the tactics and enemy positions are what matters, not the textures and set pieces of the world design.  The guns themselves do a great job at standing out and after a day or so of playing you get to where you learn all the actions to effectively use your weapons.  There's no HUD telling you how much ammo is left, and the only way to see how many rounds have been fired from the revolver (the trickiest gun to use) is by opening the cylinder and looking at which primers are dented, just like real life.As for stuff I dislike, the voice on the tapes (no spoilers here, I promise) is just about the last person I would have picked.  I hope someone makes a mod that either changes the voice actor to read it more dramatically, or to someone doing a funny voice instead.  Anything would be better than the guy they used.The other thing that screws up just once in awhile is the jumping / collision on or around stairs, but once you realize how the game is procedurally generated I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.  It's really few and far between.If you've never fired a real weapon before the game adds insight of what it takes to handle one.  This is not a run-n-gun spray-n-pray CoD fest.  Press R and you eject a round.  Press E and you pull out the magazine.  Accidentally press E again and you drop your magazine, just like flustered people under duress in real life.  This game is fearfully survivor based, and if you happen to run out of ammo with the only way forward guarded by multiple enemies you'll find yourself cursing this worthless piece of empty steel in your hand, just like you would in real life.This game is about creeping, tactics, cover, and ammo conservation, akin to the first Resident Evil game.  If you're looking for Resident Evil 6 then save your dollar for the next Farmville or Flappy Bird clone.If you hate this game so much then I challenge you to make a better one in seven days.

It means you shoot the first person you see.This game is not a First-Person ShooterLike a box of Chocolates  in this game you are basicly given a random weapon with some ammo, Ammo spawns are random, Kill Drones appear at either the Worst or Best time, The ""Tapes"" you must collect to an achieve an ""Awake"" state are either in small clusters where you will find multiple at once or scattered throughout the randomly generated map.The difficulty of this game can be judged by how hard it is to collect the tapes and how many shots it takes to die. Being killed is as easy as getting hit, A bullet will hit you and you will die within a second or two, Or You will be tazed by flying drones who charge at you faster than you can see. On the other hand the Kill Drones die depending on where you hit them and generally your luck.The game feels exactly like how the tapes explain, Doing things over and over again gets you used to them. The map seems to be cut up into chunks, These chunks are usually Pre-Rendered and if you pay enough attention you can adapt to them rather quickly.There are only three guns, I believe the Glock 18, Desert Eagle and some sort of Revolver. Damage wise these guns seem all the same, Reloading and other mechanics vary, the Glock has a large mag filled with small Bullets and can be fired Fully Automatic, The Desert Eagle is pretty much fired like a standard pistol with a Safe mode and medium sized mag with larger bullets, The Revolver works as the name says, Medium sized bullets are loaded into a revolving Chamber and can be loaded in when ever needed without replacing the mag.This game contains a varity of Features but still due to its small size it can only be considered a side dish for when you either have nothing else to do, Don't want to spend a large amount of your time or have very little time in general.I can easily give it an 8/10. It has a Uniqe type of gameplay, An interesting Enviorment (<-- Please correct that) and a little bit of an interesting Story. But lacks guns and is generally a luck based game in the beginning."

I think this game is really great on its own but there are a few problems. For one the game has poor optimization for pc, which makes sense considering it was made in a day and expanded upon. Second there is quite a lag spike when entering rooms, which could end up killing you a lot. Lastly, the controls are quite hard to get used to, but when they do, the gun becomes second nature.

The mechanics are novel and satisfying, the atmosphere is sufficiently creepy, and the enemies are a very enjoyable fight, and I find myself at the edge of my seat throughout every run. I eagerly recommend the game to anyone seeking an addictive challenge with near infinite replayability.In GeneralThe game starts, thrusting you right in to the thick of things, with nothing but a gun and sometimes a maglite. No tutorial, no nothing. Your goal is to find and listen to 11 cassette tapes without getting shot or tased by the hovering drones or sweeping turrets. Oh, did I mention you die in one shot? Yeah, that brings a whole other level of tension and urgency to every fight. There is no HUD, so you have to either count your shots or check your magazine constantly. Running out of ammo in the middle of trying to shoot down a drone that is divebombing you, tazer buzzing, will certainly spell your doom.ProsRefreshingly complex gun mechanicsAtmosphere fittingly eerie as♥♥♥♥♥♥Great little game to waste some time or have a lot of funSatisfying to disable your enemiesEasy to learn, hard to masterConsBare-bones graphicsOnly two enemy types and three gunsYou sometimes will spawn with little to no ammo or enemies right there to kill you before you can reactOften far too dark to navigate, even with the flashlightThoughtsI really like this game. The tapes fittingly play in any order and the guns are very satisfying. In my 4 hours of play, I have not yet beaten the game, and that speaks volumes to the challenge this game holds. The turrets are spooky and can startle you if you aren't ready for them, but easy to take out. The drones are probably the hardest enemy in the game. Very frequently, you'll hear one, step through the doorway and shoot it down, only to have another one that you didn't know about zap you from behind without warning. Luckily they aren't seen terribly often without large spaces to deal with them. The game feels very mazelike, lending to the general sense of unease and being lost and alone. For 7 days of work to create the base game, it is amazing. I only leave it wishing that you could actuallyseewith regularity, as many rooms are so dark that even the flashlight does nothing to help you. Even if this game never sees another major update, I am quite happy to play it as it is now."

,Recommended,234190,20568269,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,Red Triangle #53,"Great mechanics. The game throws you into a survival situation with a gun of random type in an unknown state and asks you to deal with it using detailed gun operation mechanics. It's difficult to remember all the buttons, as there is one for releasing the magazine, one for loading, one for cocking the hammer, one for toggling the safety, one for inserting magazine, one button for each storage space in the inventory, and one button which consistently drops the magazine you just released to the ground, forcing you to pick it up again using a different button(and with a released magazine the layout changes). Combining these into fluid gun operation is hard, and that's the point. This is not a point-and-click fps like call of duty which supplies you with a handy ""make gun ready for firing""-button and a big nice crosshair floating in the middle of the screen. Everything you do is exactly as it would be in real life using a real handgun. You even need to put your gun away when you load rounds into a magazine.I do have some problems with the game though. First, it's a bit repetitive and bland. You face two different enemies through the game, and both are instant death unless you're lucky. It's realistic and makes for a good demonstration of the mechanics(and the message behind it), but it doesn't work very well as a game. Secondly, the main objective of the game, which is finding 11 cassette tapes providing you with the backstory for the setting, is impossible. Most of my attempts I die after having found exactly 0 tapes. You can search through miles of this building and never find a tape. The most I've found was 3 I think. It's not worth the attempt to go for all 11, so with the main objective being moot, the mechanics is all there really is to the game.Thirdly, the end goal of any game should simply not be to reveal the exposition. According to what you learn underway, you are a survivor of some extradimensional genocide of the human race, conditioned to fight back against them. However, as far as I can tell(as I haven't found all the tapes before), you fighting back doesn't really have much of a purpose. You don't save the human race, as they are all gone, you don't deliver a blow to them that serves as phyrric victory, you don't even get to kill a single one of them. You are just a special agent trained to survive the initial massacre so you could starve to death a bit later. So the storytelling doesn't work very well and mostly serves to confuse.Now, I do realize that my criticism is a bit irrelevant considering the purpose and format of the game(and the fair price). The reason for my criticism is simply because I really, REALLY want to see this concept developed further.If this game was a filled-in roguelike akin to the binding of isaac, with permanent and temporary upgrades, special items, more enemies, more varied areas and with a more direct purpose, this could be an amazing game. I believe this would be entirely possible without breaking with the principles behind the game. For example, you start with the 1911 and some bullets, then while you learn the game mechanics you earn a temporary upgrade, let's say a fluorescent front sight or a magazine of hollow point bullets(giving a high chance of disabling an enemy without a critical hit maybe?). Then you find a tape and unlock a permanent upgrade, the ability to sense whether an enemy is within a certain distance(that's sort of the stuff I would imagine considering the whole ""mentally conditioned to deal with the invaders from another dimension"" thing. It could be as simple as unlocking the ability to hear them better, which is one of the things that bothered me. *silence* BEEP BANG *death*). Next run you use your new ability to gain 10 enemy kills without dying and it rewards you with a new gun which you can start with or find during a run. Then maybe as you gain achievements or find things, you unlock new items you can find(and therefore the chances of finding anything), or maybe the chances of starting a run with rarer items, or unlocking a bulletproof vest which has a 80% chance of absorbing a hit and a 40% chance of being broken each time it does. It should lead somewhere and feel like you are improving and progressing.There are a lot of things you can do with this concept, and the rogue-like format is what it's already going for, so that's just an example. I want it to have value as a game, because as a simple gun simulator the whole procedurally generated stuff and backstory is pretty wasted on it. Another potential use for the mechanics is as a proper gun-range simulator, which could be a great way to learn about gun operation and safety(I imagine with instructors who throw you out if you don't use proper safety precautions). In that case there would have to be a lot of different weapons and more realistic aiming(with the steadying and holding your breath and that whole thing).Tl;dr: The mechanics are excellent, but the game they are used for isn't. I want to see a good game using the same amazing mechanics, and so do you.Oh, and let me hold shift to run."

There all pistols, but have different reloading features also, like the M1911 has a safety you have to turn off when you start, yet none of the other pistols have a safety. Now before you go off and buy this bad boy, I have to mention that it does come free if you by overgrowth. Which is also a very unique game. So why not get a 2 in1 deal?! There is so much room for improvment, and I would love to see where this game can go. So who ever made the game, please do add-on to it! All in all, id give this game a 7/10."

The story, or what I've discovered of it so far, is mildly interesting, but it's certainly not the main attraction. The graphics are okay from what I remember, but I can't play on the highest settings without major lag. This is on a computer that runs Skyrim at Ultra with graphics mods at 1920x1080. The gameplay is really something else, though. You start out with a random gun, a random amount of ammo (and/or clips), in a random part of a randomly-generated map. Your goal is to collect all 11 tapes and listen to them, which are, not surprisingly, placed in random locations. Also randomly placed is extra ammo, which you'll need to destroy the turrets and Manhack-type things that are, GASP, randomly placed. The reloading mechanics, while nonsensical at first, begin to make sense the more you play and are actually really quite logical. At the price it's at, I urge you to check this out if you are a fan of shooting and roguelike-esque gameplay, right down to the difficulty."

Your goal is to collected 11 cassette tapes from around the randomly generated complex you find yourself in. One bullet or taser shock from your robot adversaries (two kinds) will kill you instantly. There are no save points either. Given that death is a little too easy to achieve and dying means you start again from the very beginning and there are 11 tapes to achieve to finish the game, how is this fun? Well, that lies in what makes it an FPS.The game's main mechanic revolves around its manipulation of your gun in a realistic way. One button opens the chamber of a revolver, another loads it, another dumps the casings/bullets onto the floor, another button closes it. You also have other weapons, such as a glock, or a semi-automatic pistol. Which one you have differs by playthrough. You could also start with additional bullets, magazines, or a flashlight. Surprisingly, what sounds tedious actually adds a layer of atmosphere and depth to the game. Every bullet counts as well as how you reload and wield your weapon. Things can go wrong that you have to fix. Just by how you use your gun and the uncertainty of how things could go gives great immersion.Aiming your weapon to properly neutralize your foes takes a good amount of trial and error (and the ♥♥♥♥ing flying taser bots MOVE CONSTANTLY), so you will die a lot. But eventually you'll get it. That said, I never found more than two tapes per run and even then I feel like I've seen what the game itself has to offer me. But, it's also $5 which is why I can recommend it, despite some frustrating experiences I had. Overall it's a unique experience that is worth trying once."

Here you have to manually reload a limited supply of rounds into clips and chamber rounds before they can be fired. As someone who's actually fired real world weapons, it's nice to see the real world mechanics of actually handing rounds and guns replicated faithfully in a videogame. There's no one button, instant reload here; and the game's all the better for it. The premise of the game is also interesting, too, and the procedurally generated levels allied to one-hit vulnerabilty and permadeath add lots of replayability - but  if there's one major flaw, the AI is *way* too twitchy.As an experiment in replicating real world gun mechanics in a virtual world, Receiver is an unqualified success - by playing it you'll gain a much greater understanding and respect for how handguns actually work - but as a game, slightly less agressive AI would greatly enhance the experience for those of us who don't have the reflexes of house flies on amphetamines."

It's like an elaborate gun simulator.You have bullets. you put the bullets in the magazine (one by one) and jam the magazine into the gun. Drones! Shoot it! Click, click, click! You just died because you forgot to put a bullet into the chamber by pulling back the slider thing on the gun.There's no interface showing you number of bullets and such. You'll have to pull out the magazine and look at it to see how many bullets you have left. You can also pull back the slide a little to see if you have a bullet in the chamber.The gameplay is simple, but pretty fun if you like realism. Take one bullet and you're dead. Run around and you'll be dead pretty soon.The purpose of the game is to find 11 cassette tapes hidden around. It's a rather difficult goal, and I wish there were some alternative game modes (like getting from A to B or clearing buildings/blocks).

This game was made for the 7-Day FPS challenge in which, as the name implies, is a callenge to game makers to create a First Person Shooter (FPS) in 7 days. And you know, its actually pretty good! So why am i giving this a low score? The game is just annoying to play to be honest. I know what you're thinking, ""Hey Vandal, if you say this game is pretty good then why did you just say its annoying? You just completely contradidcted to what you just said!"", well allow me to explain reader. What i meant by that was that its a good PROTOTYPE. This is what the game feels like, plays like, and looks like. This game honestly should be a Free to Play tech demo. Not a game worth $5! The game is also procedurly generated. Which means that, the level will be randomized with each playthrough. Now on other games that sounds good (i.e. Being Minecraft, Starbound, Binding of Isaac) but on this game it just fails to impress. Sometimes I spawn with a flashlight, the gun, about 4 fully stocked mags, and with the cassete tape in one room (You have to collect these things for god knows why). And sometimes i spawn with absolutly nothing! The other thing that makes this game bad is its TERRIBLE narrorator. In video games narrorators are supposed to retell past events, present events (Trine series), or just quirky narration (The Stanly Parable). The narrator in this game sounds like he was forced to do this. As in he sounds he hasnt gotten any sleep in months and is bored out of their mind on the brink of insanity.Pros:-Looping music is catchy-Guns are replicated good-Guns sounds are almost realCons:-Game suffers from confusing gameplay-Virtually no story if any-Horrible narrator-Not worth the $5-EXTREMELY CONFUSING controls-Bland textures-Crap hit detectionThe Final Verdict: 4/10I am being greatly generous with that rating. The game is not the worst game on pc (in my opinion at least) but it's definitely up there. I cant say anything else worth mentioning other than the fact that i can go on and on ranting about how the game shouldve been free instead of it costing money. I refuse to recommend this game to players unless you're a gun nut. If thats the case disregard this review and go buy - HANG ON NO DONT BUY IT! If you are a gun enthusiast, the look up ""World Of Guns: Gun Dissasembly"". At least there you can go crazy on numerous guns. The game would be better if it was still being in development by the dev team. In conclusion the game is not good. I know I dont have the right to say that since i only played it for about 6 mins. the uninstalled it. But in my opinion, unless the team makes a better version of the game, this game will forever be the worst game i have ever played.Even ""Dead Bits"" was a better game than this.-Evan"

There are 11 tapes to collect to 'win' but these are scattered around the randomized world and surviving the robots long enough to collect them is not easy. Each death starts you over in a new world with different starting conditions and each of the pistols play differently and require you to adjust your strategy from try to try. It all comes together as you push forward with little or no ammo, dodging behind whatever cover you can find to avoid robots while scrounging for supplies and making sure every shot counts."

For every gun you use you have to do everything manually from popping a bullet into the chamber to changing out mags. Another unique factor is how the enemies you encounter react towards you. The two enemies you will face are stationed turrets that will gun you down on sight and flying taser bots that charge towards you and tase you.Pros.-Really interesting gun mechanics-Three different guns to mess around with-Everything is randomly generated-Has a decent soundtrackCons.-Managing your gun at first is challenging but with the assistants of the in game help you will eventually get better at it-It's pretty short.

I did some more searching, briefly watch a video that Nerd³ made about it, and thought it looked interesting. So despite my rib-crushingly small budget this week, I bought this game. After all, it's only $5.I launched the game, having aslightidea as to what I was doing, meaning I knew there were guns, they were complicated, there were enemies I had to kill, and there were tapes (which tried to get me to question my existence) to be collected. And I found out very quickly that I wasn't far off.When you start, you're given one of three handguns: A Colt M1911A1, a Glock 17, or a Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver. In your average FPS, all of these would be no-brainers; you would simply point, shoot, and keep half an eye on an ammo counter on the bottom right of your screen. In Receiver, on the other hand, all of these weapons work differently. In addition, there is no ammo counter. ""Well,♥♥♥♥♥♥"" I said to myself. I brought up the help menu (which is paired with a helpful, behind-the-scenes AI that will help you get your gun in to working order!) and figured out the controls for my gun. I got my weapon ready to fire, and set out searching for tapes. Shortly thereafter, I died. ""Alrighty then,"" I mumbled to myself as the game reset. Luckily, I got the same gun next round, this time it was one step away from being ready. Same thing again. Set up gun, go find tapes, die. This will happen alot. The game randomizes the state your weapon is in when youreceiveit.After playing for a few hours, I went to sleep, and the next day I came back to it. Having become familiar with the controls the previous night, the second playthrough was a breeze. The first time I reloaded my gun from muscle memory made me feel awesome. I still died a lot, though. But at least I can load my gun faster.Receiver is a good game. Well worth the $5."

The game is pretty simple in mechanics though: It's an FPS in which turrets and flying drones are your enemies and your goal is collect tapes.Think slenderman...with robots and guns...and tapes.The kicker is the controls: Everything gun related is set up with multiple commands. What do I mean? Let's use reloading (which really is where this shines) as an example. In pretty much all FPS games, you have to simply press R on your keyboard and this is way too simple for this game.For the revolver, you have to:-Press E to open the cylinder-Press V to empty casings-Press Z repeatedly to insert bullets one at a time-Press R to close the cylinderAnd this is just for this gun because there are two other guns that have some variation to how you reloadThis is really the highlight of the game. It really makes for some tense moments. Moments like learning you've used up your clip with 2 flying drones flying at you.When I think about it though, I'm split on the price. The games can spark some genuinly tense moments and is fun to play but there isn't much to it. There are only 2 enemy types, 3 guns, a flashlight, an enviroment you'll get really use to after a few plays, and slender-esque tape collection.

You're only objective is to find all 11 tapes. Tapes and amunition are randomly spawned in vague locations so you'll spend a lot of time looking for a stray bullet or two. This game can be mindnumbingly repetitive at times, I won't lie, but soon enough you'll get yourself in a situation that'll get your heart racing faster than many, many other games. F****** tazers are the absolute worst.The only enemies in the game are the turret, the drone, and hitting the ground too hard. Both of the NPC enemies have localized damage ( example: shooting the stand on the turret won't accomplish jack, but shooting it on the sensor will render it blind).The Turret is a mounted gun that is constantly on rotation until it spots you. Once it does, you either have to kill it fast or dash to cover and hope it doesn't clip you, because if it does, you're down for the count.The Drone is a small flying machine with a sensor and a tazer attached.

The game built around finding tiny objects that could easily be looked over by the untrained eye in these maze-like, nonsensical building structures.The gunplay that involves actually SHOOTING your gun is awful.

This game is absolutely amazing considering it was built in just 7 days. There are AAA games that cost millions of dollars and years of development that aren’t as fun, intriguing, detailed, and solid as Receiver.  Receiver’s not a perfect game and it’s definitely lacking in the content department (meaning it could really use more things to do, weapons to use, and greater enemy variety).  The “plot” if you can call it that is incomprehensible; as you make your way through the randomly generated levels you find (amongst more ammo usually) tape cassettes which contain the “story” of what’s going on.  There is an order to these tapes but I’ve never gotten more than 4 (there are 11 total) during a single run and although there is a proper order in which listening to them forms a coherent story (I think anyways) but in my experience they are always out of order therefore making the “story/plot” meaningless.  The real draw for this game is the HIGHLY detailed weapons.  The guns are the most accurate representations of guns I’ve ever experienced in a videogame (that was the point of the game; to create hyper realistic weapon/gun action).  Each bullet must be loaded into the gun (whether in a magazine or in the drum of a revolver) safeties disengaged, slides cocked, etc.  The in game representation of the M1911A1 Colt .45 pistol is exceptionally accurate because I actually own one IRL and it’s amazing how well represented it is in the game.  The sound design too is excellent.  The music swells and is intense when enemies are present, and sufficiently “sci-fi” and groovy while exploring.  The sounds of the weapons firing is quite satisfying, each shot feels “real” and each different type of ammo (9mm, .45 ACP, or .38 special) sounds/feels unique.  The level of detail in Receiver is exceptional and mind blowing, even more so when faced w/ the fact that it was made from scratch in 7 days.  These devs definitely have earned the price of the game, if you’re any kind of fan of firearms this game is worth checking out, you will very likely be impressed."

,Recommended,234190,6455229,"Posted: 31 August, 2013",all,Federation Scum,"The first-person shooter has become nearly as anicent as the platformer.  Once you figure out the basic formula behind it, it's all downhill from there because everything else is just so much salad dressing.  Or is it?Receiver brings to the table some crazy ideas to go with a bright, unique one: realistic gun mechanics.  You will soon understand just how complicated actual firearms really are and that aiming is no walk in the park either.  It takes patience and persistence despite only being the tip of the iceberg.  When you get down to it though, the realism of how reloading and aiming actually works is a fascinating spin on this tired genre of gaming.  I mean, what other game has made you feel so close to a measely pistol of all things?Seven days worth of game design and we are introduced to Receiver.  You're a man (or woman) with brittle bones that can't survive a ten-foot drop and such nerves that a taser will implode your frightened little heart.  Death is one mistake away and the world and its resources are never the same should you die.  You're on a quest to find eleven cassette tapes of valuable information pretaining to the setting of the game and your own circumstances.  All you have to defend yourself is one of two handguns or a revolver and you can bet you need to be frugal with your insurance policy.Despite the game's simplicity and lack of polish, Receiver is a game that most definitely deserves to be played.  There are few games that capture and embrace the qualities of curiousity and tension.One could say that it's absolutely impossible to be faithful of your own ability to survive when there is no room for error.  The consequences of missing a single shot can hurt you in ways you never thought possible.  You might even take a  wrong step in the middle of a wild dash from hot pursuers and go careening right off a third story overlook.  We're only human, after all.Yet, regardless of the peril, you can't avoid feeling compelled to explore.  Every bullet you find ups your chances of survival and every tape brings you one step closer to victory.  The gun mechanics themselves are an obstacle to be understood and overcome.  Emptying cartridges into a magazine to be loaded into a Colt M1911A1 pistol, then pulling the slide back to chamber the first round, is a deceptively simple and absorbing activity.  Then you pull off an amazing shot at one of a hostile killer bot's weakpoints and see it crash to the ground with a satisfying clash of short-circuitry and metallic clanking.All these elements come together for an incredibly immersive game.  It really does feel like you're left to your own wits to survive a situation that would otherwise be placed in the hands of a superpowered space marine or badass super spy.  It's far from perfect (obviously) but it shines as an example of what the gaming industry needs more of.  For five bucks, you owe it to yourself to play it.  Once you get past the learning curve, you'll see for yourself that glimpse of hope that novelty still lives on in the heart of gaming.  Even in first-person shooters."

,Not Recommended,234190,19566294,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,Dblad,"This... Isn't really a game.TL;DR at the bottomReceiver is a one mode 'game' in which you spawn randomly in a generated 3D world with no textures, with one of three guns, a random amount of ammo, and sometimes a flashlight. Your goal is like slender or other random generated indie games, which is to collect all the messages throughout the level which include voice overs that vaguely describe some plot to give the game some kind of flavor or depth, and in my opinion fails to do so. Collecting all of them means you win, or, at least that's what I'm told, the game didn't keep my attention enough to complete a run through.Part of the reason for that is this game is rediculously unforgiving. There are only two annoying enemies in this game. Flying buzzsaw robots from Half Life 2 and shooting turrets from Portal. They both kill you in one hit, but the same isn't true for you. Many times you aim and shoot at them and for some reason their 'weak point' hitbox doesn't register. It is overall very frustrating, especially if you can't find a flashlight and you happen to be surrounded by very dark rooms. I ended up just cranking up my gamma.One last deal breakingly bad thing in this game. When you enter a new generated area (which there are like 6 or so for the game to load to my knowledge), the game freezes for a split second. My computer more than exceeds the requirments this game suggests, but it happens every other time, and can mean a turret might shoot me when it otherwise would not, which, again, means a complete game over and starting the ENTIRE game from scratch.The redeeming factor of this game is the neat gun concept. You are given no tutorial, but instead a key map shows up on the right of the screen with the next step to getting the gun ready to fire highlighted. A different button is required to perform all of the functions of the pistol you spawn with, from safety, to releasing the slide, to loading an empty mag with fresh rounds. Speeding up this process by remembering the right combination of presses is pretty rewarding, and is also very accurate to real life and educational to those that don't really know how guns work. Slow claps.If this pistol simulator wants to keep marketing itself as a game it needs a MAJOR content update. New enemies, objectives, a difficulty other than butt clenchingly hard, and a story that isn't one guy breathing into a mic.TL;DR- Only 3 guns, 2 enemies, 1 game mode- Stutters at loading intervals, which can end up killing you- Has very dark areas but may or may not give you a flashlight nearby- Bland blank textures and one (maybe two?) drab songs constantly playing- Frustrating level of difficulty with no way to change it- Boring generated map- Sprinting requires spamming the W key. Seriously, when was this ever a good idea?+ Fantastic gun mechanics+ Shows promise if content keeps getting addedVerdict: Buy it on sale if you reeeeaaally want to try. But otherwise in it's current state it should be free and in beta."

Regrettably, I think I am now done with it.  This is a game with a steep learning curve and tremendous difficulty, the latter being something I am not particularly fond of in games.  But few games gave me such a strong feeling of accomplishment as when I learned to use the gun and take out enemies successfully.  There are some simple fixes that I think would benefit the game; slowing down the flying enemies which move at unforgiving speeds and having more warning about nearby enemies in general would allow me to have survived countless accidental deaths, which often seemed unfair rather than my own fault.  Protip, play with the options before you get into it, specifically turning on the option to lock the gun to the center of the screen.  All in all I highly recommend the game as a piece of interest, and I only wish that the game was still supported and seeing updates."

I say that because there have been plenty of times when I used to just run into a room and (lag or not) I wound up right in front of a turret with no cover to save me because of my own fault. or that I ran into an open area and got tazed by a flying drone before I even knew where they came from.yes, this game was made for a game jam in a very short amount of time, it's far from AAA. but it is still an awesomely fun game for me. it's so simple but it has this strange kind of depth to it that I really cant explain.

No, it isn't like Dark Souls hard where the game punishes you for every mistake you make, but is rewarding in the end. No, receiver is the kind of hard where if the game doesn't like your face, you're f*cked.Basically, the goal is to find all 11 tapes that are randomly placed within a randomly generated map. You start off with one of three guns, a random number of bullets, and maybe a flashlight. You then have to stealth your way throughout the map taking out turrets and drones as you go, praying you don't run out of bullets. What makes receiver unique, is the implementation of complete gun control. That is to say, everything about your firearm is done manually. In most games, you just have to press 'r' and your character inserts a new clip. In receiver, to reload a 9mm, press 'e' to remove magazine, press '~' to holster your weapon, press 'z' a few times to load bullets into the magazine, press '~' to hold your weapon, and press 'z' to put your newly loaded magazine into your gun. Then you may have to press 't' to release the slidelock. Sound complicated? It is. But it's still cool.*IMPORTANT NOTE: Everything kills you in one hit*Since everything about the game is randomly generated, the game varies in levels of generosity. There will be sections that give you four tapes in one room and sections that give you seven turrets in one room. This is why the game is hard. The majority of the challenges you face (No ammo, stupid f*cking flying drones, etc.) are because you're unlucky.For an overall rating, I'd give this game an 8/10, for its awesome concept. No other game has made me feel so bad*ss and so desperate at the same time.Oh, by the way, please comment your record for number of tapes acquired on one life. Currently mine is 7."

Speaking as someone with little first-hand experience with firearms, it works fairly well in that regard. Just leave the help menu open for a while and you'll end up with a fairly satisfying feeling as you develop muscle memory to check your chamber for a round, check the round count in your magazine, then holster your gun to fill up the magazine with loose rounds you've just picked up. The inventory, however, can get in the way of this by being somewhat awkward in shuffling between multiple magazines--so much that it's easier to reload your current mag than to change to a new one.The second is paranoia-inducing roguelike shooter. The minimalist setting and procedurally-generated environments makes you waver between finding it to be simply cheap and menacingly alien--though some things (like distant objects being drawn incorrectly or poor lighting) push more toward the former. The recordings you are required to collect then listen to over and over to complete the game, straddle the line between boring and immensely creepy (though they're undermined once you get the obvious, mundane point behind all of them). The biggest factor of all, though is your frailty: one hit of automatic turret fire or flying drone dive-bomb kills you and makes you start everything over, no exception. These things work together to make your experience tense, but often ending in frustration due to enemies having very specific hitboxes that make your success at attacking them highly luck-based.The biggest problem of all is that there's almost no connection between the two in terms of gameplay. The biggest practical benefit of adjusting to the guns' respective mechanisms is being able to reload quickly, yet this is basically useless during combat: you die in one hit, ammo is scarce, and enemies react quickly while you're in their site but almost never when you're outside (turrets can't move at all, while drones rarely change room). Combat mostly boils down to popping around the corner to attack one robot, firing a few rounds before it reacts, ducking back around the corner, fumbling around with the weapon as much as you want to refill your magazine, and repeating.Regardless, and whichever game interests you more, it's worth the price to try, especially while it's still on sale."

It's bound to be a shock to the system to see that a game with such a small amount of focus on story and atmosphere can generate just that with the power of detailed gameplay mechanics.With the more detailed simulation of weapon handling there is a definate feeling of urgency to your actions, rather than just hitting ""R"" and holding the trigger until something dies.The sounds are tight and give the weapons the illusion of weight very well and for some reason i had flashes of my early years playing things like Deus Ex.This is owed no doubt to the semi futuristic feel and the distopic undertones of the various tapes you find hidden around the game.As i'm sure you've already grasped, the game is different every time you play, which is becoming an increasingly good way to get longevity out of mechanics. The map is randomised the loadout you get dropped with is randomised and the loot drops for ammo and tapes seem randomised too. It's smart, time effective from a dev point of view and allows for more variety than almost an map designer could possibly dream up.In short all of it's features far exceed the expectation of a built in a week shooter from an indie developer. It trully epitomizes my usual argument that most inovation these days are coming from the indie side of any industry. Yeah money is no doubt tight but it's passion that drives a person into a project and indie represents those early years before the industry has a chance to taint the raw creative power that some of us are fortunate enough to realise.Only down side i see is that there is so much scope for this set of mechanics and the current idea that a little more content and a tiny bit more polish would make it a more well rounded experience.

You have to operate the gun that you have. Not only shoot it, but use hammers, revolver's cylinder, and load bullets individually into magazines you carry around. You might get lucky with amount of ammo or have need to rush through locations to save your ammunition, as it might be lean.

As a gun nut, I feel it's a clever idea for a game, subverting the usual trope of firearms in games being the simplest thing in the world; this novel idea is really what makes the game shine, yet there are a few places it falls down or is just incorrect. It's complicated to a point where it's not a really easy arcade shooter but not too complicated to where you need a degree in astrophysics to play the game! It is so unforgiving that one bullet will mean game over, starting again with a random weapon, random amount of ammo and in a random location; yet this for me just added to the fun, as way too many games will let you be a bullet sponge, taking away any risk resulting in no reward upon completion (i.e. Call of Duty). The difficulty increases as you go along, which is an essential part of an arcade game, but the difficulty spikes very fast, which isn't awful but might put some off. The enemies, while varying few in  types, yet can become overwelming in number quickly, take trial, error and thought in order to efficiently take them down.The atmosphere is very good. The story goes (as far as I can remember) thatyou are a type of guerilla, civilian rebel against 1984-style governing entity which uses these robots to remove anybody who dares rebel. You must pick up a firearm, grab your tape deck and learn how to destroy these machines and live freely again.The procedural rooms with multiple layers is a good concept and the designs for the levels are varied and look cool, yet the way the game loads each room means there will be lag when walking through some doorways (even with a high-end R9 390 graphics card and the game being on an SSD), leading to unfair kills and thrown headsets. The music is very eerie and fits well, but can inhibit gameplay from not being able to hear the enemy. The voice which gives you advice works for what it does very well but after 5 hours of gameplay, you will want to turn him off.There will be a few thing I'm missing out but the game is definitely worth buying for $5!TL;DR:Pros:• Novel, fun idea• Good story and atmosphere• Unique design• Very rewarding• Subverts usual firearm tropes• You might learn something about firearm use• Takes quite a lot of skill to perfectCons:• Extremely difficult towards the end• Flying enemies aren't very fun to fight• Gunplay isn't 100% true to reality• In situations, slow and awkward gunplay is not fun and can lead to death• Can be very unforgiving• Some in-game issues can lead to death (usually out of the player's control)• It's possible to spawn with no ammo• Graphics and visual quality are not fantastic• Performance on low-end cards isn't amazing considering the graphical quality• Very little graphical control• Have to restart game to change graphics7/10"

The random spawning of your character as well as the ammo, tapes, and enemies simply makes it too much to manage.  i have gone by killing over 25 enemies and only finding almost no tapes before getting killed because I poke my head to shoot a drone its light goes out and then i get shot after i think its dead.  That is another issue with the game is that it has inconsistency issues such as enemies spotting you through walls, enemies that dont have lights that still shoot you, enemies that are not ""active"" until you reach a certain distance, and enemies that simply dont die when you hit the right spots.  I know excactly where to shoot the turrets and drones, but sometimes when you shoot them in the right zone it does not register properly usually meaning that your gonna get killed thinking you took them out.  As the game progressed, it was getting to points where i had to deal with 6 drones and 2 turrets in just a single room which i thought was rediculous considering i couldnt find the ammo to take care of them properly even if i was doing well and killing most of them in just 1 shot.  as well when you enter certain rooms the game will freeze for a second to load portions of the map which can also get you killed as the turrets and drones dont freeze like you do meaning a free kill for them from no fault of your own.  This game lacks the polish that you would expect to see after it being out for so long.  The gun mechanics are the most fun in the game but that can get old quick as most of the stuff you will do is simply cosmetic.  There is no reason for you to have more than one magazine since there are only 2 enemies and both require line of sight before engagement meaning you can find plenty of time to reload your magazine when you need to essentially making carrying multiple magazines worthless.  This also means there is not much reason to have an inventory system to carry said magazines.  The most I have gotten in the game is 8 tapes out of 11 and i think thats as far as im going to get because it simply a matter of time before you get screwed in some fashion either from the inconsistent hit detection, the loading, or just simply not having any ammo around.  for 5 dollars it is a game i would reccomend, but, you should know that if your trying to beat it, your only looking to frustrate the hell out of yourself.

The premise of this game is pretty simple: survive and find 11 tapes. Pretty bare-bones, kinda like the original Slender game. However, this game spices things up by implementing guns in a very realistic fashion. Pull back the hammer and make sure the safety is off kind of realism. The extremely numerous controls feel rough in that way that Resident Evil's clunky controls actually enhanced some of the horror aspects. There were more than one time I was running in mortal terror desperately trying to figure out how my own gun works. The game is in desperate need of polish, as the level has a few glitches and texture issues, but for $3.99 it's a great time waster, puts some perspective on guns in games, and has that weird sci-fi dystopian backdrop I like.

,Recommended,234190,15603144,"Posted: 28 April, 2015",all,Valn,"Reciever is a short game with fun gun mechanics. It was initially made in about 42 hours or so for a competition, and it shows. The environemnts are repeated heavily, the textures are bare, and it feels kinda cobbled together. That being said, the gun mechanics are its main selling point, and you're probably not thinking of buying it for its minimalistic style. So, let's address that aspect of the game.The gun mechanics are very complex and realistic, and unique because of that. Now - to be clear - I've never owned nor fired a gun. However, I do have a pretty decent grasp on the basics of how modern ballistic weapons work, as should most people. The game portrays them accurately as far as i know, but someone that actually owns a firearm might say otherwise. Reloading the weapon is a complicated multi-step process, priming the weapon must be done for it to fire, and you even have to turn of the safety. There is also no ammo counter, you have to count shots or look at your clip for a vague idea of how many bullets you have left. You have to make sure a round is actually chambered, and cocking the gun while a bullet is in the chamber already ejects the perfectly good, unused round that you then have to pick up in embarrassment. If you're looking at buying this game for the mechanics of it, I'd say it's probably worth it.However, if you want a game that is more than just a bare-bones proof of concept slapped together over a short amount of time and sold on steam, then you might wish to look elsewhere. While it's not expensive by any stretch of the imagination, it is - however - still 5 bucks. While I've derived a lot of enjoyment from messing around with it - as it's a rogue like - there's a distinct lack of a real story, varied enemies, guns - even through there's 3 now - and other content you'd expect from a normal game. It's good, but if you don't think the shooting mechanics are interesting enough to warrent a purchase, then you should probably think hard about whether or not it's worth it. I won't tell you that you won't end up liking it - because you might - but know that when you get into this thing it's not to reach reality A."
,Recommended,234190,15640094,"Posted: 1 May, 2015",all,Zazil,"I like the concept of Receiver, vs the genre of Modern Military shooters, where the protagonist is always steady under pressure, can reload almost instantly, his gun never jams and has nearly magazines.Recevier feels like a trip to the gun range, where you are given a randomized pistol, and told: ""Here, figure this out. GL HF.""Just figuring out the sequence of ""Click off the safety, check the chamber, eject the magazine, holster the pistol (if necessary), fill the magazine (if necessary), ready your pistol, insert the magazine and rack the slide"" takes time, but is very rewarding. Sometimes the randomized nature of the spawn points means you're trying to do all this while flying taser drones are patrolling the skies above you, or worse, actively hunting you down and zapping you. Game over.That leads into the story of Receiver, which while basic, adds background and urgency to game... the player takes the role of what can be described as a near future, cyber punk, noir detective.. searching rooms for tapes that provide information and ammunition to stay alive against the constant threat of spinning stationary gun turrets and flying, seeking taser bots, both called Kill Drones.I agree that I would love to see these gun mechanics carried over to the survival horror genre... adding another layer of tension to hording and scrounging bullets, avoiding monsters, and fumbling to top off a magazine and ready your weapon while a Silent Hill nurse or Resident Evil zombie comes lurching at you to nibble on your succulent flesh.TL/DR:  Matrix like, minimalist room clearing and gun handling simulator. 9/10."

,Recommended,234190,33355688,Posted: 7 July,all,Frogs are People Too,"Please understand that if you're buying this (or any Wolfire game, as far as I can tell), you're basically purchasing the privilege to try out a proof of concept. Receiver's proof of concept is micromanaging the various functions of a handgun; one of three you're randomly given at the start of a game. It's a little awkward to get used to what button does what so you can translate your intentions into actions but after you get the hang of it it starts feeling fluid. You feel a real sense of accomplishment at being able to reload quickly. Shooting feels fairly satisfying too. There's recoil but it's not ridiculous. So, yes, the proof of concept works well. Now onto the game.Almost everything about the game, from enemy and item placement, is random. The only thing that isn't random, as far as I can tell, is the environment you find yourself in. Dull, untextured geometry that almost seems a trademark of Unity games is the only thing you'll be looking at, aside from the enemies.Which brings me to the enemies. They're... robots, which is disappointing. Maybe it's just me but I don't find shooting machines all that fun. You shoot an animal, it whimpers, it hobbles around, it bleeds, it cries for its mother. There's a lot of feedback there, you know? With robots, they just fizzle out and fall over and stop making such a racket.There's two types of them. One's an automated turret that spins around in a circle. The other's a drone that floats around and flies at you with a stungun if it sees you. Both beep if they notice you, which is a nice indication that you're probably going to be killed and have to start over in a couple of seconds because there's no health. One hit and you start over. Same three guns. Same two enemies, same old rooftops, over and over and over. Good luck getting those eleven tapes because the time-to-kill for some enemy encounters, especially the drones, can be less than a second. I haven't even mentioned how you have to hit certain parts of the robots to disable/kill them, so yeah, your quarter-second snap shot at the metal blur that's about to zap you better be accurate.Lore is given through a rather monotonous explanation through the goal; eleven video casettes you find laying around. It's some Matrix-type stuff about how you have special powers that got locked away by being saturated with addictive media or something. To get the full story and figure out what's going on you have to get the eleven tapes, which you're probably not going to do because you're too busy getting electrocuted and shot over and over and trying to remember which key does what. The voice acting is... bad. The way the guy says prounounces the ""ch"" in mindtech makes my skin crawl.So, like I said at the start of my review, it's a game that exists solely to provide functional packaging for a novel idea. How's the idea? It's pretty cool. How's the game? It kind of sucks. I'd love to see the gun mechanics in Receiver used in a real, fully fleshed game, but I also really doubt I'll ever see that happen.I recommend the game, but I also recommend you get it on sale when it's only a dollar or two. That price seems worth what Receiver boils down to; a novelty."

The challenge in this game is mostly dealing with the mechanics, so in a sense you feel like a child all over again, learning how to use your fingers, trying to hold your mother's finger in your hand. There's quite a sense of accomplishment when you finally get it down smoothly, though. There's a separate control for ejecting the magazine, emptying the magazine, filling it, loading it, and depending on the gun, cocking it back to ready it. I got this game free with Overgrowth, but I recommend it if you're into short indie games based around a concept more than they are around ""fun."" You will die. I believe I only won once."

Looking at it in more depth, it's a demo for complex pistol handling mechanics that are surprisingly refreshing and unique considering that one of the most popular genres in gaming are First Person Shooters. Receiver maps this simple process to almost as dozen keys, and after a few minutes of pracice you'll be loading magazines, ejcting spent ones and reloading the pistol, racking the slider, switching off the safety and bringing your pistol up to aim as if you were it were second nature.However it's biggest flaw is that those gun mechanics are the only fleshed out thing in Receiver.There's some barebones rooms you'll pass through to collect old tapes and more ammunition, all the while destroying and/or disabling enemy turrets and flying drones that'll attack on sight and kill in one hit, sending you right back to the start. There's real no payoff and no ramp up of difficulty, it's a barebones arena and with some enemies to shoot at.I enjoyed my short time with it, and I'll probably boot it up every now and then to play around with the pistol mechanics, but don't kid yourself into thinking it's a game in the traditional sense of the word. It's a demo through and through, and thus only really worthwhile on sale or as a free-bee with Overgrowth. You can spend your money on more worthwhile games."

I've been waiting to write this review for a long goddamn time.  I got this game for a dollar or something on a sale a long time ago.  I thought I'd be done sooner.You'll spend day 1 giggling and feeling silly playing around with the guns.  When you don't have the help menu open you do silly things.  Pull the slide back and eject a bullet then have to pick it up.  Eject your magazine from your your gun and grop it on the ground like an idiot.  Use the glock on full automatic mode, wasting bullets like a madman, it's silly, it's fun.Then that starts to wear off.  You start feeling like a badass, working your way around the gun like a pro.  You'll use the help menu less and less.  First you'll master the revolver, in the end you'll finally know what side of the gun the glock's semi automatic mode sits in.  You're like James friggin' Bond.Then that starts to wear off.  You start your game and begin mechanically checking your gun from memory.  Eject magazine, check to see how many bullets, holster gun, top it off, draw gun, unsert magazine, pull slide if there's not one in the chamber.  You've heard every tape by now and understand the story about how 11 tapes will set you free from this reality, you've also learned there's a pause button on the tapes so you don't have to hear them anymore.  It's not fun now, it's personal. You don't just hit your enemies, you target cameras and loading mechanisms.  Every death you swear, grit your teeth, and prepare to check your gun.You become paranoid and start checking every corner like the world is filled with snipers who exist solely to kill you....and it is.  You learn the turrets actually have limited ammo, if you're low you might even exploit that.  You sneak up on flying tazers and catch them off guard.  When you hear a tazer spot you there is no fight anymore, you run, run far and fast.  You'll come back and shoot it in the back but there's too much riding on this.  The route you choose becomes entirely based on how many tazers you need to fight.  It's so simple, just finsh 11 tapes and don't die, you could finish it in five minutes but I've been at it for 40 hours.Then you finish, you slide tape 11 in and you sit back in stunned silence.  The game finishes and shuts down and you drop it into your finished games folder.  You never need to play that game again, you're done.  Somehow, the game was right.  Tape 11 set you free.I regret nothing."

You have 3 different weapons [only 1 each run] and 2 different enemies. One mechanic is that you have to handle your weapon: Pull out the magazin, put bullets in it, put the magazin back in, pull the trigger or something, every action bound to a key; It is made very realistic but also fun at the same time. The other mechanic is that it matters where you hit the enemie. You can hit the turret on its batterie to deactivate it, hit it on its ammunition so it has no bullets, hit its camera so it wont see you, hit it on its ax so it can´t rotate after you.But that´s it.

Heck, I would have happily paid $10."

Great mechanics allow you to feel like you are great at playing the game, even if you barely know how to play. (Help menu tells you what to do step by step.) Runs really smooth too. I wish that they would make this game available for purchase on steam."

It’s more a collect-a-thon with detailed gun simulation, and a story that was probably written in in a hour (not surprising as a 7d FPS project).At $5 it’s a hard sell, if you like guns (mostly pistols) you’ll like this. If you want a game, look elsewhere."
