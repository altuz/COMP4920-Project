You pay once and get the full game not just part one)Book One took me just under 5 hours to complete.I love this game so far! I can't wait for Book Two and Three to be realeased! They did an amazing job staying true to the original book and it's interesting how they translated it into a game."

The decisions made leave you wondering what else you could have done to make things better, or if indeed you made the right choice. The choices that initially seem good doesn't always turnout well in the end. I like how characters remember player choices and bring them up in conversation later. I'm really enjoying how enterwined all the characters are to one another. I'm about 5 hours in and already looking forward to the next book.  The artwork is gorgeous and the voice work amazing. If you enjoy story adventures you'll likely enjoy this."
,Recommended,234270,34345284,Posted: 19 August,all,LinuxGamer1920,"Over the course of seven mini chapters within book one, you are introduced to three main protagonists. They are Tom, master builder and father who holds a personal longing to succeed in his dream of building a Cathedral, struggle is ripe for Tom and his family throughout as he tries to prove his capability to those who doubt him. Next is Brother Phillip, a patient, calmly spoken monk who maintains a sincere love for his faith and a want to do good for others. Phillip is dragged into a number of problems throughout his journey as he tries to restore order to his failing priory. Finally, Jack the outlaw, a young boy whose opening innocence becomes tested as he begins to evolve into a daring young soul. Jack’s story takes many turns as he begins to take matters into his own hands and help the people around him. The interwoven storylines of all three characters produce a sense of companionship and belonging to a game that sees you start to tailor your answers in a way that will best help their current situation.One thing that the devs have really accomplished is capturing the essence of storytelling. Throughout the epic tale the story evolves and adapts in a way that gives the player numerous plot twists, and a surprising turn of events that not only maintains your attention, but forms a general sense of wonder towards the story. By keeping true to the author’s narrative, it means this sense of attachment continues to grow throughout as the story starts to highlight the intriguing themes of deception and mystery that Follett used to portray the sinister side of Medieval England.The most intriguing nature of The Pillars of the Earth is the  interaction, which also means some of the decisions you make are of a personal nature. For instance, the  devs have been able to incorporate sets of choices that either personally resonates with your own conscience or gives the you the opportunity to play your own mischievous style. By creating decisions that give personal dilemmas to the player, a general attachment is created between yourself and the story in a way that makes you want to continue playing and reveal what becomes of the decisions you make. Visually, the game is just as intriguing as the story that is portrayed. The use of hand drawn backgrounds and settings highlights the time and effort that has gone into making the game and also produces another nice personal touch to your experience. The use of handcrafted visuals also means the artists have been able to really capture the idea of reading a book as it gives you that slight feeling that pages are being turned and you essentially move on to the next scene.Audio and the soundtrack is superb. The voice acting is pretty good. Characters on the most part help in indulging you into the story and most are able to portray a sense of key emotion when the story gives its players one of its plot twists. The game also adds a sense of humor to its writing, whether this was used in the form of sarcastic comments or smart off the barrel remarks, most will leave you with a smile on your face. Adding that sense of humor works well in Pillars of the Earth as it gives variation to character personalities that result in a sense of enjoyment when you have to encounter that character again.The Pillars of the Earth will no doubt leave those not acquainted with the book a burning desire to pick it up and delve once more into the characters whose journeys you have had so much control of over the course of book one’s playthrough. This is storytelling of a wonderful nature and an intriguing point and click adventure that should be enjoyed by many.The game runs like a charm on Linux and is my personal favorite adventure game on Linux thus far!"
,Recommended,234270,34713243,Posted: 3 September,all,Dreamy Satan,"After 4 years with Steam, this is my first review on a game, which means that Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth impressed me a lot, and I really want to share my opinion in a written form because I think this game deserves it.The Pillars of the Earth is an amazingly beautiful product, both visually and audibly. I've enjoyed every scene, every smallest movement, and each combination of colors (as a huge fan of cathedrals & churches I felt like I visited all those places I've been to again - this is fantastic, I had never had such an experience in any game before). Additionally, color decisions and at some point visual style reminded me of the traditional art of the end of the 19th century, and I believe this is brilliant: I mean, how often do you think about masterpieces of classic art while playing a game? Had never happened to me before. Audio content creates an atmosphere and does it really well: usually I do not pay attention to music in games, but it was impossible to ignore music here. Characters are well-written, and their actions seem to be logical and understandable, as well as dialogues are not awkwardly unrealistic. Amazing.The only thing that a bit discouraged me is game's plot. As for now, it seems pretty linear, although I like the amount of potential (and sometimes quite unexpected) moral choices, which a player has to make. I hope that the following chapters will make the whole story more ambiguous.In addition, a player really cannot do much. This laconism fascinated me but I believe that not every person enjoys such style so maybe you won't find the game that charming (but you cannot deny its beauty anyway).All in all, I am looking forward to playing next chapters, as for now - definitely 10 out of 10, going to read the book."

It's not like a typical adventure game, it's like a novel told during the gameplay. It's fascinating, and they did great work on that part, it's like a new genre / style of game, and very entertaining. Be prepared to listen to a lot of (spoken!) dialogues, you need some patience, but that they have voiceover for pretty much everything is impressive.Visually, the (draw) style they decided for really gives the game a special atmosphere, the sound in certain places underlines it perfectly. You really can relax and jump in the world of Kingsbridge playing the game.Everyone interested in story-heavy story-telling games having some patience to listen to a lot of dialogues, I can recommend it.I can't wait to give it more playtime. Will be interesting to see how, how heavily and if the story changes if you take different decisions to the characters in the books."
76561198258581204,Recommended,234270,34487874,Posted: 25 August,all,pilot talk,"The game is amazing, hand drawn 90s animation, the themes are mature but not grotesque, voice acting spot on, choices matter and the story is extremely engaging, historically accurate. I have yet to read the Ken Follett book it was based on but will give it a shot while waiting for the second part to the game. I almost don't want to read the book because in this rare case I feel like the book could take away from the Game. 10/10 beyond any tell tale game. This is the type of game that entertains and expands your mind. I was relluctant with the price tag but am very satisfied with the purchase it is worth every cent and a lot of thought went into this you have the philharmonic orchestra which adds to the atmosphere mood and direction of the game, the monks choir practice in latin was great. I can't praise this game enough. If you are a fan of a good story get this game, if you like shows like game of thrones or house of cards get this game, if you want a 12th century suprisingly frank and honest explanation of the birds and bees get this game."

The story is well written and exciting, the characters are also very diverse and you want to learn more about them and what will happen to them. Another good thing is the grittyness of the world, the voulnerability of mankind and that you should be careful who you use the slingshot on :D I really liked the style of the game it really took me back to the days of Monkey island 3 and Discworld 2. Lets hope the second and the third charpter will keep on giving"

I also like Daedalic games and so was very excited to see what they will come up with. I think this game is very good for what it is. The art style is incredible (imo best looking ""cartoon look"" adventure ever). there are A LOT of handdrawn backgrounds which look stunning. You can tell the devs put a lot of though and effort into the look of this game. The same goes for the way the story is presented. a lot of original concepts are in there and while i do notice a lot of things are skipped from the book thats to be expected (the game feels a little bit rushed). They did very well presenting the material so far.To the gameplay:you hear a lot of comparison to telltale style games. while i think telltale does a better job of conveing (or actually having) freedom of choice, i think this game does have more a traditional point and click feel (although VERY easy puzzles). But I am so old nowadays and dont have the patience to have the flow of the story hindered by hard puzzles, i actually PREFER really easy adventures cause i want to experience the story and atmosphere.8/10 so far."

I will say though, that there is one section in the game that runs SUPER slow but then it picks up. Fans of the book will definitely enjoy this, and even if you're unfamiliar with the story, new fans will find this to be a captivating tale. Much like Telltale games, this game is about choosing what to say in certain situations and I was always concerned whether or not I made the right choice. Not to bash Telltale games, but I do think that the storytelling is much deeper in this than any Telltale game I've played. Hopefully people will check this game out because it really is a great game so far. I can't wait for the next two parts!"

76561197994665495,Recommended,234270,34538432,Posted: 27 August,all,Muskat,It is an interactive novel and the classic adventure elements are not so in depth as on other titles but the story and hand drawn screens pull you in. Within 20min I felt like in 12th century England in a harsh winter. I read one of Ken Follett's books a long time ago and this is a beautiful way of presenting the story - can't wait for the next chapters.
,Recommended,234270,34512374,Posted: 26 August,all,lylade3,"Great game. Pay the extra couple of bucks to get the soundtrack. Beautiful music and graphics come together with a very intresting story. Ended up buying the book after playing this. Has a few swear words but so far nothing visually graphic that would make this anything above a T rating (as of episode 1). Good voice actors, all dialog is spoken so no sitting there doing a ton of reading, the exception is for the random things you click on, the characters thoughts on those are text only, which I actually perfer, so no hearing the same dialog a million times everytime you click on a rock or something. The thoughts are intresting to read, but not normally game important. Controls are very easy and the game is just perfect for if you want to get into a good story without getting into the complexity of most action packed games. It runs well on my laptop which is a really cheap on I just got to do word documents for school and stuff, not games. The colors are only a slightly bit off (low gradient quality and a bit saturated looking) and some cut screens were a tiny bit slow at first, overall very good considering I don't think I have any other games that I can play on this (normally I use my desktop, but I was away from home when I got this so the laptop was all I had). I hope more games like this (or simular, like life is strange, nancy drew,  myst..) they seem to be picking up in popularity again and I can't wait to see what else comes out next."

One of my favorite books of all time and I feel the game does a great job of giving you the same sort of feelings the book gives you. Of course you can't replace the book, but it's really awesome to be able to play through someone else's imagining of the book. Can't wait for the next 2 parts to come out!"

Attention to detail in games like this adds to the atmosphere, for this, definitely thanks to the developers. Musical accompaniment is fine, well-chosen melodies, and in some places, songs, are forced to plunge into the game world with a head. Visually, the game is also beautiful, the drawing is unusual and very sweet, even in the drawing of objects and backgrounds, the attention of the authors to details is visible, and its really important for games like this The plot and the script of the first episode are also wonderful and captured me, I strongly expect the second episode! The game is so interesting that I read the book! And I want to say that the transfer of the appearance, behavior and character of the characters in the game is wonderful. Yes, there are changes, but they do not greatly interfere with the perception of the characters.In general, I recommend this game, with wonderful characters, elaboration of objects and details of the world, wonderful atmosphere and musical accompaniment!P.S Phillip is my favourite? he is soooooo cute(Sorry I used Google)"

They're some of the most interesting you can play, since you're fully immersed in the action. Pillars of the Earth is as good if not better than Telltale or anything similar. The choices you make have weight, and double crossing people causes a huge mess if you don't play your cards right.I have only played the first book (the first 7 chapters), so I can't say if I like the ending, but I love the direction so far"
