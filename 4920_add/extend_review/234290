The worst part of the game though is that there are a lot of glitches and bugs...you can find yourself saved to an unwinnable save point, stuck in the back / foreground, or just have the textures go haywire on you.  If you find it on a BIG sale (I picked it up 90% off), it may be worth your time...otherwise give Zack zero thought."

,Recommended,234290,12718496,"Posted: 31 October, 2014",all,Wolfgame,"If you're looking for a AAA storyline and impressive cinematic quality cut scenes, or even decent humor, forget about it.  However, as craptacular as the narration, which comes off more like story time in the kids section of the book store, it starts to fall in to that ""so bad it's good"" category.  The plot is flimsier than dollar store toiler paper, but that's what makes it funny.  It feels like it was written by a grade schooler, and the character designs reflect a lot of those same sensibilities.The gameplay is your typical run and gun platformer ala Megaman X8/9.  I use that example specifically because the different powers enable you to reach certain areas, depending on what you're trying to achieve.The models and environments are fairly well detailed, so I think I would've liked to have seen more in-engine cutscenes as opposed to the concept storyboards and  would've liked to have had a voice attached to the comm notifications.All that said, I paid a buck for this and got a lot more than that in value.    Zack Zero shows a lot of promise, but go in it for the old school run and jump gamplay of the nintendo era, and try to not cringe too much at the storyline or the narrator's booming voice.Other games like this would be Rochard and Shank."

But if you withstand some of it's quirks, it's actually a very enjoyable platformer, with nice voice acting (though sparse), cool cartoon cutscenes and some really impressive levels. Oh, and the music is pretty good too.It took me about 4 hours to finish it and I didn't find all the secrets, so it has a nice length and I didn't feel the game was padded by using the same tricks over and over. It manages to keep it fresh by using several environmental traps, cool bosses and some neat retro references here and there.Overall, I think it has some flaws, but it's still a nice platformer on the PC (and there are not many with this style here). I hope Crocodile could make a sequel, so that they could polish some of the rough edges. If you crave for some oldschool jump-n-shootin' on your PC, this could meet your needs!"

Hacking and slashing are more important.Metacritic is definitely too off 56 for this kind of game seriously?If you're a fan of platformer you'll definitely like the game.

Not for the gameplay - it actually looks good and plays great - but for the technical shortcomings, which are all too plenty. Just check the discussions going on: loads of people are having trouble with this game. Many of them can't get it started, or need quite some complicated action to get it running. This is technically not a finished product - anyway not on Steam, right now. Maybe ""early access"", and even then. Is Valve getting overwhelmed a bit by the plethora of new idie-games coming out so that they can't keep up to their usual high technical standards? Let's hope not....As for me: this game managed to crash to a blue screen of death and a hard reboot three times in a row, after which I gave up on it. And yes, I do have a very stable system with crashes almost non-existent, certainly no hard reboots.So unfortunately, I cannot really speak of the gameplay. For the 20 minutes of so I managed to be in-game, it looked pretty funny, with lots of action, good graphics, and quite some humour. Alas, technical issues ruined this one for me.Overall rating: 2/10 (possible 7/10 or higher if the technicall issues were not there).Sad, really."
,Recommended,234290,12796672,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Sawboo,This game feels a bit like a puzzle-platformer because the player must choose the correct element in order to proceed past certain obstacles.  The combat is pretty simple and enemies can be disposed of very easily. The learning curve is mellow and the overall difficulty seems pretty easy. I haven't played for more than a couple hours so the late game could change quite a bit. The pace of this game was just a bit too slow for my personal preference.

Zack has three different suit powers (along with the normal mode), which you have to use to platform and fight enemies.  The problem is that the suit powers are barely used in-game.  There's a few times when I had to switch over, but I generally saw little reason to switch from normal, especially since it can easily defeat most enemies and doesn't use energy.  Combat in general is just a bore, especially when the game makes you fight mini-bosses multiple times with no changes.  There is some decent platforming in here, and a few moments where I found myself having fun with that, but overall, this is just mediocre."

It was a struggle, a test of my patience to see how fast I could speedrun this game, and I almost feel a little cheated.  For a dollar!I will say this up front: the game tried, but not nearly hard enough.  Hit detection is awful, the controls are inconsistent (sometimes I can double jump, sometimes not, sometimes I can grab ledges, not always), the recycled enemies are absolutely dull, the level design is pointless ( ""puzzles"" consisted of moving obvious blocks onto obvious platforms), the story is absolutely atrocious and uninspired, the psuedo-3d gimmick (you and enemies could move into the foreground and background) worked against me half the time as I couldn't hit enemies who were hitting me, the dialogue is straight out of an underfunded kid's animation movie, not to mention the ""cinematic"" and dull soundtrack... ugh.I'd give it flak for the infinite lives, but that's the only thing that kept me going to completion, and what with the awful hit detection and controls it's a blessing.  It was never particularly hard, but there were very few deaths where I feel I screwed up and wasn't just cheated by the game.There were a few things that went well, however.  The level design, however plain, did only leave me at a confused halt twice, one of them was because the game bugged and I couldn't progress in the lava area.  The abilities did feel satisfying enough to use, watching enemies or the environment either freeze or explode.  That's... about it.Oh, and minor spoiler here, but the ending leaves off in a CLIFFHANGER.  They were confident enough in this game to leave space for a direct sequel.  Good lord.Edit:  Forgot to mention that the game stuttered in many places and had low framerate issues regularly for seemingly no reason, not like this is a graphically intense game."
,Not Recommended,234290,886087,"Posted: 30 July, 2013",all,baja gaijin,"Zack Zero is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you plan to just play through it like a standard platformer (which, to be frank, it is - it's Yet Another Bland Indie Platformer With a Gimmick), don't, because the platforming is in no way good, and the aforementioned gimmick is somehow worse. Zack turns into three alternate forms! Ice, Fire, Earth. Now, IF you want to play it by ""its rules"", you're going to swap these constantly because higher score comes from raising ""combo"" by swapping damage types between each attack. The problem is that doing this will chew through your too-small energy meter, so you can basically only get off two or three before forcefully transforming back into Zack Prime or whatever the hell his base form is called.Let me tell you why the actual mechanics are bad, though: You begin the game as a superpowered wunderkind and then at the end of the first stage, you're knocked on the head and are suddenly Level♥♥♥♥♥ like a later Metroid game. The problem is that ZZ's stages are straight up left-to-right platforming levels, so instead of finding your powers to get cool again, you need collectables. Rareware-level collectables. Each single green dot is some XP! It's less fun than it sounds. The powers, as a result, go from having cool moves and tricks to all suddenly being one-hit-wonders (fire has a hover which you use to clear too-long gaps, ice can slow time to get under too-fast crushers, earth can't jump but HULK SMASHES open rocks beneath you and also is used every time there's a lever because you're too ♥♥♥♥ing weak to pull a lever without rocks on you?? no really).The levels aren't fun. Period. Only fire has a reliable homing attack (which chews up energy, so you only get 2, maybe 3 off without becoming Zack again) so all the flying enemies are gonna clown on you while you try taking them out, or perhaps the platform beneath you will collapse while you try shooting down the dude who's gonna dive-bomb you mid-leap. I would legitimately argue that Super Mario Bros. (1!) has better platforming and level design than this game, if that tells you anything. Obstacles come in two varieties: ""easily ignored"" or ""KILL AT ALL COSTS"", and sometimes it's hard to tell the latter because they look like the not-entirely-3D backgrounds and will come out to wreck you. Oh, also, sometimes the platforms follow the same rule! Have fun telling which random chunk of rock in the caves is supposed to be walk-onable or will drop you to the two-second death FMV for the 500th time. (Yes there is a death cutscene. Dragon's Lair as ♥♥♥♥.)Don't buy Zack Zero, it's not a good platformer, or a good score-attack game, or really ""good"" at all. It's complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you don't have a controller (I did, for the record!) the keyboard controls are the most spiteful I've ever seen for a game that needs nothing but arrow keys, ""switch forms"", and action buttons."

The visuals are quite good and the characters designs as well are something out of a saturday morning cartoon. The game's platforming isn't bad with the multiple forms you can transform into offering a variety of ways to progress (some forced), and although easy, it keeps in mind its target audience. The combat is also easy, and can be summarized by pressing attack and letting the lock on do its work, it takes essentially no skill but does allow the game to be accessible again to the very young demographic. Dying also seems to be of minimal penalty, further lending to the genre, which is made to be accessible.  The drawbacks to this game are twofold, the first are that there are some technical issues and even I got frames per second drops occasionally without any apparent cause and the second is that if you are outside of this game's target demographic you likely will not enjoy the experience.

Creative in its design and execution.  Superficially very Trine-like but isn't so physics oriented.  Lots of fun if you like cool platformers.This game is well worth  regular price, but you'll feel guilty getting it on sale for only $.99!Do it!"

Nice graphics, sometimes you can move in 2.5D... some nice mini and levelbosses... secrets to discover, achievements... also the duration to complete was decent. Importantly, the autosave feature is very fair... all gems you get before dying are saved, you just need to replay a small area...Recommended for the price."

,Recommended,234290,14485083,"Posted: 15 February, 2015",all,Sapphire Crook,"Zack Zero starts slow, but ultimately picks up into being a fun little romp.While a little awkward at times, it's a fun thing to entertain yourself with. If 9 euros is too much, it's certainly worth getting during a sale, if you're willing to endure the very slow, annoying start.Just remember that the first few levels will make you feel like it never picks up, and then it picks up and becomes a charming little indie title that could certainly use a sequel. In fact, I'd be sad if I'd never see ZZ again in a more refined form.After all, most problems could be fixed with a few tweaks and some slight changes as well as a more intelligent design in the earlier levels. It's odd to see a game start bad and then become good, it's usually the other way around.Honestly, my experience is a solid 7/10 overall!"
,Not Recommended,234290,14956963,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,El_Desenladrillador,I'd say this action platformer is good as the game for children. The rest may skip it without any regrets as it offers nothing of interest for an experienced gamer and a grown-up person.
