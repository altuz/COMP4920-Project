Although I normally avoid platformers because they cause rage most the time to me and others I got this due to me meeting the dev. of this game. He also said there would be a hat with it in tf2 called the fuzzy wub wub that never came out, o well. Anyways this games level design changes with whatever music you put in it, causing some obstacles to move faster or slower depending on what music is playing and when the base drops in the song. Of course like i said that does cause lots of confusion and makes it so you normally die 15~100 times depending on map and if there is a checkpoint system in the map you chose. Luckily deaths are fast and they spare no time throwing you back out there to continue. All in all this game gives you enough fun for its price and its fun to play with friends and share your music with them. I'd give it... 6.75/10 I think. Gives you enough fun for your buck. (I'd recomend getting it while it is on sale during winter or summer. Although it is fun I can't see to many people playing it over 4 hours.)"

I'll buy it together with my friend and then we'll play and fun bla bla..."".But when it was released the hype was away and we waited for a sale....we got it. We paid 1€ each....and we want it back. A cup of ice cream would have been a lot more fun for the money.Now to the real review (I've been even using the Co-Op Mode): The game is fast and dynamic, in the first few seconds it's awesome, but soon the first flaws appear:- Why do they have a running animation, when you can spam the slide and are a lot faster? Keep that away, it looks like you're glitching, but if you're not doing it, you know that you should do it or you'll lose.- The game and level design is awful. Flash games look better and are for free. And you can't really tell if an obsticle is just there or if it is deadly. Maybe it is the color, but everything is glowing and so I didn't care and got kinda frustrated. And if you play coop and ""kill"" your friend....oh god the animations look so horrible.- There's no aim. You have all songs and all levels (or am I wrong? But starting with over 30 levels doesn't seem too unlockable) and therefore I don't know for what I'm playing. Me and my friend were battling and the winner got...nothing. We started the next level, had a bit fun, but it got boring soooo fast. Now you're asking ""but there are achievements which save us!"" Wrong. ""Beat XX in YY seconds."" that's it. For every level. Yay.- The level design isn't fun. In games like VVVVVV or Super Meat Boy (which I have both beaten with a sh*tload of fun) everything was hard, but fair or fun. In RB you run, fly or fall into something and ask ""WHY? WOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN"". My friend isn't a noob either and had the same questions.- The music is meh. I'm totally into EDM and it's the most common thing I hear, but in the game I liked about 2 songs (one was the main theme). After using my songs (which took an eternity to load, my friend dealt with the same issue) the levels didn't change that much, so no ""wow"" in this either.After all, this game is so disappointing, even for paying only 1€."

The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason. Again, I really wanted to like this game but some of the core parts of this game just don't click with me."

The graphics were flashy, the music was authenitc, and if you didnt like it, you could even add your own custom soundtrack! The gameplay looked fast paced, and it looked really fun........Until i played the damn thing.The gameplay is really slow and and you're not going to get to pick up the pace unless you spam the roll technique. And while that is sometimes expected, it really lowered my expectations for fast-paced and fun gameplay.And while the graphics ARE flashy, yet a bit easy on the eyes, they're a bit TOO flashy. Its really hard to focus on one thing, then move your eyes to focus on another with all of the detail this game has to offer, and I feel like they tried way too hard and ended up overdoing it. I'm not saying its eyestrain or that it is'nt pretty to look at, but it slows down the gameplay even further when you cant even focus on moving from one place to another.The only thing I liked about this game is the amount of customization and free-roaming time you have. Like I said, you can make your own soundtrack and even change the color of your character which lowers the amount of bad restriction this game forces you to deal with. And, prove me if i'm wrong, since i uninstalled this game, but i think you can make your own levels.

,Recommended,234490,13509781,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,Dastuke,"I've put in quiet a decent amount of time into this game at this point and figured it was about time to write my own honest review of the game...As a tl;dr for anyone not looking to read through this entire review before buying:I give the game a 6/10, I'll give it a thumbs up because it's enjoyable enough, but I don't necessarily recommend it. The game itself isn't for anyone and if you're planning on buying it, wait until its $5 or less as the $10 price tag is too much for this game.The game itself is exactly as it claims it is when it states that it's ""a music reactive Platform Racing Game"". The game itself is centered around competing against other players online (or against your own times) while avoiding obstacles that areSomewhatreactive to the music. But this ""reactive"" element is where part of the problem I have with this game arises. Depending on the song currently playing, certain elements of levels can be virtually impossible to complete. As songs get more and more upbeat obstacles seem more aggressive and unpredictable. Be it those strange ""bass"" obstacles that send you flying away from them, the pulsing buzz saws, or those obnoxious cannon like things, certain songs will make these obstacles about a million times more difficult. I myself would often find myself waiting for the brief moments of peace at the end of one song while another was preparing to start before trying to quickly rush through an obstacle I'd been stuck at for what seems like ages.Next up, level design. While all the stages themselves are unique and different, there's a few major problems I've noticed in levels that just makes the game itself incredibly frustrating to play sometimes. On some levels you'll get a checkpoint nearly every 20 feet, so a death is meaningless and can cost you only a few seconds, while on other levels I felt like I'd spend a minute at a time avoiding obstacles only to die and be sent right back... And that without mentioning some horrible level layouts where I could miss a jump, fall down for about 15 seconds and land on a platform near the beginning of the level, forcing me to start almost the entire race over again.Multiplayer itself seems to work well enough, however I haven't been able to play much online. Half the time I can't find a server with anyone to play against, and whenever I can, they'll often leave before we can even pick a level or make it any significant distance into a race. However racing against a friend while chatting over skype can be a blast.Overall the game itself isn't bad... but I wouldn't by any means call it great or even necessarily good. It's a basic platformer, with controls that can be a little bit slippery, beautiful background images, and a diverse and enjoyable soundtrack. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game at full price unless you're really really itching to get your hands on it, I would recommend it if it drops to $5 or below. And at that point you may want to grab a 2-pack so you could send a copy to a friend if you ever wanna play a quick game to pass some time."

After awhile you learn the controls and it becomes a little easier to manuever around the levels. The level design is alright but at sometimes gets bland and repetitive.

After playing the game for 116 minutes, several flaws in the games are apparent.Restarting the level becomes tedious because there is no key that just restarts the level. You have to press escape and click on restart and the yes button. This might seem minor, but when making a mistake over and over you could be restarting the game about 20 to 50 times trying to get a better time. Then comes the three second wait every time you restart, there seems to be no reason for this at all.There is no way to view the level so it is all trial and error. You spend minutes memorizing levels and having to react very fast and if you don't you have to restart. And restart. And restart. The level is constantly different due to the music and you can't lock a level to a single song. So after memorizing the level you still have to adapt because the beats of the song change the objects movements.There are a few bugs in the game such as warping through walls or objects. Some objects that are moving that kill you leave a hurtbox that should not be there and unfortunately you walk into nothing and die.Leaderboards is meaningless due to all the glitched scores. Some people have beaten a lot of the levels in 0.0 seconds making it all pointless."

I don't usually make negative reviews, because I know how troublesome it is to make even a small game, but if you want a piece of advice, then go waste your money on something else.This game is nothing like promised, the stage doesn't respond very well to the songs, only a SMALL portion of it (spikes, some platforms that pops from the ground and crates that will ""smash"" you or whatever those things are) will move with the song and some of the objects that are affected will move totally out of the rhythm of a custom music and the gameplay is slow and boring.

This game has controls? Could’ve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldn’t move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that you’ve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the “play” portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete. Once you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty it’s impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if he’s composed of primarily molasses. The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all. The way levels ""react"" to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing is infuriating."

I think this game was trying to be a game like Meat Boy, I Wanna Be the Guy, etc. etc. Same concept, same difficulty. 3/53 . Music:Ok, let's get serious... CHECK THIS ♥♥♥♥IN'♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT! This game was based souly on music, and they nailed it out of the park! It's badass, and you play the to the beat sometimes. I find myself playing this game just cause of the music.
