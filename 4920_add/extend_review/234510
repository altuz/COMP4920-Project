The feeling of hitting someone long range and seeing the poof of blood is amazing. It has bullet drop, and you can adjust the sights for range. This is the only game i have ever seen to have the pop up sights actually work. The BAR and Thompsons have flip sights. The Surpression system is perfect! The screen effects really mess with your aiming.Graphics 10/10Realism  10/10Sound      10/10Well worth every penny!"
,Recommended,234510,1460161,"Posted: 8 July, 2013",all,J o n e x,"Rising Storm is a truly incredible WW2 multiplayer experience. Fans of Red Orchestra 2 will be more than satisfied but even new people to the franchise (like me), will most likely find the gameplay addictive and the experience one of a kind.This game also includes the Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer so you can fight in the Pacific AND the Eastern Front. There are huge 64 player battles in extremely large maps that really makes you feel like you’re part of a war instead of a multiplayer shooter.Red Orchestra has always been about realism which means limited HUD, quick deaths, a bleed out system, and a morale meter. Red Orchestra 2 players won’t be surprised by these features because they aren't anything new, but I just wanted to mention them for new players. The moral system affects the shakiness of your screen and the amount of colour you can see. If an enemy suppresses you, it will quickly drop. If artillery falls near you, it will drop. If you witness a fellow teammate getting killed, it will drop. There are lots of things that affect it but over time it gradually recovers.Aside from the new maps and new weapons, the best new features are the distinct differences between the American side and Japanese side. The Americans have superior weapons whereas the Japanese have dirty tactics like grenade traps and Banzai rushes. So any Japanese soldier can use his grenades as traps by planting them in the ground. Luckily enough, they aren't triggered by fellow Japanese. The Banzai charge is a really interesting feature. Any soldier can charge forward while quickly diminishing morale of the Americans affecting their aim etc. The more Japanese that group together during the charge, the higher the morale drop for the Americans. While performing a Banzai charge the Japanese are also more resistance to gunfire. The Japanese weapons aren't as good as the Americans, but the effective use of these tactics can really make a difference.There are various game styles that have been added such as “Action” which includes a more revealing HUD. So far I’ve only played Objective mode so I can’t tell you much about the game modes, but objective is very fun and really emphasizes teamwork.It’s nice to play a game where teamwork is important and although one player can’t do much, a whole squad working together can really make a difference. I enjoy the visceral nature of the game and the realistic sounds used. It really is a definitive WW2 experience that I won’t forget!"
,Recommended,234510,2252964,"Posted: 19 September, 2013",all,[GND] Jester,"Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is essentially what Battlefield wishes it was. It's a more mature and more advanced PvP shooter that demonstrates the difference between console gaming (Battlefield/Call of Duty) and PC gaming (this game).Many of the game modes are similar to what you'll find in Battlefield and Call of Duty, so what separates RS/RO2 is the gameplay. It's like a realistic, hardcore version of Battlefield except with much better level design, better netcoding/hit detection, mod support, and no balance issues.Some may say it bridges the gap between typical shooters like Battlefield/CoD, and mil-sims like ArmA. Most of the gameplay, from the weapon functionality, complex vehicle functionality, and the high levels of intensity are closer to ArmA, while the scale and game modes are closer to Battlefield. Although not as strategic as Crysis/Crysis Wars or Natural Selection 2, anyone who likes PvP shooters should get this game."

And yet... I keep playing this one despite all that. Maybe it's because drawing a Katana and charging at the enemy with absolutely no regard for your own safety is just... fun! Anyway, it's a WW2 shooter, but set on the Pacific (US vs Japan) and Eastern (USSR vs Germany) fronts rather than the typical America shoots Nazis stuff. Also ""deathmatch"" mode, so popular in modern military shooters, is all but abandoned here. This is a game for teams to work together to win. All in all, this game has everything I like in a shooter game.Oh, and you can drive tanks sometimes. Vroom!"
76561198014021112,Recommended,234510,2881760,"Posted: 29 September, 2013",all,DiogoSN,"Rising Storm is a realistic FPS brought you by Tripwire Interactive, a fantastic developer.This title is a spin-off of Red Orchestra of which the franchise is based in the Second World War. Instead of Soviet Union fighting against the German Nazis, here the game is based in the Pacific War of which you fight with the Japanese Empire or the United States of 'MURICA (I mean America...). Just like Red Orchestra, I suggest you only play this game if you're not deeply affected by war movies or if you don't have war trauma. Like I said in my brief introduction, the game wants to be as realistic as it can be without breaking the pacing. There's a lot of good voice acting here which can transmit pain. For example, I accidentally shot one of my teamates and the player's avatar died. The player respawned, however, the avatar kept crying of the pain and he wouldn't stop. It made me feel bad for the mistake and I couldn't concentrate properly. So as I said, be sure you would be fine with the execution of the theme.You'll be fighting in many historical locations which are very well built for the game mechanics implemented in the game. Rising Storm is an assimetrical class-based game of which you have various roles to choose from. Assimetrical multiplayer (for those of you who don't know), is a system of which both teams or more have different attributes and features but the game is still balanced. In this case, the Americans have many classes with a better selection of weapons and the Japanease use guerilla-tactics and have special abilities. It's a bit harder to use the Japanease and you don't have a tutorial segment for them. What's harder to learn is how you should play Rising Storm, it's a lot harder to know how to advance efficiently or to defend as long as you can.Even though it's a class-based game, what really matters is logistics here. What I'm talking about is moving as many soldiers as you can from point A to B and holding the point....preferably without dying of course.... You have many respawn tickets and as long as you don't burn too much time and don't waste them in an unproductive way, what you should be worried about is pushing with your teammates. You'll die many times though, so don't be suprised, it's a very hard game. You can respawn alongside your squad leader like in Battlefield.The game is quite slow if you're doing things right. There's a lot of cover-based shooting because you can actually stick to cover, fire blindshots and tilt out of cover to fight. In all cases, do not go alone and don't run-and-gun. Go with teammates so you can get cover fire. Speaking of the firefights, the guns are very enjoyable to use but are hard to control because of their recoil. The game rewards for long and accurate shots, specially because  you're dealing with old guns which work best in a specific way.Rising Storm as Red Orchestra has a regenerative health that is mixed with consciousnesses and morale. So not only will shooting directly your enemy lower his HP, but also suppresive fire and nearby artillery fire will do the same. When your HP bar is low, you'll have difficulty hearing and you'll only see black and white. However, once  the HP bar is low, you have to shoot them directly. You can also get injured and bleed out, so make sure you stick your head low.Thee graphics are very beautiful but there are no facial animations which make it awkward to look at the soldiers. If you don't have a very good machine, then don't worry, the extensive option menu will help you on that.In conclusion, Rising Storm has a high learning curve which probably will put you off if you don't like very hard games, but if you're looking for a challenge, then I recommend it!"

Think Day of Defeat updated and done well and your're somewhere close in terms of game style, but this just feels way more gritty, dangerous and real. It's brutally hard, with a learning curve to match Counter-Strike: Source and similarly, to overcome that curve is a brilliantly joyous moment.Tactics really make up a large part of this game, especially in the Realism mode, and you have to work as a team if you want to stand any chance of winning.The weapons are all beautifully modelled and feel individual. And nothing beats banzai charging a group of American soldiers with nothing but a katana.In short, this is essential for all WWII game enthusiasts.9/10"

The Pacific theater of WWII is vastly unaccounted for in Cinema and Video games. With the exception of Medal Of Honor Pacific Assault you rarely see a WWII Pacific Theater based game. I can honestly say this is one of the best multiplayer experiences i've had in first person shooters. I find it more appealing than RO2 itself. The maps are done extremely well and are better in my opinion than the RO2 maps. It's almost hard to explain but you get the feeling of terror when you hear the Banzi charge and see 32 players running at the trench your set to defend, It makes for fantastic excitement and adrenaline rush. If you like RO2 and have always wanted a WWII game set in the Pacific, it's here."
