Full Burst brings you a revamped of Storm 3 Cinematics and a New Chapter, a Chapter that enables you to fight against Kabuto at his Sage Mode, he can be playable after the completion of the chapter.The game has over 80 playable characters, from the young generations to the characters of the On-going 4th Great Ninja War. In addition, 100 new missions has been implemented on this version that expands the gameplay hours due to challenging objectives. In addition, 38 Free Costumes, character outfits that were DLC's from the orginal Storm 3, which were worth more than £30 in total. English and Japanese audio is available within the game alongside with english subtitles.Overall the gameplay is fun and entertaining, ain't hard to get grasp on to execute visually appealing combos. The characters has been re-balanced for the satisfaction of online play from the orginal Storm 3. The game does not end after the story mode, the all New 100 Missions and Online play is available for the challange. Over two thousand in game collectables are available to haul, from profile cards to titles, which can be used to customized your in game battle profile.Verdict:As a Anime fan i would give this game a 9.5/10 due to the justice it served on the original content as well for the Ninja Storm franchise.However as a Gamer the game appeal to me as 6.5/10 due to the lack of depth gameplay mechanics, although this type of game isn't supposed to be complex, unlike Guilty Gear and Street Fighter which have more rigid and competitive gameplay. Though Storm 3 serves multiple objectives, it can be a gateway to a reminisence childhood or enter a whole new world of dedicate fans of animes. Or maybe you just simply want to enjoy to see Sasuke getting lariat by the Raikage dozen of times. *no offense to Sasuke's fans ;)*NOTE: The game starts directly after the Pain Arc, no filler characters are in this game, only Canon story is implemented - summarization with 3D visuals, more than 24 hours worth of 3D custcenes.In case you're not familiar with the Shippuden series and want to watch/catch up, there are roughly 200 anime episodes to watch in total, filler excluded, in order to catch up with the story in this game.Watch Guide List:Watch episodes 1-56Skip at 57-7071 - Last 10 min or so is manga material.

,Recommended,234670,8991642,"Posted: 5 February, 2014",all,Jake,"[SPOILER FREE] Very, very good game - Not so good port.If we were to focus on the porting of the game rather than the game itself then we'd get nowhere, as there's not a lot to say and not much of it good. So instead, I will focus mainly on the game itself from my experience with the Console editions, and later tie that in with the PC port.So, as anyone who has played a game in the STORM series knows, it is the go-to series for a true-to-the-anime experience. Everything is there; the beautiful graphics, the original voice actors, the story, everything. Even the tiny details you wouldn't normally catch (Such as Tobi's subtle and goofy taunts), are present. It's really what the anime would look like if it were real.STORM 3 was a massive step up from its predecessor, Generations, in that it took the new mechanics and elements brought to the table and refined them further, and over a year after release there are still new mechanical tactics being discovered or used in entirely new ways. There are more ways to fight in STORM 3 than there were before; many viable combinations of characters and playstyles. Although it seems at times that some are more useful or practical than others, typically it lies down to individual cunning to overcome what is ahead of them.The story is faithful to the anime (Up until a certain point, however the anime hadn't got to this point yet so it's understandable), and really makes you feel as if you were in the Naruto universe. My main gripe is the endless chains of cutscenes, with no option to skip them all, as there is a loading sequence between each one. I love the cutscenes as they are stunning, especially with Full Burst's revamped graphics, but they lose their impact if you're replaying the story mode. It would be nice to be able to skip them all without loading up each one.Aside from the main story, there are side missions aplenty, allowing you to learn a little more about the other characters in the universe that still tie in to the main story. Very good for anyone who enjoys the other characters and want to see more of them.The soundtrack to the game is reminiscent of the anime and equally as awesome. No complaints what-so-ever about the audio, as it's been spot on in all of the STORM games and I'm a huge fan of each OST. (My personal favorites were STORM 2's ""White hot battle at the summit"" and ""The Uchiha Hideout"" stage music.)Another reason people are drawn to the series is for the multiplayer. Sadly, with exception to the new roster and mechanics, STORM 3 did not bring much new to the table that was exclusive to the multiplayer, however they did take what was already there and make it just that bit better. For example, whilst there are nowthousandsof possible ninja info card and title choice to choose from, none of this is visible to other players unless it's a 1v1 fight. It subtracts a lot of the motivation to unlock these cards and then spend time personalizing it when there are only two modes in which people can even see it, and even then it's only for a few seconds before both players prepare to begin character selection.As for the non-1v1 modes, Tournaments or Endless, Both modes had a new feature added, but neither of them were really that interesting.Nobody plays elimination Endless (A mode where you keep playing until you lose, at which point you are kicked from the lobby) because people join endlesses to play mutliple matches with a group of people over a period of time, and being ejected from the lobby for losing, or having your opponents ejected when you win, is just like playing 1v1 modes except with a waiting list.As for Perpetual tournaments (Tournaments where each match has two stipulations that affect both players), they can still be interesting, however the feature just wasn't taken advantage of. There could have been countless possibilities for different rules and options. They could've made it so one player is affected by one rule whilst the second player is only affected by the second one. They could have also added in many more rules, too, however you'll usually have seen it all after your 3rd or 4th tournament.The Ranked mode has also gotten considerably worse; CyberConnect2 sacrificed a lot to try and keep the game balanced, and ultimately it went to waste as there are still the small stable roster of characters and supports you'll see in the majority of your matches (Looking at you, Kimimaro and Neji.) however unlike the past games, balancing patches have been brought out to try and quell this, however most players still stick to the familiar ""meta"" teams.Disconnections (Or Ragequits) were an issue CC2 attempted to address, however there still seems to be literally no penalty for people disconnect often, as there are players withthousandsof disconnects and people still play against them. Some people actually take pride in their disconnection frequencies now that they have no limit.Essentially, CC2 is concerned about punishing legitimate players who accidentally disconnect, however that's exactly what's happened now; I'm still getting disconnects just like someone who ragequits. If they would just give disconnecters a loss and, or heck, even JUST give the other player a win, then nobody would be bothered by disconnections at ALL.But not all multiplayer must be online - The offline multiplayer is fantastic. All of the tournament features are available for offline use, and with addition of Full Burst; there are plenty of challenging missions which actually net you some nicely-made wallpapers. Each battle has unique stipulations, which further begs the question of why they didn't include them in the tournament mode.Another unforseen but very welcome addition only possible due to the PC port is the inclusion of mods. Sadly is there no official support for mods - yet (wink wink) - however the community has still managed to bring some incredible content to the table, such as unlocking characters that were once unplayable and actually caused CC2 to recieve a bit of backlash for not including. There are new costumes, new stages, new characters, new movesets, you name it.Sadly that's where the good news stops when it comes to the PC port. On launch, the game was plagued with a terrible bug that rendered the online mode nearly unplayable. It took a rather long time to fix, but it was eventually fixed. There were also many crashes during the story mode, however one still remains as of writing this. It appears that CC2 is eager to co-operate with its community though so I expect that these issues shan't persist forever.Another problem were the very high system requirements. Although understandable for such a stunning and complex engine, it was rather disappointing to many people that the game simply couldn't run, especially due to the very little amount of graphical settings available to the user.With that being said, here is my conclusion;+ Brilliant graphics.+ Perfect OST+ Faithful to the anime+ Very easy to pick up and play+ Huge and active fanbase+ Mountains of content of all kinds+ Community-driven developers- PC port was rather disappointing- Too much focus on a ""balanced"" online mode which didn't end up being balanced, often at the sacrifice of other, much more enjoyable features- No official support for mods despite a thriving modding community- poorly optimisedOverall, I love this game, and this series. I have put thousands of combined hours into the entire series on PC and consoles.There are definitely glaring issues or places where they could've really put some work in and made something incredible, however everything else that is expected of the STORM series is met in spades. I cannot wait for the next STORM game and can only pray that CC2 keep up their level of community interactivity and keep on improving on constructive feedback."

I felt ripped off when I was in the launcher, as I there are only two graphical options, no default keyboard config(many ppl recommend to play this game with a controller). After I got a good keyboard config(guide made by ThillinaC), I launched the game, hoping to find my moneys worth. After the prologue, my feelings about this game turned 180 degrees. I wasn't a Naruto fan, but the story of the game won me over. I wasn't a fan of fighting games, but now I have more of those in my wishlist.This game isn't a good PC port, but it has the steady 30 FPS, so you can enjoy this game that it's better than most expect. Like every fighting game, there are a ton of characters with different unlockable skins, each one with their unique moves. Even tough you'll most likely end up with picking favourites, picking random characters will show you that each character can win if you have the skill. The battles aren't about tactics as much as about timing, as the controls are the same for everyone, just the way the characters execute the commands is different, which makes every character interesting.The story is so good that it makes the game deserve an underrated tag. For me it's up there with games like Mass  Effect, since I've experienced many emotional impacts and catharsis throughout the game. It's all about the kid who turns out to be the hero that inspires five nations to believe in themselves again and fight the war to prove the opponent that peace in this world can be. The story can turn out to be enough to get a person out of depression.There's also free roam and the sense of exploration brings many rewards. The missions can be replayed, along many bonus ones. There are a lot of extra battles, like tournaments and mission challanges, that make wallpapers be available for the desktop.It's a great game, both in quality and quantity, but it's also a bad port. I won't complain about the graphics, but some texture models could have used an improvement. 9.3 is the score for the game and I(along many fans) look forward for the next game and every naruto game that comes after it(that's how much of a fan this game has made me)"

,Recommended,234670,13055592,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,Chance,"Best Naruto game ever. Way better than the new one, way better than the previous one. I highly recommend it. You don't really have to be at episode 200 in shippuden to watch. If you plan on watching shippuden, I would start this game around the arc where the five kage meet, but if you don't plan on watching shippuden and just playing this game, this game is amazing. It does a good job of summing up everything if you haven't watched the anime or read the magna. This game managed to manipulate the fillers that everyone hated and turn them into something with very powerful emotions. Recommend that you watch the first 120 episodes of Naruto (not shippuden) before you play this game at a very minimum, though.10/10"
,Recommended,234670,17028759,"Posted: 13 July, 2015",all,tjtheturtleisawesome,"Time for a long essay about this game because that's just how awesome this is.NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is a game based on the manga/anime franchise Naruto (obviously). Since this is the 3rd game, it starts the story in the middle so if you haven't played the other games (I haven't) but you have read/watched the entire series, it's all good. This game just goes on the story from the part right before the Great Ninja War. If you are a Naruto fan, this is a guaranteed ""You'll like this"" game for you.The game is a 3D style fighting game and you go can either go through the story to fight the battles that happened in the manga in the game. The one thing I like about this is that everytime a battle starts, it starts on the normal difficultly, but if you are having trouble with that battle and lost over three times, the difficultly gets lowered. I really liked that, caused me not to get stuck on certain battles.The cutscenes are animated 3D models, and that is pretty amazing how they made them look beautiful with models, at the same level as RWBY, which is probably the best 3D animation(anime?) ever. The characters and voices were great (I think they used the same ones from the anime) and matched the story of Naruto overall.There is one section of the game where you can play as Naruto's pregant mom and that part really cracked me up. Another thing is that everytime you buy ramen from the ramen guy in town, all your health and chakra gets restored. THE RAMEN IS MAGIC!!!!This game is supposed to be on XBOX controllers but the PC version is also great, but has some problems. There are glitches in the game. Sometimes theres one battle that just causes the game to crash, or one specific move that will cause the game to crash. This is one of the reasons why I never actually completed the entire story within the game. One of the last battles during the Great Ninja War would keep crashing, so I gave up. (I already know what happens anyway)I suppose one of the things I didn't like was the spread of save points. Some save points would be placed 2 minutes of each other while others are 2 hours from each other. That was one of the cons of this game since I can't play games in a marathon and I don't think I am the only one.Overall, this game has its ups and downs but is a great game. It's also pretty long and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading this long essay. ^-^"
,Recommended,234670,8991146,"Posted: 5 February, 2014",all,Doop: No Red Bars.,"The story mode itself is wonderful, the giant boss battles is fun, and in each battle they give you an option for Hero or Legend, giving some different fight scenarios which makes it fun to go back and redo the fight.In the Full Burst edition, they're supposed to have Directors Cut cutscenes in story, but it looks exactly like the same thing from the first version of Storm 3, on the compare videos, they actually look worse to me.Full Burst also gives the majority of all the DLC characters for free from the first Storm 3 game, except the Pre-order Goku outfit, and you can't get Hokage Naruto, however you get a new mission mode, which adds 100 missions to the game but... it's nothing worthwhile.Free Battle fights on the highest difficulty can actually be somewhat a challenge too, but some of the AI just spams to reinact online mode, even though the combos in this game is so easy to do, however you can make your own combos (sorta) in the game and do some heavy damage but doing that is can make the game harder.Online mode is so flawed that everyone just spams jutsus, and if they lose... they'll leave the match, and no, they don't get any penality for it. Most of the people you find online anyway, will probably have a poor connection anyway, making the game very hard to play.The online mode is pretty much only fun if you have friends who have this game too and you can get mods to make the game even better like... combo customization, unlock characters that shouldn't be playable, model swaps, and texture changes.I recommend this game to:- Those who want to play the great story mode- Looking for a simple combat system that is creative and can get complex- Who want to play online with friends- If you want to play with modsSome problems:- The Story mode at the end is not canon (It's not the true ending).- Free Battle is missing some characters that should be there.- Online mode is incredibly laggy.- There is no penality against people who disconnect or 'ragequit' before they lose.- The community is awful, everyone does the same thing, spamming jutsus and choosing overpowered support.Suggestions in the future for Naruto to CC2:- Stay canon obviously, why would they think that doing a fake ending was good? It'll only cause confusing in the next game.- Include every character that is fought in the story mode, now I'm not meaning giants from boss battles but...The Edo Kage, The 7  Swordsmen, Dark Naruto, Edo Sasori, Gin and Kin should all be in the game.- Also, put more customzation into the game, looking through the files of the game, I found that you could swap jutsus and ultimate jutsus without having to choose the certain character, just like in the older games of Naruto.If I want to play as Anbu Itachi and have Fireball, I should be able to, the jutsu shouldn't be locked to a certain outfit."

,Recommended,234670,7481143,"Posted: 25 October, 2013",all,NOGAMES,"I'll start by saying that my only real prior experience of this series comes from the first game which I played on PS3 and very much enjoyed. That said I can't comment on how true it remains to the story in the manga or anime or whatever. Yet, it delivers a stunning movie like experience that rivals that of games like Metal Gear Solid and the Yakuza series. The attention to graphical detail is top notch and I've encountered very very few graphical errors which is pretty impressive for a console port. Going back to the cinemographic experience, the game is locked at 30 FPS in order to maintain the feel of the anime and even so it plays really smooth.The gameplay itself is more reminiscent of a button mashy beat-em-up or more like one of the Dragon Ball Z fighting games than a true fighter. However, there is definitely a little bit of skill involved in managing your chakra and substitutions in on-line battles. Right now the on-line seems hit or miss. Some people can't connect to me at all, however with one person I played 10 matches without a single error and no major latency issues. Hopefully a patch will be deployed to fix the on-line issues. Single player vs cpu versus is available in addition to a local 2 player versus. The single player story mode starts off exciting, hits some slow points, then gets pretty good again and held my attention.Overall, as someone who is not a typical fan of the series I can highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy something not typically found on PC. It is easily one of the best looking games I've played in a while.9/10"

If you like anime, you'll love this stuff, it almost ís an interactive anime.Great over-the-top ""ultimate"" attacks with matching over-the-top visuals to show it off, yeah, the fighting scenes really look nice...The combat controls take some getting used to, but when you get the hang of it you could win a fight in seconds. Mainly it's a 3d fighter, so if you're used to the 2d fighting games you'll have to learn some new tricks... No ducking from high attacks, but sidestepping frontal ones, and other such differences.Apart from fighting solo, you can also fight with a team, and summon teammates to stand ine way a bit, or launch team attacks. Which makes a fight look pretty busy the moment all 6 characters jump around on the field.The game consists of a Story mode, Free fight mode and online mode.The story stays true to it's nature, which is nice, the only drawback I guess is that it's either full of spoilers if you really want to read/watch the manga/anime, or you end up skipping most of the cutscenes because you already know what's next.There's also a few boss battles that require QTE's. Oddly enough they kind of make sense with the motion, rather than throwing random button inputs in your face, but they do detract a little from the action scenes going on. Either way, don't worry about normal battles throwing a QTE in halfway.After completing the story there's a few extra quests to do and roam a bit around a few locations of the story.Free fight has a survival mode which is nice to test skills with. And also has a mission mode, setting a few extra fighting conditions like losing power, getting poisoned by enemy attacks etc. Ofcourse there's also the mandatory quick battle.Online Multiplayer seems to be a hit'n miss with lag, as with most of these fighting games... I guess getting a second controller and sticking to local multiplayer would be the best idea as long as internet can't catch up to these games.Or make sure you know who you're playing with and both have a decent connection to play this stuff."

It's not really a stretch to say that this game expects its players to be familiar with its universe. Taking place fairly far along into the series' second major story arc, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 jumps right into the story. The game does a good job of introducing characters and events, but I wouldn't be surprised if some people new to the series were to get a little lost in all of the terms and introductions.The story mode is very custcene heavy. These cutscenes feel almost like they were extracted directly from the anime, which serves for a pretty cool and authentic experience. This is strengthened with the presence of the series' well-known music, which plays throughout the game's story and further immerses the player. However, similar to the anime, these cutscenes can be drawn-out at times, testing the patience of its audience. While there is always the option to skip these cutscenes, one should be aware that the game's story mode sometimes expects the player to be sitting for up to nearly ten minutes at a time, watching the story unfold like a movie, with little to no interaction.Visually, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is very colorful and exciting. The cel-shaded graphics do an excellent job of capturing the aesthetic of the anime, really helping to bring the ninja world to life. Throughout the cutscenes and in-game environments, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 blends animated graphics with detailed illustration, providing a seamless picture that looks like it was taken straight from the anime.Additionally, the animations of all the characters are very fluid and nice. General movement and specific fighting styles are all unique among characters and do an excellent job of giving each character personality. While the combat system itself is not remarkably deep, it still feels great to see and play as some of your favorite ninja, with most of the playable ninjas having their own unique style.One thing about Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 that fails to impress is the multitude of mini-games and forgettable mechanics that the game tries to implement and then quickly discards.The game does this multiple times with several different mechanics, introducing different mini-games that appear once in a level, never to make another appearance for the rest of the game. The fairly common introduction of insignificant mechanics lowered the game's overall quality for me, being a common but nonetheless painful mistake made by all sorts of games.However, outside of the story mode, these mechanics are not present and do not affect the fun of the game's actual versus modes.Aside from the story, there is also challenge missions which challenge the player to complete fights under certain conditions. Along with the multitude of unlockables, these challenge missions do a great job of adding to the game's replay value.EDIT: Since beating the game's story mode about a week ago, I've played more of the challenge missions and done some of the side quests that are left over after the main story. They're actually really enjoyable and give you more opportunities to interact with your fellow ninjas, which is pretty cool. There's also a lot to explore - it surprised me how many places you can go after you finish the story! It does a great job of adding to the game's playability after the story mode! :DThough Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 does nothing to revolutionize the fighting game genre, I highly recommend this game to fans of the series. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 stands as a solid fighting game in its own right, but the greatest appeal it has to offer is the way it brings the beloved Naruto universe to life."

Combat is improved but i would like to see more of a all around character than having lets say naruto in different modes like sage mode regular etc. Also alot of the side quest are boring and pointless and too much filler grinding side activities like the bandai store that sells cards which are pointless to buy.

There is also a storymode (that I still have to play) and a very nice multiplayer with your own customized profile card. This game is well-balanced, since I could win with Zabuza from the Hokages and the Sannins easily. Also very fun to play this with friends or random online people. The hours I played is mostly the hours from local and online battle. It still didn't get boring.Art-style/GraphicsIt looks like your very own trusted Naruto.

You can walk around the battlefield freely while fighting the opponent. There is also a substitution system in this game, which lets you transport most of the time behind the enemy, however there is a limit to doing that which is 4. After that, it recharges after an amount of time. Furthermore if you ever get beat down, you can use your awakening to try to take the lead again. Some characters have the ability to awaken whenever you want (at the cost of your *chakra) and other characters get the ability to awaken when a certain amount of health is left. The 2nd awakening is mostly more powerful too.*Chakra = it's a system where chakra stands for the energy your character has left. You can charge your chakra whenever you want in the battle and use it for quick dashes, ninjutsu** and your ultimate jutsu***.**Ninjutsu = if you want to deal more damage than just hitting the opponent, all characters have a special kind of attack to offer, called ninjutsu. For example, some characters like 'Itachi' can shoot a fireball.***Ultimate Jutsu = You are able to do the ultimate jutsu when your chakra fills up to 75% - 80% of your chakra bar. If you hit the opponent with your ultimate jutsu, the opponent will have a big part of his health bar reduced."

,Recommended,234670,23058331,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,QuVoG,"STORY:To those that have watched the anime, the game starts off after Naruto defeats Pain and ends off with a fight with Tobi and the rest of the tailed beast, but his true identity was not yet revealed. Should you watch the anime first before playing the game? Ideally, yes. The Naruto STORM franchise basically caters to fans of Naruto in cases where one can simply skip one of the first few games and jump right to the latest STORM series and still be immersed in the story. This is especially so for us steam players, where only STORM 3 and 4 are available, but not the earlier STORM series.GAMEPLAY:Gameplay is very smooth and I personally feel that the fights are very fluid. Each character has their own unique jutsu (spells), thus making it more interesting to play each of the many playable characters to witness it, along with a short unique scene if you defeat your opponent with your ultimate jutsu. Not to mention that there are different combos that each character can use. Would definitely suck if there is only 1 attacking combo :(After you have completed the story mode, there is a free roam gameplay where you can roam to different villages and complete missions for achievements. However, one flaw of the free roam gameplay is that there isn’t a menu that lists the available missions. Only a few missions are available on the get go and the rest will only activate after you have completed a particular mission or fulfilled a certain criteria. I would find myself constantly referring to guides to figure out what and where are the available missions I can do so that I would avoid wasting my time running around aimlessly. It would also be nice if the free roam gameplay is a little bit more interactive, like being able to climb up walls with chakra, jump across huge gaps, and maybe beat up some random shinobis whenever I felt like it. This could be felt mostly during the story mode, where free roam gameplays simply just felt like filler to extend the overall gameplay time since all you can do is just run to your next destination. Well, I guess that it isn't Naruto anymore if there aren’t any fillers :pAnyway, I'm sure that most of the people here are more concerned about the 30fps cap. In my opinion, I felt that there is no need to have the cap raised as it has the same native fps as the anime. With this configuration, it felt familiar to those that have watched the anime. Furthermore, the fps of the game does not dip for me, giving a very stable fps of 27-30. In the beginning, I too was concerned about the 30fps cap. I mean, most games that I've played have fps above 60, but I eventually got used to it and felt that it wasn't really much of an issue that would stop me from enjoying the game.However, at certain instances, the animation videos doesn't sync with the audio. It isn't really much of an issue since it only happens once or twice, but would definitely be nice if it is fixed.GRAPHICS:The graphical quality and art of the game is beautiful in my opinion. During the free roam gameplay, you are able to explore some of the villages like the Sand village. In between each village, you can witness the several breath taking landscapes unique to each of the villages. There are cases where I would simply just stare at the background of the game for several minutes :pEven though I'm using a NVIDIA NVS 5200M, which is a business oriented graphic card, I am still able to play the game with a stable fps. This would be good news to those that are not using a gaming laptop.ACHIEVEMENTS:Achievements are relatively easy to get since you can simply replay a particular fight to get an S rank by going to the menu. Some fights may be challenging, but looking up guides will definitely make you feel otherwise. The only tedious part of the achievement process is the one where you have to complete 50 mission battles. Other than that, getting all the achievements isn’t that hard.PRICE:Is the game worth getting at full price? Yes. In my opinion, spending around $39.90 to entertain myself for more than 30 hours sounds pretty good to me.  However, if you’re willing to wait and not in a rush to play the game, I would recommend to just wait for an offer since the game usually goes on a discount of 75% every few months or maybe more in the future."

It includes revamped graphics, all the costumes released as DLC, new character and a new Story chapter and Challenge mode. It is a fighting game developed by CyberConnect2.Story: The story of UNS 3 closely follows the Naruto Shippuden anime and takes place during the Fourth Great Ninja War. I don't wanna give too much away so I'll leave it at that. Having said that, the story is told really well using in-game cutscenes. Each chapter is presented in such a way that closely resembles the anime and while watching the cutscenes, you are even fooled to think that you are actually watching an episode of Naruto. Each cutscene has high production values with great graphics, voice acting and dynamic and over-the-top camera angles.Graphics: The game employs cell-shaded graphics for its characters and environments. I think this is a good choice as the visuals depict the anime fantastically, with characters and special attacks (jutsus) rendered at a very high quality. The game looks stunning at the highest graphical settings and no jagged edges are present anywhere.Sound: Each scream, attack and catchphrase delivered by the original Japanese voice actors sound great. They give performances worthy of an anime episode and each cutscene just feels like you are watching the TV show. When the voice actors convey anger, you feel that anger. When they convey sadness, you also feel that sadness. Those are the signs of experienced and talented artists.Gameplay: The gameplay of Naruto is fast, frantic and alot of fun. It is easy to pick up and play by anyone, as you can immediately mash the B button for a combo or press Y and B together to do a jutsu attack. The controls are laid out well on the controller and they feel intuitive to reach for and press. The LT button (on the Xbox 360 controller) has been cleverly used for performing Substitutions while LB is used to block. The easy to memorise layout of the controls add to the fun of the gameplay.Overall, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is a faithful rendition of the anime it is inspired by. The characters look, act and sound like their anime counterparts and the gameplay is addictive.8.5/10."

A bit of a design flaw if you ask me.And before you say ""Just turn down the volume on your computer"", the reason I'm complaining about this is because it makes it extremely difficult to talk to people while playing. Because during a fight, and even just scrolling through the game mode select screen, the game is all you can hear."

It's one of those rare animes that really reach deep into your core. This game is a beautiful tribute to the Naruto anime that takes you back to the reconstruction of the Leaf after the fight with Pain up to the fight with Tobi and the Tailed Beasts.What I love about this game:+ Beautiful graphics+ Very satisfying fighting mechanics+ Sticks to the Naruto story well and accurately+ Online/multiplayer batteling+ So many characters to choose to fight as+ You don't just fight as Naruto, you fight as other characters as well+ Cutscenes: there are a lot, and sometimes are long. If you can't stand long cutscenes you have the option to skip them (I did not)+ Some fights challenged youCons (for some people but not for me in some cases):- Some of the fights got waaayy too tough (which is fine) and they give you the option to heal but it lowers the rank you recieve. Some fights you just have to heal or you won't win. However, you won't get higher than a D.- Does sometimes get intense on my computer. If you can't stand fps drops make sure your specs are good enough to play (they didn't bug me too much but at times it was annoying)- 30 fps lock (again, not an issue for me)This game is a tad pricey but it's worth it. The main story will take aomewhere around ~18 hours. If you are a huge Naruto fan like I am, this game is a must have."

But, I never really thought much out of a fighter game, even naruto-based game like this would be PC worthy. Well, I was wrong. It has sparked the Naruto fan inside me, even thought I was a big fan of it before. I loved this show then and kinda fell off after a while because they had a new artist change the entire look of naruto. But, I felt I should put it aside and play the game. The storyline is breathtaking, that might be a level of nerd that people aren't necessarily suppose to expose. But, it truly is one of the best storylines put into a game if you haven't watched the series. Please, if you want a single player game this is the way to go.ALSO, KEY INFORMATION: If you don't have a controller, then this game will be dramatically less fun if you play it. Put the time and effort into getting a controller. It's super simple and costs less than the game itself. Especially since Xbox and Playstation are moving to the new console controllers. Go to google shops and or just best buy and they can sell you one, honestly cheaper than the game.Lastly, I highly recommend this game to all my friends and gaming peers. It's well worth the time and money. However, the multiplayer I can not recommend because I don't play multiplayer on this game."

When the connection is clean, the game runs without a hitch, but when the connection chugs you'll feel it in both delay and the occaisional ""Transmitting Data"" popup for a moment. The gameplay flow makes laggy matches far from unplayable as there really isn't any urgency with your inputs or strict timing, but it's still an inconvenience when things slow down.The single player story in this game shines bright, between the gorgeous graphics and the well written story (granted, it's yoinked from the show/manga, still a solid story), it's just a good experience. Also it's long. VERY. LONG. In a good way.Overall, I'd say this game is worth a pickup for both fighting gamers and fans of the series alike. Just don't try to fight players outside of your region online."

So I won't waste my breath here regurgitating all the much-deserved praise this game has already received for being a beautiful and fantastic story and its masterful art. You already know that you want this game, and you already know that you will love it. All you want to know now is really: Should I go invest in a controller? Will my computer run this?The answer is yes and no. Yes you MUST invest in a controller for this game, there is no way around it. Get yourself something you'll be comfortable, I use my 360 controllers, because this isn't the only game you'll ever need one for. And the 2nd answer is no, because this game is a port it's uber poorly optimized. I have a 1200p monitor and I was extremely confident in my PC running the game full resolution with 2x anti-aliasing. Quickly my PC told me to go ♥♥♥♥ myself because YES - THIS IS APPARANTLY HARDER TO RUN THAN BATTLEFIELD 4! So - this being a fighting game and all - you are shooting for 60 solid fps, so you will need to turn your resolution down to 720p and don't even bother with that anti-aliasing crap.Still on the same topic - the game looks fantastic no matter what, just do everything in your power to keep it ~60fps because if you don't then the animations will all slow down accordingly (30 fps will slow the game down to 1/2 the speed). Just trust me - this will look much sharper on your PC than your console even in 720p with no anti aliasing and that actually made it a more enjoyable experience and worth picking it up a 2nd time!"

It's not really an entry level story if you're not familiar with the anime but it's a fun game nonetheless.There are a few issues with voices syncing with the lips but it may just be because of the native japanese and the requirement for multi language support.

,Recommended,234670,10728236,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Halflight,"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is the update release of Ninja Storm 3 and it's a fighting game with some RPG elements that follows closely the story of the second part of the Naruto Shippuden manga series till its most recent chapters.The main beef of the game is its story mode: you can do some free roaming in the world of Naruto while taking part in the most important battles from the series, collect items and clear some side quests too. In story mode there are either normal battles or boss battles, with unusually strong opponents who need advanced strategies and some QTEs to be defeated. The RPG elements of Ninja Storm 3 comes into play regarding some ""ultimate decisions"" you can make in certain battles (which can change the way some encounters are played) and the items you can equip and use in battle (some of them being able to heal you, others to boast your stats, others to depower your opponent, ...). The game follows the series' main plot very closely, sometimes even expanding upon some specific events (and always for the better). The only downside of the story mode is the enemies AI, which leaves them wide open to exploits, making several battles rather easy (with the exception of later bosses).Ninja Storm 3 is a solid fighting game with some unique and interesting features: you can use a substitution technique in battle to escape an opponent's attack and get him easily (althought the technique works only with a set of charges that aren't always ready); you can summon a maximum of two supporting characters to either protect you, attack your enemy or pull of powerful combination moves; you can use ultimate awakening modes if low on health to gain the upper hand.Ninja Storm 3 features also a multiplayer battle mode and a free battle mode, which are made very entertaining by the high number of playable characters and combinations of them you can make.The Full Burst expansion comes with updated graphics, a challenge mode that requires you to beat a series of battles with specific conditions and a short new bonus story chapter, ""Brothers reunited"", which pits you against a new bonus boss, Sage Kabuto.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is both a great game for Naruto fans (who will surely appreciate its many details coming from the series proper) and an entertaining title for who is just looking for a fun fighting game"

There are many character choices ( bascially all the significant characters in the naruto story line). One the features I really enjoyed is battling multiple enimies at once; although still very easy, it inroduced a fun and new aspect of the game. I personally have had no problems with multiplayer, and had a really fun time fighting other players. I barely suffer any lag, even when the opponents connection is low.

But in my suggestion i liked this alot better than the anime. Even though there were alot of cutscenes and Quick Time Events (which i do love in this game.) The game had so much emotion in the game that will make u feel depressed or sad in some ways.The only flaw i would say in this game (If people have a xbox controller then your one lucky mofo) is that you have to setup your own keybindings for the game.Usually people who don't have or seen a xbox controller would be REALLY confused and there is no tutorial to exactly know what the controls are (unless you look at your setting controls or when u press start to see the buttom mechanics.) that will be fustrating also for alot of people. But after a 30+ i got used to the controls so well (Using Keyboard)and the movement is smooth and fluid, also it's fine with the keyboard(but i would recommend people to use the xbox controller if you do have a controller O.o). Other than that the game is pretty fun.Mostly the multiplayer is pretty much the main potentiol of the game and it's characters. The only problem i have witht he multiplayer is if the host is either lagging or has some horrible internet, it will infect u while your trying to fight the person in a 1v1 match.I would rate this game 9/10. Just bc i am a huge Naruto Fan and the game is fun even though i watched the anime/manga I am kinda glad they have this game on PC other than xbox or ps3."

All the events in the game have been covered in the anime already, so people who watch the anime will have no problem following the plot. People who are new to Naruto should probably read up on the events leading up to this game.Gameplay:I played Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 (UNS 3) after having finished Revolution and Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (UNS 4), and if you want the best gameplay then going for the newer games (especially UNS 4) might be better. UNS 3 isn't abadfighting game by any means, but if you don't really care about the story mode there isn't really any reason why you should get this game over the other ones.Another minor complaint I have about this game is that it did feel like there was a lot more running around in between missions in this game compared to the other ones. And running around wasting time is not fun.Graphics:The graphics are good. Very anime-ish, just like a Naruto game should be. Yes, the game is locked at 30 fps, so if that is a deal breaker for you then you should pass on this game.Music:Music taken straight out of the anime. Characters sounding just like they do in the anime. What more could you want?Overall:A good fighting game that any Naruto-fan will get a lot of enjoyment out of. However, if you want to play the (in my opinion) currently best Naruto game on Steam you should probably get UNS 4 first. After finishing that game, if you still want more story then this game is a good choice, while if you want a different fighting mode (orb collection) then you might want to get Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution instead. Or, you can do like me, and get them all. They are all good games.NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM RevolutionReviewNARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4Review"

It takes forever to load parts of the game and I'm unsure why, when much more complex games that actually need a loading screen take about a quarter of the time.I wasn't expecting a lot, its a fighting game... those are something you play with a stick and buttons or a controller... but this is terrible."

This game brings some interesting additions to combat system which makes the game far more enjoyable and less frustriating while playing online against move spammers. There hardly is any noticable graphical change between this and previous part. But nevertheless its an amazing game that will keep you occupied for hours. The storyline is very touching if you are fan of the series otherwise it might seem very stretched and over dramatic at places. The Tailed beast fights are rather dull and camera angles are sometimes problematic. The boss fights are as epci as always giving you the feel like you are controlling the main character. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Naruto storm series, this game is very enjoyable and will keep you busy for hours.side notes:On weaker machines or laptops this game tends to lag when in local player vs player mode,no problem if you use anything with i3 + processor or higher(pc/laptop only related)Playing on keyboard is not the best but this is probably for any fighter game I strongly recommend a xbox360 controller for pc users."

These guys will maybe give you a hard time but with them you will be able to really learn the basics.Also the internet connection/ lag can occur quit often, though you will quickly find someone that doesnt lag and hey just add them to your friends list.

All that fighting and action is totally awesome BUT if you dont know a thing about naruto i.e. if you dont follow anime or manga the cutscenes and the story will be tediously boring. You will fell that the charcter keep blabbering on and on as if you were listening to your history teacher in the class whos talking in slow motion . Mind you the combined time required to see all the cutscenes is more than 7 hours (that might be more than the gameplay time if skip the cutscenes) ! Whereas most games have a total of 2-3 hrs (even the game of the name is soo long) . You will be vexed out out of pure boredom if you watch the cutscenes without any knowledge about anime or manga of naruto. So if you have no interest in naruto i suggest you skip all the cutscenes and enjoy the thrill of this breathtaking fighting game . However if you wish to see the cinemtic the i suggest you first follow up on narutos anime and manga on the net. This formidable game feature a colossal number of perplexing characteres and fighting moves.... i didnt even know what a jutsu is before i played this game. I thereby conclude by saying that ""Naruto Shippuden ultimate ninja storm burst 3 : full burst""( is there a half burst?) is simply astoshing and bewildering even though the cinemtaic is too long ."

Но что для фанатов радость, то недоумение для новичков, и оно не удивительно, ведь распутать хитросплетенные сюжетные нити, которые в оригинальной манге затянулись аж с 1999 года, будет ой как не просто. Однако новичкам стоит понять, кто плохой, а кто добрый, и все остальное приложится само собой (прим.: глядишь, может кто проникнется духом серии и познакомится со всеми персонажами прочитав мангу). Новая часть серии повествует о четвертой мировой войне синоби (прим.: ниндзя) и разработчики из CyberConnect2 прекрасно её пересказывают. Время от времени от заумных разговоров все скатывается в сцены, которые сопровождаются QTE элементами, и всё то действие, что происходит на экране, можно описать как буйство красок и эффектов, но все это не режет глаз, а наоборот радует. И к слову, пережить эти радости вам предстоит не раз и не два, а великое множество, ведь большая их часть как раз таки сосредоточена в боях.Каждое удачно выполненное комбо вызывает бурю радостных эмоции, а контратака начинающаяся с подмены тела (прим.: при нажатии определенной кнопки, любой боец умеет перемещаться за спину противника) превращает поединок в соревнование на скорость реакции и сообразительности. В отличий от других файтингов, здесь это самые важные навыки.Все комбинации ударов одинаковы для всех персонажей. Это снижает порог вхождения, так как вам не придется заучивать зубодробительные комбо сутки напролёт. Но есть и одно ""но"", каждый боец имеет такие особенности, как скорость атаки, её дальность, количество чакры (прим.: аналог энергетической шкалы для спецприемов) и многое другое, и эти особенности предстоит изучить.В заключении хотелось бы сказать, что эта игра способна увлечь на довольно продолжительное время, и будет интересна не только фанатам серии, но и тем, кто видит эту серию файтингов впервые."

And since i don't owe any consoles (except for a PS2), i was over-excited to finally skip the Dolphin's Wii emulatons; the PSP imitations, and play it for real. At first, i thought it would be great, since i didn't expect to play online. And boy, was i right about that.I do'nt have any console controllers, but i managed to make my way through with the keyboard (i literally imitated Mister Sheen: WINNING!), and i felt great until i had pretty much unlocked everything. It soonly started to get boring on SP, so i tried MP. A sad thought crossed my mind after seeing the game have a bad transmission. But still, i could just keep playing with bots, so it was a very small setback.What keeps my addicted until this day, is a very simple, and perhaps unexpected thing: The Community.But not the raging quitters, the trolls, the spammers, or the IA Abusers (Neji, i'm looking at you). It was the modders. Modders like ""wajinshu"" in youtube, doing the first few mods for the game. Mostly Texmods, but sonly started the character swaps. Typhonua, who made some of the best swaps, not leaving much to be missed about it. Ultimate OmbuStorm for his awesome moveset mods, and many others. So yes, i'm stuck in this game, FOREVER, not because of the internet. Not because of most players. Because it's my favorite anime. Because it's worth it. And although it is a bit over-priced, i can't help it but be thankful for the guys who managed to mod it so much, everything is now accessible to us. Literally, EVERYTHING. Goku costume, Hokage Costumes, new Movesets, New Rosters. There's been thousands of mods, many of which are great, and that's what has been keeping me in here all this time.If you're a big Naruto fan, i'm sure you'll like to buy this.If you can't afford it, then i think i know what you'll end up doing.

Even if you don't like naruto or anime isn't your thing in general then you shouldn't be disheartened because you'll still definitely enjoy the game. The fighting style is very good and unique and you can do some pretty sick moves. The story line is very detailed and not hard at all to understand (Although you should probably read or find out what's happened in the anime before the game's storyline. The game is awesome and a lot better than a lot of the other naruto games in the series, because they have improved the graphics a lot and you can do team ultimate finishers too. Compared to the normal ninja storm 3, full burst has some really amazing graphics in comparison and they have done a very good job of improving the game. They have added new cutscenes and about 100 more missions for the player to complete after completing the main story.BAD :( The developers are still trying to bring out several different updates for the game becuase online doesn't work very well, its playable but it glitches a lot. Secondly it's highly recommended to use a gamepad, or you can still use the 'ol keyboard but a mouse isn't compatible with the game (which really fudgin sucks!)Finally, they have bought out some new characters that weren't in the other games but they should keep some of the old ones too."

For those of you who are fighting game fanatics I suggest looking at gameplay first before jumping in just in case the mechanics are your thing.The only thing I can say needs improvement is the lip sync for the english voices is still pretty off. I know it's synced to the original japanese audio but I feel it could have been edited to fit the english voice. Hell it's like that for multiplayer.Regarless this is still a great game. Defintly worth the wait."

But seriously, the single player mode is pretty good, even if it is a railroad of cutscenes, limited environments outside of battle and scripted fights every now and then.

,Recommended,234670,7748693,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Linty 👀,"Overall this game is extremely good from a standpoint of how fun it is, when it works. With ongoing issues coming up with the server, in put lag, the still not yet defeated transmission errors,  and in my opinion a faulty connection system. This game is one of my favorites even along side all these issues, and within the month I've had it, my play time has surpassed everything  except Dota 2. Passing Borderlands 2, Terraria, and Skyrim. This game is extremely fun, and fluid fighting game who defines itself in it's own personal touch. Regardless of having a single 'attacking' ability this game still manages to maintain a decently high skill cap whereas you won't see a player who is obviously more inexperienced than you taking games off of you for silly things, while it is usually the case that doesn't disregard the fact that it is easily possible.Along with the the fun gameplay comes obnoxious mechanics that have extremely low skill cap and can remove  a lot of the fun from the match, with awakenings like susanoo and fuu to obnoxious characters with Instant awakening resets like Asuma or Neji. In the end, i'll recieve more anguish from losing an obviously won match to a silly awakening or such than dominating a strong playe.While this game has it's issues with server and silly low skill cap easily accessible mechanics, I still recommend this game due to, while being short, maintaining an extremely fun story line and when working fun  multiplayer combat. I feel if CC2 provides proper patching this game could be more than just 'good'. ^^"

Fights are dynamics, different options of combos and few ninjutsus (too few, but how do you wanna code multiple on one character, no wonder there are 4 naruto and sasuke..), use of items, tournament (only fun if online works), sweet visual, and a GREAT story mode, that reproducts pretty nicely the manga (aside of some obsolete fights).I'm not really upset to have buy it full price; understand this is a great fighting game for any Naruto fans, but they really have to do something with the online transmission issue, cause the fun is specially here.I hope and expect a patch, and will wait for Naruto Shippuden UNS Revolution coming out in the next few months."

At first the game seems like it is all button mashing because there are no arcade-style button combos to put in, but it is not! Timing and managing your substitutions is critical otherwise you will be crushed by a more skilled player.The storymode is great in this game. All of the critical scenes in Shippuden are re-enacted for the most part, and the cinematic battles are great.Most people probably care about Online Mode the most though, so I'll put a good bit of my thoughts in here too:The fun you will have Online depends on who you play with. The netcode can be spotty with this game, as I've had it drop inputs playing with someone who lives in the same town. The community can also be very frustrating, as you will see a lot of TenTen/Temari/Deidara spammers who are looking for stat-padding and spend the whole match throwing projectiles, or people who turn off assists to do infinite combos with Neji/Rock Lee.Eventually you will find people who aren't trying to cheese out the game though, and when you do, you will have lots of fun. I recommend building a list of friends who play this game and doing tournaments, as this game can be insanely fun when your opponent isn't spamming jutsus or using cookie-cutter teams.I haven't tried to play this game on the keyboard, I imagine it is dreadful, so make sure you bring your wired 360 controller before you buy.

If you're not a Naruto fan, but you're looking for a good Beat 'Em Up! game then maybe give this game a try. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 has no default controls for the keyboard, you'll have to manually set every corresponding key to the controller controls, HOWEVER you can search up various setups other players have put up which can make it alot more fluid to play. If you have a controller yourself however, then I'd recommend you'd use that.

With Full Burst, there is an excellent story, epic boss battles and 100% controller support. The fighting mechanics, the visual style, and the wide range of music and sounds help this game stand out from its siblings. I don't want to spoil any story related items but It's a well written and voiced story coupled with an excellent online mode and offline multiplayer.

The fights are beautifully animated and are accurately described as ""easy to learn, hard to master."" Though there are many cutscenes, I never found them obtrusive as quicktime events tended to be woven in most of them. If you really want to play a good naruto fighting game for once, and you're not a console player, I highly recommend this game.However, I did have some serious complaints. The game is poorly optimized to work on the PC, and personally, the game runs abysmally on my system, with entire fights taking place in slow motion with the audio sync of the japanese wire-fu movies of yore. Some people might not experience this issue, but I did, so I'm making note of it. Secondly, the online part of the game is utterly dysfunctional. Online, most players can expect 2/3 online matches to disconnect before anything really happens due to server-related issues. It's incredibly frustrating, and while the developers have promised improvement, we have so far seen only one patch that did not fix the issue.In short, if you don't care about the multiplayer much, and don't mind tinkering with your system to get the game to run as it would on a console, you'll probably have a blast with this game. However, if you wanted to play online against other people and/or you're still running a system similiar to mine (I'm running XP) you'll probably feel it's a waste of your money.*EDIT*In recent patches, the online segment of the game has actually been fixed... More or less. It's functional now, more often than not, and while not perfect, the multiplayer of the game is still very enjoyable."

Transmissions errors are all I have to say about online. The single player is phenominal and a cinematic beauty (though I miss Pain saying ""Shinra Tensei"" in Japanese). The final battle is extremely challenging and so are the challenge missions (obviously). Its a game I recommend, just don't expect a patch...EVER. THANKS A LOT NAMCO BANDAI/CYBER CONNECT 2 FOR THE LACK OF CARING ABOUT THIS GAME."

You still have to use and Controller but the story is great and the Battles are intense and its NARUTO come on it cant be a bad game. Just buy it is you like ether fighting games, Linear story and most of all NARUTO."
