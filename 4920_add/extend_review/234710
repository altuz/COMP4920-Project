Poker Night 2 allows you to play Texas Hold'em and Omaha with Sam, Brock, Claptrap and Ash. And to hear the sarcastic lines of science fiction's deadliest A.I., GLaDOS.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. While you are playing, you can complete quests to unlock Bounties. If you complete all four tasks, one of the characters will use an item to play. If you manage to beat that character you'll get a TF2 and Borderlands 2 item.Furthermore you'll earn chips that you can use to unlock special tables, decks and chips. The Inventory, the casino, will get a different appeance if you use a table, deck and chips of the same theme.I won't explain the rules of Omaha and Texas Hold'em, but i can tell you that this game is really awesome. While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €5. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want to get all decks, cards, tables and unlockable items, you will be staying at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100"

,Recommended,234710,18095588,"Posted: 19 September, 2015",all,Whiteswart,"A virtual poker game from the Telltale studio, with four characters from different titles, mingled together for your pleasure. And it gives you some items for Team Fortress AND Borderlands 2! Other good thing is what it is a relatively fast full-complete game, where you can get some basic poker skills, if you wasn't familiar with all that poker stuff before.Surprisingly, it is a second game! So I can't be helped but to compare it with the first chapter. Though before I'll drown in the collation, I'll give you some general info.As a virtual poker player simulator, this particular game have many flaws. You have to listen an idle talk of some weird NPC characters, and the most of that talking is amusing at best, and, the worst, it gets repetitive quite fast. To succeed in the game, you need to complete some ""goals"", which can be easily seen as dumb moves. Like struggling for the showdown with only the kicker card, without any combinations... So, eventually, you'll make that goal, but how many times you'll fail miserably in the process? Only Fortune knows.In short, Poker Night 2 almost non-recommended for normal poker game. If only you're not absolutely green in it, so you need a simplistic stuff for getting started.Now, to comparison with the first game:Like Brock (one of the characters there) saying: I guess it's one of those ""take the good with bad"" things...1) Characters. They are much less attractive than in the first game. Less talks (less lines, and especially good lines for every character), less of this ""friendly"" atmosphere, which was created by the predecessor. While I'm usually a big fan of Ash Williams from Evil Dead franchise, I really have to say that it was his worst appearance in the video games (and I've seen them all). Other opponents are also of almost no fun. Brock and Sam have maybe two or three funny lines each, and even Claptrap isn't that shiny thing to save the day.Worst of all, while trying to make them all a better players, Telltale wiseguys do not give them personal characteristics, behavioral patterns, which was a catchy feature of the first game.2) While failed miserably with characters, Telltale has improved other aspects of the game, like: fixed stability issues, added more skins to background, and more little features like ability to order some drinks to your partners, to weaken them... There are much more various music now, visual part is a way updated from the first game.That's more, there you can play not only in the basic Texas Hold'em, but in the Omaha variant of poker as well. Which is good for your poker skill and flexibility of your mind.3) So far it sounds like ""less talk, more action"" stuff, which may be good, if you Just Want to Play a Poker... But alas! For some evil reason they cutted the ability to skip all those fuzzy repetative talks. So, when Claptrap is looping and freezing in the first time, it is fun, sure. But after you hear him 10-20 times, you obviously will be wanting to skip that *beep*. No such luck.I summarize:It is not very good poker game, besides the fact it is easy to adapt and there are an Omaha variant as a plus to the classic hold'em. Play it, if you are getting the items for Tea Fortress or Borderlands 2, or collecting acheievements on gold. But if you are looking for an atmospheric and fun poker game, I suggest to play the first Poker Night game instead. It is better.My mark is 6.2/10."
,Recommended,234710,3998420,"Posted: 29 July, 2013",all,Rabbi Himself,"Rusty Venture used to sell faulty products to S-mart and apparently had a working relationship with Aperture founder Cave Johnson until his disappearance in the 1980s.That seemingly baffling sentence is a good test for gauging how likely you are to enjoy Poker Night 2. If you have no clue what I'm talking about, then it might be best to mosey on. However, if you recognize the references above and laugh at the very thought, then have a seat at the table.Like the original, your enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend greatly on how well acquainted you are with the different franchises showing up. The group is a little more eclectic this time around, pulling names from television and film as well as video games. You're now playing cards with Brock Samson, the kill-crazy bodyguard from Adult Swim's Venture Brothers, Claptrap the robot from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams, the cursed warrior from the Evil Dead film series, and Sam, Max's long-suffering talking dog detective partner. To top it off, GLaDOS from the Portal series has dropped in to act as dealer.There's at least as much dialogue as the first game had, and conceivably much more. Themed games (available once the player has unlocked a deck, chips, and table from the same franchise and activated them all at once) include exclusive conversations you wouldn't hear otherwise, and GLaDOS will often interrupt the players to ask if they could hurry up so she could get back to observing her tests. This is a far more volatile group than the original lineup. Brock has a temper that is always threatening to surface (especially when he loses a hand), while Claptrap and GLaDOS both make several remarks about killing humans. Ash seems rather calm, almost dazed, but he's just happy to be away from deadites for a couple hours. And Sam is the most level-headed of the group, even though Max is sitting in the booth behind him trying to throw him off his game.Poker Night 2 has loads of additional content, including a new game mode (Omaha Poker), unlockable decks, chips, and tables for each character that offer new dialogue and a complete redesign of the Inventory (the Sam and Max 25th anniversary set is my personal favorite), and 5 bounty items to collect, one from each player and GLaDOS. The unlocks are gained by spending Inventory tokens earned while playing, while the multitude of unlocks for both Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 get handed out when the player wins another player's bounty item. Unlike the first game, bounty items are not put up randomly, but made available when certain challenges are met in-game. Another change to the bounty mechanic has the item won once the player simply wins the tournament, rather than having to knock out the character who put it up. Cameos and in-jokes abound, some of them pretty freaking obscure. It's a treasure hunt for detail lovers.As before, there is the chance of dialogue repeating. Unfortunately, Telltale did not include a skip option this time around, for no discernible reason. Another letdown is the fact that Ash sounds nothing like himself. Nothing against the actor who voiced him, but why not try harder to get Bruce Campbell? It would've really added to the experience, especially when all the other characters are faithfully recreated down to the original voiceover.Still, this is a dirt cheap title with a fun premise and solid execution, and I for one would like to see it continue. I've even had fun just speculating with other fans online about who should be included in the next installment. If you're a fan of any of the properties that Poker Night 2 has brought together, or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you won't regret the purchase. Telltale Games has added more unlocks, more characters, and more dialogue, all for the same price. It's hard to beat such a deal."

I must admit, I was pretty ecstatic about this before release.This sequel to the original Poker Night at the Inventory combines the personalities of CL4P-TP from the Borderlands series, Ash from the Evil Dead series of movies and video games, Sam from the Sam and Max series GLaDOS from the Portal series, and lastly, Brock (What?) From the Venture Bros. TV Series. (Oh, also, Mad Moxxi from Borderlands is the bartender but she never says anything so ignore her.)Well, I'll just make this short and quick for all of you, just DON'T. This game, in my honest opinion, is just not worth buying. This game is not only a poker game, but it is also meant to be a comedy that you can get a good laugh out of as Poker Night 1 was. In Poker Night 1, I considered the interactions of Tycho (Penny Arcade) and the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) to be truly hilarious. However, this game in particular falls flat as both a poker game and a comedy. Firstly, to me, anyway, most of the lines were simply unfunny. They were either stale jokes that were easy to see coming, or puns. Plus, as if the lines weren't enough to ruin the comedy, there simply aren't enough of them. I can't count how many times I've heard Sam say ""Sure is, exciting, isn't it?"" in a row every single time he placed a bet. As a poker game, I'd say it falls flat in that the bots are far too ridiculous. It seems like every single hand the bots get is simply one card better than yours. For example, I got a flush with both of the cards in my hand, I enter a 1v1 showdown with Brock, who then beats me with a 1 card higher kicker than mine. (In Poker-ese, that's incredibly hard and unlikely.) But, if this was a one-time experience, I could understand it, it's just poor luck. But this seemed to be the case EVERY SINGLE TIME I got a good hand, though it may just be me whining, there seems to be very little reward for being able to read the bot's faces. They seem random, if anything, which in a poker game, is truly ridiculous.I do not recommend this game,»ZCC« Zombie Chicken"

This time Poker Night features Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (The Evil Dead), Sam (Sam and Max series) and GLaDOS (Portal) as your dealer.In Poker Night 2 you have the option of playing either Texas hold 'em or Omaha hold 'em. In either case, tournaments start with a $20,000 buy-in.An humorous opening sequence leads you down into the Inventory and introduces the characters. These characters will have fun lines to say on their own, but the real treat is when two or more characters talk with each other.Each character also has a special item that you can win from them that unlocks items in Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.Like in Poker Night at the Inventory the sequel has no multiplayer option, so you always play against the same opponents.The audio gags and discussions are amusing the first time you hear them, but they get annoying when you start hearing the same ones over and over again from one tournament to the next.All in all, if you are looking for a good poker game, then you should try Poker Night 2.

In my opinion, a better cast than Poker Night 1.+Banter between characters is funny...the first time (explained below)-Dialogue gets very old, very quickly. This can be unbearable for some of the longer dialogue scenes. Oh, and did I mention they're UNSKIPPABLE?-The same thing above applies to ""tells"" in the game. ""Don't be scared by the chips. Don't be scared by the chips"".- Tells are less common than in Poker Night 1, and more ambiguous-A.I. feels very cheap, moreso than the first game. Even if you have a very good hand, they will most of the time beat you with unbelievable ""god hands"". This is one of my core complaints.Some people may say that I'm whining. It is definitely possible to do well against the A.I., and I've found the correct rhythm to regularly win against the computer. However, doing this requires you to be incredibly defensive. You must play much more conservative in Poker Night 2 in comparison to real life poker games because of the complete BS hands that the computer can get. Even when you have a very high hand, the computer will manage to tie with you. When combined with the gruelingly repetitive dialogue, this game can really feel like a chore for the items. There are hundreds of cheaper poker games out there that simulate the experience much better than this."

It is probably the best poker game for this price, or even any price.Long version:Poker Night 2, just like its predecessor, tries to do what a few other poker games did by enhancing video poker with quality writing. Everyone you meet here is a known character from a known franchise (video games and motion picture alike), and they chat a lot. Their banter is not only full of humour, but somehow manages to feel natural, even when they talk about time travel or demons.The amount of spoken lines is impressive, and it can be boosted further by unlocking character-specific themes which all come with their unique bonus dialogues. This little addition can keep you in the game for quite a long time; it may take up to ten hours to unlock and hear everything.Good dialogues are great, but they couldn’t keep you around if the game is bad. Luckily TellTale managed to program a rather impressive AI for Poker Night 2; an AI that follows the characteristics of your opponents. They all have personalities and play accordingly… they sometimes even give small tells, if you look closely. Naturally they cannot substitute human players, but far as poker games go, Poker Night 2 is probably the best one you can get– and for a rather low price."

Poker Night at the Inventory was fun, and Poker Night 2 theoretically improves on every aspect of that game; the decks, tables, and themes you can purchase in-game are of an even better class than ever before, and Telltale pits you against a whole slew of characters who not only live up to, but surpass those of the first installment. On paper, everything is jolly and lovely. But when you first start up the game, you realize something is wrong...horribly wrong. The effort this game forces you to put in to earn its touted TF2 items is a far cry from the laid back nature of Poker Night 1's system. By the time you've earned the fifth, and arguably best, item the game has to offer, you've trudged through 15 disgusting challenges the game concocts for the sole purpose of extending the longevity of the game, all at the expense of the player's mental health. Any joy you may have derived from listening to the delightfully witty banter of characters such as Claptrap or Brock Samson will quickly turn in to teeth-gnashing fury as you feebly try to find a way to skip past all the fluff just to fail the tournament at a critical moment, with the bounties right out of your reach. What's worse, the items you can earn are intrinsically linked to the Steam achievements for the game, which means that, for the unlucky few out there (yours truly included), playing in offline mode prevents you from reaping your hard earned rewards. The proposed solution to this issue?""Like we give a ♥♥♥♥, we already got your money, fool. Delete your save and try again""- Telltale Games and Valve Support.""P.S.

It's a quirky game, with colourful visuals, great characters, great dialogue and some neat rewards. Oh, and there's poker. I had never played Texas Hold'em before (to this day, I think it's the only proper card game I've ever played) and after looking up the rules and having the tutorial fill in the blanks, I had a good idea of what to do. So much so, that I bought the sequel to play more and, more importantly, get more items for Team Fortress 2. I'll say it now; Poker Night 2 is definitely better than the first PN. If you haven't played the first one, I'd recommend it, mainly if you play TF2 like me. Now, that's enough backstory. On to the good stuff. (This review might be a bit on the long side).So, once again, you're back at the Inventory, playing poker against 4 colourful characters from various entertainment. The first PN had Strong Bad (Strong Bad), Max (Sam & Max), the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) and Tycho (Penny Arcade). Now, we have Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Ash Williams (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam & Max). In my opinion, this is a much better cast. It certainly feels more balanced as opposed to the craziness of the first game. Oh, and did I mention that GLaDOS is the poker table and commentator?I won't explain the rules of poker (the game has another tutorial for that anyway) but I'll list off the features. In PN 1, you would play poker, win different decks and tables and stumble upon a chance to win a TF2 item by beating the retrospective character yourself. This chance was entirely random, so if you only wanted the item (let's face it, that's what we all came for) you would have to keep hitting the 'restart' option and hoping that someone would put their item on the table. When you take into consideration the fact that characters would occasionally fold frequently (I'm looking at YOU, Tycho), this would make the matches rather tedious, as you have to keep trying to make characters bet whilst not making poor decisions and giving them more money (making it even more long and tedious). Thankfully, this system has changed. Now, you complete challenges to have a player place a bounty on the table. Win the tournament and an item for Borderlands 2 and TF2 is yours. Lose the tournament? The item will be back on the table by the next match, no resetting needed. Also, there are new tables, decks, chips and the introduction of themes. Apply all the items in a set and the Inventory gets a BIG visual overhaul, changing the lighting, the background and giving the retrospective character a slight outfit change. There are also special cutscenes and dialogue that occur with these themes, both of which are quite entertaining. Seriously, the cutscenes with Steve in the Borderlands 2 set are some of the funniest moments in this game. More features include a second mode of 'Omaha' poker (again, there's a tutorial) and being able to buy drinks for the other characters, making them reveal 'tells' more often (basically, hints about the strength of their deck Yes, I said DECK). There's also a cheatsheet that covers all the possible hands but if you've learned poker then you'll probably know these.Finally, the dialogue is worth mentioning too, it's that good. It ranges from references, to asking others about their universes and some great humour (particularly with Claptrap). It stops the gameplay from seeming too stale and makes it more entertaining, even if you hear certain lines multiple times (I'M LOOKING AT YOU GLADOS). Now, the game isn't perfect. Some challenges may take time to beat and despite this, the replay value isn't that large. But, for what it is, Poker Night 2 is a solid sequel and a great poker game. If you own TF2/Borderlands 2, played the first PN, or both, pick it up for some good entertainment. 8.5/10"

The NPC's cards are most likely crap compared to it, at least if you have played some poker you know it's not very likely everybody has better cards than you every single game.Now depending on your playstyle their cards are adjusted by the game to punish you for being too sure of your hand.If you play ""reasonably"", you might get away with your hand and beat all of the others.Doesn't matter how good your hand is or if your winning chance is 99% after you decided to go All In with it, during the next move the game will place cards that definitely beat yours in your opponent's hands. Your winning chance switches from 99% to 1%. This happens on a regular basis. The game just counters your hand and whatever you have, you WILL be punished.Sometimes every NPC has ridiculously good cards to make sure your good cards are countered, which means every single one of them has a Flush, a Full House and so on. But this only happens when you dare to go All In too quickly.If one of the NPCs goes All In though with a 2 and a 7 (yes, this happened) before even the flop is revealed, they win the game with it.So - not fun at all.The lines of every character are terribly annoying and you can't skip them or keep playing during them.

The first game delivered a poker experience with four pop media figures, the second gives you the same, with different figures. The new selection is both more interesting, and better presented, as befits a sequel.The player, voiceless, is ruthlessly teased by their opponents. Brock Samson plays with an appropriate sort of serious absurdity, the most grounded competitor. Claptrap is as annoying as he is in his birth title, and you'll enjoy when he leaves the table. Ashley Williams is so aggressive, you may let Sam handle him. Sam is the cautious, ruthless player who almost always plays his cards.All in all, if you want a more challenging poker experience with better - more varied - dialogue and interaction between the characters, buy Poker Night 2, and have a night to remember.

Moxxie is the bartender, but you never interact with her.You play as yourself, never seen, against Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam, while GLaDOS hosts and Max messes around off to the side.  The game then pretty much consists of playing Texas Hold 'Em while the characters chat and wisecrack at each other during the game.

GLADOS is the overseer of your hectic underground illegal poker game mocking you at any chance she gets. Some scenes will make you LOL.

There are a few sets of unlockable decks, chips, and themes  based on each character to add some replayability and try to experience all the dialogue. CPU strategy can be messed around buying them drinks from the bar so they are not always predictable. In the end Poker Night 2 does leave you wanting so much more and proves poker games have a  place on steam. You can't beat its asking price of 5$ 1$ if on a sale.

A lot actually.....This game is really frustrating and has nothing to do with poker, the players have no range at all and you don't have any fold equity. One exemple: 3 players with the same stack, 2 of them go all in on a A J 9 flop, the third one then call with 3 6 offsuit (no flush draw possible, no odds whatsoever). No one would ever do that, and it actually happens every two hands on that game. At no point I felt like playing poker or had any pleasure sitting at the table.The characters are not funny, especially when they only have 5 different lines each. So you'll hear them making the same comments again and again.....and again. The pace of the game is very slow, every time someone talk, the game is paused even if the people talking are not in the hand.If you like poker, don't play that game. If you don't know poker and would like to have a taste of it, for the love of god don't play that game and seek any other poker games out there.

For example:-- There's plenty of dialog in this game that not only gets repetative and annoying, but also is unskippable. This is simply frustrating.-- I don't play a lot of poker outside of this game, nor do I know the probabilities associated with different hands, but the hands will go on seemlingly long streaks of good or bad cards on the same players over serveral hands. What I mean is: you might have bad cards for up to ten or so hands while one or two of the AI have great cards for the hands. Whether or not this is typical of poker, this does get infuriating.-- The AI bet without logic a lot of time. I've seen the AI go all in to $10k - $20k+ on an Ace High hand after the River (5th) card has been delt. Nobody in their right mind goes all in on that much money with only a high card. There are so many other betting discrepancies that it's not funny.-- Going on the above point, the amount of betting that occurs before the first three cards are delt is rediculous. With a $20k buy in on you + 4x AI players, I've seen the pot hit $30k+ before the first three cards are delt. There is no hand worth a pot that much without seeing those first cards.-- The AI don't change their play styles and if you're paying attention even a quarter of the time, it's very predictable who you'll be facing off againt at any given point. For example, I've elimintate 3 out of the 4 AI players many times, but never have I ever not eliminated Ash.-- Another example is early game, Sam folds a lot. I'm not kidding. I've seen a player been busted out and somebody's up $20k+ before he ever makes any bet what-so-ever (apart from the blinds).-- There are too few unlockables and you earn way too many tokens. It is so easy to earn the tockens required to unlock all the skins for the decks, table and room, so you're left with all these excess tokens. The only thing other than those unlocks that you can spend the tockens on is drinks for the other AI players. This is not only fruitless half the time, but also doesn't seem to stem the tide of tockens you earn.-- This is perhaps my biggest complaint: There is not Multiplayer! No multiplayer mode, no online server (dedicated or otherwise), no LAN, no nothing! This means that not only can you not play with your friends, but the game itself gets extremely repetative after while because there's not enough variety in the AI and, as mentioned before, there's problems with the hands delt and the AI betting.As you might be able to tell from my above list, there is so much about this game that annoys me. That being said, I kinda like and kinda dislike how easy it is to grind out all the achievements. Also, it does seem to be a half-decent time filler or TV companion. For example, if you're watching a movie or TV (especially if you're watching it on a second computer monitor), it's a fun enough game to play while watching.Overall, it's not a particullary great game and is definitely lacking (especially in the multiplayer department), but if you can pick it up cheap, then it's definitely worth it.

It is fairly difficult to determine whether one has a strong hand and betting large because of that, or trying to push you off the pot.You would think the dialogue would become old annoying quickly, however, the devs did a great job of managing to mix emotions, reactions and character traits quite well.Claptrap bugs the hell out of me, but that's just me.  I think Clap should go tend to the bar while Moxxie joins us for a round or two.Really dig playing with Ash, the Evil Dead character, the guy who does Seinfeld's ""Puddy's"" voice (can't remember the show he's from in this game), and the others I could care less about.

,Recommended,234710,29494585,Posted: 25 January,all,Soda [Hurricane'd],"This is by far the best video poker game I've ever played, it easily teaches how to play poker as you play, the AI is the most challenging and most complex yet, and you feel like you are actually there in the scenario, playing poker with real people, only the people you play against are iconic pop culture characters.The characters have an endless amount of dialouges, but once you play about 20 matches they say the same thing every time, another problem i have with this game is that you don't get to be a certain character, you're always known as ""that guy who's mute"" you don't really get to establish a friendship with the characters like in other TTG games (then again, this game mocks you for being a nerd playing virtual poker).This game is certainly great, it's a shame it's overshadowed by it's partnership with Team Fortress 2 items, it is honestly a great game to play besides getting those TF2 items.If you love poker, this is a must have, far more better than Poker Night 1.TL;DR Very complex and puzzling AI, easy to adapt inside the game and just fun poker time, dialouge gets overused when it runs out and you don't get to have a character as a protagonist for a game that immerses you in a virtual reality.Just buy it."

There are two modes of Poker to play for each tournament that will offer new challenges and achievements to complete.

It is interesting to see such characters interact with one another, but it is a shame the player (he or she) cannot engage in conversation or interact with them too. Puchasing drinks for other players is the only interaction with the characters in this game. I know this game is purposely released as a ""Poker"" game, but the developers could of enable more options for the player to interact by asking or answering questions or get into a brawl. However, the game does very well of being a simple card game simulator. My other complaint is there should of been more opponents to play against other than Ash, Brock, Claptrap and Sam. **Game Tip: Expect to ""Fold"" a lot in this game due to bad hand dealt to player percentages.Fold, Bet, Raise or All-In For A Game Of Poker !!!"

AI for poker was not the best but was servicable. Dialogue was really good and its nice to kick back for a game. The camera angles on the cards and the unlockables added a nice twist to things as well as the random events and banter. Best of all I think this is the strongest roster of characters, claptrap, ash from evildead, and both sam & max with only one guy I dont know. Dealer has an auto-tune voice and is from the portal franchise. Wish there were other minigames and stuff around the bar instead of just poker but this is still great.

Or you can go buy the original which has more dialouge and more fun.FYI people who say the game is rigged are either tilted by their bad luck, or do not understand poker well enough (I don't claim to be an expert). It is not rigged, the AI is just quite dumb.Pros:- No limit Omaha is a nice addition, as you don't see that in nearly as many games.- New, fresh characters.- Win percentage is now added.- The new bounty system.- More TF2/BL2 items if you are into that.- Unlike Poker Night 1, you only have to win the tournament now instead of knock a player out to get an item. This makes it more fair.Cons:-  Dialogue. The banter is funny but unlike Poker Night 1, there are so few lines. This means the lines get repetitive almost immediately.- No Skip Buttom (bar some certain cases). This makes the repetitive dialogue even worse and slows the game down.- The game puts you down too much, always saying how your move was stupid, which often turns out to be wrong or hypocritical.- The AI is basic. Any semi experienced poker player will easily beat it. It has no pattern recognition and will go all in often for no reason.  It might actually be easier than Poker Night 1 (which also had a difficulty setting, which this game lacks).- Like Poker Night 1, the game still runs slow. It is buggy; it crashes. The menus are still clunky and slow. This really feels like a rushed job; at least Poker Night 1 felt like it has some thought put into it.- The little things - like when a oppoents hand is dead on the river, they acknowledge it, then the drum rolls and they look nervous for the turn. Your hand is dead, there is meant to be no suspense. I could name 10 more examples. These little mistakes makes the game development feel rushed.- The ""Win a showdown with only high card"" bounty is pretty rough; too rough in my opinion.- The ""tell"" and drink system is ok but I feel like it could have been expanded upon.Summary:- This game could have built on the Poker Night 1 formula and been a really fun poker game. Instead it feels like a useless cash-in that will have you bored in under 2 hours. Only buy it if it is on sale."

The dealer, namely Glados, is at her acerbic best, humiliating and degrading at every opportunity. If those characters sound like fun to you, you'll have an enjoyable poker sim to play.As for the unlocks, while I can't speak for the Team Fortress 2 items, the Borderlands 2 items are excellent and humorous. Playing as a human-sized turret from Portal is worth the price of admission by itself.Note to achievement hunters and perfectionists: unlike the last Poker Night game, the achievements in PN2 are all fair (Poker Night 1 required a victory by straight flush for its final achievement, a 72,192 : 1 chance)."

The voice acting is good and the interacting between characters doesn't seem forced. My only criticism would be the character AIs seem to respond to stimulus the same - it would be cool if Brock did more bluffing than Claptrap (for instance). I also did some experimenting and the computer responds the same regardless of the player's actions from hand to hand. If they wanted this game or a certain character to be really top-notch they should use some kind of Markov model to evaluate player actions. In any case this is a great choice for some casual gaming on a laptop or when you want to be able to walk away from a game for minutes or hours at a time during play. 8/10 for a casual title.

Downside is that it's pretty short, and the dialogue gets really repetitive.The""Once she drinks coffee, she doesn't shut up for hours""version:It's a decent game from Tell Tale.  We have the murder-machine Brock Samson fromVenture Bros(highly recommended show to watch), the ever obnoxiously annoying CL4P-TP unit from theBorderlandsfranchise (play the games, they're fun), Ashley Williams from theEvil Deadfranchise (I don't like horror so no opinion), and Sam from theSam and Maxfranchise all together at the same table,being taunted and experimented on bywith GLaDOS as your dealer.There are five challenges in total to get through to get the downloadable unlocks, and five felt/chip/card combos to get which have their own set of stories to go with them that don't appear if you only have one or two unlocks on.  The possible challenges are funny, as I don't know if I can actually deploy ninjas, want to take an asprin and call someone in the morning or do the hokey pokey.  Some are challenging as all get out, like ""Win with only a high card"".This time around, there is no difficulty setting, which I found disappointing.  The music is amazing, especially the slow piano version of ""Still Alive"", and the variations on all of the theme tunes, like the opening theme to Borderlands 2 ""No Heroes"".The two complaints I really have are these:1) the game is far too short, and getting the unlocks are too easy for the most part.  I end up deleting all of the saves and starting over, just to keep it interesting.2) they could have recorded a lot more dialogue, especially for GLaDOS.  Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is really funny, but to be told ""Well, that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior"" over and over and over and over and over again gets old fast.  That and their reactions to you going all in.It took a while for me to get the rules of Omaha, but I finally got it figured out.  Now, if I could only get into a showdown with someone other than Sam...Poker Night 2 is a good game to play while eating supper, or killing a few minutes before you have to leave.  It's not in any way a ""great"" game, but just a, ""Meh, I'll play this to murder some minutes while I eat/wait""."

Amusing High Stakes Poker with a Hint of Potential AI Cheating.Genre: Single Player Comedy Card Game.Developed and Published by: Telltale GamesPlatform: Windows and MacOSX.Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsIt’s a cross-over poker game, plain and simple. Where the player plays against four other characters from different universes in media The four characters, Brock, Ash, Claptrap and Sam, add to the atmosphere chatting and bantering to each other. They’ll talk about events in their universes, stories of what happened to them and generally hang out. It’ll help to know at least half of the cast or much of the humor/references will go over your head. As far as the poker aspect is concerned, there’s the option to play either Texas Hold'em or Omaha rules. The objective is to win the Poker Tournament and not lose the $20K buy-in. Good luck, you’re probably going to need it. This game has a vicious difficulty that I can only surmise is due to quite a bit of cheating on the AI’s part. Far too many times I’d have a pair of aces only for the AI to bet high and get a straight or flush. That’s one example of many where the AI feels far too omniscient for its own good. Even if it isn’t cheating, it’s way too convenient how many times the other players win. Outside of winning poker, you can get chances at earning each character’s special trophy and earn poker coins to unlock cosmetic items. To get said chance at winning a character’s special trophy item, you’ll need to complete the objectives given to you. Once you’ve done that, win a tournament. Again, good luck on that.The Characters and InteractionsIt's a pretty good selection of characters in this game that work off each other rather well. Claptrap is his usual self. So, you’ll like/dislike him just as much you do in Borderlands. GLaDOS makes for an entertaining poker dealer with her usual biting barbs at the contestants. I didn’t find Ash Williams to be all that interesting. I’m curious why they picked him over any other number of Telltale characters they could have used. Brock is an amusing straight man and carries himself well. While Sam makes his entrance to the series with Max in the background being, well, Max. They tell some interesting stories and really, this is where the meat of the game is. Which shouldn't be surprising as Telltale is really good with character interactions. There's quite a bit of amusment to be had just hearing these five characters talk to each other. Whether its about how good that bet was or what kind of dog Sam is, there's quite the range of subjects brought up at The Inventory. You'll get at least a couple of hours of lines that are new or fresh before they start getting repeated. After that, you'll hear quite a few lines repeated with a the occasional story being brought up now and then.PC Settings and Stability ProblemsGraphics options are pretty limited. There’s a rendering quality slider that swaps between low and high. Anti-aliasing is only switchable between on and off. Additionally, there’s a plentiful amount of screen resolutions and full-screen on/off. There’s music, sound and voice audio sliders as well as subtitles. The only gameplay options are “how to play”...so not much to be found here. There’s no difficulty slider so if you think the game is too easy/hard: you’re out of luck. I should also note that there isn’t any Steam Cloud support.Upon replaying it for this review, I had it crash on me a couple of times for no discernable reason. I did try making it a windowed game and thatseemedto help but I can’t be 100% certain that fixed it. There’s also been a number of reports on the Steam community that also seem to indicate crashing problems with the latest releases of Windows 10. So, I’m not too sure how long this game will continue to run if it’s this unstable already.Final ThoughtsIf you’re going to pick up Poker Night 2, pick it up for the characters and interaction. Playing poker against AI is a tricky business at best and it’s easy to think its cheating even if it really isn’t. Though in this case, I do think PN2 is cheating at times. The convenience of how good their hands can be is just a little too much for me to buy. PN2 is good for a couple of hours and by then you’ll have heard all the fresh lines before the characters start repeating themselves ad nauseam. After that, there’s really not much of a reason to keep playing. Tells are too telegraphed and there isn’t much to really draw you in. Still, if you want to listen to GLaDOS berate Sam for making a lousy bet, I’ve heard of worse ideas.Read the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

These are my first impressions of the game.First off, the atmosphere seems a bit less cozy, the chatter amount can't be changed nor can you skip the chats. I do find the new characters a bit dissapointing compared to the older crew, who felt a lot livier and these just throw more mean snarks and remarks instead of fully chatting with eachother. Although I do like the inclusion of GlaDOS as dealer, she's just an awesome dealer with the right amount of evil. Sam definitely makes more jokes with his partner compared to Max in part one, which is also nice.The poker itself felt as good as always with a better unlocking system than the previous one. The ability to buy the ones you want makes it a lot more rewarding. Since you don't have to wait for the ones you really want. There is a new gamemode, Omaha, but I haven't touched that one yet.Overall, the game still feels fresh and fun if you're bored of the first one. It has new jokes, new characters and new visual flair to unlock. There are a few things downgrades compared to the other one (unskippable stuff, lesser settings etc) but they're not too bothersome. So if you're a fan of the first, go ahead and try it out!"

GLaDOS is excellent as always, and having her as the dealer was a wise move.When it comes down to it though, actual poker players say it's nothing like playing poker, and the unlockable bounties for Borderlands 2 straight up don't work; it's possible to get them if you contact Gearbox support, but I think when you have to open a ticket to recieve what is debateably the biggest selling point of the game, the product is fundamentally flawed.This isn't a game for poker players or collectors."

As it is, the canned diologue gets stale fast.  I turned it off after a couple games, but now I have to watch them miming their lines.  That's right - you can't skip the incessant dialogue.  It turns fifteen minute games into thirty minute games.  It turns thirty minute games into purgatory.  Then there's the menu - even the *menu screens* take forever.  There's like a four second delay to move between them.  And when you press escape, it likes to default not to the actual menu, but to the unlocks screen.  Why?  Because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why.  I can only recommend this game to Buddhist monks for whom limitless patience is a possibility.But if you find it for $2 then, meh, it can mix up your game library when other games get stale and you forget how much of your time Poker Night 2 loves wasting.

In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.The amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so.

I am comparing Poker Night 2 to several other games I've played, including DD Poker 3, Dogs Playing Poker, the free Yahoo poker game, and Governor of Poker.First the good.Character animations. Poker Night 2 is the best of the bunch, since DD Poker and the yahoo game have no player animations, Governer of Poker has 2D animation consisting of the player's hat and hands only, and Dogs Playing Poker is quite old and low res. But best among a terribly weak field is not much of an achievement.Dialog. Funny once. Unfortunately it quickly runs out and you start hearing repeats. Over and Over. With no way to turn it off.  And appreciation of the humor depends on picking up the various game culture references. I loved Portal and Portal 2, so GladOS as a dealer works for me. I never played any of the Borderlands stuff, or Ace Ventura, so those references pass me by.And the badTournament structure. You start with $20,000, the big blind is initially $800, and it goes up in $400 increments pretty rapidly. So it's no limit, and you're starting off with just 25 big blinds. Suppose your first hand is pretty good, and you get a good flop. You'd typically bet before the flop, and make at least continuation bets after the flop and on the turn. Well if you do, and one of the other players doesn't fold, you're going to be all-in by the river. Its not uncommon to see all-in's on the first hand, whether you play it or not. So the structure of the tournament means the game is over pretty quickly. You won't spend even an hour patiently and slowing grinding down your opponents in this tournament structure. No matter how solidly you play, you're on thin ice from the start due to only having 25 big blinds -- a level at which some players are already looking for their last-stand hand.Poker AI. The four opponents do have distinct personalities and play styles. Sam plays fairly solidly. ClapTrap is random enough to be difficult to predict. Brock is aggresive, and Ash is a maniac. And what a maniac. As in ten-seven off suit all in before the flop kind of maniac. On the first hand, just because one player raised and another one called ahead of him.And this brings me to the biggest controversy about this game. Quite a few people have accused it of cheating. And the accusers seem to be the more serious poker players, not just whiners. The developers have denied this, and claimed that writing a game that cheats would be harder than writing one that doesn't. I don't believe that. I'm a professional programmer, with nearly 30 years of industry experience, though not in games. What I think is that writing a bad AI is easy, writing a good one that can beat good players consistently is very very hard. It's a lot easier to cheat.Let me explain why I think they'd be motivated to do this, other than because it's easier. Have you ever watched poker on TV? You do realize that it's edited, right? The boring hands are almost all edited out. They don't show you the hand where one player raises before the flop and everyone else folds. It's not entertaining. They show you the big confrontations, the sweats and especially the outrageous bad beats.So if you wanted to make a non-serous poker game that's fun, you'd do the same thing. And that's what I think Poker Night 2 has done. Because comparing playing it versus the other poker games Poker Night 2 deals many more bad beats. Many many more. It works both ways, as a player you get to apply bad beats as often as you receive them. This is not cheating to make you lose, it's cheating to make the game more exciting. Because lets face it, poker for play money isn't all that exciting by itself.Poker night 2 deals many more flushes, straights and full houses than I think you'd see from an honest dealer. Because my dry ace beats your dry ace isn't as exciting as my full house beats your flush. Or your flush beats my straight.I can't prove this, of course. I suppose I could write a bot that played the game and leave it running for a week and record the hand distribution, but that still wouldn't satisfy some. And what's the point. It's supposed to be a fun game, anyway. The game even hints at this. After raking in your chips, Sam will tell you ""You didn't stand a chance once I decided to win"". And GladOS, after you win a head, may say ""Now lets see how you do when I'm not stacking the deck in your favor"". If nothing else, these kind of lines are why the developers shouldn't be surprised if someone thinks the deals are set up. I think this ""game design"" philosophy is also why the blinds are structured the way they are, to get the excitment going quickly, and keep the game short.So on that level, I think the game succeeds. If you like having plenty of chances to win and lose big, quickly, without having to grind through a ton of boring hands first, then this game is far less boring than an honest game like DD Poker 3. It's cartoon poker, for the impatient kid in you.So after a mostly negative review I have given this game a 'yes', but it's really provisional: it depends on what you're looking for. As a serious poker game I can't recommend it. But who looking to buy this  really expects it to be a serious poker game? If you want serious poker, I recommend DD Poker 3 -- it's a free download. On the other hand, if entertainment means lots of crazy hands and few boring ones, with a cartoon backdrop, then this game is going to entertain you. And I think the deck-stacking is very well done -- you have to play quite a while and switch back and forth between it and other poker games before you feel certain the hands here are crazier in general.A couple additional notes: Poker Night 2 also can play Omaha. Omaha is also no limit, with the same blind structure as the Texas game. That added a little value for me, because I didn't have an Omaha game. And if anything, the Omaha game is even more conducive to crazy hands. Second note: the dealer isn't the only one that can cheat. You can search the web for the tells that the game regularly gives you. Just in case you weren't born with the inate ability to read poker tells off of an animated dog."

That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.-The animations are borky-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.Luckily, there are some good things about the game as well:-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.Buy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't."

76561198002864416,Recommended,234710,8458987,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,The Morgue,"A solid little poker game, highlighted by the great writing and voice-acting of your ""celebrity"" opponents.The concept is simple enough: stars from the world of geek come out to play poker against each other (and you, of course), and the winner takes all.  The game features both No Limit Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha variations, and that's it.  While the poker engine is pretty solid, it's not likely to convert hardcore players.  The real fun is in the interactions of your opponents, who include Brock Samson from the Venture Brothers cartoon series, Claptrap from the Borderlands franchise, Ash Williams from the Evil Dead series, and Sam of Sam & Max fame.  Max, of course, is on hand to make mischief, and everyone's favorite evil robot Glados deals the cards and provides sarcastic commentary about the players.  Borderlands vixen Moxxi serves as the bartender, but oddly enough, she never says a word.  Weird.The problems with the game are easy to predict: the dialog begins recycling itself after a handful of sessions, and the players never change their tells or strategies, making them fairly easy to defeat after some practice.  These issues are handily countered by the game's price, which is at most five bucks and usually less thanks to Steam sales and flash bargains.  It's unlikely that this game will be something you play hardcore for months on end, but as a low-cost slice of passing entertainment, it's hard to pass this one up.  Granted, if you don't know the characters involved, 75% of the humor might go right over your head.Bonuses include themed decks, felts, and chips for the respective franchises of each character, and bounty items from each player that unlock new skins and items in both Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.If you're a fan of poker and some of the characters involved, this is kind of a no-brainer.  The game won't hold your attention forever, but for the price, it will more than hold up its end for some good laughs and solid card-playing."

So you have no idea what level you are playing on.- You have to listen to characters lines over and over again. Because you can't skip them.- The game can freeze in the middle of the game, so you have to restart the match. ( This happends to me, not all players have that problem tho )-  Most of the time you get crap cards, that you can't build up. Thanks to our dear dealer Glados.-  In a showdown: You have 80% chance to win and the opponent has 20%, but when the last card is placed down the opponent turns to 100% and you turns to 0%. Lets just say the opponent gets nearly allways: Straight, full house, flush or royal flush. The odds ain't real.- Lots of luck is required.- I could continue, but there is no point to do that.So I can only recommand to buy the first poker night at the inventory.The End."

Fun GamePlaying poker has never been so interesting. All the insance antics and the interesting conversations held by the characters. E.g. All the false information about dogs from Sam.I especially liked the themed sets. E.g. Steve from Borderlands 2 and his ""Heyoo""2. CharactersAll of them are so funny. I love Claptrap the most. I was hoping Moxxi would speak though.3. Probability CalculationsI appreciate showing the probability though I wish you would teach us how you arrive at the number.4. Crossover Game RewardsNice. Love the free skins for winning.CONS1. No Multiplayer ****Such a fun game and you can't play multiplayer. What a waste. I felt that Telltale could easily make themselves one of the top games on Steam by allowing for multiplayer. Perhaps they have some restrictions regarding publishing online gambling software but I would like to point out that Dota 2 already encourages gambling in the form of match predictions using CASH.2. Nothing to DistractWhile waiting for the NPCs to decide (which should be instant), maybe there could be something interesting to do in the few seconds in between.3. No Concrete Assurance That It's Not RiggedI don't see anything anywhere in the game that points out that it is not rigged. So far the best assurance I've come across is a forum post. The idea that the game is rigged to win at some points and lost at others takes away a certain portion of fun.SUGGESTIONS1. Assurance of Non-Rigging/CheatingMaybe you could have a small option in the Menu that points out how Telltale codes the game to be non-cheating.2. MultiplayerYou could attract all the seniors in their retirement to Steam, thereby helping to make Steam a true company for all.3. Other Card GamesBridge, Taipan, Baccarat, Blackjack, Big 2 etc... The list is endless. Why stop at Poker? You could corner the market on non-cash card games on Steam.I AM HIGHLY AGAINST USING REAL MONEY TO BET ON STEAM GAMES. IF YOU DO MAKE A POKER NIGHT 3 WITH MULTIPLAYER, DO NOT ADD A REAL MONEY COMPONENT OR ALLOW PLAYERS TO MAKE REAL MONEY SIDE BETS.4. Newbie TutorialHave a simple section teaching how to calculate the probability of winning with your hand. This will teach advanced mathematics to MILLIONS of players. This would be optional as some people just hate math.5. Protect People from CheatingYou could also teach them about the dark side of poker, like the cheating. This would help to protect the public from cheats in real life. E.g.""cooler decks"", palming cards, marking cards, false shuffles.Treat this like an act of charity.6. Gamer's CentralYou could create a Gamer's Central just like the one from Wreck-It Ralph. Then everyone can choose their card game and walk into an empty room."

It's very odd, given the circumstances, I would have thought I'd never get this addicted to a simple card game, and it doesn't help that before playing this, I didn't play card games at all. As I started to play the game more, however, I started getting the hang of how things worked in Texas Hold 'Em and I started developing stradegies. Now, I'm the only one in my family that can play poker, and I won't let them forget that. I've been constantly asking members of my family to learn how to play so I could have someone to play with instead of the computer, and my addiction was only taken further when I started learning other card games outside of poker. I know the story I just told was a little off-topic, but it's a big factor in what made me like this game so much. Poker just got addicting to me, and I'd just keep coming back to this game which some could argue is repetitive.That's just my personal opinion though, I think poker is really fun. If you want an action-packed game with tons of variety, you're not going to find it here. It's just poker. Still, there are some things about this game that sets it aside from playing real poker. The fact that they were able to get together a wide variety of interesting characters with comedic personalities is great, and the conversations between the characters really sets a great atmosphere. The problem with this is, the conversations repeat. A lot. The jokes are funny, but you won't be laughing at them by the 40th time they're told.I also like how this game rewards you for accomplishing things. You'll win not just virtual money, but also items and accessories in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. So that's pretty cool.Oh, and GLADoS is the dealer. You can't go wrong there.In my personal opinion, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's very fun and addicting, and the characters that you play with are great. I'd recommend this to anybody who plays poker."

Each character has many lines of dialogue, almost all of which are great, and they poke fun at  Gearbox studios, TellTale and many TV/Film personalites. GladOs is a great card dealer, and always adds a cynical or homicidal quote after most hands. The visuals are great, the character animation sare clean and smooth, far better than the first Poker Night, and The only drawback to the entire game is that the game might have done better had they included a few more crazy animations when characters are removed from the table.All in All, a absolute treat and perfect for a few hours of addictive and cynical fun.

There are plenty of unlockable items to give the game some longevity, but the downside is the characters don't have enough lines, so they repeat themselves often.

The drinks cause the other players to be more obvious in their tells.Speaking of tells, each of the players has them. Brock is a hothead and will often bet without a real hand. Ash plays more like Gus Hansen, Claptrap plays a solid game overall, and Sam almost always folds unless he has a real hand.That's pretty much it. Outside of the setting, dialogue, and some challenges which allow you to unlock new skins and such for Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2, it's pretty much a straightforward Hold 'em and Omaha game. So, if you like poker and video games, you will probably enjoy this. If not, look elsewhere for sure."

,Recommended,234710,8625349,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,Nighthawk,"PresentationPoker Night 2 follows a familiar pattern that you have probably seen or at least heard of before, and much like the original title Poker Night at the Inventory, it puts you, The Player against four other characters from different blockbuster franchises not only from the video game industry, but also from television series and movies, in tournaments of Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hold'em. This time around your adversaries are Sam from the Sam & Max franchise, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise, and Claptrap from the Borderlands series, in addition to GLaDOS from the Portal series which takes the role of the dealer. There isn't a story that unites those characters at the Inventory poker table, but having them in one place is great no matter the circumstances, and even though there is no adventure or story to follow here, hearing from them once again is just as nice. Even with the thought of the game being a simple poker simulator with your favourite characters as your adversaries in mind, the game does little to set itself apart from other such games apart from having those characters in it; there is only a short introduction cutscene when you start the game for the first time that shows you making your entrance at the Inventory for the first time and bumping into all those characters along the way as you move towards the table, and after that everything will become an endless repetition until you eventually get bored of the game. Even if you aren't familiar with some of the franchises that brought you those characters, they will make themselves known to you as you play more and more with them and hear their stories, but the really pleasure comes for those long-time fans of one of those characters, because hearing themselves explain one of their adventures that you are already familiar with in different way and in some ways making a parody of it is unlike nothing else.Rating: 7GameplayThere's no catch here, it's poker: you either dig it or you don't, but considering the amount of poker games out there, some of which come at no cost at all, looking at Poker Night 2's only 2 game modes and the lack of any sort of multiplayer you realize that if you got this game for the actual poker playing experience, you clearly got the wrong thing. Sure, Texas Hold'em and Omaha Hold'em are the most popular poker modes, but just like anything else it will get boring to follow the same road every tournament without any twist to change the actual game. Poker was always one of the most popular forms of gambling and even if virtual poker games still maintain that feeling by using virtual money and chips, it doesn't feel like gambling unless you play against other human players. Playing against the AI gets boring incredibly fast simply because their next move will always be predictable in a form or another, and even though the difficulty of the game is somewhere around what would be a normal level, you can't increase or decrease the difficulty to your liking if you're looking for a more intense experience or a more relaxed play. The only things that will change the boring atmosphere come in the form of unlockables, that once activated will change things like the deck of cards, the table or the chips and activating all three of them from the same theme will trigger a different scenery effect specific to that theme, making the Inventory look like the set of another Evil Dead movie or the next chamber of Portal experiments, but even so, those changes are strictly visual and will not affect the core idea of a repeating poker experience that is isolated to the AI battles only. Apart from the items that can be unlocked using tokens that you'll win at the end of each tournament according to what position you finished on and the ability to order drinks from the bar for your adversaries there is nothing else to distract you from what is an incredibly repetitive set of plays that is limited in every possible way.Rating: 5.5GraphicsPoker Night 2 isn't the prettiest game out there, even compared to other poker titles only, but it's not bad looking either; the characters are nicely done, the backgrounds are pretty and those unlockables really change the scenery in a pleasant way, especially when you combine all three of them from the same theme package. The animations are decent, even though the lip sync can be way off at times, but all the funky moves of those characters that combined with audio effects create some funny moments make up for it. Things don't look bad in any way, but you can clearly see some cubic edges when the camera zooms in on a character's face and so on.Rating: 6.5AudioThe cast, even though small, does its job of creating a rich audio environment as Sam is voiced by David Nowlin, Max by David Boat, Brock Samson by Patrick Warburton, Ash Williams by Danny Webber, Claptrap by David Eddings and GLaDOS by Ellen McLain. The one great thing about Poker Night 2 comes in the form of its epic dialogue between all those legendary characters that will constantly tell jokes and stories, all to the delight of the player. As good as those jokes are however, they won't last forever, and even thought the first hours of the game will be a pleasant surprise for the fans of those characters as you hear more and more stories about them, they will get repetitive eventually and when they do, that fun will almost instantly turn into boredom.Rating: 8ExtrasIf you're a fan of those characters or at least some of them, you'll have fun in the game for a few hours, but after you've heard everything there is to hear, which shouldn't take longer than 5 hours to do, your only motivation will come in the form of unlockables which in a worst case scenario will take around 10 hours to unlock all, and after that there really is no reason to come back: you'll hear the same old lines over and over again, there is nothing else to win or see and there are much better poker games out there available for free, which can also be played online.Rating: 4VerdictPoker Night 2 is a delight for those who appreciate the classics and wanna hear more about their favourite characters and this game is the perfect opportunity to see some of those legendary characters all in one place, but that special treatment will only last for a few hours, and once that is done and you've heard every joke those characters have in store for you, Poker Night 2 is just another game that you won't play ever again.Rating Overall: 6.2Check the full review and a lot more about Poker Night 2 athttp://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=216"

Have a royal flush? Sorry, we're just going to count it as a normal straight. I recomend picking it up while it's cheap, get the items, and either keep it for some themed poker or refund it. I highly recomend the original, even if almost all of its unlocks were merely reskins.BTW, why in the Hell are Brock and Ash here? Brock's entertaining, sure, but the theme of this series is gaming/gaming related media. While Evil Dead at least had a game series, Brock's inclusion is just confusing. I personally would have tried for getting the rights to Phoenix Wright, as Phoenix is a small time poker series in the canon of his games, but then again, Capcom doesn't have the best track record when it comes to multi-corperation co-operation."

David Nowlin (Sam) is in way over his head as usual, failing to add the comedic punctuation and nuance that Sam's lines demand (one of the many reasons why the Telltale incarnation of Sam & Max has fallen far short of the original). Brock Samson is about as bland a character as it gets - deliberately so or not, it makes no difference; intentional blandness is still blandness. And finally, Claptrap manages to be even more obnoxious than both Strong Bad and Tycho combined - an achievement of sorts, I suppose.The lines themselves repeat much quicker than the original Poker Night (it seems each character only has one ""reaction"" to an all-in, and given that all-ins occur quite often in poker, believe you me this is quite noticeable), and the TF2 rewards are a pair of Scout socks without a football (objectively inferior to the Football Manager socks), a mediocre Pyro hat, a Spy mask which by virtue of being a Spy cosmetic means that nobody will ever notice, and a Sniper hat that looks like five other Sniper hats.

GLaDOS makes an excellent dealer, with her snide remarks as always. It could use more characters to play with, though, if we want tournaments, more characters should be attempting to play in, even if they can't play all at the same time.

Repetitive dialog that cannot be disabled continually slows down the game.  Although it was a bit fun at first.The game also cheats, for lack of a better term.  Based purely on game statistics, it appears that there is a mechanism in place to keep players from going all in.  I play a lot of hold-em and it is pretty obvious to me that the game is not on the level when the player goes all in.  Play the hand with standard betting, no problem.  Go all in with a 80% hand and you will lose 90% of the time.  So, standard hold-em strategy will not work properly.In pure English the deck is stacked against you in a way that defies normal play when you go all in.  You will lose a lot more than you should.  I am not talking a little bit either.  They probably did this to weed out the players who go all-in all the time and win based on pure luck and not skill, but it removes an element that makes hold-em the popular go to game every where, the show down.  Couple that handicap with the fact that some of the bounties require you to win those show downs and this gets even more frustrating as the only real way to do this is grind away until the game gives you a break and lets you win a hand you should win with no problem."

(Some of whom I recognize)There are only two poker games you can play: Texas Hold'em, and Omaha. (Compared to the first game which only had Hold'em)As a sequel, it improves upon several aspects of the first.1.) The addition of Omaha to the available gamemodes can shake things up a bit. But not much.2.) You can buy drinks so characters will show their ""tells"" more.3.) More unlocks. The addition of different poker chips as well as the ability to change the theme of the entire Inventory when completing a set, adds more variety cosmetically to prevent the game from going stale too quickly.4.) Challenges. Instead of just knocking out the person for his unlock, you have to complete challenges, and then win another tournament.5.) Multiplatform. It's not just on Steam this time, it's also on XBox, which means more accessibility.6.) More 3rd-party unlocks. Just like last game, you get to unlock ingame items for not only TF2, but Borderlands as well this time.7.) Better graphics.However, there are a couple things that makes it worse than the first game.1.) Less dialogue. There's less voice acting in this one, which means the talking can get repetitive much quicker than the first game.2.) Less options. There are less options that you can configure, particularly a ""dialogue frequency"" option that controls how much the characters talk. This helps exemplify the problems of number 1.Verdict:7.5/10Conclusion:Compared to the first game, it improves some aspects, but falls short on others. I gave the first game a 7/10, I'll give the sequel 6.5/10, with the fanboy in me bumping it up to 7.5/10 (like last game) because of the characters and witty dialogue.If you're looking for a poker game, this wouldn't be for you. But if you're a fan of the characters, enjoy some witty dialogue, and wouldn't ming getting a few more special items to your TF2/Borderlands inventory, and wouldn't mind the bargain price of $5, then I'd highly recommend this game."

Even at the title screen, references to the games and videos that the game's characters overflow here.  From the gorillas from Sam & Max to the bartender from Borderlands, there is always something around to tie the oddly matched characters together.  There is even is photo at the staircase showing the characters from the first game.  If you are willing to let your eyes roam, there is plenty to see.Another visual detail about the game is the unlockables.  Just like the first game, you can earn unlockables that lets the player customize the look of the game.  Unlike the first game, those unlockables have an affect on the game.  By using an entire set, it causes both how the area looks as well as how the characters talk.  A prime example of this is watching your opponents leaving through theVenture Brothers' teleporter.  Knowing that each set has something special to see, this gives extra variety to what the characters could say and do.Speaking of the talking, that is the real draw about the game.  As with most Telltale Games titles, the humor alone makes the game worth playing.  From moments like the robots dealing with paradoxes, Ash learning about his unknown fame, and Brock dealing with dubstep, listening to what they have to say will keep you coming back to more.The one big problem about the first game is still present in this game.  That problem is the lack of variety in the gameplay.  Seeing that Texas Hold 'em is the most popular version of poker, it is understandable that they feature it in this game.  New to the mix is Omaha, a variant of Texas Hold 'em.  However, they still choose to ignore other popular variants of the game.  Games like Stud and the classic Draw are out of the mix.  Even within the Community games, there are more games like Razz available to play.  By only focusing on two similar versions of same game, the gameplay still feels limited.  Once you are used to the two games, it will leave you wanting more.  Having Blind Man's Bluff, something featured inSam & MaxEpisode 103, would have been perfect for Telltale's style of humor.  If they are going to make a third game, they really need to add more types of games, not just slight changes of the same game."

No matter how many times I re-install this game it just won't work at all for me. I've tried installing it on four different computers (multiple times) and each time it crashes before it even gets to the title screen. That's a huge issue, and a lot of other people I've talked to have had the same one.I've played on a friend's account where it worked half the time, and it was a pretty nice game. It had humourous dialouge and made me feel like I was good at poker. It had a lot of downsides though. The jokes became pretty monotinous after a few hands, often cycling through ones that were said just moments before and after a while you had heard every one. There are non-skipable scenes in this as well, which makes farming for the items that you can get a bit frustrating. It often ignores your hands as well in the game, allowing for an NPC to win when you clearly would.The negative aspects outweigh the positive, but since I personally like playing poker games I purchased it I was hoping to play it when I wanted to killl some time (the items being a nice bonus too). Since it doesn't work for me and I ended up wasting my money and my time by installing it over and over, I'm giving it a negitive review.But if you want you can take a chance, because it may work for you.

It's a great title, with lots of fun to be had.Final conclusionA: Must have.B: Great game, picking this title up in a sale is almost a steal.C: It's OK, worth it in a sale, but lower your expectationsD: Not worth it, unless it's 90% off, or if you really want itE: Technical disaster, do not buy this at any circumstances"

For some reason the game will give a tie to all of the players with the exact same cards or they would have just one card that would keep them in the game.For example this.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=142288555There is a higher chance of the sun turning into a blackhole tomorrow than this occurring by chance. It may seem that I am whining, to be honest if this only happened maybe once or twice in a blue moon I wouldn't get so salty, but for some reason it happens more often than it should which leads me to believe they want people to play the game as long as possible and to listen to all of the funny dialogue and quips they put in the game for us. For most people they probably just got this for the items, me I got it because I wanted to enjoy a fun poker games that had characters I am fond of. The AI isn't hard to beat or anything, it's just the game wants to punish or suppress yoloing behaviour that can win rounds too quickly.The game wants you to play carefully and to not go ham too often, most hardcore poker players may or may not like that about the game. I suggest trying some of the other poker games out there that doesn't sport a favouring system.Also not to mention the streak of bad hands that you get in this game that causes you to just be whittled down by the blinds when it comes down to 1 v 1. I've had many times where I got jack crap for over 20 hands and the AI just has all the god hands betting in the double digits, if the ai get ahead they will just steal the blinds everytime bullying you out of the game with little to nothing to do. Sometimes it seems that the RNG bugs out at a point. I've had hands where I went from 80k in the lead to 20k and a lose just to blinds alone and crappy cards hand over hand. A 30 minute game ends up being an hour just to the horrible RNG a lot of the time. That or the blinds just suck you dry, and god hands you play turn out to be beaten by the stupidest of rivers."

Glados is scripted to mock you no matter which move you make, even if you play well, and her sass is also unskippable, which just makes the game a slow-paced, annoying slog where every hand you wait 45 seconds for someone to finish repeating a story just so you can click Check and then wait another 10 seconds while Glados explains why you're an idiot until you find the one button she doesn't have a comeback for: Quit."

Away from the flaws, this game has good graphics and I like the way you win rewards for TF2 and BL2.You see, the original came out alot of days before, and it was nearly at the top of the awesomeness meter. But the only reason why the original did it is because it was 'the first game to combine famous characters in a game session we like' and 'the rewards are awesome because you can get them in TF2' and so on.

,Not Recommended,234710,13704100,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,Dravvad,"DISCLAIMER: Don't play this game for too long in one sitting or very often. It could really use some setting adjustments and extra features. If you don't love Poker too much, then don't bother with this game, obviously.First off, I like the game concept in the sense that it's Poker (Texas or Omaha) with the addition of some nice characters from TV and video games: Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands, Ash from Evil Dead, Sam & Max from... Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal. The game has an interesting personality with these characters because there's actually good dialogue and some very funny scenes that happen as you play. Hearing the characters bicker back and forth, or listening to GLaDOS giving sarcastic put-downs is hilarious.On the other hand, the above is really the only thing ""extra"" to the game. Without it, it's just another Poker game, and the bonus characters wear off pretty quickly. It's not that the characters and their personalities bother me, but it's that there simply isn't enough dialogue for the game, and there aren't enough game setting to manage.I had only played the game for less than a couple of hours, completing a few matches/tournaments, and already started encountering a lot of the same dialogue, thus it became very boring very quickly. The sad part about that is there aren't any settings to manage that. You cannot skip dialogue unless it is before the whole match begins or you just folded and want to skip to the next hand. If you are in the middle of the game, you just have to sit and wait. Many times did I place my bet and had to wait nearly over a minute to make my next move, because the characters would talk a lot before the next person would fold or bet.A minute isn't a lot of time, but when it happens very often, it can take a lot just to finish one hand and can be very boring if you have heard all of the dialogue by that point. Similarly, you can't change any gameplay settings to limit the dialogue.On top of the dialogue, you will encounter certain cutscenes sometimes in the middle of a match or when someone is eliminated or you win the game. You can't skip these either, thus they are just you sitting there for 3+ minutes at a time when you have seen them already as well.The only thing to change the dialogue is to change the Unlockables to 3 items matching one of the characters (e.g., a Venture Bros theme for the room). Doing so adds extra dialogue while you have all 3 items activated, and the dialogue pertains mostly to the matching character and things involving the show or game world. While the new rooms are a nice touch, you still run out of dialogue quickly, and further the rooms actually add longer custcenes for elimination and winning, thus you have to sit and repeat things even more.All in all, that really makes the game boring and take way more time after you've played a handful of rounds (per room). Being able to manage the dialogue occurrence and being able to skip it and the scenes would be a lot more useful if you're tired of seeing the same thing over and over.Because of the above, the game therefore turns into a basic Poker game that is artificially extended by repetitive dialogue and scenes. No other real settings exist for the game, and the only extra addition to the game is the Bounties. The Bounties are essentially goals that you get and you must complete 3 of them in order to compete for a Bounty Item. Once you get to the Bounty Item, you must win the entire match (and eliminate everyone) in order to win the Bounty Item. Once you do, you simply unlock an item for Borderlands 2 and for Team Fortress 2.The Bounties themselves are really a pain. They are randomly generated, and once you get them, you cannot change them. Depending on your luck, you may get really simple Bounties like ""Order a drink"" or ""Come in 3rd place or better"", which are relatively simple things to do. Otherwise, you will get the worst ones such as ""Win with a flush or better"" or ""Win with a high card"" which can take indefinitely to get, because none of those things are up to you. They are just up to luck. Having to win with a high card means pretty much everybody at the table has to get no special card matches and then you just have a King and everyone else has less, for instance. There's a few other ways to get it, but it's really less often than winning with a Pair, for instance.You just have to play and play and play and play, eventually getting the Bounties. It is just a waste of time and pointless, since there really isn't any skill involved in those. Poker does require skill, but only in terms of generally winning, not winning with a specific pattern.All in all, I don't mean to say that the game is terrible. The dialogue and scenes, when you first experience them, are absolutely hilarious and I loved it. But the game dies out pretty quickly, and it's a shame. They really should have added some extra features and especially configuration to the game."

But if you don't especially like poker I wouldn't write this game off. You are joined at the table by Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, CL4P TRP from Borderlands, Ash Williams from Army of Darkness and Sam from Sam and Max. These four characters are packed full of witty and charming dialogue, their conversation and insults keep you very involved in the game and could even entertain you on their own. Each character also has distinct play-styles and always keep you on your toes. Unfortunately the dialogue has the habit of looping which can get extremely dull, most of the jokes stop being funny after about the third time.You might think this game would get fairly boring and inevitably it eventually will but it keeps play interesting with randomised challenges, customizable chips, cards and tables and unlockables for other games. This helps maintain the incentive to win despite being pitted against bots.Overall it is definitely worth the price, full of charm and life and entertaining on multiple levels but please remember it is a poker game and it's not for everyone."

Easily one of the most unique, and amusing, poker games I've ever played. With a plethora of interesting characters like GLaDOS, Brock Samson, Reginald Van Winslow and Ash Williams, this game has a ton of hysterical moments with each character exchanging quips and discussing various topics like personal servitude and job openings. The gameplay itself is fun and always engaging, using features like 'tells' and 'bounties' to create another layer of challenge and play style is beyond awesome. The different felts, decks and chips give you more reason to keep playing and earning fat stacks and the various easter eggs, references and jokes are all pretty clever. This game is also pretty hard to rage about, even when you lose a hand, just because of how utterly likeable and hilarious the characters are. I recommend this game to any poker fan, especially those who also love Evil Dead, the Venture Bros, Portal, Borderlands. By game mechanics alone, this game is great but when one takes into account the creativy and humor behind it, it's amazing. 10/10."

Poker Night 2, however, seems to take that logic and throw it out the window.Before, your experience mainly depended on your skills with the element of chance that all card games have to offer. However, in Poker Night 2, the odds seem to be stacked against you. (Or at least is a buggy mess, but considering the types of glitches I've come across it's likely the former.)As I mentioned above, this seems to be a buggy mess. For instance, during a showdown against Claptrap, the odds meter on the top of the screen read my odds as 51%.... and Claptrap's as 52%.I've also been the victim of ""lesser readings"" as I call them, where the game interperets your hand not as the highest it possibly can, but rather as the lowest. For instance, in a 1 on 1 showdown with Max, a Flush that I had was read as a single pair of 2s; still technically right, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonetheless.All in all, Poker Night 2 is a terribly broken trainwreck that pales in comparison to the original. Sure the new opponents are a nice change but I feel that the glitches and bugs it presents make it unworthy of most Steam libraries."

Although several of the exchanges between the characters are honestly funny the first or second time you hear them, they quickly lose their luster. Especially after you listen to Claptrap or GladOS smack talking you with the same line for the hundredth time after making a completely reasonable and statistically valid call or raise that just turned into bad luck because of a gut shot turn or river card in a hand that the AI had no business being in after the flop. Seriously, the option to skip dialogue would have gone a long way with this game.This game really has no value other than providing a cheap way to acquire some Borderlands 2 and TF2 vanity items.

The conversation between the character's is really great, and with the addition of GLaDOS as a dealer, gives you 1 more person that talks. I like the % that each player has in a showdown, giving you an idea of who's winning. To buy additionals, you need tokens, which you always get if you aren't the first to get eliminated. To get the special items for other games, you don't just need to eliminate the person who put it on play, you need to complete 3 challenges then win the tournament.

The computer clearly helps the AI by giving good cards to it in the river most of the time (I tested it just for the heck of it by going for the showdown all the time an at around 80% of the hands the AI won with bad cards by getting help in the river). Because of this Texas Hold'em is basically unplayable as it becomes a luck based guessing game with no strategy involved. Omaha is better so if you really want to see Sam & Max talking trash that game mode is the way to go. The AI itself is pretty bad, it makes stupid decisions while every character has a distinct playstyle that is easy to read. They never change their playstyles, they are always reacting the same way which makes the experience boring.And then there are the so called bounty challenges where completing 3 of them will unlock the chance to compete for one of the character bounties. Some of these challenges are nice and they require a bit of skill to pull off, others are purely luck based with a small percentage being outrageously luck based. This last category absolutely destroys the enjoyment of the game because if you get challenges like ""win a hand with 2 opponents going all in ""or ""win with the higher kicker"" your next move will be to just go and uninstall this mess instead of waiting for circumstances you have no chance of affecting occur. What's even worse is that you can't skip these challenges so if you get a bad 3 you're basically done for.Anyway the atmosphere is pretty cool, the unlockable decorations are nice and the characters are funny but everything gets old quickly. There's also no way to skip repeating jokes so you'll hear the same stuff all the time.Bad, really bad game."

It's also interesting how the graphics for each character remain true to the games they are from, though I did have random frame issues (I run a 7970 and a 4GHz 8 core processor) at times for no apparent reason. Overall, I bought the game for $2.50 cents during the holiday sale and I'm not at all disappointed.

The kicker was that once I found a way that got it working, after I closed it and started it up again it wouldn't work.  Each solution would work maybe twice, and then its back to the same old crashing before the telltale logo even comes up.  I was able to get it to start in compatibility with windows 98/ME but then it must store the save file somewhere else when you do that because it made makes you start over.  I started looking to see if I could find where the new save file is placed, but I realized that this game is taking up waaay more of my time than its worth.  I have literally spent 45 minutes starting it up and having it crash on me.

However, it's not hard for me to point out all of its extremely blatent flaws so I'll cut to the chase.If you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker for fun, move on. If you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker at a simulated friendly table, move on. Now, if you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker at an unfriendly table AND having the computer always stack the deck in favor of the other players, then this is the poker game for you.You are forced to play ridiculously conservatively if you want so much as a chance at winning. Have a pair of kings? The computer gets a pair of aces. You have two pair? The computer gets three of a kind. Bluffing might as well not even exist since even if the computer bluffs with a worse hand than yours, they'll still draw what they need to beat you 80% of the time.On top of feeling more akin to playing a slot machine with two of its reels broken than playing a fair game of poker, this game's dialoge gets grating fast. Most of the longer conversations in the first Poker Night at the Inventory were still about only two thirds as long as some of the drawn out gags in this game. This wouldn't be as bothersome as it is if you could decrease how often characters talk like in the first game, but for seemingly no reason, this and the difficulty option have been removed.In conclusion, if you want to buy a fun single player poker game that feels fair with entertaining characters, buy Poker Night at the Inventory and skip this sadly inferior sequel."

,Not Recommended,234710,1870917,"Posted: 13 May, 2013",all,Will T.TVR,"Prior to this game, I was under the impression that a series was supposed to get better as it went on. Apparently Telltale is losing their touch...Poker Night was a tough act to follow, and while this game had the potential to top it with its cast of characters, it fails hard on many levels, not the least of which is the CPU's blatant cheating (why on earth would they make a cheating AI when they had a perfectly-working non-cheating one in the first game? Cheating AIs are only supposed to be employed when there is no better alternative ... or when your game is Mario Kart). Went all-in after being dealt a pair of aces? Someone else got a pair of jacks, and the next card on the table is 100% going to be a jack. Game tells you you have a 99% chance of winning? Your opponent is guaranteed to get the one card that would let them win. Just folded? Oh look - THERE'S that card you needed! Too bad you'll never see it again.There is also a disproportionately large percentage of the dialog dedicated solely to insulting the player. I know it's supposed to be funny, but when your game isn't exactly relying on its own fun merit to begin with (face it, the only worthwhile takeaway is the TF2 and BL2 loot), calling the player a moron for playing it is the last thing you want to do if you expect them to keep playing.Speaking of dialog, what banter isn't used to call the player an idiot is repetitive and dull. The characters have different conversations based on the unlockable theme currently in use, but there are only maybe 4 or 5 per theme, meaning you'll hear the same crap over and over unless you change tables every tournament. They're not nearly as funny as the first game either. There are some humorous animations when others get busted out (if you aren't the first one to bust out, which you will be 90% of the time - again, cheating CPUs), but they don't always play, so you'll likely never see most of them. (Speaking of animations, characters, especially GLaDOS, get frozen mid-animation A LOT. It's these kinds of bugs that remind you why testing is necessary.)NOT recommended. Save your $5 and find something worthwhile, like Just Cause 2 when it goes on sale again, which it does often."

Seriously, there could not be enough Steve for me but he only pops up every so often.  MORE STEVE!  One downside is supposedly if you buy the other players drinks they show their tells more.

Typically a result of poor planning and design; it can have a damaging effect on the project as unplanned, not fully tested additions over-enccumber its original design.That is what I would say of Poker Night 2, The first Poker Night was a pleasing preoccupation that came out from under the radar to surprise anyone who played it. It wasn't an AAA game by any means, but it knew what it was and delievered on it in style. Poker Night 2 just seems scattered, unfocused with it new features, its new unlocks and how to obtain them, even some of the new computer opponents don't exactly jive with its core.Let's start with probably the most glarring problem of Poker Night 2, which you could say flys in the face of why many of us bought this game, its unlocks and new unlock system. In the first, opportunities to win the TF2 unlocks appeared randomly and only needed you to bust out the character holding the unlock. It resulted in many restarted tournaments in hope of of a drop but it was sensible for the scope of the game. In Poker Night 2 you get to accomplish three different 'Bounty Challenges' before you can have the chance to win one of the unlockable items, which required you to win the whole tournament!! Now, I can see why Telltale changed this, a few more hurdles means more people will see more of the game. But unless you're ALT-F4ing every time a hand doesn't go well; as I wasn't for most of my playtime, It becomes a battle of attrition. In fact if it wasn't for the humour of the game I'd find playing this game about as relaxing as a sudden death elimination tourney for Rock, Paper, Scissors.The massively improved AI, although an welcome addition from the wild betting from the first one, doesn't help the situation....Presentation in the game is same as the last Poker Night, Its a mostly competent blend of several art and graphical styles; albeit with all the same animation bugs. That's fine for a game of this scale. What is really important is the personalities that are the game, some are a good fit, some fall flat.... So in not particular order here are my thoughts on the cast.Sam - Totally great, witty and with max throwing in his own sharp comments, always a delight. I only wish he was voice by the same man who voiced Sam in the cartoon series (Harvey Atkin).Brock Samson - As perhaps the most obscure character of the cast he is the most poorly written. His watered down references to The Venture Bros. contridict many facts of the show. And his presence only feels like he's there to remind the world season 5 is on its way (after three years).Ash Williams - I've never seen The Evil Dead series, but I liked Ash alot. He's a cocky, one liner dispensing zero to anti-hero that's prone to get in over his head.Claptrap - Hate him, should've been instead either Elis from Left 4 Dead or The Scout from TF2.GLaDOS - Her inclusion as the dealer has suffice to say; considerably dampened my enthusiasm for a Portal 3.So what's the take away? Well in some ways its a better poker game than the first one. But in making its sequel Telltale tripped over its own success with the first and made it more complicated than it needed to be. Although you can't fault them for being more ambitious, you can criticalize them for turning that ambition into Scope Creep."

The banter between all of them is interesting (at least on the first go) and I seem to have learned something about Sam & Max, Borderlands, and The Evil Dead series from these exchanges.  However, poker Brock does seem kind of flat compared to TV Brock. Something that was obvious to me,  since I started watching the show about the same time I bought this game.-The items. They stuff you get for TF2 is the only things that really motivated me to get this game. I really want the Long Fall Boots.-The backgrounds are cool. I personally enjoyed the Venture Brothers set.Cons:-The game cheats. I could not believe how many times I’ve had a decent hand (three of a kind, straights, flushes, and at the very least really strong two pairs) and then been blown out of the water. One time during the final showdown of a tournament I had a full house (three Kings and two Aces) and I lost to a four of a kind (four Aces, yhaa for serious). Never have I been more frustrated by a game of chance in my entire life. And forget about attempting to win by bluffing or with a single pair. I’ve only down that once and a handful of times respectively.-The banter gets old/takes too long/is insulting. While the opponents will engage in story telling with each other, there isn’t a moment when the player isn’t constantly bad mouthed. It’s especially bad when you’re on a losing streaking even though you’re getting good hands. Not only that but it’s the same stories and banter that you’ve already heard a hundred times in the last few minutes. I’d be fine with that if you could skip it, but a lot of the banter locks you out from taking your turn.Overall:There really isn’t anything that needs to be said about this game. Essentially it turns your computer into a glorified video poker machine. The only real impetus that has even kept me playing was so that I could score some swag for Team Fortress 2.The game isn’t bad, but I just wish that the game’s cheap tactics didn’t kill any of the fun that I had had with it. 4/10"

I hesitated to review it as like I said I am no e-poker afficiando, so the biggest thing on offer here, the poker AI itself is not something I can compare to other games besides the first one, briefly.Let me say that it is fun to play around with, the ai does seem uneven at times as there are really really long odds for one of the computer opponents to beat your nice flush or straight, and they get it. A Lot. It is still fun and thier banter is funny for the most part. Catching it on sale is the icing on the cake for me, but this one has already been reccomended by me to some others and it is good for some laughs and occaisonally a halfway decent round of poker breaks out."

You aren't going to pay much for this game and thats okay. Poker Night 2  has an awesome cast of characters: for those who actually know who the characters are. This game is both comedic and fun. I don't know what its like to play this game without knowing any of the cast but even if that was the case a portion of the comedy stands on it's own without having to understand a reference. The cel-shaded art style is done very well and allows for characters from a cartoon/ a live action film to fit in visually without seeming weird. The length of this game's fun is based on how much you enjoy the characters and playing poker with them. Eventually the jokes will repeat but it still creates a nice atmosphere for your standard poker night.You will also recieve hats in tf2 and items for Borderlands 2 for doing certain things.

What makes it great, though, isn't just the starring cast, but the fact that it makes poker accessable and fun again (or fun for the first time, if you've never played).As a five-handed game, the player is given alot of oppurtunity to play without losing his/her virtual shirt. The other players are good enough not to be cowed by a bullish player, but not cut-throat enough to push a timid player out every time.And, even if you don't really know anything about the characters in the game (and, really, where have you been?), the witty banter and random sillyness is enough to make even the slowest of grinding sessions a treat to sit through. Seriously, you don't even have to bet a hand to have fun. And, there's enough back-and-forth between them that its never feels repetative.Still, with the option to fast-forward through hands you're not in, and the fact that other than throwing out a tell, the characters never hold up the game, Poker NIght 2 offers a fast-paced poker experience, with lots of unclockables and rewards to keep you coming back.For a price cheaper than a movie ticket, you really can't go wrong."

While what the characters say can become repetative after a couple of hours of gameplay, you will find some new stuff scattered about after that point.In the game you win ""Inventory Tokens"" which you can use to buy different unlocks, such as cards, poker chips, and table felts. While these things are nice, they are for the most part not necessary and only make things interesting in terms of the game itself when you have all the unlocks for a certain franchise activated at once.There are also bounty challenges in the game, which if you win, you get some special items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2, which is nice, but if you are not a big fan of these games, then the bounty challenges are not important to you.All in all however, the characters do make this game worth buying.

I haven't played the predecessor in quite a long while, but I believe it was less repetitive in that regard. Additionally to Texas Hold 'Em you can now play Omaha as well, which I highly recommend, because it is much more fun. The Poker Night 2 unlockables are felts, chips and decks for each of the represented games/movies/TV series and activating a full set completely changes the room you are playing in AND the soundtrack!

I'm by no means a pro level poker player, but I still know enough about it to know that this game does not care about your level of experience.Half of the point in poker is to bluff your opponents into thinking you've got a good hand when you have a crap one or vice versa. In this game, you CANNOT bluff. The AI simply doesn't let you. It knows when you have a good hand and knows when you have a bad one.Not only that but the AI gives you two choices in 90% of the hands. 1) Fold. 2) Go all in. Seriously. The number of times the computer decides to make one of them go all in is rediculous. So you can either go all in with a pair of jacks, thinking you'll come out on top when you get a third jack on the flop, only to be sent drowning at the river because one of the others somehow got a straight. Honestly, I hate to feel like I'm complaining about this because it could just be that I'm a bad player, but the number of complaints I'm seeing about how badly the AI was programmed in this game makes me think it isn't just me.If you want this game for the TF2/Borderlands items, don't waste your time. You won't get them unless you invest a lot of agonising hours into losing tournament after tournament.

You can get a much better poker experience elsewhere if that’s all you’re after. If you are interested in the characters or just must have all the goodies, then it is still a recommendation but it may not be as much fun as it was last time. No matter who you are, you’re getting a terrible poker game but an okay game – if that makes any sense.From an original review onAnother Castle"

I didn't like it whatsoever, but this particular iteration is a delight. I can actually play Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha now, I understand how they work for the most part. THis game has helped me realise the psychological aspects of poker a lot more.The rewards the game gives you are excellent, and the customisation and themed dialogue is a nice touch, though you'll probably still find these people repeating themselves a fair amount. Also, if you're not a huge telltale fan, you might not know a lot of the characters. PErsonally, I only recognised Moxxi, GLaDOS, Claptrap and the Host, having played next to no other telltale games.I can't tell you if this game plays a good game of poker, but I can tell you that the game is very well made, and fits together well. A good, solid choice and a very sound purchase if you own Borderlands 2 or like to play Team Fortress 2.But please let us reroll our bounties, game, winning a showdown with a high card was nigh impossible"

The dialogue was entertaining, the ""showdown flops"" were exciting, and generally decent. It is, however, when one reaches tournament #5 that the game decides to bend you over and show you who's boss. An example: If you have two pair and the AI you're in a showdown with has a only a pair, the game will make either the second-to-last card or the very last card coincide with the AI's pair, making him have a 3-of-a-kind. Thus converting your easy win of ""90%-chance of succeeding"" to literally jackshit. This is just ONE example.If by chance you are one of only two people left at the end of the tournament and have twice or three-times as much chips as your last opponent, the game will give the AI consecutive wins and before you know it the game basically stole your win from you. These occurrances happen constantly from tournament #5 onwards. Also, bluffing for some reason becomes broken, where whenever you bluff, the majority of the AI have a strong hand. Whenever you have a good hand, the AI go ""All-In"" and scare you out. Plus, most of the time it was a bluff on their part.All in all this game sucks you in thinking its fun and fair, then traps you in a never ending vicious cycle of rigged gameplay, ever making you hell-bent on winning at least ONE game and then stopping. But that'll never happen."

There are unskippable scenes within the game - even when clicking ""skip to next hand"".  You have to sit through scenes when all you want to do is play the next hand.  2) In too many cases the game doesn't know how to play Poker.  It doesn't know how to match cards - namely, when you have a flush vs. a straight vs. a full house, or even a 2 pair.  It's key that none of the issues are with how the game is played, but rather how the game counts cards.  It's up in the air whether it's more frustraing that the game can't figure out if you have 2 pair vs. waiting for some silly cutscene when you select ""skip to the next hand."""

Aside from just being a game to play poker in, it provides several game items for both Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2 for completing bounty challenges, or chances to win an item from each gambler and someone else special. Besides all the nice things already in the game, Poker Night 2 includes a hilarious set of dialogue from each character. You might hear Claptrap and Brock Samson having a discussion over people using melee weapons on Pandora, or perhaps the secret endings for having a complete set of cosmetic poker items and winning the tournament. Above all else, if you don't enjoy playing poker in any way, you won't enjoy Poker Night 2 for what it really is.On a point scale, I would be giving a 9/10 just simply because the AI can sometimes have some really rediculous hands in actual gameplay."

You may have a connectivity issue the very game you beat a bounty. If that happens you won't get the Steam Achievement for it, which will in turn mean you don't get your tf2 item and your borderlands 2 item.And if you happen to look up Steam support about it, they will tell you they can do nothing about it, and so you should delete your save and do it all over again. Mind you, Scout boots and Zero's head GladoS bounty only goes up after beating every other bounty. Best case scenario, you're a decent poker player and manage to beat all tourneys in a row, completing the feats to start up the bounty (easy to not so easy stuff, as stealing a pot on the river, or finishing second or better twice in a row - you lose 1, it's 2 extra tourneys to win), it will take at least 10 tourneys to unlock them.Which takes me to yet another issue. Game chatter is fun first time each dialogue. It should probably get old around the 5th round. And the mocking from losing a tournament and starting the next one isn't skippable.If you're not in for the items, it's decent. For about 5 games. At that point you'll just wish you could skip a dialogue once it's started."
,Recommended,234710,15013437,"Posted: 22 March, 2015",all,Belgarion of Riva,"I wrote a review for Poker Night 1 a long time ago, but I made some good points.This sequel expands greatly on the forumla from the first game, adding tells, themes and alcohol.As far as the characters go, Brock is essentially the Heavy, Sam is a more boring Max who constantly refers to Max's behaviour for humour, Claptrap is an annoying robot, but Ash is a nice addition. GLaDOS, on the other hand, is genius. Combining the role of the dealer with one of the best written characters in game history really works in this game's favour.The dialogue between the characters is better than ever. With the 4 players, GLaDOS, Max and the odd peripheral, the whole game is very alive. The natural breaks and continuations in coversation add a lot and allow funny dialogues to persist between hands. There was one laugh out loud moment where Ash (voiced by a good Bruce Campbell impersonator) made a subtle Burn Notice reference. Cracked me up.With the original, however, they could never write enough unique interactions before you start getting repeats. And with the slow, long, ongoing nature of the game, you will get bored of them. At least in the first, there was an option to disable the interactions. In this I resorted to muting them while watching TV.The gameplay is still poker, but it isn't a great poker sim. The 4 characters have distinct playstyles which, while realistic, makes them rather annoying and predictable. Ash will usually be the first to bust while Brock will fold or win. The 'random' cards vary from rigged against you to rigged for you, but maybe that's just the nature of the game. It's just that the regularity of the one card that'd beat me showing up in the river makes me pause and doubt.The bounty challenges range from basic to interesting to almost impossible, but if you stick with it long enough and learn the terminology, you can do any of them. I actually have to thank this game for that last bit; I've never understood the terms used in poker, but I had to learn them to unlock all the items. The flop, the turn, hole cards, everything. It taught me well.Overall, the characters are fun to listen to (at least for the first 6 hours) and the unlockable rewards for Borderlands 2 and TF2 give you something to aim for and take away. Once you've unlocked them though, there is very little reason to keep at it. Maybe if you particularly like a character playing, you could stick around to hear more, but there will be a limit to how many times their banter entertains you.A decent poker game, well-written and with good other-game unlockables. Worth your time."

The game offers a nice intense but still relaxing game of Texas or Omaha Hold 'Em. The characters are funny and well implemented, and you get a prize in TF2/Borderlands 2 every few wins, so whats better than that? It's a game that can suck you in and make you addicted, but is also a very great game for picking up every once in a while. Some say they want an online version but I think that would take away the fun in determining what each character's tells. If you want a relaxing casual game of poker with video game characters.

In my honest opinion, this game really is worth $5 alone, as it's actually a really great poker simulator, and it actually feels like you're playing against real people.  It feels like they have built upon the original AI, so these AI's actually feel like they are playing against you rather than outright cheating you out of all of your hands like in the first version (where they've pulled a Royal Flush twice on me).The dialogue is amazing, although I think there are fewer voice lines in this game than the first, although I guess it must have cost more to get the voice actors together to record some lines?  It didn't really bother me that the Ash voice actor isn't Bruce Campbell, since it was fun having Ash give cheesy lines throughout the game.I'd have to say my favorite character this time around had to probably be Sam, as he had some of the funniest interactions with everyone being a 6ft tall dog♥♥♥♥♥♥(GET IT, HE'S A DETECTIVE HA HA HAH HAHAHA).  Max is sitting in the back near the table and always felt free to throw in 4th-wall breaking lines to make you feel awful to be playing virtual poker, and the game doesn't hold back in reminding you that you're playing against AIs!I had a lot of fun playing through this, and I still have one challenge left to go, but it's a relatively short game (unless you really want a poker fix and have nowhere else to play), but I think it's worth $5.  They've even added Omaha Hold'em as a selection if you ever get sick of playing Texas Hold'em!  Even if you don't care for the fun character interactions with each other, I guess you can have comfort in the fact that there's new items that come with this game if you play Borderlands 2 or Team Fortress 2..  dat portal turret assassin skin..."

Oh that still amuses.Max's voice change is a little off-pitch, leaning towards being deeper than previous but otherwise gives a decent performance.  Sam's dialogue is hit and miss (much like his oft-referred to aiming skills in the adventure games) and isn't delivered as well as it could have been (when teleported using Doc Venture's experimental transporter, he asks if it makes his ""keister look fat"", where ""fat"" could easily be ""flat"" with the way the dialogue was delivered.Moving on, some of Ash William's facial animations leaves a lot to be desired and whilst Brock Samson is captured wonderfully from his animated equivalent...his animations can be ill-suited to his dialogue (""go ahead...take it from me"" is a play on his first season line should anyone try to take his knife from him, but instead of a menacing and sly look of which Patrick Warburton's delivery is, instead it's a look of a crazed man and doesn't work well at all.Before I move on to the rest of the game, GLADOS's lines become extremely repititve very quickly.  Each time she thinks you're making a bad decision, she'll comment ""Well...that was a clever move which won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior"" which she seems to make regardless of what level of hand you have (I've had flushes, full houses, four of kinds and ace high straights at the flop when this line is uttered).The game itself offers both Texas Hold 'Em (as per the original) and Omaha Hold 'Em.  These don't really need any explanation, although the AI of each character is unique and all understand what makes a winning hand...though Claptrap and Ash rely on bluffing and luck as opposed to Brock's relative high skill but frustration if there hasn't been a big pot and Sam's hesitant nature unless he feels really lucky/got a great hand makes the game as dynamic and almost infinitely replayable.Now if only a patch was released so as to adjust the dialogue options!"

Every now and then there will be a bit of dialogue that goes for 30 seconds or more, stopping the gameplay (and unfortunately, Claptrap seems to have the bulk of these), which is irksome when you've seen the bit many times before, but this is pretty rare.  I'm familiar with all the characters except Brock Samson, but I love Patrick Warburton; he's got the best lines in the game.  Ash's voice is spot on by Danny Webber -- it's hard to believe that's not Bruce in there!  GLaDOS is a great, efficient dealer too.

The novelty of having characters from other games is pretty neat, and their conversations are kind of funny, however they are repetitive, and gets boring after the first 20 minutes of gameplay. Claptrap does a ton of stupid stuff too, which I thought was funny in the first 20 minutes of the game, but it really slows the poker game down and I find myself dozing off at my computer when I play this game. I love poker, but I think this game revolves too much around computer AI conversation than it does actual poker. This game would be a lot better if we had an option to turn off the conversations, and video cut scenes for a more efficient game. Now all I do is go ""all in"" .... all the time, just to save time. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless things were cleaned up more. The game feels like you're watching the same movie over and over again.

It's just one of those nice casual games you can jump into if you're looking to play some standard poker, the scenery is nice with unlocks, the ambient dialogue/cutscene scenarios between playing pass the time just fine.  Some may say it gets repetitive after a while, but I haven't noticed as much and still find myself chuckling from time to time.  However, there are some relatively large downsides I've come across spending time in the game, as follows.  While the dialogue didn't necessarily get stale for me, being unable to skip the cutscenes, or long-winded conversations to get the next hand rolling is incredibly annoying, to the point of just quitting sometimes.  Also, the game seems to have the A.I cheat mode activated EVERY SINGLE TIME you go for a win, or seemingly gets ramped up as the amount of npc's are removed from the table, which is very frustrating, but fortuneately so common, it's predictable.  You'll find yourself losing much more, the more money you have it seems.  Lastly, one of the biggest killers is the final challenge....which is...Winning a showdown with just a high card, you have to win a showdown versus any number of npc's, with just a single high card, and no other combination on the table, which is absolutely rediculous, and may prevent you from unlocking all of the extras, which it has for many people.  So in the end it's kind of a hit or miss, but I enjoyed it enough for the atmosphere, which is aided by the fact it is so cheap."

It also has GLaDOs as the dealer, which really adds to the proceedings.But yeah, still only good if you really like the characters or if you want to learn Texas Hold 'em or Omaha rules."

Especially since Sam has brought Max into the inventory once again, so he often interjects, mimics and/or brandishes his gun to humourous effect now that he's not tied to the table. Ash and Brock are fairly non-energetic conversationalists, but you need someone to balance the Claptrap/Sam+Max hilarity, and Glados just demeans everyone.The tournament organiser also interjects more often, lending an offended upper class voice to the conversation.Getting the players drunk would likely affect the conversation as well.In all, I think the conversations in this game are more humourous and varied than the first.As for the Poker, Omaha seems like a much more interesting game than Texas, purely because your hole cards afford more viability in potential flops. So your hand is far less likely to be crap or excellent until that river goes down. As a result you see more rivers and can then bet intelligently off that information.Some things could be improved, such as not looking over every characters shoulder when watching the remainder of the match. Just put the values down beneath their name or split the screen, otherwise it takes too much time.But the poker's better, the characters and conversation better (all though get back to me after I've memorised all the lines), and the prize distribution less frustrating to those who can play. This is probably the best poker game I've played."

There's no 1 in ~3,000 chance to get an achievement this time around.  I completed the game in 11 hours (much less in actuality, as I was just goofing around in the beginning).  The addition of GLaDOS as the dealer rather than that one character very few people know of is just the icing on the cake.  Percantages used to indicate the likelyhood of winning the hand is a very nice addition for newer players to the game.  The way the other competitors play the game has been considerably improved as well; tells can inform a player about either the character's hand or mood.However, if the player is playing the game just to grab the Borderlands 2 and/or Team Fortress 2 items, they had better know how to play poker.  Without a difficulty setting, the game can be a bit harsh on newcomers, and no longer can the player simply reset the game until a character offers up their bounty.  Players must complete a set of three challenges, which can also scare away newcomers as some aren't written well enough for them.  A good example is the challenge 'Double Up', the meaning of which is hard to interpret.While character interactions are quite entertaining, I unfortunately had to hear them repeat only a couple minutes after another.  When the interaction is Claptrap's sound card stuttering (which is very annoying to hear), I can see how the player would be likely to listen to something else while playing the game.  This new game also allows for cheesing your way through tournaments unlike the last game.  If you had lost quite a lot to a hand, you can simply exit the game before the next hand starts and you will retain your currency.All in all, this game makes obtaining the Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2 items fun.  However, there is not much else if you decide to play beyond it: you will likely be close to obtaining all of the achievements or hearing every single audio dialog in the game."

Throwing all in seems to win 70% of the time.But at times when you know you've got an amazing hand, three other players somehow also have super amazing hands.Check out my screen shots but one time three players had Straight Flushes... what the?!!!Biggest disappointment is Bruce Campbel DOES NOT voice Ash from Army of Darkness... what gives?!!That alone would have made this game worth while but sadly disappointing.After a while getting insulted constantly by the characters really wears you down and you will find yourself disliking them in their respective games/movies/genres...Sad that this could have had amazing potential but Tell Tale Games got lazy with this one.

In short the game is pretty amusing and its poker.  The game feels a little rigged at times but is over all enjoyable

But, in terms of just having a nice poker experience? The original was better.In my honest opinion, there are two three things to know about this game.1. The random card shuffler is not random.2. The original Poker Night 1 was better.3. Poker Night 2 is VERY repetitive.In short, the original was much more relaxed. I found the characters from the original game more fun to play with/against, and I enjoyed how it didn't play on its own gimmick. In the new version, being able to turn the entire room thematic is cool, but it really gets tiresome having the exact same ending sequence play over and over again with no variation. GLADOS as the dealer is irritating, yes insulting the player is kind of her thing, but I don't actually want to hear the dealer speaking when I'm trying to play. Many aspects of this game destroyed immersion for me, but bad stuff aside you get exactly what you asked for. A poker game with pop culture icons. Enjoy it! And make sure when you're done you open up Poker Night 1 for the full experience."

It's not really encouraging to keep playing when you can't skip the dialogue either (and it's especially annoying when you're on Claptrap's bits because the game doesn't even keep going during a lot of his moments). Only newer dialogue, though kept to a high minimal, are activated when you unlock & activate a specific group of chips, decks, & felts which are obtainable via tokens. The tokens are earned from coming in 3rd or higher in the tournament.Though there's entertainment to be had it wears off pretty fast.And I'm a sucker for poker with a bit of other entertainment on the side."

,Not Recommended,234710,7802452,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Macho Fantastico,"Telltale Games' Poker Night 2 is the sequel to their 2010 poker release featuring a cast of colorful characters from video games, animation and more. Combining these personalities with the widely popular card game of poker might seem like the perfect combination, yet it proved otherwise with Poker at the Inventory. Whilst it wasn't a bad game of poker, it most certainly wasn't one of the best. Those with poker knowledge picked at it's flaws in regards with A.I and a great deal more. So can Telltale's second attempt smooth out this deck of cards and give poker fans the game they've always wanted.Four new familiar characters make an appearance for Poker Night 2, those being Sam (from Sam and Max), Ash Williams (from the Evil Dead series), Brock Samson (from Venture Bros.) and that chatty robot Claptrap (from the Borderlands franchise), oh and we mustn't forget Portal 2's GLaDOS as the dealer. Generally speaking it's an interesting cast who, with the help of some solid writing provide a reasonable amount of amusing dialogue scattered throughout the rounds of poker you'll play. Speaking of poker, the game features both Texas Hold'em and Omaha variations for you to enjoy. I'm not a poker expert (I'm more of an absolute newbie) so I can't speak technically for how well Poker Night 2 handles the more in depth areas of the game, yet from my perspective I found the poker to be less enjoyable than some previous experiences of virtual poker I'd played.While poker might have been side activities in the likes of Red Dead Redemption, I'd argue that Rockstar Games did a better job of explaining the game of poker in a more structured way. There is a slideshow styled tutorial that attempts to explain the basics of the game, but I found this lacking. From my point of view, the view of someone new to this card game I was disappointed with the teaching tools available. After all not everyone knows the game of poker inside and out. Of course eventually you get an understanding of the hands and the rules at play, but if you don't exactly know what you're doing then you'll have a more difficult time of it at first. Even with an understanding however, I wouldn't say Poker Night 2 provides a particularly great game of poker as it's clear even for me that the A.I still remains unnaturally inconsistent and flawed.From a presentation point of view, Telltale Games have done a solid job in giving the game a charming personality. Chatter between the characters is often witty, humorous and filled with references that fans will get a kick out of it, there's particularly a few moments that provided me with a good chuckle. However it's inevitable that this chatter would repeat itself and it starts repeating itself a little too often, causing frustration as I waited for Claptrap to make the same card jokes for the thirtieth time. Thankfully you can skip some of the bigger stories the characters have to tell, but it's a shame you can't skip more of the dialogue entirely. It's nice to have this cast to face off against, but when they start to get in the way of the actual game you have to wonder how useful their additions are.There are a range of unlockables both in-game and within both Gearbox Software's Borderlands 2 and Valve's Team Fortress 2 for you to earn. It's a nice touch and an added reason to attempt the tougher objectives thrown at you as you look to earn another opportunity to win one of the four character specific prizes, which is where you'll earn those extra goodies. Of course there's unlockable decks, felts and chips to purchase with tokens so there's certainly a reason for you to invest some time playing poker with Brock, Sam, Claptrap and Ash. Well, that is if you're somehow invested in Team Fortress 2 and or Borderlands 2.So I'm left flattened and disappointed with Poker Night 2. It doesn't exactly play an offensively poor game of poker, it's just not particularly fun nor challenging and that's coming from someone new to this popular card game. When it does offer a challenge it feels unfair, leaving you angry rather than more determined to become a better player. I'll admit my experiences with virtual poker is limited, yet even I can see flaws in Telltale Games design here. There's a great deal of personality to like as the cast interact with each other, but even that loses it's spark a few hours in once you've heard the same joke for the fiftieth time. With better forms of virtual poker out there, I'd argue that you might be better served enjoying a few rounds in the wilds of Red Dead Redemption or even the jungles of Far Cry 3, because while they might be side activities, they make poker both approachable and fun."

You beat at least 3 of the opponents at the table, and for some reason at the last second you go all-in and you got like 3 Aces straight, the last opponent (Usaully Max), seems to get the last second advantage and all your hard earned pot was lost. This is just my luck, even though it happened to me 4-5 times, but you'll probably be a more fortunate player. Yes, after what all happened to me, I do recommend this game."

The only thing is you can't longer edit on options how much of a talk you want on the table, even thought still pretty good, isnt floodin' but isnt also like a table of pokerstars. The development of the characters between the talks are really good and fun. The personalities they have according whats happening sometimes is like you are really dealing with they in real life, the emotions and expressions they reffer are really good and really close to humans. I see that telltale succeed at this part mostly. On the other hand if you are only here for the items I will tell you something; Only buy it if you are thinking to learn some poker, otherwise, this will be another stacked game on your library.85/100This game has some little things that are actually annoying in some point, e.g. you cant preview the cards, table and the rest of the unlocks before spend the tokens, and some times the way the camera chooses to go with the dialogues makes the tells of the characters impossible to see due to be on the other side of the table which can affect the result of the game."
