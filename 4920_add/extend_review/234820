The latest version now scans your PC for missing or outdated drivers, offers to download and install the new drivers (you can choose which ones you want), and then does so with one click, creating a system restore point before applying the changes. Optionally, and by default, it will back up your current drivers before making any changes as a double protection, and restoring the drivers through Driver Fusion is less dangerous than reverting to a system restore point if you make any changes to your system in the meantime.The developer's has demonstrated commitment to improving the product, proactive follow-up, and that they don't just promise, they deliver. Well done, Treexy!Original (and retracted) review, for context:Unfortunately, this program stops short of actually being useful. It won't find better or newer drivers for you. It won't download them or install them. It just gives a different view of information that can already be obtained through standard utilities. It does identify the files and registry entries that are associated with a driver, which could come in handy, but it in no way justifies the claim of being ""the complete device and driver solution for your PC"". If you don't already know how to manage device drivers, this program won't help you a bit. If you do know how to manage them, the assistance it brings is minimal."

Program crashes a lot, especially when performing an operation for the first time, such as entering the serial code or downloading a new driver.2. Despite being managed through Steam, this software requires you to sign up an account with them. Kind of a hastle considering it's managing drivers on your local machine. This isn't exactly an MMO. If I can get my Skyrim save-games through the Steam cloud, anything you're storing could probably go there too.3. Auto-login option doesn't always work.4. Downloading is still a very convoluted process:- When you're downloading something, the rest of the program is inaccessible.- You can't pause a download.- You can't queue multiple downloads.- When viewing potential download candidates you can't view the current drivers info and compare them. You have to memorise one and then compare to the other.- Downloads aren't filtered by whether they are signed. If you're freaked out by Windows warnings, be brave!- The program will offer the current driver as a download, even if it is currently installed. Unless you've check that it's not the same one, you might perform a redundant download.5. There are a few little finishing touches that are lacking. For example, when looking at an installed driver's release date, the format is (m)m/dd/yyyy. When looking at prospective new drivers, their release dates are dd/mm/yyyy (my preferred). Its just the little things.Probably not worth the full price, depending on your rig and your resourcefulness, so try getting it on sale."

If like myself you have invested thousands of Dollars/Euro into your gaming rig, then Driver Fusion Premium should absolutely be in your software library. It will detect and resolve multiple driver issues that you were previously unaware were either missing/corrupted or outdated and I guaruntee after your first Driver Fusion Premium health check you'll be amazed at how many instrumental and obscure drivers begin populating the page. Driver Fusion Premium offers multiple driver maintainance features of which, I have listed in the lower portion of this review.Simply put, I can't recommend Driver Fusion Premium enough. The combination of the softwares seamless functionality, accessable interface and excellent customer service support offered by the developers Treexy here in the Steam forums are more than enough to warrant my recommendation to anyone interested in computer maintainance.Driver Fusion Premium Review Score:ːss13okːːss13okːːss13okːːss13okːːss13okːout ofːss13okːːss13okːːss13okːːss13okːːss13okːTreexy's Driver Fusion Premium customer service here on Steam is second to noneThe custormer support being given here on Steam by Treexy is second to none. If you have an issue or a question in regards to Driver Fusion Premium, Treexy will answer your questions and offer guidance for those who need it. Simply put, where other developers here on Steam fail Treexy succeeds. Treexy communicates directly through the forums in a candid manner on a daily basis, answering any questions you may have including but not limited to product questions, technical support and more. If you have a question about Driver Fusion Premium, post a thread and I guaruntee they'll respond in a timely manner.Why am I such a huge supporter of Treexy's Driver Fusion Premium?Driver Fusion Premium solved the infamous MadCatz Cyborg R.A.T 7 issues that have plagued so many but, had previously gone unsolved even by MadCatz and Cyborg themselves. Their answer has always been that it may be a faulty laser issue and an RMA may be the only solution. This wasn't the case whatsoever and was due to a driver distribution issue on their homepage. Driver Fusion Premium succeded where a manufacturer couldn't within seconds.If you are a MadCatz Cyborg owner and have experienced similar issues to what I explain in the thread below, more than likely Driver Fusion will resolve it. Due to space limitations if interested, please follow the link below to read my entire thread in regards to Driver Fusion Premium solving my MadCatz Cyborg R.A.T 7 issues here in the Steam forums.http://steamcommunity.com/app/234820/discussions/0/627456487109745825/Is the premium version worth 39.99?No, it's worth far more than that and it issues you a lifetime Steam liscense to use on multiple computers. I like many in the forums questioned as to whether or not Driver Fusion Premium functionality warranted it's price. After running the health check feature for the first time I was instantly converted into a believer, after seeing how many drivers were either outdated or missing/corrupted. If you value your tech and consider yourself a true entusiast, you owe it to yourself to make the purchase, you won't be dissapointed that you did. Read below for my detailed overview of the features you recieve with Driver Fusion Premium.Driver Fusion Premium Features OverviewMaintainance:Premium Health Check: The Driver Fusion Premium health check is what I and many other Driver Fusion Premium users consider to be it's most useful and more than likely most frequented feature.You will be presented with three available options to utilize during the health check, Driver backup, Missings Drivers and Outdated drivers which can all be selected either individually or as a group depending on your needs at the moment via check boxes residing next to each corresponding category. At the bottom left you will then be presented with the option to scan and once it's completed a fix option will replace it in the same location.Driver Fusion Premium edition will manage this section semi-automatically creating backups before anything is performed and then begin populating the screen with data in regards to missing and/or outdated drivers and offer available certified/signed driver to either replace them with. It will then ask if you wish to proceed with it's recommended fixes. Once the fix option is selected Driver Fusion Premium will begin downloading and installing the necessary driver file you have selected. Within minutes your installation is complete and you will then if necessary be prompted to restart your computer as with any driver installations, restart and everything will then be completed.I really can't praise the Driver Fusion Premium health check feature enough because it truly is something that any true enthusiast should own. If you like myself have heavily invested in your gaming rig or computer in general, this investment will pay for itself usually within it's first launch. Like myself most users proclaim an instant gain in general computer efficiency and some have even remedied ingame issues such as low fps, launch issues and more. I guaruntee if used correctly this program will absolutely be one of the most appreciated pieces of software in your library.Driver Family: Driver familiy offers and much more efficient and effective method of creating backups, deleting installed driver entries such as files and registry keys. Simply put this feature eliminates the need for programs such as CCleaner anymore and the mistakes that come with it such as deleting incorrect reg files etc. All driver associated tasks can now be accomplished directly here in Driver Fusion Premium in an easily organized and stress free manner. Another fantastic feature of Driver Fusion Premium.Device Control: Device control is basically access to windows device manager, although that can be achieved without Driver fusion Premium it is a welcome addition considering it makes management much easier with it being in this location as well.Computer:Desktop: Desktop will allow you to backup different layouts and screen resolution for furture restoration with the press of a button.Monitor: Monitor is exactly that, a hardware monitor that presents on the fly information in regards to functionality such as Processor, Graphics card, Hard drive and motherboard information.This is another nice addition that although may not be the most detailed monitor available, is fantastic to has such easy access to while working on maintainance.Management:History: History offers information that can be reviewed such as previously deleted/restored drivers which can also be rolled back to at this location. This is another essential feature in Driver Fusion Premium that shouldn't go unnoticed. Simply put it's a feature in the case you experience any issues after installation and need to revert back to a previous state.Filters: Here you can create filters in regards to all driver maintainance actions.Purchased Driver Fusion Premium and would like to learn more about it's functionality?Check out theComprehensive Driver Fusion Premium Guide(work in progrees) for a detailed explanation of Driver Fusion Premium and it's features. The guide will be completed by February 1, 2015 but, already offers quite a bit of information that may assist you."

Read the reviews on steam here, and i am super glad i finally caved! Updates ALL of your drivers with a couple clicks, about 50 i didnt even know about! Also showed me that i still had the drivers for my gtx680 installed (using 970 now). It also easily lets you pick and choose what drivers to back up. And another great feature ive been using is the monitor, keeps track of processor and graphic card loads, and temperatures all on one nice screen. And what really convinced me to buy it, is its yours for life. Free updates, never have to buy a ""new"" version. And you can use it on any PC you install steam on! Try the free version from their website, then if you like it buy it on steam.http://treexy.com/products/driver-fusionTreexy responded and I believe you can download driver fusion (free version) from steam and then later upgrade if you want. Also, steam achievements for cleaning up your drivers! A much much better achievement then looking up a girls skirt in lolipop chainsaw.6/24/15 Update 1: So bought downloaded arkham knight, it recommended i update my nvidea drivers. I did, crashed my pc acouple hours in. Wouldnt restart if it wasnt in safe mode. Deleted new nvidea drivers in safe mode, restarted. PC worked normally again, loaded up driver fusion because thankfully i backed up my nvidea drivers when i bought it. A couple easy clicks and back to stable drivers! One thing i might recommend to treexy, make the help section offline? I couldnt check it in safe mode as i wasnt connected to the internet."
,Recommended,234820,12921778,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,Sapient,"I've been using Driver Fusion for about 8 months and overall I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. I was skeptical at first, but after reading some reviews on Steam I decided to buy it at full price, and I almost never pay full price for software on Steam.  I'm by no means a computer enthusiast, but I keep my video card drivers and other basic stuff up to date. I was having some minor sound issues, which Driver Fusion fixed, and my computer (Asus G75VW; GTX670M) has continued running very well.The beauty of having this on Steam is that you can use it on multiple machines, which is where I  feel I've received the most value from this software.  My girlfriend's  8 year old son had made a proper mess of his 6 month old laptop. Malware/anti-virus were not cutting it on his machine, but running this software had significant results (2014 Toshiba Win 8 low-mid range laptop). I also used it on my parents e-Machine, which must be atleast 10 years old. I did quite a bit of basic upkeep on that machine so I can't say for sure how well Treexy specifically worked, but it certainly saved me time and looked like some sort of wizardy to my folks.Ultimately, what really sealed the deal for me was the commitment of the Treexy developers. I have yet to read a problematic/negative  review or comment on Steam to which a Treexy developer has not constructively responded (usually within a day or so). I was a little worried about this software damaging or causing issues on my machine, and others have had issues in the past (I've never had any), but I was confident a Treexy developer would see me through any potential issues.My only nit-pick is I wish they would solve the issue of certain drivers being 'unverified' and flashing a bright red Windows warning when trying to install them. I always click yes and haven't had any issues, but I never feel 100% confident clicking yes when that warning box pops up."

I was browsing forums to see if there were any solutions & this came up, I saw it was on sale & thought ""♥♥♥♥ it, why not"". One of the best decisions I've made. It managed to update all my drivers properly and as well as not having a crash since, with updated drivers that weren't updated with AMD Catalyst Control I've noticed a marked improvement in visual quality.

All in all it appears to have done me a service which saved me time and made my system up to date, which is what I care about most.Old Review.This app is almost pointless. The price is a joke for what it does. I purchased so that it could manage all of the drivers on my system and keep them up to date but I must warn this app does NOT do that.

While Driver Fusion showed me that everything is ok, all drivers are up to date and there are no missing drivers, the device manager in Windows XP reported and unknown VGA adapter and a Multimedia Audio controller without drivers.

I know that this particular software has had both good and bad reviews, so I wanted to share my experience.I bought this software back when it was on sale. It seemed like a good idea, in theory, but I never actually used it. My philosophy on software drivers is: if it isn't broken, don't fix it! The last thing you want to do is install new drivers and break a computer that is otherwise working fine. But, the software was interesting and had a lot of potential, and Steam sales are great, so I bought it; thinking that I could always use it later (or use it on my wife's computer if she encountered an issue, etc.) Another tool in the toolbox, so to speak. I loved the Steam license that lets us use it on any computer we are willing to use with our Steam account: that is a very fair license for someone like me who is responsible for all of the computers in this household. I never condone piracy, but sometimes software licenses go too far the other direction and prevent legitimate use by the rightful owner. So kudos to the developers for that.Fast forward a few months and I bought a new game on Steam during this winter sale. I think it is called Arch Mage or something. The game has an intro cut scene that was choppy as hell on my computer. Very strange, my computer is normally fine with any game, especially a cut scene. (Who ever hears of a cut scene lagging? Weird.) I did some Google research, and discovered that it was a common (enough) issue and the suggested solution was to update the audio drivers.I almost never think to update my audio drivers. Once again: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. But, now I actually had something broken, so I decided to ry this Driver Fusion software. I installed it, and went through the slightly annoying registration process. Yes, you need to register and get another stupid account just to use this software. I take back my kudos, developers. I'm so tired of having a separate account for every damn thing. That is why I love Steam in the first place.Anyway, no big deal. Everything requires a registration these days so I just sucked it up and registered. How did the actual software perform?It worked. Exactly as advertised. It (very quickly) scanned my system and listed all of the out of date drivers. My sound driver was definitely out of date, along with a bunch of other weird drivers (mostly associated with the mother board) such as the PCI express driver(s), etc. It also listed my keyboard and mouse.Now, this is important: It lets you uncheck drivers that you don't want to fix. I did unselect the keyboard and the mouse driver. Once again: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. I hate it when drivers update my keyboard and mouse, because then all of the mouse acceleration curves and keyboard macros, etc. get deleted/messed up. Have you ever upgraded your mouse driver and spent hours trying to get it back to how it was before? I have. It is painful.So make sure you LOOK at this list and only check the things you actually want to update. For me, I updated the audio drivers, and the PCI drivers. Those seemed like logical candidates for fixing my cut scene stutter issue. The software did its thing, and it actually worked really quickly. It claims to have made backups (I assume it did, I don't want to test it) and gave a nice status bar for the progress. The status bar was even accurate and everything worked without hangups. So, the developers can have their kudos back.Then, after rebooting my computer... I rebooted a second time. You can never be too sure especially when updating drivers. Afterward, everything seemed to be working fine. I also manually downloaded and re-installed the NVidia graphics card drivers. I already had the latest version, but after updating all of my motherboard drivers, reinstalling the video card from scratch seemed like a really, really good idea. So I did, and rebooted for a third time.When I fired up the Arch Mage game again (the suspense is killing you, admit it)...  it worked! The cut scenes play just fine and the driver updates did their trick. So, yes, I definitely recommend this software. It did what it claimed to do and it fixed my problem.But: updating drivers is always risky. Don't do it ""just for fun"" unless you really don't care if you have to reinstall Windows. I highly recommend following the same process I did. Basically: Only update drivers if you suspect it will fix a real problem. Uncheck everything that you don't want to update. Be very careful and very specific, use this tool as just that: a tool that can help you find drivers that you would have updated anyway. And when it comes to big/important drivers like your video card: always get the full package directly from the manufacturer (NVidia or AMD). I would only use this product for more obscure drivers that are hard to locate. If you know the real source, use the real source.Oh, and reboot often."

Sure I know where to manually download all the drivers. I also know that it takes time to hunt them all down and you are bound to miss one (or a dozen.) With DFP I basically have a two click solution that take care of 95% of my driver issues. Sure the software isn't perfect, but I don't expect anything to be spot on all the time. So here are some Pro's and Con's to keep it simple.*Pros*-Saves time-Saves effort-Easy to use-Simple to navigate-Two clicks take care of most drive issues and or problems-Incrediably easy to use driver back up and roll back functions (less complicated and less time consuming than Windows)*Cons*-Occasionally doesn't recognize some drivers or fails to install them properly (this only ever happens with Realtech drivers so I am further convinced Realtech is just garbage over all)-Will occasionally whig out and say that I don't own the premium version even though I am booting it through steam (this has happened no more than once every three months) and all I have to do is click the manual login-Some of the advanced functions are fluff and don't seem all that necessary (at least for me)-It has twice shown me a driver that was an earlier version that what I already had and told me that my version was out of date. This has only happened twice and was quickly remedied.Over all I would recommend this to anyone who don't care to take the time to do all the manual updating and doesn't mind spending a few dollars to keep all those drivers up to date. Considering you own the software for life (or as long as the company stays in business) then I don't think it hurts to throw down $40 (or less if on sale) for something that has saved me countless hours.

The paid for version offers a lot of functionality that I helps keep my laptop up to date with drivers (which can be a PITA on a laptop).  I think it's worth the cost.

Those disks tend to be outdated the day you recieve them because the product has been sitting in trucks/shelves/werehouses for a year or two before they reach the consumer.Your milage will varry, as I see many satisfied reviewers.

Broken DRM + Non UAC complianceSteam runs under the user account and elevates to administrator with UAC only when it needs to- this is known as UAC compliance and it is a necessary design that ensures safer environments. DriverFusion requires administrative powers to start. This is generally a big no no and would usually earn a big giant FAIL from me, but given the purpose and scope of this program, I can maybe overlook this. However, administrative processes and user processes are not allowed to communicate. Driver fusion starts, asks for elevation, looks for steam (a user process), cannot access it, and silently crashes. This is what we call 'broken by design', and it needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY. Since this is specifically a steam version, the key you get here will not work on the non steam versions that can actually start without crashing.*Most Windows users are unaware that they should, or are unwilling to run a User account separate from an Administrative account, which is why this design flaw made it into release, and why many of you will not encounter this issue. While it may not affect YOU personally, please remember that UAC compliance is important and non-complying software should not be left in a broken state.2. Unstable + more broken DRMI wanted to play around with the program so I ran steam as an administrator and was able to start driver fusion. After running an outdated driver scan, I tried to switch to a different tab within the program and it froze. Actually, the program becomes unresponsive every time I try to access ""device control"", and will crash some time later. When this happens, I restart the program and then cannot access premium features because I'm ""already logged in"" to my driver fusion account. I must wait several minutes before something times out server side and I am allowed to use the program again. If you're going to have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM, at the very least just give me the option to force logout anyone using my account! Better yet, just use steam's DRM and get rid of your broken filth. We don't need two independent DRM schemes going on here.3. Sketchy business practicesI scanned for outdated drivers and it started telling me a few Microsoft components were ""very outdated"" and I should upgrade to ones by NEC (or other). Newer is not automatically better, and installing the drivers from random manufacturers (on machines that have no hardware from said manufacturer!) is a good way to break things, and introduce stupid-manufacturer bugs and vulnerabilities. This feature of driver fusion is misleading and potentially dangerous- I appreciate that it opens up options for the power user, but it's portraying this stuff as optimal and better than what is currently installed, which is downright lying. This is the sketchy business practice: telling you your system is outdated when it isn't, so it appears to be doing something and the user feels like their purchase is justified. Buyer beware.4. Skinned programI hate things that don't adhere to the standard UI convention (yes that includes Steam!). Use the native libraries, custom UIs are ugly and cause problems with UI manipulating software.--Edit-- 2016/04/29I've just noticed that the publisher/developer, Treexy, has commented on my review, demonstrating a continued total ignorance about the functions of UAC, justifying bad decisions with unrelated PR babble, and defending the skinned interface with a lie (or just more ignorance).It should be noted that in the steam thread about the UAC compliance issues, Treexy is ignorant TO THIS DAY about what the problem even is in the first place. And they have the gall to ""give insight"" about how this program is ""UAC compliant"" when the whole issue is entirely because they don't even know what UAC is or what it can do. At this point I'm actually more inclined to believe they're playing dumb because they just don't want to deal with fixing it.http://steamcommunity.com/app/234820/discussions/0/496879865900321903/Listen, I'm holding on to this and not demanding a refund, because despite all my complaints, this software does have a place in my bag of Windows related utilities. The caveat here is that I know enough to work around their BS, and for the once every 2 years I need to run this software, it's not the end of the world to boot up steam in my admin account.But as a paid product, I cannot recommend this to anyone. It actively punishes you for securing your computer environment properly, it presents information in a misleading and frankly dangerous way to try and justify its existence to the customer, it's not that stable, it has unreasonable DRM (as if any DRM were reasonable, but I digress) and it's ugly to boot."

Deleting some drivers fully removes issues that pop up after multiple updates to the driver ect.Might be a tad pricey for what it does.  Offers a lot of features you just dont need...dont need device manager and health monitor, its nice to have though.After running this, i didnt notice how slow my PC had gotten over the 1.5 years ive had it.  The SATA 3 drivers, hard drive firmware, and odd intel chip drivers for god know what made noticable improvements, not to mention the driver wipe function cleared up a graphic card driver crash issue that was getting annoying.Worth it, but be sure you have a back up plan and a pre downloaded driver if you are going to make use of its driver wipe function.

But omg the translations...is it from Google Translate?I wanted to use it in Swedish but i couldn't understand the settings cause of very bad translation.Other than that i think it's a good software and pretty much easy to use, and FINALLY i can get the latest drivers for my outdated hardware without putting my computer at risk on different sites that could spread viruses and save a great deal of time.EDIT: 2017/09/19This program was very good even with bad translation.It found and helped to install drivers that you didnt know was out there. I really liked it.But now it's abandoned like many other users says.No new update since november 2015, and it constantly wants to install older drivers.Don't buy this software until Treexy are giving a damn about it again."
