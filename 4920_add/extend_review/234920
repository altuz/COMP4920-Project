Done well, it can be really engaging, and provide a lot of replay value in going back and finding different outcomes.Unfortunately, this one didn't really resonate with me.  On a mechanical level, the game is fine, with frequent decisions (some timed) that appear to have a substantial impact on the narrative.  It's the narrative itself I take issue with -- the characterization is very one-dimensional, with each character serving as a simple stereotype.A bit of personality shorthand is fine for a short game, but these characters are mere caricatures, where every single line is a repeat of their one overriding personality trait.  It makes the game farcical, which removes a lot of (well, all of) the weight from the decisions; when someone gets hurt or killed, it's difficult to sympathize when everything they've said to that point has been the same exaggerated characteristic over and over again.  Couple this with humor that borders on slapstick and emotional responses that seem sociopathic and it's hard to take seriously.To me, for a game like this to work, the decisions have to be something I care about -- the tension comes from wanting to make the correct decision.  Unfortunately, the relative silliness on display here in combination with the flat characters means that ten minutes in the decisions start feeling fairly arbitrary as I click through for my ending."

,Recommended,234920,15137008,"Posted: 31 March, 2015",all,Jedo,"Dyscourse is my newest favorite choose-your-own adventure game. I thoroughly enjoyed combing through each path to unlock the variations of each possible ending. I found myself often looking back in time at least 2 or 3 times per playthrough to find out what went wrong. With that said, a lot can go wrong (and that's a good thing). Small details matter in this game especially if you want to aim for 100% of the achievements. I also want to note that the art style is very easy on the eyes. The characters dialogue is also well-written. Personally, Steve was my favorite out of the group with his bleak outlook on life and his trusty stapler.If you want something to compare it to, I'd say it is like a slightly longer and more evolved 'Monster Loves You'. I definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy adventure games. Even if you don't normally play adventure games, this is actually a good starting point for the genre."
76561198129096537,Recommended,234920,15055005,"Posted: 25 March, 2015",all,The Walking Fat,"Dyscourse is a really different any intresting game, overall its a solid game but has some flaws.The pros:Its like if 'Lost' had choices that YOU choose (Similar to Life is Strange or The Walking Dead), the artwork and atomsphere is really well done. Every moment in the game I feel nervous and eerie and the amount of outcomes and choices are so hearttearing. The characters a realistic and have their pros and cons, there is no one character that is perfect or evil.. which I love because they're not cliche. For instance one guy is super nice but is always paranoid and it gets annoying, one lady is kind but doesnt make the right choice and it a bit of a critic. The timer when you make choices also adds to the tension and is great, after every choice you instantly feel like you made the wrong one which was perfectly done. The varity of deaths are also really cool and it has an amazing amount of reply value, I want to reply it to get every single outcome.The middle:There is some stuff to say in the middle, the beginning is pretty aburpt and i'm not sure how I feel about it.. it doesnt pull you in the first five minutes of playing and takes awhile. The puzzles are generally simple which is a con and a pro, there was only one puzzle I struggled with and it was unique which was good, so the puzzles are unique but simple. I'm also mixed on the soundtrack, it was good but I feel like if the devs went a little further on the soundtrack it could have improved the game.The cons:I actually dont have a lot of cons, I wish they did voice acting instead of mumbling and exploring your area can be fustrating sometimes because the controls can make it awkward to move around. Sometimes the choices confuse me though, for instance I gave food to one lady one day and didnt give her food another day and then she died from starving.Overall: Overall this game is solid, if you enjoy games about choices and point & clicks this is for you.  I'd give it a solid 8/10."
76561198025683143,Not Recommended,234920,15359612,"Posted: 14 April, 2015",all,WientheStampede,"This game is absolutely dreadful, and I really wanted to like it. I tried my hardest. I guess the best way to break down my distaste for it would be to list the Pros and Cons.Pro:Interesting art style: The game looks fairly nice. It won't blow you away with graphics, animations, or character designs... but the art style itself is a change of pace from what one would typically see.Soundtrack: Whatever else I may say about this game won't detract from the fact that it has a pretty stellar soundtrack. I always enjoyed what I was hearing in regards to that.Disky: There is one twist ending that made me kind of chuckle. I'll give that due props.Cons:Terrible Characters: I disliked every single character in this game, passionately. For a strictly story driven game like this, that is a cardinal sin. All of the characters were hyperbolic annoying familiars of one character stereotype or another. And since they all spend the entire campaign b--ching, whining, complaining, fighting with each other, and generally failing at whatever task you delegate to them (though there were some successes in that regard), I found it very hard to find any character that I could truly align myself with.Absence of Gameplay: Its pretty tough to call this game a game, there isn't really anything game-like involved with it. Most of the time you are crawling through dialog, and in those rare moments when you can control a character, you have an extremely limited range of movement within a restricted area, and your actions are only ever temporarily extended beyond doing nothing into picking up a couple of objects. Once you pick up those objects though, you're done ""playing"" anything game-like here. Its back to the story. Which would be fine and all, were it not for the above grievance combined with the below...Absence of Choices: The game bills itself as a Choose Your Own Adventure style game, and I dig that. But for a game whose focus is on story and choices, you don't seem to have a whole lot of decision points. You make a choice here and there and then spend the rest of the time watching everybody react to those choices. Sometimes, the distance between making a decision on something is so large that I forgot what kind of game I was playing for a bit. Its really like an elongated cutscene. When you get to the moments where you make decisions, most of the time they are pretty milquetoast (choose who finds the water, choose who gets to eat, etc). For a game with interest points far and few between, you'd think they would make all the decisions you would have to make be a bit more.... exciting. I went to look at other story driven mobile games just to compare, because I felt I wasn't being fair to Dyscourse with my expectations. I played a story driven game on iOS where every other sentence my character said was a decision point; I had the ability within the game to completely drive the conversation, and as such, the direction of the story. More to the point, even the minor choices I made felt like they carried more weight; they informed my character and allowed me to respond to situations the way I would respond. It may be unfair to compare to Dyscourse, but for a game devoid of any real gameplay and focusing on story and choices, I could have certainly used more. A lot more.Petty Storytelling: There were a number of times in the game where the storytelling just felt.... petty. For instance (Spoiler Alert, I guess...), there was a moment I encountered on a mountain where I had found 3 eggs in a nest off of the cliff. I was able to get two of them, but couldn't get the 3rd. With 3 of us in the party, I had to make a decision: who gets to eat these two eggs? Well, one of the dialog choices presented to you is ""All 3 of us will share the eggs"", which is an easy thing to do with eggs. But then you are told ""No we can't do that, you must choose between 2 of the 3"" for no real reason whatsoever. Its obviously a Sofie's Choice moment, choosing who will live and who will die. The petty part is, I had made great strides getting to this point in the game without any characters dying, and I was literally on the last night before rescue. There was NO reason for anyone to die other than the game just said ""Nope someone's dying lol"". What am I playing this for? This was only 1 of several examples within this game.Dull: All in all, the game is just dull. The story is horrendously generic (plane crash, desert island, etc), and none of the characters to a lick to improve on that. As stated earlier, they are all annoying characters. Add to that, they all speak Simlish. Not normally something I would say is a bad thing, but when you have annoying characters in a dull game talking about dull things (do I really care about George and Jolene's marriage?), the Charlie-Brown-teacher-wompwomp effect only helps to underscore the appropriate level of attention I end up paying to the whole thing. Wompwompwompwompwhatever lets move this along so I can get to the next decision point.Short: Maybe this should be a positive considering my feelings on this game, but for a 15 dollar ""game"" of nothing, being able to complete it in less than an hour seems... borderline criminal. That iOS game I mentioned earlier provided me a much more robust storytelling and decision making experience at the same length, for free (for the first episode, the 2nd costing about 2 bucks, which is still substantially cheaper than this). Why is this game so short? Its not at all worth 15 bucks for the litany of reasons listed above, but even ignoring all that, 15 bucks for less than an hour of playtime is a steep, steep price to pay. Is this an early access game? No no, that's not a good excuse. I've poured countless hours into Darkest Dungeon and other early access titles. I just don't get it. Maybe the lame, rote, predictable, cliched, boring story just doesn't lend itself to a long lifespan of playability. Whatever the case may be, its a quick burn, so be prepared for that.Ending: I don't really want to spoil the ending.... suffice to say that if you like looking at corkboards, you're in for a grand treat.OVERALL: I cannot NOT recommend this ""game"" enough. I am honestly completely baffled and dumbfounded by the positive reviews its been getting. I don't get it at all, not even a little bit. I can usually understand one way or another how popular games I don't like are at least popular with others. For Dyscourse? Its as much a mystery to me as the island itself."

Going through the story once hasn't taken me more than 2 hours, but don't let that make you think this game is small-- it's packed with tons of different paths to take in the storyline, with each path revealing a different part of the story. I found myself replaying to piece together the whole picture, favoring some characters over others to get new information out of them. If you find yourself having trouble committing to a long video game, or forgetting where you are in the game, Dyscourse might be a good match for you, as it was for me.Additionally, the style of the game is beautiful and very quirky, and the colors are a nice balance of saturated and subdued. Very easy to look at for long periods of time if you find yourself playing for hours on end. Music adds a lot to the mood of each scene, and the writing is smart and charming. Pay close attention to what you read! And choose wisely. ;)Overall: Buy this game. Throw your money at it. Play it forever.ALSO: There's a cute cat with fluffy ears in the game. Do it for the cat."

Unfortunately, it gets so bogged down in the dialog and the ten thousand times you seem to have to hit the ""more dialog"" button that after getting rescued an hour into playing, I had absolutely no interest in revisiting the game.

This really is the main point of the game, and it's fun for a while but I got to a point where I was satisfied that I'd seen everything I wanted to see. According to the achievements list I've only seen 41% of all possible story events, but it just seems like it would be punishing to attempt to unlock every minor event.

Another person in the same scenario as yourself may still have different outcomes depending on timing, which is a result of the individual decisions they have made in their game. Dyscourse is a game that you MUST experience for yourself. Good storytelling in a game is 100% necessary for me, and I kept asking myself, ""What's going to happen next?"" and even when I was finished with my run, I wanted to know MORE, such as the details of a character's back story that I hadn't gotten to know due to their unfortunate... well, no spoilers.The art style and colors are masterful, and the original soundtrack is beautiful.

Plane crashes on desert island, you, the sensible person, have to lead a group of idiots to survival over the course of a few days, while waiting for rescue.Simple as that. Works rather well too, in the sense that choices certainly do affect the outcome of the story somewhat. But it is rather simple, and figuring out all the different 'pathways' and variations of those pathways can be a fun thing to do. However, it isn't as in-depth as people make it out to be, you can have a husband and wife be rather blase about one or the other committing murder for example, even when their relationship is absolutely rock bottom, where the expectation is for some actual 'reaction' to happen, to push them over the edge.Where Dyscourse fails is in its characters and the direction the game takes with them. As I mentioned, the idea of the desert island survival story is a sensible one. But the characters are something out of a poor hack's comedy show. There's the husband and wife, who seem relatively normal. The absolute bat-snot insane conspiracy theorist, tin-foil-hat, rage inducing idiot ""Teddy"" who will spout off all sorts of ridiculous rubbish about THE NANOMACHINES! and the ALIENS!!!!!! And omg the sand has ears... Oh shut up, you delusional nutter.There's the 'gamer', and I use that term ever so mockingly because apparently gamers IRL would go out in a thunderstorm and suggest a lightning strike means a Black Mage is nearby. Wut? Dude, get a grip.And then the office jocky, who seems to have an unlimited amount of cigarettes, who mopes like that one friend who tries to find a negative in absolutely everything? ""Good morning!"" ""Nothing good about it, oh woe is me, I wish some rock would casually stone my brains out."" ""Jesus Christ mate, all I said was good morning!"" ""And wooooooooe I am still alive, to listen to your mundane voice, please kill me now!""If you find that sort of thing absolutely, knee slappingly, hilarious, then Dyscourse is right up your alley, a survival game with absolutely ""hilarious"" characters.If, like me, you find that sort of thing absolutely moronic, then Dyscourse is probably not quite the game for you, and it is a shame because the idea is a relatively simple, safe one that really should work no matter what, and yet the developers somehow managed to actually make it almost unbearable to get through. (Additionally, turn the 'voice effects' sounds off, it will save your sanity.)So yeah, get it on sale if you absolutely must. Don't bother if you feel those characters I summed up above are unlikable people, unless you want to buy it just to kill them, which some of you will, so go for it.(Game rating: Mixed.)"

The graphics are sweet, but not impressive--its like a children's cartoon. There are far too many points where you are waiting for nothing to happen. Like waiting while your charcter passes out water to other characters--no dialogue, no story bulding, not even something pretty to look at...just waiting. Some of the dialouge is funny, but not the majorityIf anything can be said for it though (minus the first 15 minutes) the choices you make do actually change how the story is told and determine who lives and who dies. Unfortunately, I never felt strongly about any charcter or situation, so all the excitment that should have been in making a choice was lost.I guess the game is interesting, but not impressive and not exciting.

,Recommended,234920,19638567,"Posted: 11 December, 2015",all,Sy Snootles,"A fun & funny game where your choices really DO matter. Stranded on a desert island following a plane crash, your goal is to help your ragtag band of survivors... well, survive. Virtually every decision you make has its consequences, & you make a LOT of decisions. Friendships are formed & broken, sacrifices are made, people die... people ALWAYS die. But just who, & how many, is entirely in your hands.No two playthroughs of this game are the same. That's not to say it doesn't sometimes get tedious to replay, but the achievement system in place is a really good motivator to unlock particular paths. Also you can ""rewind"" to any day in the story instead of having to start fresh every time you want to change something. It even shows you who died or was injured on each available day, making it easier to go back & ""save"" characters by making a different choice, if you're feeling guilty. I did sometimes find myself wishing for a ""fast forward"" button for many of the scenes, though -- things get a bit desperate when you're onto those last two or three achievements.I didn't like the artwork at first, but it grew on me (the backgrounds are great, but the character designs I'm still not fond of -- WHAT is Rita wearing & WHY does she have claws?). The writing is really entertaining; the humorous dialog combined with the cartoonish style definitely help to keep the mood light, even when you're dealing with stuff like murder & cannibalism. The voice acting is... well, it can be turned off, fortunately. As for the DLC story ""Indie Island,"" it was way too meta for me; I only went through it once.Overall this is a clever, well-made game which really does hide a multitude of secrets. So do yourself a favor & start DYSCovering them today!!! (That was really bad, sorry.)"

I often find that the ""Do X"" yourself option is ALMOST always the best case.2. There's some character specfic events, but I wanted more and for them to be consistent. For example: very early in the game, someone's cigarette causes jet fuel to ignite. However, when I later needed matches to ignite another object, the character was of no use."

,Recommended,234920,33009916,Posted: 29 June,all,IUserious,"I absolutely LOVE this game! Every play through is so quick and concise, thus making it incredibly replayable. You play as Rita, one of the six survivors of an airplane crash, and getting stuck on an island forces you all to find ways to survive together.What can I say? Each character is unique and nuanced, and there are tons of different things you can find out about them from subsequent playthroughs. I was pretty surprised by how much I didn't know a character until I went back and talked to them more, as well as get them to tag along for the daily task of survival. This could range from foraging for food, exploring the crash site for supplies, along with several ways to get off the island.The combination of choices and outcomes seem almost limitless and you will find yourself wanting to explore the differences. And not all of them can be waited on, as there are some choices you need to make under a timer. These of course could mean life or death when your fellow survivors are about to be attacked by the island's wildlife. You'll be weighing your choices on what secret (if any) alliances you'd like to make with one or more survivors, and who to favour in your quest to survive.What I love about the playthroughs I've done by now is wondering who to save and who to let go of. Sometimes I feel cynical and don't mind if someone dies, but then other times despite how inconvenient they can be, there are certain skills they posess that can help our group progress if I had only let that one person eat!!!Anyways, I highly suggest this game at either full price or discounted. You can't go wrong with it. If you like choose your own adventure stories, this one has choices that matter and come up frequently!Random sidenote: the soundtrack is BAWSS!!!"

In my opinion the art style is absolutely amazing; you can decide for yourself by looking at the screenshots. There are enough branching paths to warrant multiple playthroughs and the relatively short game time (around an hour) makes it perfect to play in a single session from start to finish each time. Bottom line: Dyscourse is a beautifully stylish game of meaningful choices.

Only thing that would make this game worth the money is if you replay the game until you have gotten every possible outcome, and no one is going to do that for any other reason than Steam achievements or because you're planning on continuing until you have all the trading card drops.I was only a bit interested while doing my first playthrough of the main story.And to be honest, even in my first playthrough of the main story it got a little boring, actually, it got very boring.The game claims to have replay ability but it doesn't unless you're entertained by reading the same lines of text 500 times.This game is one of the 'Chose your own adventure' games where almost non of your choices have any impact on the game, even though the game claims that all choices matter. Only some choices have impact, and it's ovbious which ones they are.The game is extremely repetitive and also has a lot of meaningless filler-content.You also don't get to make a lot of choices, at least not reasonable ones. If you're stuck on an island, starving and while your scavenging for food and you come across a cat(in the middle of the desert for some reason), are you going to kill it and eat it so you don't die or are you going to let it live and contiune to starve to death? I think the answer is ovbious, yet you're not able to chose that ovbious answer.The art style is great, yet the actual game does not hold up.The game tries to be funny and silly, it is definetly silly, but funny? No. Neither is it entertaining and after 20 minutes of playing you will start to mindlessly click through the dialog to get to the end.4/10.Good concept, horribly executed."

To pull this off, a single playthrough is quite short (a couple hours max).  Fortunately, the decisions are engaging and the outcomes are very different so the replay value is very high and well-worth the time it takes.  I'm particularly fond of the ability to rewind a save file day by day to make different decisions without having to repetitively grind back to the same situation each time.  The game is dark but doesn't go out of its way to make you feel like every decision you make is a bad one, which I greatly appreciate.

That's time and effort I'm just not interested in giving, however. This game is mostly a snooze-fest. I only stayed awake because I had to constantly smash the spacebar. My fingers hurt.Your choices matter in this game, but they're highly illogical--you won't ""outthink"" this game. I played to Day 7 and my game then skipped forward to Day 62.

Like an interactive story book.It's slow and boring and nothing literally that will excite you if you are a teenager or adult.For this price and even on sale it's better off to buy something else. It cost too much even on sale.Bottom line dont get it. If you even need a game for your child just get lego series or something else.

Besides the artistic graphics style, I found this game tedious.For fifteen dollars, I expect much more gameplay than this. To me, this is more like a visual novel. Which is fine, but I would never spend fifteen dollars on a visual novel. Heck, I can get those for free. As far as story line goes, I never found myself wondering how the story would pan out or heavily considering my decisions. The days were far too short, same goes for the game as a whole.I'm sorry that I'm really negative, but this is my honest opinion. If this game was five to ten dollars, I would like it much more than I do now. Definitely a rip off."

76561197985705342,Not Recommended,234920,17570146,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,SloopDanB,"Very similar to The Walking Dead game, but not especially good.I bought this for $7.50 and found it almost worth that. After the fun first playthrough (about 1 hour), I was not especially excited for a second time through. I did do a second playthrough and feel like I've gotten all I will out of it. So, this is 1-4 hours of gameplay.The gameplay is some dialog choices along with some very simple puzzle elements. The dialog presents you with some interesting choices. For example, deciding how to divide your party for various tasks or deciding which character to protect from an attacking animal. These choices seem a bit more developed and interesting than The Walking Dead's.Unfortunately, the results of my choices seemed pretty arbitrary. For example, when I protected one character from an animal attack, the result was that a completely unrelated character got harmed. Similarly, the interpersonal choices had pretty arbitrary and unimportant outcodes. Most of my dialog choices didn't produce any clear effect (something like ""Teddy became intimidated"" or ""Steven suspects that I stole that food""), This made my choices feel nearly meaningless. It didn't  matter whether I was a demanding bully or a selfless enabler, because either way arbitrary things lead to an arbitrary outcome.I passed an happy hour playing Dyscourse. The game suggests some excellent possibilities for player choice in video games, but it didn't deliver very well on them."

However looking into it and trying thousands of different methods there is no possible way to rescue all 6 survivors and that sucks BAD i really wish there was a way to do it. also theres only 5 seats on the plane. all in all good game play it but im dissatisfied that everyone cant make it back alive.

The trailer made il look cool, but you play through the story in 30 miutes or so an have to ""replay"" the same scenario with the same charaters over and over again--which for me is boring after a while.  I would say this is worth maybe $5, but certainly not full price."

The lack of emotional impact when making a choice or dealing with its consequences contrasts with its superior compeitors from Bioware and Tell Tale Games. Unfortunately, it is not very funny nor is it very touching, despite subject matter and dialogue that suggests that it is trying to accomplish both of these things.I do sincerely hope the creators will continue to work on more story and choice based games in the future, as I think video games have vast untapped potential in story-telling, but I can't honestly recommend this as an example of succeeding at that goal."

I found the characters flat and the choices somewhat non-sense...things just sort of happened regardless of your decisions. I think the idea is cool and maybe for 2 bucks the experience would have been worth it, but for what I paid and what I got I wasn't impressed. I get the whole point of the game is to play it multiple times but after about my third play through I just couldn't stomach doing the same parts over and over just to see every little twist. If the characters had been more interesting and if my choices were more dynamic and had clearer outcomes I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more. Cool concept just wasn't a fan of the execution."

The short days (1 day consisted of feeding 2 people and sleeping) and poor story telling deterred me as a player.All characters are incompetent and heavily dependent on the player. Likewise, the game relies on really long and pointless dialogue to progress. Never is there a time to get to know the survivors (ties in with poor storytelling.)"

I saw PewDiePie play it and had to get it for myself. The choices really do matter and really do affect the story quite dearly. For example, there are quite a few character deaths, but they can be prevented with the right choices. These characters that you saved with your choices can stick around til the end of the game, so it isnt a TellTale desicion where the character dies one or two episodes later. With all these positives, what could I possibly be giving Dyscouce a negitive review for? Well, I dont know if its just my computer, but, there is a scene in the game. This scene is quite a good scene, and frankly, I'd love to finish it. So what happens is, I am awoken by thunder and am alerted there is flooding going on near my tent. One of the characters, Teddy, suggests we leave our flooded site, and find new ground. The rest of the group, Steve(If you saved him) Garret(If you saved him) George(if you saved him) and Jolene(if you saved her) attempt to shut Teddy up. You have a choice to agree with Teddy and tell the group to pack up, or disagree with Teddy and stay. Now, I do not know what happens with either, because likewise, each will end up crashing my game with a few simple words ""Rita go get a torch"". If we stay, Teddy will be crushed by a tree and Rita, the player, will have to go get a torch. When going to get the torch however, my game will crash. Same goes with the other choice. If we attempt to leave, Jolene will tell me to get a torch. My game will crash on the way there. If the creator of the game sees this, please help me and I'd be happy to give you a wonderful review. A review this fantasitc  game deserves. BTW, I have a Windows 7 Laptop. Thank you."

One of the details I liked the most is character voicing. Along with the soundtrack, the voices sounded quite condemned and therefore dramatic, I spent some time trying to imitate it. Another cool detail is that you see the consequences of your choices in the end (not just statistics as in some other choice games)."
