I spent a great deal of time combing the forums to get a feel for what Bad Bots exactly was. Not to mention starting a post that insisted that games such as Bad Bots should have a demo when mixed reviews come into play.Once the demo was made available, I spent about an hour playing Bad Bots, got a feel for the dynamics, and quickly realized that I needed this game ASAP.That being said... The game is great. Bad Bots has an old school vibe that reminds me of a SEGA game called ""Slime World."" If you're into murdering blood thirsty robots and trying to save Earth from being attacked by the Titan Hauler, this is the game for you. As the only living human survivor aboard the ship its up to YOU to save the Earth from being overrun by millions of murderous robots.Bad Bots has several different weapon upgrades and choices, tons of hidden rooms, and a great story that keeps you on your toes and guessing the whole time. Plot twists and hard bosses round out the game and make it a must have for anyone who enjoys a good platformer.Graphics: 6/10Playablity: 7/10Story: 8/10Challenge: 7/10Replay Value: 8/10"

With your only hope being any guns you might come across and finding some means of escape. Unfortunately the fun here is a bit detracted due to the games short length and the controls being a bit clunky (keyboard & mouse only). But despite all that blasting away at a ton of killer robots is a pretty fun way to spend a few hours.
,Not Recommended,235070,8952652,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,Chris Fifty-Two,As the name kind of give away its a bad game so there is at least honest advertising.  Its a mediocre 2d sidescrolling shooter with among the most repetitive gameplay I have come across in a shooter game ever and the game has really poor pacing since the game goes on forever and ever before the first thing happen...and then you are all of a sudden on the end boss. The game has no music while you play at all and has a bunch of other strange design choices that really weirdly defended by the developer in a FAQ on the forums:http://steamcommunity.com/app/235070/discussions/0/828939797184939390/The achievements in the game are fairly straight forward but has some missable stuff just towards the end so would hunt down the save folder location and duplicate your saves as you are getting close to the end in case you mess them up and  overwrite your autosave forcing you to replay the entire game to be able to do things again. The most annoying achievement in the game is for dying 50 times which is surprisingly hard and actually is something you have to intentionally grind to get.Time to 100%:6 hours

The most glaring issues are the overpowered stunlocks that can screw you over on higher difficulties, the sheer volume of enemies that are thrown at you at times (stacked on top of the stunlocking), and especially a couple bosses that basically are all about stunlocking you (see a pattern here?).

I first got the game and had to wait a few weeks for a patch to be released since there was a bug where the first boss spawns which makes you unable to fight the boss(he just stands in the corner and never comes to life)This issue was fixed and I have encountered another game freezing bug which makes me unable to complete the game.  It is not a bad game when it works but please do not waste your money on this unplayable garbage because even after a few updates there are still game ending bugs in this.

Reminds me most of Bio-Menace (1993) and a few other old games.I encountered some minor issues. It was a bit tricky to shoot over cover (but cool that you and the robots could duck behind it!). I found that occasionally my equipped weapon randomly changes (when I change and then jump straight away?). I sometimes found it hard to get off ladders unable to defend and avoid enemy attacks. The boss fight that I encountered could have been better I couldn’t see a way to get out of the bosses path (i.e. grab a handhold and hang from the roof above it or something). Basically the battle boiled down to it semi-stun locking me and having to out damage it.However I enjoyed the game so far. It has a story with cut-scenes in a comic book style (sort of like in the original X-Com). It wasn’t so retro that you couldn’t aim with the mouse. The Sci-fi space ship environment music were cool. Crawling through service ducts are a nice addition to the corridors and rooms. Remains of the brutally murdered crew scattered throughout the ship added to the atmosphere.It is probably (I say probably because I haven’t play the whole game) worth it’s $1.99 price tag on steam. At the moment it is only $0.49 which is the price I got it for and it was worth it even just for the short time that I played.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)

,Not Recommended,235070,8129972,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,Whiskey,"With a metactric score of 49 when writing this review I might have passed this one by, but my affinity for pixely graphics and throwback gameplay compelled me to give this game a shot.In Bad Bots, you play as Sam McRae aboard the Titan Hauler in this side-scrolling 'metrovania' style shooter. With a plot right out of an Asimov novel, Sam McRae finds himself the only survivor of a robotic uprising incited by a malevolent AI; a story we are all familiar with, but maybe originality isn't what this game is going for.I've spent just about a half-hour in game by the time of doing this review, maybe that's too short but in my opinion it was easy to see where the game was going. In either case, feel free to take my review with a grain of salt due to my lack of time in the game.In a very crowded market of side-scrollers does Bad Bots have what it takes to stand a head taller than the rest? Personally, I don't think so. Maybe it's just my affinity for this sort of games but I feel like Bad Bots could have been a good game but the game's overall lack of polish and thoughtfulness hold it back. First of all, there's very little music in the game, I even thought the game was broken at first. I suspect it was aiming for a Half-Life vibe but I don't think it achieves this. In Half-life there are many other sound effects and visuals to occupy your attention, but with Bad Bots you're left with an aural void that doesn't feel particularly artistic and more like the developers trying to save money. I mentioned previously that this game lacked thoughtfulness; unlike a well thought out game of this genre where every room and enemy is placed with intention, rooms in this game seem to be thrown in arbitrarily and filled with rows of identical enemies. It's also nearly impossible to avoid being hit as enemies shoot with laser precision (hey, they're robots after all) through all manner of platforms and other obstetrical. To compensate the level is loaded with copious amounts of ammo and health and in my book this is a sign of weak level design.In my first 30 minutes of gameplay I was able to make it to the first boss; they actually busted out the music for this battle. The boss quickly fell to my weapon in the matter ofseconds. This lack of challenge doesn't inspire me to keep playing and leaves me with an empty gaming experience. I supect the challenge level would increase later on, but based on the previous gameplay how much of this challenge is derived from unavoidable damage taken from laser accurate gunfire.Bad Bots appears to be a port of a Xbox game so it does support USB controllers. Conversely it seems they put minimal effort into doing a proper PC port as it lacks any options to rebind keys or even view what the keyboard controls art. Even the ingame control hits still show the Xbox buttons when you are using a keyboard/mouse. Playing with the keyboard and mouse literally required me to guess what the buttons are.On the positive side, besides for the pixely graphics and retro gameplay (which is entirely subjective) the feel on destroying enemies is quite good. The game features storyboards that narrate the story and the overall presentation is decent but the previously mentioned flaws keep me from recommending this title. It's a shame as I feel this game did have potential.Score: 5/10"

The game starts scrolling the screen when you are about 1\4th of the screen away from the edge of the screen. As a result, you can't see where you're going. Thankfully, there are few punishing platforming traps.- However, enemies CAN see and shoot you and you can't shoot them back (well, you can shoot, but the collision won't register) unless about a half of their sprite is on the screen. Invulnerable shooting enemies would be freaking frustrating if they weren't so easy.- Iffy platform detection. Those hanging blue thingies don't have solid edges. Thankfully, the game doesn't have challenging jumps.- Badly designed boss fights. Well, at least the first one with Jackhammer bot. The arena has an obstacle, which you must jump over, but the boss can pass by. Combined with it's speed and fast melee attack wich resets your jump height and stunlocks you, again it would be very unfair and frustrating if it wasn't so easy. Just bring a big gun.- Bad aiming system. The aim sometimes jumps unpredictably, is very roughly sampled despite using analog aiming, glitches when the aiming cursor is near the edges of the screen. And itself is illogical being relative to your position, so that it shifts when you jump, not continuing to target the designated spot as you would normally expect. I see no reason why devs would do that.- And the most important - you can't change the controls. Is it 2014 now or not?I guess, with a 91% discount I wouldn't call it wasted money, but there are sertainly far better platformers to waste your time and money on.EDIT:Second boss.Yyep, fast moving, with stunlock melee, which you can't reliably dodge, because it's faster than and bigger than you. And it itself is a hazard - a big fast ball of stunning hurt which you can't ountrun or dodge. Worsened by small weakspot hitbox, which you can't accurately hit because your goddamn aim shifts uncontrollably with your jumps!And two previous zombie shootout-like scenes (with stunlock melee enemies!), which depleted all my heavy weaponry.Not sure if I want to continue this =\"

,Not Recommended,235070,13560975,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Leisher,"Meh. Bought this for $1.50 so I can't really complain. It's an old school side scroller with old school design. It other words, it's a controller thrower...It gets very repetitive, has no map despite a maze-like ship, has a terrible animation when you get hit that causes major problems later, and has a boring storyline whose sole twist you'll see coming from the start.The difficulty can be adjusted, but in game it's pretty simple until the final part of the story. All of a sudden the difficulty is ramped WAY up. Instead of 4-5 opponents on screen, you've fighting 20 or more at once. Also, instead of the one hit kills you fought en masse earlier, these opponents take several shots to kill. Don't worry though, you get more powerful weapons along the way in the story, BUT in this phase they're very, very limited to what you brought and the crappy shotgun. Expect to run out of ammo before you clear the first room, and there are three of these... What makes it worse is that crappy ""I got hit"" animation that causes you to effectively get stuck in your enemies if you make the slightest mistake while moving non-stop during this phase. I can't say this is ""old school design"", just a huge design mistake.Once you get past this area you get to fight a boss that you must grind down slowly. No easy trick to beat it and it'll take a few attempts for you to get the pattern down.I won't say this game is completely awful, but it's not great. There are better games to be played on Steam unless you really long for the old side scroller days (in which case, have at it)."

I will tell you the story.First of all there are no gamebreaking bugs or mistake that will stop you from finish what you started. But the game lost his faith a two stupid gameplay functions. The first one is the you are hit by electric or melee animation that will keep you struggling and stun locks you in the first final run. And the second his that you will keep climbing up at edges, even when you want to go down.Ok ok stop it. I tell you somethin you dont even know about. I will go backwards.Bad Bot is a Game of his genre to be an average one. It contain a simple story and no really deep Gameplay functions. Just run and gun.The enemy is an army full of robots and they want to kill you. How unforgened that this is to simple. There are different types of enemys and there a map obstacle that arent really funny. But there are only two parts of each level where you gonna die. Both parts are nearly at the end. The First one is the run thru the sleep quaters. At this point you need to fight lot of melee enemys that spawn until a current amount is reached. There is problem number one. The problem based on the you are hit by melee animation that will stun lock you and you die. The second part is the End fight against mother. Not a big deal but you need along time to take her down. Because she has a big amount of Health.The rest simple, repeated and not challenging at all.And it is short.Do I recommend it to buy and play it.Yes and No. 5 bucks are to much more 4 hours.
