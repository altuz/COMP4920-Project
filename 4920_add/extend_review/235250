If you're a fan of Tower Defense then I guarantee you'll find hours of fun in this. The ability to level up, use player skills, assign talents to amp your towers or even your personal skills depending on the map you're on. This is all alongside creating your own maze by placing blocks just like you do in the original Sanctum games. This is certainly worth the few dollars their asking. You wont be disappointed."

You should place blocks on the battlefield to make path of the monsters longer. Such subgenre of td game contains deep tactics and strategy.Devs have done a good job. Game is simple at the start and becomes harder with every mission.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=886283294There is a wide choice of towers. Every tower has unique specifications and abilities. Every tower can be upgraded three times. I can definitely say that's more than enough to feel as a real commander. I found only one minus, that is you can take only 4 towers during a mission.There are a lot of different skills: bombs, lightning, black holes, etc. You must use them wisely to achieve victory on hard.You gain experience by completing levels. You can spend skill points on different upgrades.Graphics is nothing special. But I like this retro style.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=886283335I spent 5 hours to complete all levels on normal difficulty. I enjoyed every minute of playing.I recommend this game to both strategy and TD fans."
,Not Recommended,235250,9071018,"Posted: 12 February, 2014",all,Adilor,"First off, I do actually like the game. I really do. It is quite pleasing aesthetically, and has a great system in place that lets you play the game how you want.Problem is, how you want to play the game might not be very successful.It is of this gamer's opinion that a tower defense game should not be a puzzle game. There should not be a narrow band of builds that will actually grant victory among an immense number of combinations that could be played. With 15 different towers and 17 skills, picking just four of each can be difficult, yes, but it affords the player the ability to define how they want to go about defending their cores, and that's not even counting the perk points, which add another layer of depth and customization. This system by itself is fantastic, but the execution that makes use of it is rather poor.There is progression; not everything is available from the start. This progression, however, cuts off quite fast. Everything is unlocked at the point of hitting level 12, but the levels keep going, rather pointlessly. Perk points are gained differently, at a rate of 1 per completed map, and when you feel like you're not powerful enough to get past a particular map, there's a problem.Now, I can understand a TD needing some strategy; if one doesn't make you think about what you're doing, then it's probably not very good. SSTD, though, feels like it asks too much of strategy, putting the player on a very fine line between perfection and failure. I was doing fine with this game through the first few levels. I made a blunder here and there, and learned from what were clear mistakes (setting all Violators to attack the highest HP targets was a bad idea, for the record). There were some tougher levels that took me a couple attempts to figure out, but it felt okay. The challenge was fair. Then along came Works.Works is the map that I feel enforces an unfair level of difficulty and shows that the game really wants you to use a very specific setup to get through it. I have taken numerous attempts at it with different builds and have yet to even see the boss wave. I have beat my head against it long enough that I don't really care to continue. Maybe it's a fluke, maybe the rest aren't so bad after it, but I'm not going to put myself through the torture of trying to figure out the exact combination of towers and skills it takes to get through this map that seems to have too much of everything.Sure, I could just use the magic of Youtube and look for a setup that gets through it so I could continue, but that's not how I play; I would get no sense of accomplishment and may as well have used Cheat Engine to bypass the level in terms of enjoyment. When a game completely shuts down a player's ability to progress, without giving them an opportunity to either adequately learn what they're doing wrong or power up to overcome the challenge, then there is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.The game doesn't need to be easy; it just needs to cater to more than an elite 1% of builds. Don't tell the gamers how to play their game."

,Recommended,235250,14669448,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,Spootaloo,"Super Sanctum TD was a game I picked up for the combination of ridiculous sale price ($0.79) with trading cards. When I saw a game that looked to be similar to the original Sanctum games with the fast-paced FPS action taken out, I expected it to be a sloggy, boring grindfest - my standard opinion when it comes to the majority of tower defense games.Much to my surprise, Super Sanctum TD manages to dodge the most common gripes I have about the TD genre. Most levels have an open-ended ""create-your-own-maze"" approach, allowing for a lot of freedom and creativity in level solutions. SSTD also does away with long streaks of easy early-game snore-inducing levels - strong planning, resource management, and intelligent skill usage are all needed as soon as you complete the two training levels. The difficulty remains fairly consistent throughout, giving what seems like a paltry 14 stages a pretty beefy amount of playtime, as you'll likely need a few tries to figure out a suitable plan for much of the levels. On the other hand, if you find yourself breezing through the game, there's plenty of replay value in the form of an optional Hard difficulty, as well as infinite survival modes for every stage.SSTD isn't without its flaws, however - most glaringly is the game's fondness for crashing. Thankfully, the game does a fairly good job of autosaving, letting you continue right at the start of the wave you were left hanging on. The high difficulty I praised earlier can also be a bit of a double-edged sword - with a completely linear level structure, getting stuck on a stage will bring any semblance of progression to a screeching halt. An optional easy difficulty setting may have been a good idea for this reason.Super Sanctum TD may not be the most innovative game in the world, but what it does, it does very well. If you're a big fan of tower defense games, then this game is an absolute steal."

Outside of the traditional tower defense formula, you also get experience points and as you beat levels, you can earn perks to upgrade damage, enhance the economics of the game and boost your abilities.As to the bugs, the devs have been working hard at improving the experience, and they seem to have the worst bugs whipped.  They've also been tinkering with balance to create a tough but fair play experience.  The fixes have been a little slow in coming, but I'm generally happy that they stuck it out and managed to get it fixed.On Steam, this is my second favorite tower defense behind Defense Grid."

If you’ve played either of the full-fledged Sanctum titles, you’ll immediately be familiar with the towers, the enemies, setting and soundtrack. However, Coffee Stain Studios may have pushed the “retro” thing too far. While the graphics and the soundtrack are pleasing, there’s no widescreen support and the sound effects are not only atrocious, but after a while they get pretty irritating. There’s really no reason for this game to be this low budget.The game plays like a typical 2D tower defense game with a few twists. There’s a decent number of towers although less than in the main series. The usual staples are here: gatling gun, laser towers, etc. You even get the slow and amp fields from the original Sanctum which for some reason didn’t appear in last year’s sequel. The aliens are back as well and there’s less of them as well. They range from big brutes, fast chargers, annoying flying ones and big bosses. The objective is to build mazes and place your towers in a way that’s most efficient in destroying as much aliens as quickly as possible before they get to the core.Keeping in line with the hands on approach from the main series, you also have a number of skills at your disposal which you can use during the alien onslaught. For example, you can set up mines, freeze a group of aliens, make them hover in the air for a limited amount of time, strike them with lightning, send them backwards for a bit and so on. All of these skills have varying cooldowns so you need to use them at the most opportune time.There’s not much content here. The single-player campaign spans 15 missions that you’ll be able to finish in under 10 hours on the normal setting. After that you can play each level on hard or in survival, but as far as game modes go, that’s about it. This is a low budget spin-off that never pretends to be anything else which is reflected in its price as well. The full price is only 3,99 euros, but it’s not unusual to see it slashed by 90%. And if you sell the trading cards, it’s likely that you’ll break even.In the end, Super Sanctum TD is a solid tower defense game that’s worth playing as it manages to deliver that tactical and addictive experience that such games aspire to offer. And even though it’s too low budget and extremely light on content, at that price you really can’t go wrong with this one.6 OUT OF 10 (ALRIGHT)"

The level of dificulty will scare some away almost immediately, but tower defense veterans may enjoy some of the subtle gameplay mechanics which allow for deep strategic thought.  The problem is this is not like other Sanctum games.Rest of the review:Sanctum was great, and I loved Sanctum 2.  I didn't get the Super Sanctum spin-off game until the 2014 winter sale, because I wasn't really fond enough of the 2D graphical style to part with much money for the game.  Well, the game finally dropped to an absurdly low price, so I took the bait and began playing.The first thing I noticed was that the combat was almost entirely about the towers and wall placement.  This is not Sanctum-like.  I was expecting a player character, but I got instead a god-like view with generic tower defense fare.  I was disappointed but did not let that sway me from giving the game a fair try.The tower options were very bare to begin with, but after a few completed levels, I unlocked a lot of towers.  You start with the gatling gun tower and eventually unlock more towers as you beat levels.  You can go back and replay levels using your new towers and new abilities in survival mode.The abilities are the closest thing you can get to player interaction with the game world, but I found that the best abilities were the ones you didn't actually get to use manually.  For example, you could have abilities which add to tower strength for a limited time when used, but you're better off unlocking the abilities which enhance towers indefinitely.  None of the upgrades are ever permanent, so there's little reason to replay the game from the beginning, but achievement hunters will enjoy the grind, I guess.The story is non-existent.Overall, I liked the game in a casual time-wasting way, but I cannot recommend it unless you're looking for something extremely simple, something intended for the most casual of gamers.  Considering the game's intended audience was Sanctum players, I doubt many will be satisfied with this game's more generic approach to tower defense."

This is one of those games. It is so tight with resources that you either do everything right or fail every time. No room at all for anything else. And this is on normal game difficultilty mode, I dred to think what hard mode would be like! Add to this the fact that each mission has 10 waves of enemies and if you discover in later waves that you did not do something that was vital, then you will have to redo all of the previous waves for this map again. just to correct you mistake, to win the mission. For example, one of the early missions starts air enemies on around wave 4, if you do not plan for this and build anti air prior to this, you will have to do the early waves again, including building anti air in preparation of what is to come. If you are a fan of patheticly hard games, enjoy, if you don't mind redoing maps while you advance your abilities, enjoy!!!Another dislike is if just one boss gets through then it is game over.What is with the bug that decides that none of your weapons will do any damage to anything.I doubt I will play this game much!"

Doubly so if you are a fan of the tower defense genre. If you, like me, are rather fond of retro style games then there is really no reason not to try this one out. The mechanics are fairly simple, but conspire to produce a game with a pleasing level of strategic depth. Sanctum fans will be right at home, and players new to the setting will discover the best turrets for the job in short order. I was initially dubious regarding the lack of 'hands-on' management of enemies a la Sanctum 1 & 2, but the special powers available for you to direct and deploy make up for the inability to go down there and fight quite satisfactorily. Campaign length seems fine, though may well prove to be my only real area of concern. That said, difficulty settings, survival mode and achievement hunting should ensure that you leave the game feeling satisfied.An excellent game to pick up for a break, or to play for longer periods, especially when set to survival mode."

,Recommended,235250,26215305,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,aruvin,"Super Sanctum TD (SS TD in short) developed by Coffee Stain Studios, the makers of Sanctum & Sanctum2. Released on the PC platform on  May 9 2013. It has an average user score of 7.3 on MetaCritic(http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/super-sanctum-td). This came as a surprise but SS TD was released before Sanctum 2! If the dates are correct on MetaCritic, SS TD was released a week before Sanctum 2 went live on the PC. Who's up for a 2D solo, Tower Defense game set in a sci-fi theme battling hordes of aliens? Did I say that it was also ""cute"" ? No one? T.TSS TD inherits the entire Sanctum lore/concept. It is a solo game however - unlike Sanctum (or Sanctum 2) minus the FPS & heroes. This is just pure Tower Defense..with a little spell@skill casting moment. Any Sanctum player will recognize the art style of the towers/settings/aliens immediately. The most glaring difference is that, its a 2D miniature version of Sanctum. For me, that just looks super cute. That is, until they reach your core and you want to smash them to bits..*ahem* So let's get down to business.Controls:Controls are straight forward. Easy. You can't turn the map. So your focus will be on placement on towers, mazing & casting of skills.The game seems to be designed in a small screen fashion. I guess there's nothing else to see so they've restricted your view. Changing resolution doesn't really help enhance the visuals or Field of View of the game..unless you want to see even tinier aliens. The view was restrictive for me but it didn't hamper the game play experience.Yes, I've build towers and I've lost count which is level 1 or level 2 towers. Especially if you are going for endless wave OR if you are planning to build hordes of slow towers, you are going to face this issue. I wished the devs could have made a more visible indicator on the tower levels. I had to keep check on my towers - so thats micro management for you.Visuals:Like I mentioned earlier, everything looks like Sanctum. The aliens are tiny cute creatures running amok to your core but just because they look cute, it doesn't mean they are harmless. Things can get pretty nasty if you dont plan properly. eg: 70+ over tiny runners heading to your core.Game play:There is no story whatsoever in SS TD. You are straight thrown into the game to learn to build/maze/get to know your towers/aliens immediately.The objective of the game is simple. Protect your core from the aliens.You lose the game once your core has been damaged enough by the aliens. The end.If you defend the core without taking any damage(0 leak) - a perfect defense, then you will be rewarded with 3 stars. What does the star do? For achievement purpose.You are only given a max of 4 tower slot and 4 skill slot. So you have to choose from your collection of tower/skills and learn to build a combo@tactic around them. Planning is always crucial as each Map layout is different and so is the spawn of mobs.As you progress into the game, you gain experience points and you start unlocking higher tier towers/skills.And Yes, there will be bosses. Speed Runners, Flyers and the ones that eats up your towers. They are here. so are the mutators. >:-DMy Personnel Experience:In the early of the game, it seems pretty acceptable and fun to play. Until a certain level where you know you hit the limit and there's just isn't much you can do unless you start investing into other forms of tower/skills.By Mid game you would have realize that all you needed was the lighting tower family. So you ponder was the choice of tower selection a mere illusion? In some way yes. If you wanted an easier time, you'd pick certain towers over the others because it gets the job done better.By end game You've probably figured out which enemy was ""weak"" to which tower and what sort of tactic to deploy. You are probably aiming to get the 10k alien kills now.I am not into leaderboard but I am into achievements. I had a memorable time studying/exploring ways to complete certain maps/achievement. SS TD was fun and challenging however i'd say it lack certain aspect of the game.The first is that it lack a drive. There is no story or motivation for players to complete the game. At some point, players them self can also lose motivation if they keep failing in at certain maps. getting stucked at some map without any form of aid is a painful experience.The second one is related to engagement. Aside from TD, there is nothing else to do. No mini games, no other game mechanics to keep you occupied when you are tired seeing the aliens. I was hoping that because this is 2d, solo offline TD game, the devs would try to introduce something new - something thats not FPS or co-op which has already been done in sanctum 1 & 2. If I may reference other games; For an example, Final Fantasy 7 on chocobos, Plant vs Zombie: plenty of mini games and zen garden. PvZ offers way more ""gaming experience"" and ""value"".The tower and alien description were very vague. You had to observe the battle to understand which unit takes more damage from X tower at X level or X tower seem to be better against X unit.Other than this, I'd say the game was fun & solid.Once I've beaten the game and obtained my 100% achievement, it is unlikely I will revisit SS TD again but for the highly competitive gamers, they will no doubt invest their time into perfecting their art of defense to get their name up in the legendary board of fame.My Summary:Super Sanctum TD as a whole, is a good solo, offline TD game. It would've been much better if it had an option for skirmish mode/co-op mode to retain its playerbase. A different game mechanic apart from the TD would be a welcome - It's a risky move for a simple 2D game but I seriously hope the devs will incorporate something new in their next solo TD product. So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Super Sanctum TD is a 6/10."

INFORMATION.Where are the tooltips? I got a new tower, but when I started the next fight, I didn't remember exactly how it worked. I just had to plant it and see what happened. That is the opposite of fun.It begs me to open the encyclopedia so I can see info on the enemies, but the special attributes are not explained. ""Squishy"", eh? What is that? I guess it makes them die more quickly, but if you're not going to tell me how to take advantage of their squishiness, why not just give them fewer hit points?

A simple game to play while you wait for a train, your next class, lunch break(?), in a five minute to 30 minute gap of doing nothing, etc.HOWEVER, it's not as fun as you advance in the waves.  Whenever you complete one mission/area, you have the option of continuing into survival mode. In these cases, you'll either instantly die or find a point where you've maxed everything out, but the enemy will ultimately obliterate your defenses without effort.  If you always want to win, tough luck, this game will make sure that you're destined to lose at one point or another.  Also, there will be times when you're forced to place certain structures up, in order to win, taking away your freedom of choice and flexibility in the gameplay.Still... I guess this game isn't for people who want to try hard to the max, but more of a time waster for periods of waiting and thinking.  Might as well get it if you can't be asked/fked to find a book to read instead.Note: This game does come with steam trading cards, which will help pay off the final price of this game.

Numerous times I had failed but I was happy to come back the next day and attempt to accomplish what I thought to be impossible. With each failure comes a gift that enabled me to try out a new combination within my defensive strategies. There were even some levels where I had to completely exchange everything I chose. Each level had its own unique challenge that forced me to be more creative. Super Sanctum TD is like finely cut gem that shines without falter.

It starts up fine and doesn't lag at all. Each tower can be upgraded three times. Some towers attack just ground, some just air, and some ground and air. All levels have a survival mode, and every level has a leaderboard.There are upgrades that carry from level to level in the form of commander upgrades which can be reset at any time without penalty which lets you experiment with different tower specs and loadouts. There are also special spell-like abilities that you can employ such as a bomb that resets every 20seconds, croud control effects such as freezing, and temporary tower boosts.There are strategy elements to how towers are placed, how abilities are used, and what your spec is, and how they compliment each other. There are lots of options to play with, and it is fun to experiment. It is not as deep of strategy as a larger game, but this is not meant to be that kind of game. A basic level can be completed in 10 minutes. In survival mode a level can last an hour easily. This game is very very accesible and easy to drop in and out of.The difficulty escallates rather slowly, but with survival modes and leader boards you are ensured a challenge. That said I am past the first half of the game, and did so casually from my baby's hospital room. I got this title on sale for under $1, and it has been well worth it. Very happy with this game and purchase, and replayability is awesome.For the price, depth of strategy, and replayability I give this a solid 7/10, and if you like tower defense it is a no-brainer to pick it up I believe."

Very simple graphics, but they are servicable.The only negative (and it may be because I don't understand the interface), is that there appears to no way to get back to the beginning of a level, after the point where you have laid out your starting maze layout. When starting a level, you place platforms, that serve to redirect the waves of enemies. Then you build towers on these platforms. If I mess up a level (which for me happens fairly often), I get tired of always having put the platforms down again, as there can be a lot of them. Otherwise it's a fun game."

I saw one person not recommending this because of not being able to beat a level. Maybe its one of the levels i'm stuck at on hard but didn't have too much trouble on normal. That's what you want from hard mode. The survival mode alone is worth the price. Havent messed around with defense grid enough to see if it has survival but i like the controller support. Where's Super sanctum TD 2 with some next gen 2d graphics is what i want to know. I didn't think much of the fps sanctums. Orcs must die has that crown. I'll probably grab OMD some time if it has a survival ranked global leader board like this does and most games should have. Super sanctum TD is a well pollished tower defense that every tower defense fan should own. It has that one more go feel i dont really get from others tower defense games.

,Not Recommended,235250,33684805,Posted: 20 July,all,Audion: King of Antics,"SSTD is held back by a failure to focus on the backbone behind the gameplay. The window doesn't let you resize. This means the cutesy pixel graphics scale horribly and all the pixels become different sizes. The options in general for this game seem pathetic. Anti Aliasing, hotkeys, and music choice seem to be the extent. They do use the default windows combination for fullscreen rather than set it as an option. There's no choice to lock the mouse to the game either, which means you can overdo a movement and your camera flies off the screen.  This also causes the map to fight against you when you try to select a map. The actual gameplay is pretty okay, if a bit vague at times (For example, trying to upgrade a tower with insufficient funds only states that the tower is not a ""valid target"") and the idea of particpating in the attack phase has been applied here as well. It does feel extremely slow in the beginning because this game follows the route of Sanctum 2 and requires you to play the game before you unlock more slots. Which would be okay if it wasn't for the that fast that unlike Sanctum 2, those slots are your ONLY way to interact with the attack wave, rather than FPS gameplay with no artificial downtime.I dunno man, it's only 4 bucks or less. It's not a bad game either, just marred by poor settings menu and ugly pixel scaling."
