Don't let its retro looks fool you.Its something along the vibes of jagged alliance. you get character progression and permadeath. Most of the main characters have their own lines and personalities written for throughout the entire campaign; i always tried to keep em alive just for that ;Dother than that, the storyline, while slightly convoluted, simply serves as a backdrop for a great rts/rpg game where you manage not only your resources, but your human resources as well. 4 Character classes where your characters can switch between and gain experience in during missions carry out specific tasks, where soldiers fight, scientists do research and heal people up, engineers start buildings and collect resources, and mechanics drive and build vehicles.Decisions you make within each mission affect subsequent missions. Somewhere down the line you will be forced to make one which will split your campagin progress into two trees. *spoiler :D*I really loved the vehicle design in this game, where you slowly overtime research and unlock modules to provide more options for modular vehicle construction. Gun+Chassis+Power source+ wheels/tracks is awesome. I like the really distinctive look of the double gun cars. <3all in all, this game is worth my 20 bucks then, and the 5 bucks now. buy it. you wont be disappointed."

It has all what good RTS game should have:- Unique story, never seen anything similar in other RTS games- Unique resorces gathering system (not seen in any other games, and still fits 100% to the story)- Unique crew management (loosing man in first mission, can make others harder up to the last one, cause crew advance with you, crew members are limited, no respawn, no training units, permadeath)- Crew has skills (and they train them on mission, and as reward for good mission score)- Three factions quite balanced even while having different units, and different technologies- Modular vehicle construction (you choose vehicle type, engine type, weapon type, and steering type)I played this game when it came out 13 years ago - still having box version, and playing from time to time. Today I saw it on steam and bought it without even small doubt.P.S. To STEAM crew. Why its marked as ""indie""? Its made by Altair Interactive ( now called Altar Games )-> the same that made UFO;Afterlight, UFO:Aftermatch etc. Its also beeing published by Bohemia Interactive (Arma game series, Operation Flashpoint, Take on Helicopters).

76561198032742599,Recommended,235320,10978894,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,BurningLegion,"I got this old game because it was on sale, because I hadn't seen the concept of an RTS closely involved with time travel anywhere else but Achron, and because of its positive reviews. I was wrong - this game is nothing like Achron, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.Last night, I stayed up until 6 AM trying to beat the first two USA missions in a way I could be proud of, and spent more than an hour on the third mission besides! I've only played one other RTS which directly applies how well I performed on one level to how well I start on the next level and to the degree that it is possible to get an unworkable start if you really mess up. The best part is? The game doesn't tell me that. It lets me explore, lets me find that out. It lets me find out that level 2 is much easier if I keep level 1's wounded soldier alive, lets me discover that Sabre-tooth tigers attack my troops as a matter of course (New policy: Pre-emptive extermination), makes me find out the little things that divide a Lieutenant from a quartermaster.The tutorial's unobtrusive, taking the form of hints which pop up along a small, out of the way bar at the bottom of the screen. Easy to ignore if you've seen it before, and easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Just the way I like it.The graphics are, to be honest, not good by today's standards. But I am a firm believer in ""Graphics matter only to the point where they help the consumer suspend disbelief"", and they are good enough for me to suspend disbelief. If you've played the original Starcraft, it's around that level of quality.Unlike in Starcraft, however, terrain is hugely important in Original War. Long grass conceals soldiers who are crawling, but is temporarily flattened if a vehicle or walking human crosses it. Harder and softer terrains have different effects on the movement of vehicles depending on their propulsion (Tracks seem to be slower than wheels on harder ground and faster on softer ground) and the movement of infantry.The variety of units we have access to is honestly extremely well done - a basic human can fulfill any infantry role, but the skills they've acquired (In four areas, which transfer from mission to mission as the character does) determine how effective they are. Whether they're effective or not, just performing in the role will increase their ability in it. The four roles I've been exposed to - Soldier, Engineer, Mechanic, Scientist - are each so useful choosing between them is actively painful, and I count that in the game's favor. I've only seen three vehicles so far - two wheeled and one tracked - but being exposed to the vehicle construction menu informs me that eventually I will have the option to deploy vehicles of multiple chassis types, controlled directly by humans or remote guided, armed with distinct weapons, and so far I've seen both gasoline and solar power represented in the game.Now, the gameplay itself. Original War features RTS gameplay, but it honestly spends most of its time telling a story of people trapped two million years ago which is reflected by the gameplay. Most RTS games accept one basic conceit - that if you click a button in the barracks, you get another man or woman with a rifle. Original War rejects that conceit, and as a result you get a game more about using up, salvaging, resource allocation, and making do than it is about build orders, micro timing, or army composition. The result neatly becomes a sort of hybrid between an RTS and an RPG, with the large battlefields and unit management of an RTS and the detailed statistics and many, many options of an RPG.In terms of what I as a player can do, Original War impresses me. Do I want the resources that captured vehicle represents more than I want the vehicle itself? I can have it taken apart for a bit of a refund. Do I think it's time for my top soldier to learn how to repair vehicles? I can make her put on overalls and carry repair tools. Do I need to build a bunch of buildings fast? Turn everybody into engineers! Frustrated at the Engineer's slow speed while carrying resources? Vehicles with cargo bays can gather that for them. Am I considering mounting a final, do-or-die assault? Why am I considering that? I can pick the enemy's irreplacable unit count down with a small group of soldiers if I move carefully. Do I want my vehicle to be built quickly or just eventually? Do I want that tech researched NOW or eventually? And this is not counting the in-mission choices - I've received at least one dialogue choice per mission and this is without mentioning the implied choices.All in all, if you like RTS games, if you like RPG games, and most of all if you like HARD, uncompromising games which ask you as a player to think, learn, and make choices I think there is a very good chance you will enjoy this game as I am.EDIT: Having completed the final mission of the USA campaign (One of them, anyway...) I have more to say.In terms of Original War's ethics, I am impressed again. Original War is from the 2000s and it would have been easy for the game to fall into the standard American action hero characterization for the protagonists in the fashion that ruined so many other innovative RTS' for me, yet it doesn't. This is most notable in the portrayal of Joan Fergusson, a scientist who was never meant to go back in time but did anyway. In the majority of video games she would be doubly hampered as both a civilian and the love interest of the USA campaign's main character which would result in Fergusson simply being a useless character in both a statistical sense and a storyline sense. Instead, the exploits of this individual are believable given who she is, where & when she is, and what her limitations are. Specifically, if you keep Joan alive she holds bases on two occasions and brings a squadron of AI tank reinforcements to the final battle that you know she built by herself. The same can be said for nearly every other character I have encountered so far (I'm finding it difficult to grasp Major - Comrade Major Platonov - but I haven't completed the Russian campaign so...) which I view as support for the theory that Original War is more of a cross between an RTS and an RPG than really either.I enjoy Original War's dedication to continuity of choice - most choices made in early levels (Yes, losing units is a choice) will come back to haunt you by the final stages of a campaign. For instance, in USA 2 I chose to spare a captured enemy Mechanic. In a later level, that choice directly affected how I went about that mission. Even small choices like rotating the Scientist and Engineer roles so that everybody gains skill points becomes a major tactical factor by the tenth level.If I have one major criticism of Original War, it is that some units seem completely pointless. Apeman Engineers are amazing, Apeman Soldiers are...not. Double Gun Vehicles are always useful, Double Laser Vehicles are an utter waste of time and resources. Original War is hardly unique among RTS games in this sense, and I do appreciate having the options even if they are largely pointless. A point that mitigates this criticism in my eyes is the potential for the player to make useless units - for instance, the abomination that is the Morphling Machinegun or the utter incompetence of the Hovercraft...anything. That some units are useless means less when allowing inexperienced players to make stupid mistakes is such a big part of why I like this game.All in all, I still really like this game. There's a better than even chance I will buy it for most of my friends since it is on sale, and I will return to 200 Million years before the modern world after my Age of Empires phase has petered out."
,Recommended,235320,8869470,"Posted: 27 January, 2014",all,Rip,"Original War is certainly a product if its time. It was very quietly developed in the waning days of RTS popularity and developers were first trying to do something a little different. It is the quinessential ""Gem"" for any fans of the genre. The art style is unique and clever, fantastic music and the concept was innovative. You don't train new men in the traditional sense; you have a finite amount of men, and you can build vehicles part by part (chassis, turret, fuel source) and train local fauna (aka cavemen) to join your cause. Each of your men (and women) have a name, and stats, and a specialty. You can change their roles as a match goes on (sniper, infantry, medic etc...) to suit your needs. In campaign mode, survivors of each battle with gain XP and ""lvl up"". Having an RTS with RPG elements back in 2001 was something special, but I'm not sure this game is for everyone TODAY. I think if you're a die-hard fan of the RTS genre, this is a great pick! Even if you're a fan of retro PC gaming in general, go for it. If you're looking for a Starcraft killer, move right along."

,Recommended,235320,11900298,"Posted: 28 August, 2014",all,Qriminal,"I have purchased Original War three times; first in a bargain bin in 2002, then ongog.comand finally on Steam. Let me tell you why this is one of the finest RTS games ever made. A truly exceptional example of the genre but mainly for reasons that set it apart from most strategy games.Let's talk about what it does that may not be so different but is instead allows us a comforting familiarity with what we've come to expect from Sci-fi RTS games. As is a staple of the RTS Genre the single player comes with two campaigns, a Russian and American/NATO campaign. There is the cliché'd sci-fi super-rare-new-resource, and of course it's a green crystal.What sets Original War apart from most RTS games is... Well, quite a lot actually. For one; it's set in a world where time-travel is possible. Russia and America are vying for control of a new-found substance called Siberite (known as Alaskite in the Russian campaign.) Both superpowers decide to use time travelling machines to go back and move all the  green-glowing-good-stuff to their respective territories, so that when the future comes around they'll already be in possession of every valuable deposit of said resource. For the soldiers embarking on this mission; it means a one way trip. Speaking of soldiers...Throughout the story you'll be given a single protagonist (American's get Macmillan, Russians get 'Gorky') and if they die, it's game over. The rest are cannon fodder. Likeable cannon-fodder. The problem with liking these human meat shields is if these characters die, that's it. They don't come back. Given that each character has stats based on what you had them do most (building vehicles, constructing fortifications, shooting enemies, or researching space-time anomalies) they get better at it through an EXP system. Even if you don't find yourself liking their dialogue (impossible), you sure as hell will miss their efficiency. Certain characters dying affects the story too, sometimes in a grim way (this is true of both campaigns).This is but a brief overview of the game, there's a lot more off-the-wall design elements you should experience for yourself and for it's price, Original War will not disappoint. It's difficult to find anything to dislike; The RPG elements are unobtrusive, the cheesy dialogue is heart warming and with memorable characters such as Colonel Powell and Lisa Lawson (to name but a few) I cannot reccomend it enough."

You cannot create different soldiers, you can only use the ones you've got (and some you can find scattered throughout certain maps)  This means you have to treat each life as vital.You change jobs at different buildings, choosing from soldier, engineer, mechanic, scientist.  Each jobs allows the unit to perform different tasks.  Scientists heal and research upgrades and can spot and mark oil.  Engineers pick up the shipments of crates that are sent back from the future and build buildings.  Mechanics can work in the workshop (or whatever the vehicle and turret gun creating building is called) to create vehicles, guns for turrets and they also repair and drive vehicles (each class can drive vehicles and perform based on their mechanic skill.)All this adds up to quite an enjoyable game.  It also includes a pause feature that allows one to stop the action and give complex sets of orders which is certainly noteworthy and unique in thie genre.I caught it on sale for a buck and it's not too expenisve otherwise.  If you catch it on sale, it's a must have and if you're open to the universe worth of gaming that opens up to you when you look past graphics and release dates it's a must get all the time.Check it out.  You won't be disappointed."

OW is (even thought it´s age) original not just in the means of timetravel and war in the far past and for the past. Above all it´s brilliant combination of rts and rpg, what makes it so unique. In terms of gameplay it means you have to care about every soldier you have (and in this harsh environment, it´s usually much less than optimal numbuer). You have to always think abut for what to use each soul and how to treat it. What skills to train, where to allocate the manpower, what technology develop and when. Becouse even won battle for valuable resource, if it took too much time, can endanger development of your base and therefore whole mission. Loosing any soldier means hell of a trouble. There are usually multiple ways how to achieve your goals, but every one need careful tactical thinking from base management to field battle strategy.This way it may sound like hardcore stuff for very patient tacticians... but it´s not. Above all, it´s very enjoyable game for anybody. The main experience isn´t frustration, but fun. Lots of fun. There are some things that help this outcome. First is excellent level design. Missions arent repetitive, but almost always bring some new challenge. They vary from more traditional base-to-base war to Commandos-like stealth action. Often there are also twists in the developement of events, which boosts gameplay with dynamics and pushes you to be prepared for anything.The last but not least quality is the main story. From the ""cliché"" of American-Russian war (just situated in unorthodox setting), situation quickly extends to be more complicated. Player is therefore forced to choose which side (and which politcs, ethics and philosophy) to pledge allegience to. Not just from global perspective, but from personal view of main hero and his relationships, too. Which even adds emotinal touch to game. Quite special for rts, isn´t it? Oh, I forgot to mention that (living) soldiers and their valuable experience goes to next missions. And that for some of the more important characters amongst them, you will soon develop special feeling.Game has, of course, it´s weaknesses (like poor voicecast), but there are not many of them. Somebody may despise the old graphics, but I like it even after all those years.So in the end I have only one advice regarding Original War: Enjoy It!!!"

,Recommended,235320,11825384,"Posted: 22 August, 2014",all,Oddbolt,"This is my favorite game of all time. I found out about it through a demo disk that came along with a game magazine back in 2001 and was instantly hooked. I must have spent a good 50+ hours playing the demo alone before I finally managed to get my hands on a copy of the full game.I still to this day bring Original War up regularly in my gaming rants about how unique and inventive it was, and how disappointed I am that it didn't get the attention it deserved. I'm glad to see it on Steam now and it's fun to see how pretty much everyone else that's played it feels the same way as I do.Besides compatibility issues this game has aged extremely well. I still play it from time to time over 900+ other newer games I could be playing. While it is an RTS it actually plays quite a lot like an RPG, in that you don't mass produce anything and the few units you get to control all for the most part have their own stories and personalities. When they die they're gone for the rest of the campaign (unless you restart, which will become a habit if you're anything like me and can't let a single person die ever) which makes you actually care about who you send out and think more carefully about the most optimal ways to get all your soldiers out of each mission alive. A lot of official reviewers back in the day complained about the voice acting but personally I love it. Sure it's not super serious and amazing but I find that it adds more charm to the game, makes me laugh and makes the experience generally more memorable. I frequently find myself doing impressions of the more 'unique' characters like ""Oleg Kazimirowicz Gleb"" (you'll understand when you run into him) and lip syncing all the story dialogue when I go back and repeat playthroughs.You have to assign characters to research new technologies for weapon, building and vehicle production as well as go out into the world and collect enough resources to sustain that production. In singleplayer it's all tied into the story very well. There are also dialogue options and decisions you'll get to make that strongly impact the outcome of your game and who will survive.As far as I'm aware, the online community is still very much alive for the game however it still seems to be mostly Czech and Polish folks playing (as those two countries were basically the only places where the game was decently advertised). It's because of this that the first words ever I learned in another language besides English were polish, back in the GameSpy arcade days. They were swear words (go figure).There's also a website called 'owsupport' that actively releases patches/fixes for the game and as their name suggests, provide support for the OWar community so if you ever need help that's the place to go.Overall it was an underrated, poorly advertised game that deserved a lot more credit for it's ingenuity than it received and I highly recommend buying a copy and giving it a go."

,Recommended,235320,29409043,Posted: 21 January,all,Cipmu,"This was a seriously unappreciated game when it came out, outside of Czech republic and Poland that is. It's one of my most beloved games and here's why.It's really quite amazing, and does something no other RTS I've seen. It combines RTS basics with RPG elements and a great, original story. The characters (the team your control) are unique, have their specific voiced lines and play an important role in the story, they're not just units you can crate in a factory. You're stuck with the soldies you get and if they die, they're gone for the rest of the game. Think of it as a mix of the team based Wasteland with the classic base building of Command and Conquer etc.The story:If you're a book reader and are fimiliar with Wolfgang Jeschke, more specifically the book ""The Last Day of Creation"", you pretty much know the story by now, since it's been heavily inspired by it.There are two campaigns (American and Russian) that each have multiple paths.The basic plot: A new element is found, Siberit/Alaskit, that is higly radioactive but wields an incredible power. Using this element, scientists discover a way to use it to travel back in time. There are two campaigns, so there are 2 countries (USA/Russia) traveling back in time to secure the resource, mine it up and move it to the location where their respective countries will be in 2 million years. So you're transported to the prehistoric, pliocene epoch with exact mission. It's a one way ticket only.I don't want to say more so that I don't spoil the story of the game, but expect multiple universes/futures. It does this pretty well, and suprisingly, doesn't get as confusing and convoluted as it usually does.There's branching story lines, decision to be made and you can play as all sides of the conflict.The mechanics:As I said, characters you can use are limited, with permanent death being used. You have 4 basic character jobs (soldier, mechanic, medic, builder) and you can change their jobs on the fly in the missions. Everyone has jobs they're good at or close to useless if your ignore those. The skills shift throughout the game depending on what you have the characters do. So every character is unique and special, you really start to find your favourite characters, where even if they die and you're about the complete the mission, you'll be reloading the mission.The most important resource in the game are crates. These get teleported in from the future, but since this technology still hasn't been mastered, these drop at random points on the map. So in order to get these, you'll have to go and actively search for them while weaking your camp and putting the scounts in danger.There's one issue that people have with the game, and that is that the english voice acting is supposed to be pretty bad. I've only played it in the original czech dubbing, so it was never an issue for me, although it certainly isn't great either.It's my favourite RTS of all time, and I just hope more people would discover this gem of a game.The game was developed by Altar Interactive in 2001, and it was their first big game. The core of the studio aren't together anymore and have moved on to other projects, and since this game was never very successfull commercially, we won't be getting a sequal. Or not an official one, the community is still very much alive with this one. Having Steam Workshop capabilities certainly helps.So please, if this sounds even slighty intriguing to you, BUY IT!"

It never got much attention because at the time noone cared about games from small developers. Even though there was clearly a big disparity from how mediocre this game was considered by game magazines and how well recieved it was by players, truth is not many people even knew about this game. A huge mistake. It is fun, long, it has high quality both single player and multi player. Plot is great and the possibilities are huge.

From the opening sequences as John I could already feel my heart pang for him as he finds the love of his life but it's already a million years too late...Original War is a game where your soldiers as your most valuable resource. You are reliant upon only a finite number of troops and must manage these to the best of your ability and limit casualties. The game also features a bit of an RPG system where each soldier can develop as a Soldier, Engineer, Mechanic and Scientist where each class has its own strengths and weaknesses.And these soldiers if they survive are present for the entirity of the campaign and depending on the choices you make, follow you to hell and back.Overall I think Original War is a very fun and addictive game that never really got the attention it deserved when it was released."

Every single one has unique personality and once they're dead, they cannot return. There are resources randomly spawning across the map and sometimes you have to fight for every supply you need.There are two official campaigns where you play as Americans or Russians. You'll also face mercenaries led by Arabs who were also meant to have a campaign but unfortunately it was cancelled (there is a fan made campaign ""The Arabian Campaign"" which perfectly fills the hole though).Your units can change their job during a mission. They can become a soldier, engineer, mechanic or a scientist. They keep getting better and better at their job and it's up to you to make them even better. You also assemble vehicles and turrets which can be controlled by your soldiers or just make them fully automatic.Also I live in Czech Republic, the country where this game was developed and the Czech voice acting is just perfect.

I think, that the setting of the game is one-of-a-kind. The characters are outright lovable and it is very easy to grow attached to them and that is not only because of the necessity of having good people in your army.Give it a burl! If not for these reasons, then for the ability to tame apemen and make them gather crates.10/10 Will give apemen machine guns again."

The limiting factor of your primary resources (building material and people themselves) which contrasts with the ability to recycle and train ""natives"" (apemen)/build AI war machines and all this combined with usually limited space of your base which you have to upgrade in certain way presents a very interesting decision-making tactical situation. Add a very interesting and thought-out storyline with different timelines as a result of the time travel and you have a great unorthodox game.You will want to know what happens next, you will want to know how your decision affects the outcome and you will want to branch out in the campaign to know what would have happened if you made a different decision. The game also offers tactical options, such as units with greater range then they can see, visibility obstructing terrain, including trees, higher ground granting firing range bonus. The soundtrack is also good and nicely themed - the sort of ""lumberjack style"" for US and the typical tunes ""Siberia style"" (as we nicknamed them with friends) for Soviets. Speaking of soviets, you will look forward for any communication with your superiors or cutscenes - all great jabs at the party propaganda and way of thinking.A great older game, RTS where a second here or there is not important, you actually want to carefully plan and execute.Message for Czech players about dubbing: Hra je i v češtině, ale jen titulky. Dabing je celý v Angličtině, takže pokud jste OWar dříve hráli a těšili se na parádní české nadabování, bohužel."

There are 4 specialities (soldier, scientist, mechanic, and engineer) that can be swapped during the mission if you have the right building. Your units can level up every mission. You might be pretty bad off if too many of your good people die during the later missions. You can also screw yourself over with bad base layout. The game has a total of 38 missions, split between two campaigns with 2 major branching paths and an unknown amount of minor ones.  Slightly cliche storyline with major plots point not explained, unless I missed it. There are some mission that are tedious and the game is highly scripted. The AI doesn't seem to rebuild their base or build any new structures. The AI works fine for both your team and the enemy. Graphics are what you would expect for a 2001 game from a Czech developer(no offense), to think otherwise would be luducrious. You have the ability to slow/speed up game time and I don't recall many rts using this feature. The current developer/modders have patched the game, since its origianl release, so gotta give them props for that. For $1, I can recommend it."

It introduced (possibly pionieered?) a handful of unique features to the genre, such as: campaign/story branching, RPG elements, visibility mechanics, death system, vehicle design... to name just a couple. All these novelties enchance the gameplay greatly and make the game really stand out even nowadays. Original War came out back in 2001 and some of those features are nowhere to be found in more modern real time strategies. You just can't overesitmate the level of innovation and creativity that's present in this title, even by contemporary standards. The thing I like the most about this game though is it's absolutely amazing, immersive and original (pun intended) setting, based on Wolfgang Jeschke's novel ""The Last Day of Creation"". Time travel... Americans... Russians... apemen and resource war waged in the past... I'm in!Unfortunately Original War suffers from rather poor voice overs and lack of AI. The campaign missions are downright scripted and the game does not offer single player skirmishes against computer. Multiplayer is there along with a couple of play modes. I only wish there were more challenges on steam which would add some replayability value.Original War has aged a lot over the years but it's aged with dignity. I'd say it's definitely worth trying out, especially for people who are into old school gaming and especially for this price.Bottom line: this game deserves either a decent remake, sequel or prequel, would love to see it out one day. Or how about a FPS spin-off? Nah, I'm going too far ahead here - the world isn't ready.EDIT: they added 21 achievements one day after I wrote this review, wow.

Give this game a chance, it has a bit of a learning curve, but since you can pause and issue commands, as well as slow down and speed up the game at your leisure, you can truly think out each move.The story is highly original, and really interesting, across the 2 campaigns both American and Russian. Both Campaigns have a branching path to another faction known as the Alliance. You also have the Arabs, and the offshoot mercenaries The Legion. In fact, the modding community has brought back the Arab campaign that was originally planned by the devs.There are a few flaws in this game, but nothing major. Like I stated above, there is a bit of a learning curve, and the game does have a good tips pop-up on the UI, but I do wish there were more tooltips to explain certain icons. This is apparent on the Alliance last mission with the Artifacts you can use. I also wish the Apemen were used more, the Americans can't use them to their full potential, but more than that, except for a few missions, you only get maybe 3 apemen per mission.I am glad the Original War Community continues to support this game, and I hope it only grows. The game took me about 40 hours to complete with all of the achievments, which is seriously impressive for an RTS. I want to come back to this game from time to time and replay key missions, as well as play the full Arab Campaign once it is finally complete."

While this sounds like a cliche B-movie (and it kinda is), every other aspect of this game is rather unique (some might say, pardon the pun, original)The game could be characterized as RTS. You build bases, in those bases you explore new technologies, build vehicles, defense towers etc. The game however features many RPG elements. As sending people to past is demanding, you only get a set number of soldiers for each mission. They all have names, personality, and skills, and they are at your disposal for the entire campaign. If you lose a soldier, you won't get a replacement, you are one man short for the rest of the mission. If you lose a skilled soldier that has been fighting with you since the beginning of the campaign, not only does this hurt your performance (you no longer have that guy that could all by himself clear out a small enemy base), you also lose a person that talked to you and other soldiers, made jokes, expressed concerns and otherwise interacted with the entire unit.There are many more aspects of the game and it's gameplay, that could be considered innovative, but I will leave exploring those to people reading this. If you are considering buying this game, then I can only recommend that you do. You won't get just another Red Alert or Age of Empires clone, I can guarantee you that you will get a game that is unlike anything you've ever played."

There are two campaigns each with 20 or so mission for the main 2 factions, where some of the missions are from the point of the other side but they aren't the same missions as you may remember it from the previous campaign, there is always something different. Oh and your choice does matter!! It might take a while but character that survives in 3rd mission might pop-up in 10th and save the day.Actually all the characters are unique, you can't 'make' more, once they are dead, they stay dead. Don't even let me start on character development, yes this is a RTS but every character have it's own stats (speed, armor) that depend on it's level and a class (soldiers have more armor, are slightly slower and are better at fighting than scientists). Your only source of manpower are apemens with their own set of classes (yes, suicide vest apemen is one of them).The game has multiplayer but luckily it's not plagued by 'competitive' balancing so all the faction feel different, play different.

You have here 3 Factions and your resource are actually your people.You in online games from 9 to 24 people, if killed they are hard to replace, you cant buy them again.You can let appear new , but even on fastest option it takes time.You change by your characters any time with right building in 5 Classes.Trooper, Scientist Mechanic Worker or Special trooper after Update. You can research a lot of Stuff here, and build a lot of interesting Tanks.Its a special RTS, in most you do just let people die, here you must look that they survive.By do their job the level up and are this way more efficient, but can be equipped anytime to do other stuff.You collect crates and can train apes to help you, build tanks and people do drive them. You can upgrade your tanks so far that they are controlled by PC, but Tanks with people are more efficient. You can fuel your tanks with oil and must refill them or with a special Crystal, so they don't need to be refilled.Best is the Story, there are several outcomes of the story and you can anytime look what would have happened if you choose the other stuff. Like what if you do side with rebels or stay by the order.You have really good characters you can either play American or Russia in the Story, in Multiplayer you can play Arab, who do have suicide Apes or their Tanks can explode. In Story each you your Troopers is a character with own voice and story,you do permanent loose a character if he dies, you don't have him in next mission, you can replay anytime the mission so more people survive. Its not like you have just 10 Missions and do them. There are situations like you are asked, stay loyal, rebel or join a new side. You can try out all 3 outcomes. So its more like 100 different ways to finish the game the way you want.Each human has its own name and portrait, speed, firepower and defense scores, and experience levels.American and a Soviet campaign are awesome. Missions on both sides tend to contain scripted events, multiple-choice situations and sidequests. Human units persist between missions, so that each loss is a loss for the rest of the game.The Story did really impressed me, not like today here you go just kill or bomb someone.If you still like 2D RTS games, you have here a solid, well balanced and good game."

It may even have come to reside in that special place in my heart - you know, on the 3rd shelf, next to C&C. For many others, it clearly still does, as it benefits from a strong, active community.However, having only found this much later in its life during a Steam sale, I was somewhat disappointed. It suffers similarly to the RTS games of the same era from single- or two-trick-pony AI. The script and voice acting with which it is delivered are, frankly, terrible, undermining what feels like would have been a fun, novel setting back in its day. Even as a fan of the old-skool RTS games, I have to, somewhat sadly, say this was more miss than hit for me.Worth checking out if you are a fan of similar games from that era, but one I'd recommend you catch in a sale.Reviewed after just under 50 hours play."

Also do not forget to save it just at the end and start of each level as there is no auto save .
