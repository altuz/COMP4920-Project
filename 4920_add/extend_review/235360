The game also pauses to try to connect to its server frequently during play.  Completely broken now, as if the points below weren't bad enough in the first place.Having paid for the Steam version of this game feels like an EX slap in the face with a trout by a troll.It is free to play (with microtransactions) on Kongregate, Facebook and mobile devices.  The Steam version does not get updated, it's at version 1.2. The F2P versions get frequent updates and are currently version 1.7.3.A borderline criminal business practice. On Steam, if you buy the game, they already got your money so why update the game eh ? And likewise on F2P, its of course very important to constantly update it with new things to spend money on.  Disgusting.Seriously Nival? You gave us the wonderful Homm5, and then you do this, why? :(Its not even a bad game, its a very functional and decent looking TD with a unique CCG flavour, its actually well worth checking out.  Just.. don't be a fool like me and purchase it here, play the F2P versions instead."

I picked this one up on a whim and right off the bat I could tell this game was set up with a mobile market in mind.They build RNG into your potential power by making upgrades random drops, and build the maps around having gotten said random upgrades. So inevitably, you will reach a spot where the towers you have are simply not good enough, and to proceed you will have to grind and spend time PRAYING for a specific tower that you want to drop so you can upgrade it.It is a black spot in the genre, and this game should be avoided on that basis alone. The rest of the game is bog standard tower defense, and not interesting enough to make this system worth my time. Do not purchase."

It starts off fun for the first half... You get to upgrade towers and combine powers and unlock new abilities... All very nice...BUT...The baddies are in a constant state of ""better than you can ever be"" near the middle of the game. As you are upgrading towers, like in other tower defense games it should be EASIER to take out baddies so they just throw more baddies at you so you can then upgrade towers more, but in this game they not only throw more baddies at you but the baddies are near invincible and require HOURS AND HOURS of grinding to finally beat. Even with upgrades and such, the starting ""prime"" money/resources at the begining of each level is insanely low for the amount of powerful baddies that show up even in the first wave... The amount of prime you get from each kill does not go up with the difficulty increase and health increases the baddies get as the game progresses, so it makes it even harder to upgrade towers and such without pointless hours upon hours of grinding. Also, the types of towers that show up after the midpoint are completely random, so you may get some decent towers in a playthrough or you may never see those towers at all!  It just feels like a poorly executed port from a mobile platform ""free to play, but pay to win"" type game at that point. I mean I had towers upgraded that could do 5000+ damage in a single shot and it couldn't take down the weakest swarmers.I really cannot recommend this game because of the insane difficulty curve that spikes in at the midpoint of the game; it goes from being fun, to being a decent challenge, to being an automatic rage quit. Maybe I will revisit the game and give a better review if the devlopers ever fix the balancing issues. (DEVS? If you are reading this, play the game 'Defense Grid"" that is how a tower defense game should be done.)"

,Recommended,235360,7693216,"Posted: 18 November, 2013",all,noibn,"I am slightly conflicted in recommending this. On one hand, purely from a ""tower defense"" perspective, the gameplay is pretty solid. Everything works as it should and it is well-designed (nice interface, towers all serve specific purposes, enemy health, waves and routes are clearly indicated, etc). And most importantly, the actual gameplay itself is fun. What brings this down are the nonstandard elements the developers tried to introduce into the standard tower defense formula - specifically, the ""card system"" (and everything that comes along with it). There's nothing wrong with the basic idea - tower types are represented by cards that can be collected and leveled up, and you have to pick and choose a subset of cards from your deck before going into a level. Where the problem comes in is obtaining the cards you need you be successful and ""leveling up"" those cards. First of all, the leveling system is overly confusing and needlessly complicated. Secondly, in order to beat the later levels, you will need specific cards leveled up to adequate levels of strength. The problem with this is that most of the cards you get as rewards are random, so you could go a good long while without (or possibly even never) finding a Lightning Tower card, for example (which I would consider absolutely essential for beating the game). And even if you are lucky enough to get some good towers, the process of leveling them up takes serious time. You basically just need to keep grinding out optional levels to get extra cards that can be used to fuse/evolve other cards. And make no mistake, you are going to be doing some serious grinding. So, depending on your tolerance for grinding levels and ranking up things, that's how I would recommend you make your decision to buy this or not. Personally, I am the OCD-type who feels the need to level things up and complete stuff, so I forced myself through and eventually got enough cards of high enough strength to power through the main game, as well as the extra hard difficultly that unlocks afterwards. While I did enjoy the game overall, it did take a lot of time and effort to get the most out of it. To me, tower defense shouldn't be about making towers strong enough to win by brute force. It should be about overcoming the challenges using a set of predefined towers and nothing else except whatever strategy you come up with. The first half of this game can be played along those lines, but once you get to the later levels, you will absolutely hit a wall if you don't have certain cards leveled up to a certain strength. That's poor design in my eyes. But even with all that said, I honestly still had fun with this game, as it's well made and I have a semi-high tolerance for grindy things. If you think you can deal with the grinding issue and like TD games, definitely go for it. Otherwise, you may want to hold off or wait for a huge discount."

,Recommended,235360,9915098,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,Aussiedroid,"Tower Defense crossed with a Card Collecting game; an unusual mix that strangely works well together. You have a set campaign of around 20 quests to complete before you, with some side quests you can do between main quests to gain further experience. There is some backstory to the whole game but its not overly interesting only appearing after winning certain levels. You use the drops, silver & stars earned from each win to upgrade your towers & magic, increase your deck size & obtain other perks.Initial levels in the game are very, very easy to complete, making me think this might be a 'one session to complete' kinda game. Once you hit around level 10, the levels get much harder though. If you have been unlucky on the drops or have put your upgrades into tower cards you shouldn't have you can find yourself grinding out upgrades to get through the next level. This isn't overly frustrating though as the maps are randomly selected for each difficultly level & can have random modifiers to block certain tower squares from use. This adds new challenges for existing maps. There are also some unique boss levels where you have a set amount to build & take down a large enemy - those are fun!There are a LOT of different towers you can build up in your deck. For tower defense veterans, most of the common suspects are there in some form (guns, flamers, slowers, long range), plus some other more unique configurations. Not sure exactly how many tower types there are but would estimate at least 20. The quality of the card determines how far you can upgrade, with each upgrade generally improving DPS/Range/Efficiency etc.For those who like a strong mazing component to their tower defense, then this game might not be for you. There is some maps with a smaller level of mazing but most have a set path design. The strategic importance in PW:D is with your card selection to match the incoming enemies & what you put your limited upgrades earned towards. Better choices will make moving up the levels much easier (unlike my poor effort of a play through lol!), & bad choices will make the game feel next to impossible to beat.The HD support (or lack of) I found a bit disappointing. Running PW:D in full screen ends up stretching the desktop down to 1280x720 - windows like the Steam window open in the background always get shrunk down & I need to resize. It looks fine at the lower resolution just a minor frustration. Again, a minor frustation I found was the menus between games. There is a lot of going in and out of different sections to get your upgrades done, check your towers etc. This could have been simplified to fit more cards on one page, and have main functions and browsing together to save going back and forth.Overall, I have really been enjoying this one. Its a challenging & addictive tower defense game with a card twist! Lots of achievements & one that is well suited to load up for a quick 10-20min TD session.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

Every tower has its price and costs an amount of ""prime"", which you are lack of and it makes levels hard as hell so this is the reason why you need better towers which you can achiev by buying new cards and playing almost same levels again and again which sometimes makes this game really boring. You can improve your cards by evolving and fusing them.

,Recommended,235360,4260982,"Posted: 7 June, 2013",all,Xelios,"Update: Offline mode has been implemented.Prime World: Defenders is a challenging tower defense with card collecting and rpg elements, where the story is told through comic book art sequences with full voice acting. 23 repeatable story levels, as well as randomized levels for grinding, are laid out on an overworld map. When you play a level you’ll have a rotatable, zoomable and pannable isometric view of towers and enemies. Towers cost “prime” to build and upgrade, and you only begin levels with a small amount. Killing enemies will earn you more prime, as will summoning additional waves of enemies before they’re due--though in many cases this will increase the difficulty and possibly overwhelm you. Where towers can be placed on the field there are sometimes helpful anomalies which increase their range, power or firing rate. There is also a handy toggle for 2x battle speed.Towers and spells in the game are represented by reusable cards in your inventory, and you can only carry a set number with you into battle. You can see which enemy types populate a map before you enter so you know how to build your deck. There are towers for both land and air enemies, invisibility detection, snaring, poison, fire, mortar and more. Destructible towers which buff or heal the enemy may also exist within levels.Spells don’t cost prime but are instead on a timer, and consist of targetable AoEs which snare, stun, reveal invisible enemies and/or do flat damage. Spell and tower cards can be combined with other cards in the forge to level them up--increasing their base damage, range and/or secondary effect intensity--and tower cards can be combined with their duplicates to make the towers upgradeable to tier II and tier III during battle, doubling and quadrupling their damage respectively.Currency is awarded after battle and can be used to unlock talents for your hero, purchase cards from the store and pay for forging costs. Each story map you complete will earn you 1-3 stars as well, depending on your performance. These stars can be used to unlock high level talents and purchase rare cards. You’ll also be numerically scored on every story map depending on how much damage you take and the amount of prime you have left over at the end, and these scores can be compared with friends’ for each map. You’re also given a total game score which can be compared both globally and with friends’ on the leaderboards.The difficulty can be frustrating and requires some grinding before bosses, but it tends to be a gear check rather than a matter of skill. Everything about Prime World: Defenders is surprisingly solid for a title that came out of nowhere, and that’s even considering my time with the game was mostly in its beta state and the fact I am not remotely a fan of tower defense."

Last edited: 27 November.i will just focus on progression system while for the rest you can read his====================================I have to say that your review is the only one which shares my opinion on the game. Was planing of writing ""something"" ""somewhere"" and wanted to inform ppl about it. Basically my opinion is everything you just wrote + one other thing about the progression system. i am not sure how this works so if i am posting on only your wall let me know :)i do not have a clue if this game is on any other platform but it is clear that the initial design (progression system) was with micro-transactions in mind. During the game you are awarded with ""Stars"" (level up, optional ""quests"", random draw, etc.) which you can than exchange for the ""rare"" booster packs and final tier upgrades (which you will need to do for sure). If they decide to place this game on Facebook/Android/iOS (or something like that) it would perfectly fit in. You even get a free random card for every day you log in (this reminded me of facebook games).There is no microtransactions in the game, just my opionion is that the design the game and progression system was with transactions in mind, then decided not to have micro transactions but they forgot to remove the ""grinding"" part. Again, just my opinion and how i see it.i have played for 16 h of the game or so. Had a lot of fun, i quite enjoyed it, got my money worth (was on a discount).Now i am not sure if i will ever finish it (currently i am aware that i have to grind for a lot of cards/gold so that i can enhance my cards and progress further). I do not have time to grind anymore... probably just getting old :)My recommendation:- if you are searching for a TD game which you would play every day for 15-20 min than i strongly recommend this game to you (every 5th day you get a rare card so will probably keep your grinding to minimum).- if you like to play games in a 1 to 3 h sessions (like me) than the grinding will get quite apparent at some point... now do you want to grind or not its up to you... story could be your motive to grind to find out how it all ends..in general, if discounted than yes. Full price? No. Add 5 more bucks and buy Defense Grid."

76561197996028718,Recommended,235360,11464395,"Posted: 29 July, 2014",all,bassie,"This game is not without flaws, and your enjoyment of it can depend greatly on how you like it's mechanics. Most crucial among those is a progression system that allows you to level up your towers between missions through a collectible card system. You can buy additional cards as well as boosters with ingame currency (no microtransactions whatsoever in the steam version) and use those to evolve your towers, unlocking the ability to upgrade them during missions, or infuse them, making them more effective. Different tower cards also have different rarities, with some being straight upgrades from their common versions. This leads to the first major flaw with the game, as the card rewards for side-missions are random, leaving you hoping for a specific tower to drop because at some point in the game, about 10-12 story missions in, you will hit a brick wall of difficulty. Once you get the next 'tier' of basic towers properly evolved and infused it becomes easier again, but getting these towers is mostly a case of farming sidemissions in hopes that RNG will bless you with the right rewards. I feel the upgrade system worked well inherently, but adding tiers to the towers completely broke it.Difficulty tends to be all over the place in general. For example, finishing the normal mode of the game unlocks a heroic mode and two extra long survival missions. But with the towers required to beat the last level I had zero difficulty in the survival missions, often mashing the rush button to send in more gits because my towers ground everything to paste from start to finish. The heroic modes also felt hugely dissapointing, as I was able to blitz all of them with next to no effort up to the last level, which I overcame with two retry's and a bit of tweaking the tower placements.The missions themselves however, are well-built for the most part, with the only hiccup being the randomized levels you get for your sidemissions. The game essentialy re-uses previously finished levels and adds random buffs to some tiles and inpassable rocks to the other. This meant you couldn't rely on a single layout and had to adapt, which greatly increased their replay value. Admittedly it could benefit from removing the first few levels from the map pool, since they're so small you run out of things to build or upgrade halfway through the harder sidemissions and can only sit and cast the odd spell, waiting for the waves to inevitably overrun your defense.The towers themselves start out rather bland with the basic all-round tower, the slow tower and the anti-air tower, but later tiers add some much needed variety, with the highest tier offering some interesting options to mix and match into all new ways to make the Touched's lives impossible.The Touched is the generic enemy faction in this game and consist of a collection of fantasy villains like kobolds, ogres and trolls. The only remarkable enemy is the pink floating marshmallow... thing that occasionally teleports forward and suddenly sneaks past your defenses. No really, you'll know it when you see it... and then you'll rage.The game has a story and a linear set of missions to follow along with that, but it's cringeworthy at best. There's no major twists, even if the game tries very hard to set one up for you. The voice-acting is mostly terrible, with a special place in hell for the short snippets played during the missions.TLDR: the gameplay is good, but beware that the difficulty can spike wildly between missions and most of the times the only solution is to farm sidemissions. Also there's a story, but who plays tower defense games for the story?"

Involves strategy, but allow different strategies to beat the levels, which is always nice. I hate games where you are given a bunch of options, but to win you have to chose a particular one. Never felt this was one of those games.You eventually will have to grind, but i found it an enjoyable grinding never felt repetitive. Mainly because, while ""grinding"" you can beat one mission you already passed trying new cards/spells you earned. It's like you are grinding but at the same time, you are training and experimenting the best ways to beat the upcoming levels. You get the feel that you are always progressing, which i appreciate a lot.The card evolution/fusing system it's also very interesting, and adds a lot to the game.The visuals and voice acting are also enjoyable, not great, but they do their job decently."

At start, I loved the game, I still play it from time to time. The idea of having different towers and magic abilities, which you can customize, is great. Towers and magic are aquired through cards. When it comes to customization, it means you can customize what towers you take with you and you can reinforce these towers with fusing different cards. The crafting isn't hard to grasp, you either improve a card or evolve a card. Evovling meaning, ie. a tower can be upgraded to the next level, meaning you can in-game upgrade the tower. There are 3 tiers when it comes to evolution, default, upgraded and max evolution.It is a great game, but playing and progressing requires you to play same map, again and again. At some point through the main story, you will get the next map which you can finish, if you can't you have three different challenges from where you get more cards, easy, medium and hard. These kind becomes your bread and butter, grinding these challenges for more cards, so that you can progress and make better towers.At some point, you will notice that there are very little variety to the game. Challenge maps will be recycled, which imo, isn't too bad. But you will see same enemies over and over again, in different colors. The challenge will be different, even though you have the same enemy, but the only difference is that the monster can tank more damage.If you don't mind the grinding and similiarites through the game, I would recommend this game. Good game with an good idea, but somewhat poorly designed. I think the metascore is true and correct, but that doesn't mean the game is bad or not fun. I would recommend watching some gameplay vids, before considering buying the game. Still a decent tower defense game."

Sorry to everyone that bought it in the holiday/seasonal sales; it's apparently been broken for months.  I didn't notice until a few days ago.Gameplay wise, the TD mechanics are solid and the card system makes for an interesting twist on figuring out a playstyle that works for you with the cards you have.  There are, however, a few missions along the way that simply cannot be beaten unless you and your cards are leveled up enough.  You simply won't have enough damage to outpace healing, for example, or you won't be able to kill the flyers and the ground units with the resources available unless both sets of towers are strong enough to hit the benchmark of cost efficiency necessary to kill stuff before it gets to the end of the maze.  That, to me, is bad design.  It isn't enough to prevent me to urge anyone not to buy it, but you should be aware of the possibility of needing to grind to get strong enough to beat certain levels.

Zzz...Sarcasm aside, this game really is pretty fun. It blends TD, char lvling to gain new skills and also the collecting of cards to gain access to new towers and spells. You then sacrifice extra cards to towers you like to make them stronger. I honestly hope to see more games like this. This game is just as ground breaking to TD as Dungeon Defenders was. The addition of actuall loot in my mind is what makes it shine, but clearly other lazy folks don't agree and just thumbs downed the game without even trying. Granted I've only had it for 1 day but I've logged 10+hours in that time & can't wait till I wake up later to play it some more. As far as the metascore I really am stumped, this is the most fun I've had on a game in awhile and all for under $10. If it goes on sale again it's worth a look."

It combines a classic TD-game with a trading card game with many features, looks very nice and you can choose many different play styles, all what you need in a good TD-game. But you need to grind a little bit to get these cards or you buy booster-packs from the ingame-store, don’t worry, it’s not pay-2-win. If you are not sure, try the demo version of this game or the free version on iOS or Android.StoryThis game has not really a story with a meaning. It’s completely irrelevant and can be ignored, how all TD-games oyu play this for the gameplay and not for a interesting story.GameplayLike a standard TD-game you do exactly the same in Prime World Defenders. You choose a level and build your towers to defense your base against the enemies. There are fixed points to build the towers and some of them have special effects like more damage or areas that increase the range or the attack speed. There are also magic spells including freeze, fire, thunderbolt etc.To be able to upgrade your towers you must collect trading cards and to get them, you need to finish the levels or collect silver and buy some booster-packs from the store. Every Tower or magic spell is a card and you need two of them to combine them to upgrade them ingame. To level up your cards you can use very card, depending on how rare the cards are you get more or less experience points.After finishing all levels in the normal mode you unlock the hard mode. To beat this and maybe to collect all the achievements, you have to grind a long time.GraphicPrime World Defenders looks nice for a TD-Game. The game has a comic style with nice visual effects and is very clear, also the User Interface.

Pet peave= If you hover your mouse over a tower or even select a tower in game, it does not tell you what tower you have selected or what tower you are about to build.  You pretty much have to learn what tower is what based on the picture or what the tower looks like.  I may be missing something, but I have been playing for a while now and always seem to build the wrong tower.  There are also places where if you place a tower there, you get a buff of some sort.  But there is no indication of what that buff does until you actually place a tower there, making it too late if you make a mistake.Other than that, the game is amazing!

I would still recommend it, doubly so if you see it on sale.  Expect to get frustrated and maybe not play through it all the way, but tower defense games are usually just time-wasters anyway, right?This is a solid tower defense game, made unique by the collectible card aspect which allows you to collect your towers as cards, and to upgrade them by sacrificing other cards.  Match two of the same card and you can ""evolve"" a card, and thus level it up (up to a max of level 3).  Burn a pile of otherwise-useless artifact cards, or some lesser cards that maybe you have too many of, and you can increase the level of your cards, making your towers do more damage and adding range.  The RPG aspects people speak of are pretty minimal, in my opinion.  You, as a character, do gain levels, and this allows you to buy some abilities such as larger card carrying capacity, passive buffs, and more spells/towers to pick from during a battle.  There are spells which, although pretty underpowered particularly in the second half of the game, add some extra bits of strategy when your towers are ALMOST good enough.  The comic-book-esque cutscenes are kindof neat, tho the story isn't exactly going to be the driving force for playing this one.The balance is pretty well thought out, with one very glaring flaw.  If you are semi-lucky and get some good rare cards early on, or maybe if you stifle your spending of stars on your stats and instead spend the stars to buy card sets, you can pound through a pretty intense game.  If, however, you don't get at least a lightning or dragon tower by about the third boss, the game becomes impossibly difficult because it's balanced for actually having these top-tier cards.  If you don't have the rare towers, you may find yourself doing a fair amount of grinding, which really starts to suck the fun out of the game.  There are a couple 250-wave levels which are a good means of getting cards and money and experience, but you can't access these until you beat the first half of the game, which really sucks when you just need to build up to beat the last few maps.  They definitely could have put more effort into making the game adapt to the cards they've let you have, rather than assuming you're just going to grind until you get them.A couple tips for this game: if you can hold off evolving a tower card to level 3, you'll get 5% more powerful towers if you evolve four level 1 cards into two level 2 cards, then evolve those into the level 3.  Takes four of the level 1 cards, which can be tedious to get for the top-tier towers, but that extra punch helps for the second half of the game.  Additionally, to help combat the wunky randomness of buying a set of cards for 3 stars and finding out you wasted your valuable stars, you can go to your %appdata% folder and back up the ""Prime World Defenders"" folder inside it, and restore it if you get dealt a bad hand."

Yes, there is a lot of grinding to do and I am not that far into it, so I am not going to really review the game yet.  Just know that I play a lot of Tower Defense (TD ) games and so far Prime World: Defenders is one of my favorite.  The 3D graphics are superb, the gameplay is fun, but might be a bit grindy for some people, the sound is great with excellent music.  Every thing else is done right and very colorful!  All the menus are pleasing to the eye and the world map is awesome!  The choice of creatures is the best feature and they are all rendered in stunning 3D!!!  The towers and animations look great!  The list goes on and on...The only negative thing that I found was that you can only grind the maps so many times before you stop getting silver and experience points for beating them.  Then you have to move along to the next map and grind that map to it's max times.  I think you can grind each map around 10 times or so.  I haven't counted, but it's enough to get some of your perks leveled up.  The cards really only represent the towers and do not come into play during combat like the card game Magic.  You will stack them to level your towers and magic, so to speak.  There are special cards to find and add to your towers too.  This is all done outside of combat.  Combat is your typical tower defense setup, but leveling towers happens outside of combat.  Makes sense and is pretty cool! :-)The game is a little hard, but easier than some of the other TD games I've played.  I'll have to play some more and then come back and review it.  I do like it a lot so far.

As a result, many steam achievements won't unlock (although they do unlock in game, they just have difficulty  syncing up), and this is likely to never be fixed.  End game grinding is a bit tedious, as you're stuck with one of two options to obtain rare towers -- endless survival grinding for a chance at a rare card, and then a chance to pick that card from a set, or logging in every day to get a ""daily bonus"" which has the possibility of being a rare card.It has a lot of card fusing and upgrading, which is kind of a side point to the main game, but it allows you to individually customize your tower set to only upgrade what you use, which is pretty nice.  The unfortunate part of this is the lack of a reliable method to get said towers.  As far as gameplay goes, it's a pretty well done TD, although your ability to path monsters via tower placement is virtually non existant, and your towers are confined to rails along the sides for the most part.  This is it's only real drawback, in that it's more like Kingdom Rush than Defense Grid.All in all, decent game, but it unfortunately will never be great with a developer team giving it any post-release attention.  8/10.  Good for probably 40ish hours, with some additional hours if you enjoy the grind to max out your towers."

Similar cards can also be stacked (to improve their abiliites) or fused in hopes of generating a rare card.Furthermore there is an in-game shop where Game Money earned during levels can be spent for various card booster packs.Prime Defenders looks like a serious effort towards a Play 2 Win which was converted into an offline single player game at the last moment and this alone should earn the developer support for not damaging a decent game by placing it on an empty server dependent on micro-transactions.This is (mostly) yet another tower defense aside from the above mentioned but it's an extremely well-polished TD and one of the very few which I can actually be bothered to play.Price Recommended: $20
