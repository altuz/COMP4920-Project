,Recommended,235460,8636738,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,[AReV]Nomed,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a collaborative effort between Platinum Games and Hideo Kojima.What we’re left with is an extremely fast-paced hack and slash title set in the Metal Gear universe. Solid Snake fans will immediately be disappointed as you once again play as the ninja cyborg; Raiden.The highlights of the game are the fast-paced combat, the stunning visuals, and the ridiculous boss fights. MGSRR does a great job with their combat system which is designed to keep you on the offensive while you chain together parries and attacks without the over-reliance on dodging.The game also adds a “slice anywhere” mechanic which allows you to cut wherever you aim. This essentially allows you to cut enemies and objects in the environment into a million pieces. This really doesn’t add anything significant to the gameplay but it’s still quite a bit of fun.The graphics, visuals, and environments are great. It’s a treat to watch the explosions and chaos unfold around you as you move from one varied area to the next. Unfortunately, the game is fairly linear and doesn’t allow for much room for exploration as you’re constantly hit with frustrating blue boundaries.The game features an over the top story with plenty of humor mixed in. It’s entertaining but don’t expect the same level of depth as other Metal Gear Games.The inclusion of VR missions, where you have to complete simple objectives in a virtual reality training program add a bit more content. The main game is very short however, clocking in at around 5 hours. Granted it’s a fun-filled 5 hours as the game features some of the best boss fights on the market.A few extra things to note:A controller is recommended for the game.This is a console port. It does look better on the PC than the Xbox 360 and PS3 but it is capped at 1920 x 1080 resolution. This means if you're using a 2560 x 1440 resolution monitor, you won't be able to run it at that resolution, you'll have to downscale to 1080p.For a more in-depth review, here’s a video I made:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=214546187Pros:Amazing gameplayStunning VisualsFantastic Boss FightsCan cut things up into a million piecesCons:Short Length and a lack of content in generalLinear with a lack of explorationStory isn't up to par with other Metal Gear games.If you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/"

,Recommended,235460,11299779,"Posted: 18 July, 2014",all,Kenuty,"A fast action game with solid game play music and decent story with the metal gear charm where stealth isn't the dominant game play but will be required at higher-level difficulties. This is a side story game where you play as the bad♥♥♥♥♥ninja Raiden, After a short intro on the execution of a country's minister by Desperado, you'll be taken forward in time to the point where Raiden will go after the armed coup that Desperatdo started to find out what is going on and what the private service companies are up to.The Gameplay is pure action, Slicing, cutting, ripping, and cutting things your way, There will be side weapons you'll earn as you defeat bosses in the game with precise cuts with the  katana. the game play slashing and slicing don't as just one-button presses, depending on where you aim and how you slice you can chop your enemies up to pieces. You'll want to chop their hands and certain places to take their spine so you can take it in as health when you need it and of course when this happens, free form blade mode time slows down enough for you to aim at your enemies on those precision cuts. Later in the game, you'll be able to do ripper mode where you'll go into overdrive. Sub weapons and extra items you can carry and use in this game, which are literally almost useless at times except for specific enemies and at higher end play.The control for this game is better off played with a controller over a mouse and keyboard which was much easier personally to  me for this type of game, though that is a preference, there will be intense fights where the key is to actually be on point for the attacks otherwise you're going to get yourself killed.The soundtrack is absolutely rocking in this game, the music is big time adrenaline pumping, and you'll love it along with the funny voice overs. Ah yes the famous metal gear voice overs. Basically if you don't know what I am talking about you been missing out. It is hilariously bad at times but still well done for being bad, and that's what makes the game great.Once you beat multiple hard modes, there is an even harder mode where you are required to sneak and kill your enemies and to challenge your skills to the limit, don't believe that the stealth is the best part of this game though and only at the highest level difficulty will you be forced to use it.+ The unique system of cutting your enemies up, and things around you+ Rockin soundtracks during battles and game play+ Good variety of weapons that will be unlocked as you defeat bosses.+ funny comedic moments+ all the boss fight was intense and purely epic, especially the last boss+ You slice lots of things to pieces, just not the watermelon+ the way the battle is done is fluid, really fast paced action and the game play is smooth.+ love the fps and the graphics upgrade as much as we got out of it, game runs super smooth+ game is plain fun, FUN!+ raiden is bad♥♥♥♥♥and you'll feel immersed enough that YOU are the bad♥♥♥♥♥+- its a spin off and it isn't a regular metal gear game, fans looking for solid sneaking game will be really disappointed.- The sub item isn't that useful at times, only for certain enemies.- Things do disappear as you slice them- The extra item you get is meh- The stealth isn't metal gear quality- Short game five hours long, you can, however, replay it on a harder difficulty, otherwise no online play or any other replayability factor, maybe some achievements.- The map is straightforward. This is a linear action game with short side quest to do and hidden items to find.- If only it was made on the PC graphics would have been crazy, but it is a port and improved one at that- took a year to come out on pc man but the price is reasonable and with all dlc +++- lol the voice acting is if you like it or hate it, it was done the way it is done.I hope there is a sequel, and I hope they improve on adding more to it to make it unique, trust platinum games when it comes to making action game, this was a collaborative effort, and it was done well, if you played their games before you enjoy it, hardcore mgs fans who want to indulge in the mgs universe will either like or hate this, and those who crave action games will love this game, worth the purchase and also my gotm (game of the month) at the time when it came out.* Follow the Gamer Race Curator*https://steamcommunity.com/groups/strmgrp#curation"

,Recommended,235460,15443986,"Posted: 19 April, 2015",all,♆Major✠Dirtymcnasty❝.❛,"In the first installment of the ""Rising"" series of the Metal Gear franchise, cyborg super-soldier Raiden is dispatched on a mission against a private military company held responsible for acts of terrorism. The truth happens to be more than that in the end.The famous (or infamous) spin-off from the original Metal Gear Solid series, Revengeance brings a gameplay shift from the usual stealth third person shooter into an action-packed hack-and-slash sword fighting game. With Raiden's main weapon being the high-frequency blade, the player is put to engage several enemies that vary from regular sword-fighters, to rocket-launching cyborg soldiers, to huge assault mechs.GameplayAs mentioned above, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance has mainly action gameplay. Implementing the occasional use of one of its main game mechanics, the ""Zandatsu"" (lit. 'cut and take'), used to slice off foes and extract energy units to replenish your own. Stealth is present in the game, as you can sneak past or stealth-kill a number of enemies, but at little quantity given the action genre of the game.Sided with Zandatsu comes the parrying game mechanic, which will give you an extra edge (no pun intended) on combat given its often prompt to deal finishing Zandatsu attacks upon a 'perfect' parry. It's also the only method of defense that doesn't involve dodging in the game, making it your incentive to master it.(Note: it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you have a controller of some sort to play this game, as mouse and keyboard gameplay is extremely complicated.)Combat in the game feels pressing and complicated at higher difficulty levels, giving an extra challenge on levels Hard and above. In addition, there is the presence of some quick-time events, as well as boss fights of the game which usually feel absolutely riveting, from fast-paced cyborg vs. cyborg combat to slicing off pieces of humongous mechs.The only down side is an arena-style limited area during fights.PlotThe story begins in a recently-enforced African country, introducing Raiden as now a member of private military corporation 'Maverick Security Consulting Inc.'. During a guard duty task, President N'mani is hijacked and killed by military contractors of Desperado Enforcement LLC. Months later, Raiden is deployed in tasks to investigate terrorist activities found out to be backed by Desperado. It happens though, it's more than just power and money at play as Raiden uncovers a bigger scheme.The story is over-the-top and characters are -on the least- quirky. Not that it's a bad thing, and it gives the game its distinction from Metal Gear Solid franchise. Just get ready for cyborg ninja fights and explosions.SoundtrackLead composer Jamie Christopherson did an amazing job with the soundtrack of Revengeance, both in the less-famous ambient music and in the better-known vocal tracks, perfectly fitting the situations and characters involved in the longest time. It sets the mood and gives the finishing touch of the game, being also one of the highlights of the game.BugsLittle if any that I know of or could see.OverallAlbeit opinions vary, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance surely does good work in the fighting/action game genre, even if breaking somewhat from the known Metal Gear Solid formula.Revengeance being my first Metal Gear game, in my opinion it's a game worth a play and should be taken in consideration."

According to my system, a 5 is completely in the middle, not like IGN and Gamespot's stupidity, where a 5 is a disaster.------------Visuals7.5/10 [Graphics - 7 | Artstyle - 8]Slightly muddy texture work, outstanding animations, brilliant character designs and a slightly drab color palette. The game looks good, and sometimes amazing when the action really picks up, it is Platinum after all. Props for the smooth 60 FPS throughout the whole game, wouldn't have it any other way.Gameplay9/10Par for the course for Platinum games, high-speed character action that requires a good deal from the player. Precise animations helped by a good combat depth. Raiden's chief trick is parrying, executed by launching an attack in the direction of an enemy, you'd be surprised at what you can parry in this game (nearly everything).Good diverse enemy design and higher difficulties remix enemy placements, which is always a nice touch, even more points for an unlockable difficulty.While we're on the topic of unlockables, this is a Platinum game, so expect costumes, concept art and many other goodies which will certainly wet the appetite of the completionists among you.My only gripe with the gameplay would have to be the subweapon system. It's slow and clunky and I feel that it could have been all but done away with, in favor of more combat inputs, but the game was slightly rushed, so I won't hold it against it.There is a light sprinkling of QTEs, but they are far from intrusive and they do help with the hype in certain moments.Sound10/10 [Music - 10 | Voice Acting - 10]Over the top voice acting that fleshes out over the top characters, great performances by all involved and especially main man Quinton Flynn (Raiden), his rival Philip Anthony-Rodriguez (Sam) and fan favorite Alastair Duncan (Armstrong).No review of MGR is complete without touching on the music. It's amazing. High-speed techno-metal which brilliantly syncs up to the pace of the action on screen. The boss themes deserve special mention, at the start of a bossfight, an instrumental prelude plays, once you reach a specific point on the boss's healthbar, the lyrics start. At this point there should only be a little blood in the adrenaline pumping through your body, not to mention that the lyrics are catchy and memorable. Certainly one of the soundtracks that can be listened to on it's own, but certainly enhances the game in an amazing way, that I wish more devs would utilize.Story8.5/10 [Story - 8 | Writing - 9]Rising takes place at the current end of the Metal Gear continuity, taking place after the events of MGS4: Guns of the Patriots. It's story deals with the exploits of fan ""favorite"" Raiden after he's once again taken up his sword in the name of justice and protecting those who can't protect themselves.The story is divorced from the thick exposition of the Kojima directed games and introduces us to a new, if slightly shallow, but nonetheless interesting cast that exist to facilitate the narrative and give us several people to care for. The antagonists are all colorful and rich in character, just like you'd expect from a Metal Gear game, but their absurdity has been taken to 11, abandoning most pretenses of seriousness in favor of an over-the-over-the-top style of theatrics. This combined with the pumping soundtrack and especially the boss specific vocal themes creates a really memorable experience.And for all you Metal Gear Solid fans, rest assured, there are HOURS of optional Codec Calls explaining details about the universe, or just sharing our fruit ninja's taste in movies.ElementScoreVisuals7.5/10Gameplay9/10Sound10/10Story8.5/10Overall9/10The game is certainly memorable, but with slight flaws that don't bring it to the level of character action games such as DMC3 or Bayonetta, but certainly one worth your time, money and electrolytes!"

,Recommended,235460,13433594,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Underdrill,"Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is an amazing game. My game of the year 2014. Let me explain why.I have not played a Metal Gear game before, but I jumped on this because I have heard of the acclaim this series has gotten. This may be a spin off of the main series, but it has convinced me enough that I made the right choice in purchasing.The story is a bit throwaway, but interesting. Hell, I don't care much for it. This game is all about the gameplay. It is a spectacle fighter where you play is Raiden who, to put it quite simply, is a badass. He can slice people in half and into tiny little pieces with the 'Zandatsu' mode aka Blade Mode. This, when used correctly, can slow down time to cut parts of enemies off and even them into half if they are weakened enough. You can also rip out their spine and regain all of your health and blade mode meter. This may seem overpowerd, but it is quite the opposite.This game is hard. Really hard, even on Normal (Which I recommend you start with). There are also 3 difficulties above it. Yeah. It gets really intense and requires a lot of skill. You will need to parry foes by attacking in the same direction as them and dodge them by unlocking a skill known as 'Defensive Offensive' and using at the perfect timings. If you are skilled enough, you can perfect parry your opponents to do serious damage. On the hardest difficulty, Revengeance, this is required. Every single enemy on that difficulty will take serious damage from it or get sliced into pieces. I found revengeance to be a nice change of pace. I even found it easier, but maybe it is because I got real good at it.The boss fights are one of the best parts of the game. They are all extremely hard and they even have a no damage achievement to go with it. Prepare to spend hours and hours trying to beat them, but having that proper satisfaction and success when you finally memorize their movements and parrying their every move. The bosses are also incredibly unique and each require very different strategies to beat.The game has an upgrade system where you can unlock skins, new weapons and upgrades for them. There is quite a lot of stuff to upgrade, and some of them are tied to the many collectibles, which are quite well hidden. You can get the currency, BP, by ripping out the spine of your foes, by completing battles or finding consumables. These consumables consist of one time use items, like Grenades, RPG's and Stealth items. This game has a very simple stealth system (Approach enemy from behind/above. press button) but going head first into fights is where this game is at it's best.All of the DLC is included. This includes extra skins, weapons, 2 bonus campaigns and VR Missions, which is basically the games challenge mode. There are 20 of these missions in the base game and 30 in the dlc. They are all really hard and sometimes frustrating, but it is always satisfying to finally completing a hard challenge. Some of the DLC ones also offer a different type of gameplay. There is a very obvious nod to a sidescroller in one of them.The bonus campaings are really good as well. They offer a different playable character, more collectables and more challenging fights. Jetstream Sam is a much heavier fighter, while Blade Wolf is more stealth focused. They both offer a change of pace and more replay value, which the base game has a lot of.One final thing I should mention. The Music. It is f*cking amazing. Not only do they sound brilliant, the lyrics have a meaning to the boss fights, which is where most of them are found. It has, hands down, one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.Final Verdict: 10/10. Buy it now. £4, £10, £20, it is all worth your hard earned money. I really hope a sequel is made, as the game was quite short, but it offers a extreme amount of replay value."

,Recommended,235460,13566833,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,ownosourus,"To say that Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is over-the-top is an understatement. Having missed out on last year’s console release, I went into the game only knowing that it was a brawler based in the Metal Gear Solid mythos. I had no idea what I was getting into. This is a game where cyborg ninjas slice their enemies into slivers with electrified katanas, sometimes with their feet. This is a game where three-armed eyeballs and chainsaw-tailed attack dogs jump from the shadows to tear at you. And if that’s not enough, most of this happens within the first half hour.If you’ve never played a Metal Gear game before, fear not. Revengeance is set within the Metal Gear universe and features a number of callbacks, but, in general, it is flavor for the fare. There is a story, as crazy and shifting and nonsensical as it may be, but newcomers to the series can easily slip right in. Unlike many games, having a crazy, shifting, nonsensical story really doesn’t do Revengeance any disservice. This is a game that revels in its outrageousness. The lunacies of its futurist setting actual serve the gameplay by elevating the possibilities to new heights.The core of Revengeance’s seriously satisfying nature lies in its defensiveness as much as the sheer fun of slicing enemies into dozens of pieces. This is not a game to be button-mashed through. Enemies hit hard and team up, forcing you to dodge and parry. Revengeance has the great quality of allowing you to feel like you are winning against all odds. This trait comes at the frustrating cost of repeated death while learning the intricacies of combat, however.Raiden has a number of moves which can be easily chained together using a mix of heavy and light attacks, as well as a secondary weapon. These can be expanded and upgraded over time, of course, and each blow carries a nice sense of impact.The most unique addition Revengeance brings to the fore is Blade Mode. Once you dispatch enough enemies to charge your fuel cells, Blade Mode can be activated to trigger Zandatsu, a combat technique which slows time and allow you to set the angle of each sword swing. This is important because Zandatsu is the primary way of regaining health. Precise cuts must be made to sever the cybernetic spine of enemies so their power can be absorbed.Using Blade Mode, Revengeance becomes something of a cutting simulator. Raiden can freely chop his environment into little bits, which is separate from the organ-severing Zandatsu.For all of the fun Platinum Games has packed in, Revengeance does have a tendency to degrade into eyeroll-worthy campiness. With the exception of the bulging American, most of the main players are disturbingly beautiful.One of the biggest things where the game gets seriously ridiculous is in the boss fights. These can be epically large in scale or a one on one fight with another cyborg. Either way, they are intense and fun as hell.It may be a somewhat short experience, but there’s no denying the fact that the entire time was full of high adrenaline action. The combat is simple and satisfying, and the presentation is top notch."

So if you liked DMC you will like MGR.This game is a pure action game and is nothing like the Metal Gear games which are more stealth oriented games.You play as Raiden a cyborg enhanced human soldier who fights for a private military firm. The story is set in the future when private military companies are trying to manipulate politics to suite there hidden agenda.The game is non-stop action with high adrenaline music and epic cut scenes that tell the story. The boss fights are also quiet epic and rewarding when you finally win.When you advance in the game you receive battle points. With these points you can buy upgrades for your weapons and armour, new battle suits and health and new skills. Hidden in the game you can find upgrades for your health, grenades, ...A unique skill in this game is the ‘Blade Mode’. When the ‘Blade Mode-bar‘ is full you can activate this. It’s a sort of slow motion sequence when you can cut your opponents in slices – it’s impressive and a big part of the game.The game is best played with a gamepad. The Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller work flawlessly.The game can be quiet difficult and frustrating at times – especially the boss fights against the senator.I nominated the 'Senator' of 'The “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” Award' in the 2016 Steam Award.After you finish the game you can access the included 2 DLC stories. In the first story you play Jetstream Sam and in the second you play Bladewolf. Replay ability come from higher difficulty settings, trying to get better battle scores and finding and finishing the more than 50 VR-mission.The bad:The game doesn’t support resolutions higher than 1080p. When you want higher resolutions you need to use a ‘hack-program’. I used Flawless Widescreen to play the game in 2560*1080 – 21/9 aspect ratio – this worked without problems but all cut scenes are letterboxed (with black bars).I believe there is a bug in the game with AMD GPU’s when you activate ‘Blur’ in the graphics options menu. With an AMD GPU you get constant stuttering. With ‘Blur’ deactivated you can play the game at maximum settings.Conclusion:I recommend this game."

When I found out the main character was a cyborg I thought ""hang on a minute, if he's a cyborg... That means he can rev AND biff at the same time... Maybe even do a burnout with his phallic member(try this at home)!After playing for a while I encountered a cutscene that made me want to turn gay, or at least embrace my inner homosexual. The player character catches a knife in his elegant high heels while striking a sexy pose and showing off his nice body. On the second playthrough I equipped him in red armour just to see if he looks sexier in red heelsWhen I finally unlocked customization the first thing I looked for was a V12 engine, it was not there. I then looked for twin-turbos, still not there. So I thought, at the very least, we should be able to attach wheels to ourselves so we can do a burnout, isn't that the first thing all cyborgs want to do? No wheels. No burnouts. You can, however, still get extra revs in your engine & better fuel economy, but what good is extra revs if you can't do a burnout..? Well, you still can do a form of burnout; the extra revs allow your mind to just rotate in place at around 9999RPM, spinning with such fierce velocity that it actually causes your brain to do a burnout against the walls of your skull and grind itself into a dense smog.Once you purchase the maxed brain burnout upgrade and rev it hard you reach the point where all you can see is Hideo Kojima. Why can you see Hideo Kojima? Because you have just exceeded the boundaries of reality and entered the ""Kojimaverse"". I would recommend at this stage taking an entire plethora of psychedelic and narcotic substances, as the cutscenes will make much more sense that way, as will the plot and Hideo Kojima's mindset(or lack thereof) while making this game.All in all this game is an excellent example of why drugs are bad, and should be bought for your children at a young age to properly indocrinate them against drugs. Those of you whom it is too late for such things will, however, probably enjoy the last piece of your sanity rotating around inside your skull, going up in smoke and slowly drifting away like a fart in the wind, right off into the sunset.And your sanity lived happily ever after.The end."

The primary campaign is short, but it gives users a real treat with its dynamic soundtrack and epic bosses. Raiden's blade mode also allows you to cut the most fearsome of enemies into up to thousands of pieces. And, even after the primary campaign is completed, there are many upgrades, VR missions, and challenges for a player to pursue.Overall, the game provides a very enjoyable and action-packed experience - after all, which other game gives you the opportunity to pick up gigantic metal gears while someone is singing rock in the background?"

This is my attempt in which I will try to cover the problems this game has without sucking Kojima's asian pee pee too much.At first I'd like to state that I am not familiar with the Metal Gear series. I never was a fan and i found the realistic approach behind it far to unappealing. Considering most of the titles were also developed for Non-Nintendo platforms i never had much of an opportunity to get to know these kind of games.Thing i've noticed so far, MGR has as much to do with a regular Metal Gear game as a baseball bats make sense in a hardware store. Yes, they are kind of tools, but the intended use is an entirely different reason at all. You dont need any prior knowledge to enjoy it and the unavoidable brand pandering is keep tolerable low for the most part.Regarding the controls, you need to be aware that this game is next to unplayable without a game controller. And i should know. I attempted to do it on a keyboard only to learn halfway that you need more than Surgeon Simulator cutting accuracy later on to not get assblasted. Un- and relearning the control scheme while battling a boss was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The fairly incompetent camera movement and derp combat lock-on did not help either.The machine I ran this on was 4 years old at the time of the playthrough. Although I could play the game at state-of-the-art console graphics, i can not recommend it on similar or older hardware. There's much stuff in this game happening at the same time and the physics engine can torture your CPU real mean. Lower resolutions were helpful, i barely noticed the lower performance visuals and it still worked fine. For the most part.Talking gameplay, this game is more or less a browser with inbuilt swordplay and a physics engine. You can cut most things into pieces (with the exception of trash containers, cats and the ground you walk on) while performing moves that would remind one of an adept fighting game. It's also mostly fast paced and benefits fast reactions and accumulating skill. The game has a heavy start, so make a slow approach and take your time to get used to all of it. Don't try to become a perfectionist though, the ratings system is thoroughly ♥♥♥♥ed and after a certain point won't address any advancement whatsoever besides a lightning fast no damage run. That's something you need to consider.It feels mostly like a knight game. You confront a bunch of enemies in open combat and take them down one by one. The stealth aspects of this game are rather boring, silly and feel shoehorned in in the out of place spaces i found them in. I guess the game could do fairly well without them. I mostly ignored them right away and did battle head on. A thing i didnt like too much was the overabundance (or should i say abuse) of Quick time events. You basically can't do a single fight properly without feeling like an idiotic lab test monkey during the duty calls-esque bullet time with the hint ""HOW BOUT U PRESS DEEZ BUTTONS?!!11"".The presentation in both visuals and audio is what you can expect. High quality and very enjoyable. Especially the soundtrack is excellent. The storytelling appears to be rather cookie cutter at first, but digs deeper in as you carry on, revealing deep thoughts on social commentary, war and peace and achievable technology with its following impact in mankind. It can definitely hold a candle to the movie quality experience that was Batman Arkham city. But i guess that's something you can expect with over 2 hours of cutscene footage. (These take up most the whole of the 25 Gigs download capacity btw...)Something you might want to consider: This game has no multiplayer modewhatsoever. You are all left on your own with a bunch of impossible challenge mode arenas, an avalanche of unachievable unlockables or tedious free build-in DLC that cant hold up to the main campaign and will make you question if you even know what you are doing after several hours in the game. Also, why the one and only samurai character in this game has ninja-like traits like faster running, higher jumping or double jumping while the main character who is more like a ninja himself has not is beyond me.To make things short, if you like yourself a wapanese game with cyborgs, large mechs, lots of blood and gore, profanities, hyperbolic super villains, talking dogs, swords, loli hentai and pizza you might like this game.

,Recommended,235460,30904117,Posted: 2 April,all,infernovia,"This is my favorite brawler from the 360/PS3 generation, and it's one of the best games Platinum has made. Period.Platinum is known for satisfying and stylish combat, crazy bosses, and balls to the walls concepts. Everyone agrees that their brawlers are the best in the business. But to me, they were still held back, not quite there. Their magnum opus brawler, Bayonetta, was filled with large, empty, and uninteresting levels. It lacked control in terms of immersion (IE, the plot, the setting, the world) and let the gimmicks run wild.Too much filler.But MGR is different, a fantastic display of Platinum's talents reigned in and controlled. Bayonetta gives you a whole 10min stage devoted to riding a rocket into the city, completely useless padding and a way for the developer to pay homage toSpace Harrier. But MGR is much more controlled, and much more demanding with these ""gimmicks."" They feel spectacular, cool for the moment, yet easily discarded for that next set piece, that next spectacle... as if all that unique assets, programming, was no big deal. The fights jump from set piece to set piece, but in a way that seemed organic and entirely fit the battle that you were already dealing with. Not seamless, (ie, Shadow of the Colossus), but close enough that I could ignore the stitching.The camera is closer to Raiden when compared to Bayonetta, especially in combat. Not the easiest thing in the world when you are sliding, flipping, and slicing spines in half with enemies and protagonists that are as mobile as the ones in here. But somehow, it never felt bad enough for me to throw my controller into the wall. Perhaps it was a necessity for the Zandatsu mode, a mode that lets you cut anything as if you were wielding aswordlightsaberhigh frequency blade, but I am glad they were pushing for this ""zoomed in"" combat. You felt more connected to the character. The cuts feel more visceral, the antagonists more awesome. One of the bosses flips you and the camera flips upside down with Raiden. Cool.The closer the connection, the more demanding the illusion. And this is where the magic starts to break down. The cuts with ""Zandatsu mode"" never feel gory enough, and the ""cutscenes"" oftentimes broke the magic of the fight. I played hard mode from the get go and taking a punch was like getting hammered into your skull. But in the cutscene, I see Raiden getting pummeled and coming back as if barely anything happened. It's a jarring disconnect when you see that happen. Perhaps it gels better when it’s in normal mode… but I love the game too much in hard…And yet, if you can look past these faults, this is genuinely one of the best brawlers of the last generation. It has a great track integrated well into the game. Fights so spectacular that you wish you could relive it over and over again. And antagonists that were properly unique, cool, and memorable. Just the right amount of discussion of self, identity, nationhood, morality for a game branded with the Metal Gear name. Very little stealth element, but let’s be honest, that could have never happened under Platinum’s development.This is where I felt Platinum was headed. A great honing of their craft to really push the boundaries and the limits of third person brawlers. But taking a quick look at their body of work now... well, I hope they can keep the lights on for long enough for another great gamble. I will be waiting."

,Recommended,235460,8746216,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,Junoh,"Before I get started with the review, I must inform everyone that I played with a controller and not the keyboard and mouse. Some people have had trouble using a keyboard and mouse with the game while others have said that it's better than using a controller. If you do not have a controller then I suggest that you check out other reviews and see if it has good keyboard/mouse support. I'm using what is essentially an Xbox 360 controller. This review will only encompass the main game and not the DLC. I will do my best to not spoil any of the story.The first thing I'd like to talk about is the interface. Metal Gear Rising's menus aren't what I'd call perfect but they're functional. One of the biggest issues that I've found with the main menu happens to be pretty minor; you can't quit the game without loading your save file first. It's a negligible issue to me but I see it brought up in the Steam forums quite a bit so some people might consider it a bigger issue.Main Menu and Options Menu:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHaOCg_x7kQThe item menu could stand to be improved but it's likely that you'll never use it in combat anyways. It pauses the game when you press left or right on the directional pad and allows you to pick which weapons you want. When you're being attacked or in the middle of an attack animation then it will seem unresponsive.The heads up display has a lot of information being shown. Whether or not this is a good thing depends on how much hand-holding you want. It at least keeps itself out of the way during battles and doesn't cover up the entire screen.Heads Up Display Screenshot:http://i.imgur.com/BNA1c5L.jpgUser Interface and Heads Up Display:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tACzan0hmm4The gameplay is a bit more than just hacking and slashing your way through enemies. It requires accurate timing and precise aim with your sword while under time constraints. Battles are drastically different from the previous entries to the Metal Gear franchise. Stealth is now harder to pull off and there is more emphasis on the action.You can tell that the boss battles will be over-the-top once you see the first boss. They put you up against a modified Metal Gear Ray in the first few minutes of gameplay. From slicing the armor off to even throwing the Metal Gear, it's clear that Raiden is a lot stronger than he was in previous games. Metal Gear Rising seeks to make you feel like a super-human and I feel like it succeeds in doing so.Metal Gear Ray battle from the Xbox 360 version:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVFyYqfNSVgThe bosses are unique in Metal Gear Rising. Every single boss has its own way to beat it and even their own theme songs. I feel like this is where Metal Gear Rising shines the most; the boss battles. While the regular enemies put up a bit of a fight, they're mainly just fodder for your blade even on the highest difficulty settings.The contrasting difficulty from regular enemies to bosses might seem a bit unbalanced, especially when you go up against the final boss which is probably one of the hardest bosses in any game that I have played. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually lost against a final boss. From health regeneration to a larger pool of health and insanely powerful moves that you can only dodge, Platinum Games knows what they're doing to make a boss feel difficult rather than just tedious like so many final bosses in other games.If it weren't for the amazing music, I probably would have had a harder time against the final boss. That brings me to my next point: the soundtrack. Metal Gear Rising's soundtrack might seem a bit strange for a video game but it definitely suits the gameplay. Each song is different and the lyrics suit the boss that they're made for. The boss battles with their amazing songs are the main reason why I'd consider replaying the game over and over.One of my favorite boss battle themes(Mistral):http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLvgvsI5jAgThe story is one of the only parts of the game that doesn't really shine. You're a cyborg who has to kill terrorists and that's as much as you need to know in order to justify your character cutting people into tiny bits. The story only briefly references the events of Metal Gear Solid 2 and 4 so it's good even if you haven't played any other Metal Gear games. There are only around two hours of cut-scenes this time which is less than other Metal Gear games; to put this into perspective, Metal Gear Solid 2-4 each had five hours of cut-scenes while the original Metal Gear Solid had over three.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is one of the best action titles of 2013 and I'm glad that Platinum Games ported it to the PC. I feel like they did a good job on the PC port besides a few technical issues that they can easily fix in a patch. There were no noticeable bugs when I played through the game and I feel like it was a polished game.The PC port is locked to 60 FPS and the resolution can only go as high as 1920x1080. If you're using HDMI then you may run into the same bug as I did where the game switches to interlaced mode by default in 1920x1080. The solution to fixing this problem is to run the game in windowed mode and then using the Windowed Borderless Gaming tool.Windowed Borderless Gaming tool:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769Overall, I feel like this game is worth buying if you're a fan of action games. The game looks much better than it did on the PS3 and 360 due to the increased resolution, frame-rate, anti-aliasing, and texture filtering. If you haven't played this game before then I recommend buying it on the PC if your specs are good enough. It's easily one of the best action games I've played so far."

It is such a shame to slap such a bizarre portmanteau on such a sick game.Platinum Games was one of the indubitably amazing game developers until they sold out. Metal Gear Rising is from before that moment and you will know exactly that you’re dealing with Platinum Games and not Kojima. Don’t be fooled by the Metal Gear name, this is all action and a tiny bit of sneaking. From the moment you start to the pulse pounding ending you’ll be thrown headlong into adversity and hacking and slashing  your way through hapless mooks with more style than the Milan Fashion Week. This is one solid game.Enter Raiden, former enfant terrible of the Metal Gear series and overnight dark horse since MGS4. Raiden is working for a private security firm and putting is robotic tush on the line to protect an African politician when his ride is attacked by a group of well-equipped mercenaries. After an unfortunate showdown on a train Raiden is sent to the drawing board and with new resolve to uncover who the mercs were and what they want. Turns out they’re kidnapping children and turning them into child-soldier cyborgs. Raiden, a former child soldier, is not amused and vows to kill every single member of the enterprise.Raiden’s M.O. is to go in and hack everything to ribbons in the blink of an eye. As the player, you can run like a ninja and block and parry incoming strikes in order to counter with devastating effects. When you manage to slice an enemy enough to drop their guard you can enter blade mode and slash your opponent into any number of pieces. Go for the limbs or make a perfect vivisection to expose the cyborg’s power cells to rip them out and to replenish your health and energy to keep up the slaughter.It is a fun and fast system and once you get the hang of it you’ll be cleaving enemies in half by the bunch. It doesn’t get boring fast either. You’ll be on the top of your game to dodge, block and make precision slashes at all times. The enemy types and difficulty scales accordingly, so you’ll always be playing on your level.When not slashing, you indulge in some mild exploration and platforming, as well the occasional stealth section. When unseen, you can violently eviscerate any enemy from behind in one attack, but when that fails you can still go for a violent brawl anyway. It makes you wonder why they even included it, but at least your crew is amused when you pull of a ninja kill. Speaking of crew, as a Metal Gear game you’re supported by a few helpful people at the end of a phone line. Conversations with the gang take place during the downtime so the game doesn’t indulge in lengthy cut scenes either.When there are cutscene you bet your hide that there is a boss fight coming. The bosses in this game are nuts, like in any other Platinum Game. The thing is, is that they’re perfectly attuned to the flow of the game. The first boss can be beaten with good slashes and the occasional blade mode, but the second boss demands that you have learned to perform counters at that time. The ante goes up and on until the final boss that is possibly the best final boss to ever grace the PC.Visuals are sharp, but a bit bleak and dreary. The character models also all came rolling out of Platinum Games’ character mould, so they look awfully alike to those from Bayonetta and Vanquish (If you’ve ever had the pleasure of playing those, you elitist pig). The music is in the league of its own. Some extremely wild techno, metal and trance passes the venue and it adds to the experience. Especially during boss battles.Let it be known the Metal Gear Rising is not a Metal Gear game, but definitely a Platinum Game. It is packed with over the top action, well-paced, insanely rewarding to master, great to replay and packed with bonus content. Get it."

The writing is corny and the themes are hamfisted at best. But god damn is this the best character action game I've ever played. And I've played this game at least five or six times. At least. It's in my top three Metal Gear games for a reason. Those reasons being a stupidly satisfying combat system, hours of replayability, and one of the most infectious soundtracks in a video game ever.The game takes place in 2018, which means it's happening next year, or something. Anyways, it takes place four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4, making it the latest game in the timeline chronologically. It follows Raiden, making him the protagonist for the first time since Metal Gear Solid 2. He's grown a lot since then. Took on a couple inches, voice deepened a bit, got replaced with a cyborg body, wields a magic science katana or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Y'know, he's a bit cooler and people like him more this time. The game's story isn't horribly long compared to your average Metal Gear, with the plot taking only about... I'd say six to eight hours. Long story short... It's edgy, but in a self-aware, ironic way, that in some way makes it genius, and very enjoyable.Anyways, Raiden's a cyborg ninja now, and cuts his way (quite literally since one of the game's main mechanics is slicing objects and enemies into framerate-killing segments in slow motion for no reason other than style) through some of the most memorable and likeable bad guys in Metal Gear history. (So memorable that at least three of them have been turned into literal internet memes.) All to the tune of edgy nu-metal that is actually really catchy and will probably make you want to get the soundtrack to unironically listen to in the car.Anyways, the gameplay itself is fun. It's pretty standard light attack/heavy attack hacking and slashing with a few nice combo moves and parry mechanics thrown in there, but the game's got a nice difficulty spike and there's no real way to cheese the game, unlike, say, DmC where you could cheese the game with the scythe. On higher difficulties, the game really tests your mastery of the mechanics, and it's one of the most amazingly frustrating and♥♥♥♥♥clenching games I've played because of it.Very much recommend this game.

But even though it shares the story, the settings and the themes with the saga it essentially throws in the dumpster all the stealth mechanics that marked and represented all the other titles in favour of a more rushing hack'n'slash style. Well, to be honest even the story is secondary as it's quite simple and lets the player focus more on the gameplay and the characters' charisma.4 years after the Patriots incident Raiden finds himself working for Maverick, a Private Military Company, with the task of protecting N.Mani an African country prime minister. Another underground outlaw PMC named Desperado will assault your convoy to kidnap the senator and eventually kill him. You will fight your way to the PMC leader, Jetstream Sam, and as usual you will be defeated, then the real game will start.Until that moment you will have already seen most of the key elements of this game. As I've already mentioned the game is definitely a Hack & slash game with a particular innovation: Raiden's katana. Your main weapon is capable of completely cutting almost everything, starting from your enemies during blade mode, where time slows down and you can slice your opponents in literally hundreds of pieces while your energy drains during this action. You can't roll away from enemies attacking you (an I HATED this) but the only way you can defend yourself from enemies attacks is a parry system which is assisted on easier difficulties and manually tough on harder difficulties. there are miniboss fights and other fights with HUGE enemies, time action events and extreme action situations that look taken straight from anime such as vertical running sections or jumping on rockets being fired at you. Definitely beyond the limit, but tough and awesome at the same time. Some advanced sections will try to give you a cardboard box and a barrel, both to be used as in a common metal gear, the problem is that besides some forced sections you never feel like it's a good idea to use them as there are always too many enemies and there are rarely blind spots to use for a stealth approach. Exactly the same feeling for the couple of rocket launchers or grenades you can find here and there, I've finished the game and I've used them 2 or 3 times...As in any respectable Hack & slash game you can improve your character's health and energy, moves, weapon and cyborg armour, though for the first 2 you need to find the relative upgrades hidden in the level. Also you can find VR missions hidden in the levels, which can represent a valid enterteinment expanding the durability of the game, considering that they're not all simple VR missions but some of them include some original mechanics that add that variety to the missions.Included with the game there are also 2 DLCs unlocked at the end of the main campaign: Jetstream Sam and Wolf prequel Stories which give a little more life to the game, and I advice to play both of them because even if they're short they're still pretty good. There are some tough VR missions hidden there as well (not reachable through the main VR menu).The game is developed with the Platinum Engine (not Fox Engine), and even though it doesn't make any particular miracle it does its job.The soundtrack is really tough and badass as it follows and incites the player in the toughest and most intense fight sections especially Boss Fights.+++PROs+++GAMEPLAY.Even though a Metal Gear fan could see the total change of gameplay as a trauma, it really is great and fun, a very tough challenge, especially the final Boss and considering how Raiden has been portrayed in MGS4 I personally consider this change of direction and gameplay perfectly understandable.SOUNDTRACK.Since this chater is a frantic Hack & Slash a badass soundtrack is a MUST. So, what can I say... Check![/]CHARACTERS.I noticed a nice and deep portray of some characters, say Raiden, Jetstream Sam, Wolf and The ""final boss"", just to mention some, without spoilers.EXTREME.Considering the legacy and the previous chapters, what is to be seen in this title is extreme: vertical runs and jumping on missiles are the two smallest and least spoilerous examples I can come up with... Yet I Really appreciated all of this, the frenzy of the normal gameplay mixed with these extreme time action events and tough boss fights, and all shown with a great direction worth of Kojima's blessing.---CONs---FIGHT STYLE.For a frenzy Hack & Slash game like this being deprived of the ability of dodging attacks in favour of a tough parry system can be a tough challenge but I honestly believe it simply kills the action as you have to wait a long cooldown tie before you can attack and most of times you are forced to parry a sequence of attacks, not just an attack. Not to mention the fact that some attacks can't be parried and you don't have the ability to dodge...FAILED STEALTH MECHANICS.This game is part of Metal Gear Legacy, yet the developers chose to take the H&S direction, which is fine, considering the character and all the rest. Then Why in the hell try to put just a fistful of forced stealth sections if the only way you can run them is just with boxes or drum cans. You can't crouch, nor crawl, nor get against walls or other props to stay hidden, you can't make noise to distract enemies unless you sprint close to them. No, Stealth as made in this title is quite pointless.CAMERA.I didn't find myself too comfortable with the camera and control settings. strafing left or right results in turning the camera as well. The camera is slightly left sided, can't be changed and in few times I find it being too close to Raiden. When you want to take a good look at the situation from an observation point or when hiding in the carboard/barrel if you move the camera and leave it still for a second and a half it will instantly turn back... So you essentially can't observe anything taking your time and all... And last and least important the camera look seems quite ""uninterpolated""... as if you want to turn left or right a very little bit the camera skips to the next angle instead of sliding smoothly from A to B... I don't know how to explain but it is more evident when you move slightly or even more while you're on codec.I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64"

,Recommended,235460,22963786,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,nͫiͤcͫeͤ,"I probably played about 50 hours of Revengeance on the 360 before getting it on PC. I've got some experience with the game.This is one of my favourite games, and I'm tempted to recommend it to any carbon-based lifeform with a pulse... but ultimately it isn't for everyone. Revengeance is rightly a niche game, a strange spin-off from a mainstream franchise that abandons the Metal Gear Solid gameplay formula and only includes token nods to the stealth focus of its progenitor. In spite of the player character being a ""cyborg ninja"", the gameplay mechanics for stealth are as minimal as can be, while the mechanics for high-speed stylish melee combat are far more developed than anything western action games might have prepared you for.I don't want to go into the details of Revengeance's story, but I do want to commend how effectively it carries the game, without spoiling any details. Throughout the story, our player character Raiden has clear motives and goals. He also goes through an interesting character development arc, an arc that stays true to his personality in both previous MGS incarnations while also pushing him forward as a person. By the end of the game Raiden has gone through both physical and philosophical transformations. At the infamously bombastic finale of the game, Raiden and the final boss clash over distinct ideological differences. This final boss advocates loudly for a twisted worldview where the strong dominate the weak, and then demands that we, as Raiden, use our strength to prove him right by defeating him. It's a unique synthesis of player involvement and philosophy that I don't think Revengeance gets enough credit for. It's a traditional aspect of Metal Gear Solid games to have the game's villains be complex in their goals and motives, and Revengeance nails it.The fighting in Revengeance is maybe 80% of the total gameplay, with another 10% being stealth and the rest being less-than-compelling 3D platforming. Thankfully it's in this 80% that the developers succeed 100%. It'd be hard to define ""the Platinum feel"", but every Platinum game (and every Clover game for that matter) has a level of combat mechanic excellence that you rarely find elsewhere. I think there's two major aspects that make this particular system so good, the first being that the player maintains total control over Raiden. Every player move can be ""cancelled"" out of, meaning the player never finds themselves stuck in an animation, and every enemy attack can be either dodged or parried with enough precision and skill. This is a game that politely asks you to ""git gud"" and gives you the tools you need to do it. Every hit you take is entirely your fault, every blow you land is entirely to your credit. When you learn to use the fundamental mechanics correctly you start dodging through previously devastating attacks and swiftly dominating previously intimidating enemies, and the feeling of satisfaction and pride is second to none.The other aspect that makes the Revengeance combat system so fresh is the Zandatsu. When Raiden has harmed an enemy enough to shatter their armour, he can pop them up in the air and hack them to pieces. You can swing wildly and hack the cyborg enemy up into a hundred meaty slices, or you can cut carefully and pull out their cyborg heart to absorb their juices. This move is the Zandatsu and it refills your life and energy meters. When the game gives you this ability and then pits you against tough enemies, it incentivises you to chase down weaker enemies and consume them, giving you the boost you'll need to face the rest of the enemy mob. Not only does this mechanic look and feel great, it once again ties back into the philosophical thread of strength and weakness that runs throughout the game.Sadly the execution of this system does have some flaws. The camera positioning isn't always on your side, particularly when fighting in hallways, and larger enemies (particularly Gekkos and Raptors) can leap into the camera and drop down onto you in ways which are disorienting. Some enemies have conventional firearms that they constantly drill you with, and the only way to avoid taking damage from them is to keep constantly running. When you're trying to beat a fight without taking damage (and therefore get the No Damage bonus to your fight ranking), one random Dwarf Gekko with a machine gun can really ruin your mood.The game provides you with access to 3 unique boss weapons that you can purchase after beating their respective bosses, but these weapons can't be toggled mid-fight. They have to be accessed by opening a menu on the D-Pad, which inevitably costs you some momentum in a battle. I don't love the boss weapons, none of them feel as good as Raiden's sword and they seem more like novelties than necessities. I'm sure there's high skill players who can wield them in amazing ways, but as an average player I couldn't find their utility.Revengeance can be finished in about 5-6 hours by a casual player on normal difficulty. I'm sure some players get their fill and stop there, but if you love your first experience MGR has a huge amount of replayability. VR challenge missions, DLC side campaigns (Jetstream Sam's DLC is phenomenal), collectibles that you literally have to chop off your enemies, a vast wealth of codec dialogue with interesting characters, and of-course the constant challenge of S-Ranking every fight in the game.The only thing left that I want to specifically praise is the music. Each major boss fight is accompanied by a unique boss song, with lyrics relating to that boss' internal struggles. The songs are some weird hybrid of electronic kick drums, downtuned nu-metal guitar riffs and distorted rock vocals, which isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. The songs are played as instrumental until the final stage of the boss battle, at which point the lyrics kick in. It's precisely as cheesy as it sounds, and I can't help but punch the air and sing along every time it happens. When you're mashing your gamepad in frantic excitement while battling an enemy you've come to love, and you're hearing a song decrying their loss of identity and lack of any choice other than to fight to the death, the synthesis of gameplay and mood elevates MGR to an intoxicating apex. It's so addictive you'll want to lose certain boss fights just so you don't have to stop experiencing it.At the current asking price (£20 as of writing), I wouldn't recommend Revengeance to literally anyone. I would recommend it at that price to people who want a challenge, who are open to Japanese design eccentricity, and who need a change from the stagnation of melee combat mechanics in western game development, where everyone appears to be mimicking either Assassins Creed or the Arkham series.Were it on sale at half that price, I'd recommend Revengeance to literally anyone. At the very least you can get £10 worth of enjoyment by playing through on Easy and absorbing the atmosphere and storytelling."

The tone is a perfect match for the game, and within that tone the story still manages to take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of American Exceptionalism and various other absurdities and platitudes.  This is a less philosophical game than general entries in the Metal Gear Solid series, and takes the philosophy of the series less seriously, joking with it in many cases.  This is appropriate, as Metal Gear Solid generally overreaches when it tries to do real philosophy anyway.  In place of this, we get to explore the motivations and character of Raiden in a game that greatly expands his personal story arc.As for the gameplay, I found it very good.  Much is based on memorization though.  The camera can sabotage you at times, which is obnoxious.  Also, play it with a 360 controller.  Seriously, find a USB 360 controller online and get one, playing this with keyboard and mouse is a dumb idea.  Replayability appeal is limited to the appeal of the hack and slash gameplay and to any perfectionist tendencies a player might have, either towards this gameplay or toward the achievements in the game.  I expect to put about 40-50 hours into it and probably never touch it after that."

If you're into the story you'll be in the Codec calls 90% of the game. Listening to discussions on many different topics from mission briefing, intel, enemies to cooking, personal opinions and history, etc. Personally I really like all the character interactions, though it's only a call and not required for playthrough.Combat is very rewarding, flashy, with a lot of large mech type opponents and bosses, apart from your standard human cyborgs and robots. Different ways to kill with sword type weapons in some combination of martial arts. Wont spoil the combat, the only thing I'll say is: you'll be making salad from the enemy, literally.Character customization is present, in form of different body suits you can buy, combat moves, weapons and health/power upgrades. Visually game looks great, with good quality textures, animations and voice acting.Levels are a bit empty in my opinion and too often fenced off, but it's well demonstrated in game that it's locked with reason, because you're constantly on missions and you can't fool around aka go wondering somewhere aimlessly. So props on that.If you listen through the Codec calls and explore levels, you'll be entertained for a long time, because they sure talk a lot.

It's a lot closer to the source material than I was expecting it to be; I was dreading a Metroid Other M style disaster, where a 3rd party's take on a beloved franchise falls horribly flat. Thankfully not the case here!It's kind of a pleasant hybrid between MGS and Bayonetta. The storytelling is Metal Gear style, which is to say a LOT of cutscenes, an openly (and playfully) bonkers plot about the nature of war, memetics, what makes us human, etc, and tons of codec conversations. While there is technically stealth, it's not the focus of the game and things seem to push you towards just going balls out in the combat.I won't ruin the story, as it's interesting enough to merit paying attention to the first time through, especially if you're a Metal Gear fan. It slots neatly in after MGS4, and while it's not anywhere near as far reaching, it works as a decent side story focused on Raiden. You don't really need to have played any of the previous games to follow along, although you'll miss some references.The ending fight, for what it's worth, is one of the most gleefully batshit insane things you are ever likely to witness. It's a combination of a lengthy stoner discourse on the sustainability of the military industrial complex and a wrestling/shouting match between the Hulk and an amalgamation of every 80s Ninja Trope ever. With mechs. And slapstick comedy. I didn't think anyone would top Metal Gear Solid 2's fighting-the-president-with-ninja-swords-on-top-of-a-doomsday-weapon-in-New-York thing, but Rising sure gives it the old college try. The only major difference is that Rising is openly aware of how nuts the proceedings are; while it never breaks character, it's clearly not trying to take itself overly seriously all the same.If you've seen the original RoboCop, kind of the same idea. The insanity is delivered with a straight face throughout, and that's what makes it work. In some ways, it even works better than the ""main"" Metal Gear series.The PC port runs fine, I didn't have any issues at all. Not a whole ton of options for graphics but still better than usual for a console port. It comes with all the DLC baked in, so that's nice. You're going to want a gamepad, though.The game itself isn't without some issues. Camera's finicky as all hell and can (and will, often) unhelpfully point your field of view directly into the nearest wall right as five tons of angry cyborg starts punching Raiden in the back of the head. There's also an abundance of quicktime events, some of which are instantly fatal if you fail then, which isn't horrible in and of itself but the game gets very confused if you're holding any buttons when the prompt appears. More than once I was in the middle of combat only to suddenly get tossed into a QTE, have it accept an incorrect button input because I was in the middle of hitting Jump or whatever, and result in an instant death. The best bet is to lay off the controller entirely when the QTEs surface, and just go into things aware that you're probably going to get an unfair death at least a couple times until you know what's coming next. The game has forgiving checkpoints however, so the occasional cheap death really doesn't detract from the proceedings all that terribly much, it's just mildly annoying.This is also a game clearly designed for repeat playthroughs. I beat the campaign on normal in two sittings in one day; don't take this as a negative, though. There's a ton of unlockables, the harder difficulties ramp up CONSIDERABLY if you're looking for a challenge, and there's a ton of VR missions and other things to play around with once you've given the game a run through. If you're willing to spend some time on it, this game could actually last for quite a while and takes a good amount of dedication to really master.I streamed my entire playthrough in two chunks.

I had never played a Metal Gear tittle before but this is obviuosly a spinoff with little stealth. The main campaign can be completed in under 10 hours (you actually get an achievement if you are a slow poke like me who takes more time) but most of the challenges lie in the additionnal VR missions (With an emphasis on level design  - a lot of platforming and one hit killers like flying robotic mines - that reduce any error margin). This VR missions can be completed as fast as possible to get more cash and unlock other abilities and armors in the main campaign. Although it's enjoyable and very graphic (you can chop bodies and robots in the air with your blades) I enjoyed the mini campaign with wolf even more. I felt this cyber dog and the geckos could have had a bigger role in the main gameplay (scouting out and going through places unreachable to the main character) and the amount of content pales in comparison to other fighting/adventure titles like 'Batman Arkham City' or any 'Assassin's Creed'. The storyline is cool but then again it's too short to really make an impact, everything happens too fast and the last levels are a series of epic and imaginative boss battles.

,Recommended,235460,29436835,Posted: 22 January,all,DF,"I received Metal Gear Rising as a gift in a Secret Santa games swap, and it took me around nine hours to get to the end of Raiden's scenario, with a total of about 13 hours to also clear the DLC stories.  I played entirely with an Xbox 360 controller and set my difficulty to Normal for the entire game.I don't really have much experience with Metal Gear.  Just the first two Solids, the first two Acids, and that's it.  I know enough about the series that I can say this is a Metal Gear game just the same that it isn't.  There's a lot of exposition and philosophizing and utterly weird bosses, but instead of non-lethal incapacitation mixed with hiding or sneaking past enemies, you are an engine of bladed death.  There are some stealth sections, but there's nothing wrong with just hacking people to tiny bloody chunks--and the game's designed to render all of these little pieces too.  It might have more in common with Devil May Cry than its home series, but I don't think that's a bad thing.The game is focused almost entirely on swordplay with a few different weapons like a polearm-whip or consumable weapons like rocket launchers and grenades.  You are given BPs for performing well and you can use these to unlock additional moves as well as alternate outfits and health/power upgrades.  Enemies mostly stick to melee attacks themselves, though you'll be fending off gunfire if you leave them alone at a range.  Parrying is an integral part of the gameplay, watching enemies for when they're going to attack and deflecting it accordingly, negating damage.  Raiden might have a fancy new body but he can't just tank hits.  Blade Mode allows you to slow time and let you hack wildly at an enemy, and it was kinda neat to have fine control over your slashing using the right stick.Blade Mode is also required for one of the game's other notable features, Zandatsu or 'cut and take'.  Weaken an enemy enough and when in Blade Mode, you'll be given a target--cut it free and press the prompted button and Raiden will reach in and grab it, crushing it in his hand to restore health and fuel which powers Blade Mode.  It's a nice way to heal mid-battle when things go poorly and it powering Blade Mode means you can potentially chain these together to walk off the battlefield unharmed and ready to repeat the process.  It's a great way to preserve the consumable medkits for the boss fights where you won't have this ability to rely on.The controls were pretty tight.  I thought the feature of controlling the angle of cutting with right stick was a bit neat but unnecessary, but you are given BP bonuses for cleanly severing body parts off of enemies and you can actually nonlethally incapacitate enemies by removing their limbs if you want (it's okay, they're cyborgs, they'll understand).  There is a very small number of parts in the game where the directed angle is necessary, though.  The camera for the most part cooperated with me, but it went nuts a couple of times due to trying to keep an enemy in sight and dealing with a nearby wall.  There was only one platforming section and not only was that in a wide-open area, it was part of a DLC mission.  For the most part, you really ought to be fine with the camera and the controls.  There are some QTEs--the basic ""push the face button!"" one, one prompt to use Ninja Run to climb on a barrage of missles, and another to tell you to use Blade Mode to trigger an assault on part of a large enemy or just to destroy your target.Something needs be said about the music.  It's pretty heavy on the metal side, but the game puts a nice spin on the variable mix idea during the boss battles.  It's instrumental during the first parts, but then the lyrics kick in when you've done quite a bit of damage, and the lyrics are even relevant to the boss or the circumstances of the fight!  Like, ""Rules of Nature"" for Metal Gear RAY could be from the point of view from the weapon itself--a once top-of-the-line piece of hardware facing its last days of relevancy, the hunter becoming the hunted, and 'survival of the fittest' still doesn't guarantee if the strong or the weak will survive in the end.  There have been games with relevant lyrics before, but it's kinda neat to hear the enemy get their own 'theme music power up' in a way when you're starting to do well against them.I ran the game on Low graphics because I have an aging rig, but I was honestly surprised that I got 60FPS almost constantly, with 30FPS cutscenes and the game really only lagging when I had hacked enemies to hundreds of bits--and there's even a setting to control how many chunks get rendered!  The game still looked great even at supposedly low quality, not that I put it up to High to compare.  My resolution (1360x768 on 32"") wasn't high enough to have the textbox information during the codec calls be readable, though.The only thing I didn't really like about the game was the length, or I guess the pacing.  It was a pretty short game (in-game stats listed getting to the end of Raiden's story at under five hours, not accounting for redos), and there are only eight chapters total, with two more as DLC.  It was kinda jarring that one boss fight was the entirety of one chapter, and that doesn't even count the long slog of a final boss fight taking up the majority of the final one.  I kinda struggled with the final boss too, given I burned all of my medkit revives beforehand so I absolutely had to learn how to read their attacks or die very quickly.  I don't think I really got a good grasp on the fighting system, though I was pretty good at parrying.  I didn't really look at the combo list so that might've been to my detriment in the end.Overall, Metal Gear Rising is a ridiculous game that I guess fits right in with the equally-ridiculous Metal Gear series.  Bisecting 30-foot tall giant mechs is totally normal.  It's very actiony and I didn't play MGS4 but at least there isn't a save point during a long stretch of cutscenes here.  There's some replay value in trying to get all of the collectible left arms or getting better ranks or getting achievements.  Already familiar with Devil May Cry?  This is kinda like that, but it's not as though it's DMC with a Metal Gear skin.  It's definitely worth a try if you're into high-action games that might require a little twitch reaction for parrying and the QTEs.  It's a hell of a ride and fun throughout."

,Recommended,235460,8638390,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,Chop Spooky!,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the annoucement that Konami and Platinum Games were bringing this title to the PC. Now, truth be told, I was a little bit nervous when I saw it being ported to PC simply because Platinum Games haven't had much of a track record when it came to PC games/ports, but I decided to push my luck and pre-purchase this game again. I say again because I already owned it on the Xbox 360.Turns out my luck paid off, as did the luck of countless others that purchased this title. Amazingly, Konami and Platinum Games seem to have done a wonderful job of porting the game onto PC, minus a few issues that a few users are getting, but to be fair, most games have some form of issues on a day one release.Graphics wise, turning all the available settings down to their lowest makes the game look quite similar to its console counterpart. I have not tested what the game looks and runs like at the highest possible settings, simply because I'm not sure if my machine could handle it, but I'm willing to bet the game looks rather good with everything cranked up to max. Most of the options you would find in an average PC game nowadays are included, although resolutions only go up to 1920 by 1080, so if you are one of the few rich people that have a 4K resolution monitor, you'll be sad to hear this game won't support it.Gameplay wise, this game is a solid opposite of your standard Metal Gear Solid game, with a healthy focus on action as you hack and slash your way through numerous enemies, although a light stealth element is prevailent throughout the game. Most of your surroundings can be manipulated by your blade in some shape or form, with trees and cars often splitting into multiple parts. The same can be held true to your enemies as well, with the ability to slice them into hundreds if not thousands of pieces before ripping out their spines. You actually get rewarded for doing this as well by getting all your energy back, which you will need as the game goes on.The dramatic set-pieces in the game stand out as some of the most jaw dropping moments you'll see and expreience, ranging from parrying the sword arm of a giant robot before launching it into the air and bisecting it straight down the middle set to one of the most hype pieces of music you'll ever hear, to fighting a man made out of magnets in a collosal rainstorm. No, I'm not making that up either.Speaking of music, the music, THE MUSIC. SWEET JESUS, THE MUSIC. The musical pieces in this game are some of the best that have ever been produced by both companies, rivalling that of the pieces from both MGS3 and MGS4. Every boss has their own track that gets more and more intense as the fight goes on, cullminating in some of the most BRUTAL lyrics as the fight draws to a close. That doesn't mean that all the best music is limited to boss fights though; standard encounters with the enemy mooks are equally satisfying in terms of music.Both of the DLCs that focus on different characters are equally impressive, providing players an insight into what happens before the main events of the game. In addition, you also get all the DLC from various pre-orders and consoles for free! BARGIN!Overall, there isn't much more I can really say about this game without actually spoiling it. If you like exceptionally hype, over-the-top action sequences set to epic music, compelte with a somwhat impressive storyline to boot, then you should definately consider buying this game. Let's hope for a sequel, eh?"

MONEY WELL SPENT!! I think it has a lot of things you could want in a game of this genre, especially being able to slash enemies and world items into tiny bits and pieces. Like god, did any other game let you slash up a whole ferris wheel to bits? There's also a minor stealth system and a parry/dodge system, and those are really nice aditions to the game. You can also gain additional outfits, weapons, sub-weapons and skills in your customization menu as you go!Anyway, I think the port was fantastic. And I'm a keyboard+mouse user, so people saying you can't play this game with kb+m at all are dead wrong. I had no issues with anything, and if I needed to swap keys positions, I could do that no problem. All in all I'll just say the gameplay was all amazing to me and I have no complaints. All the things it lets you do in the game are seriously mad fun.Now let me throw a word in about the visuals. MGR is one of those games that looks beautiful even on low quality! So you don't really have to worry about it looking ugly if you're in need for FPS.What else.. oh OH, the music. Good GOD the music is amazing. It's just right for a game like this, so of course I just had to get the OSTs after I beat the game.Story and characters? It is sad that the story is quite short, but it's pretty nice and touching, and there's also plenty of humor in this. The characters are so great, too. I don't think it's possible to actually dislike anyone in this game, they seem so well developed. And before I played the game, I thought Raiden was going to be some boring killing machine, but I was wrong, so wrong. He's amazing.Let's not forget about the DLCs. You get to play as Jetstream Sam and Bladewolf, which offers even more fun to the game, since both of those characters have different skills. There's also VR missions.Now then, list of things that might bother other people + bugs that I know of:-It's a linear game. I don't have issues with those type of games but yeah.-Low fps will hinder you with completing a crucial part of the fight during the last boss battle. So make sure you have around 60.OH WHAT DO YOU KNOW. That's all. Now go buy this game."

But, I'm not personally one to back down from a challenge and enjoy a bit of Nintendo Hard in my videogame diet now and then; but I can empathise why some complain or even quit on a couple of fights.The upgrade system and unlocks, higher difficulty modes, and focus on mastery give the game good replay value IMO, trying new combinations of weapons and skills, mastering abilities.But more importantly the game is a real blast to play, with gorgeous visuals, art direction and involved action.Highly recommended."

It wa a Steam Api related but and Platinum Games\Konami moved to apply a fix for it in less than 24h.So good work on that one!UPDATE 2: I've played the game for a bit longer and it's been an amazing experience so far. The gameplay is fast paced and flashy but it's not a brainless button masher, you actually require some finesse to pull parries and combos at the right time.Blade mode is extremely satisfying, allowing you to slice the enemies into pieces in all directions.Every battle has this epic feel to it, and the soundtrack is just the cherry on top of the cake as the battle themes slowly progress to their climax as the battle reaches it's conclusion.Early Review:I haven't played for very long but so far the game seems interesting.The art-style is great but the graphics do seem a bit dated for a 2013 game, I'm playing it at 1920x1080 and you do notice the low-res textures on both characters and scenario. No doubt because it's a console port, and even with these imperfections the game does look pretty and honestly with everything in motion and so much action you barely even notice it.Gameplay-wise the game is very very good. As I've stated I haven't gone very deep into the game but it actually plays rather well on a mouse\keyboard, even blade mode works with the mouse which came as a good surprise since it's a port and usually developers don't bother optimizing this kind of thing.I'll still probably play it with a gamepad in the end, but it's good to know that they went all in to support mouse and keyboard too.In terms of performance the minimum requirements on the page may be a bit over-cautious, considering it lists an i5 as being required and I'm running the game pretty much maxed @50~60fps on a Core 2 Duo machine I built back in 2007...So I don't think performance will be a problem for anyone. The game runs surprisingly well!I don't really know the console version of this game so I don't know if it has Japanese VO with English subtitles but I was rather disappointed to find out that I'm stuck with English VO on the PC version.The soundtrack with plenty of melodic death metal tracks, totally makes up for it!

Well, I'd agree with you, but MGR's Raiden is much more of a badass. Being able to suplex a Metal Gear will do that to you. Raiden got the Gray Fox treatment this time around - he's the new Cyborg Ninja!You're capable of performing various slashing, cutting, flesh-rending attacks and combos that are immensely satisfying to  do - along with a special feature called Blade Mode. This allows you to effectively target where you swing and put you into a ""bullet time"" state until you run out of Fuel Electrolytes (a resource effectively equal to a charge bar).Now, that sounds pretty average. If you wanted combos, you'd just play Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter games, right?And then come the boss battles.While many of the story characters are not particularly memorable, the boss battles are all distinct and unique - each possessing a particular fighting style and attitude. Along with their own amazing music tracks. (Did I mention I like the music?) Besides, who doesn't want to fight a U.S. Senator who jacked himself up with the Metal Gear equivalent of super-steroids?There is DEFINITELY a learning curve. Once you get past the tutorial chapter, you better learn to parry quickly, or you'll be torn up into bite-sized bits of Gekko food. The bosses also seem to be out of order in terms of difficulty (I had a much harder time with Blade Wolf than Monsoon, for instance). I'd recommend playing on Very Hard (or Revengeance difficulty if you're a glutton for punishment and millisecond-interval timing).My only gripes with the game are the awful keyboard controls (it's a console port, so that's to be expected) and the various but small glitches throughout the game. If you run into, say, Sundowner infinitely running into a wall, or being thrown into an invisible clock tower, just restart the game and it'll never happen again.You receive the two story DLCs when you buy the Steam version of the game (Jetstream Sam and Blade Wolf's stories), as well as various cyborg suits that can provide an advantage should you acquire them. Free DLC included in the base game for the same price as the original console version? I'll take that.Overall, I had a lot of fun playing MGR. But once you've defeated the very last boss on Revengeance difficulty, there's not much else to do aside from collecting left hands.Also, please use a controller. Don't mangle your hands playing with a keyboard like I did."

I know Raiden isn't your favorite character, but if this isn't the most interestingly flamboyant hack and slash stealth game you've ever played, then consider toning down the non-Snake eater-heat (get it?).A general overview of this game shows it's a typical hack and slash, with generic characters and overplayed plot archetypes. However, looking a little bit deeper into the rabbit hole reveals what is in my opinion a masterpiece of a game that got an entire series named for it, even though they're never gonna make a sequel (really Konami or Kojima what ever the ♥♥♥♥, Metal Gear RISING? We know you aren't ever gonna make a new one. It would be fine, but then you went on and made a SUBTITLE for it too, really?). Sure you have a sleezy government paranoia plot and middle eastern warmongers, but the characters are all interesting, and have these shades of personality added to them to make them stand out. The plot is a pretty basic mixture of revenge(ance) and save-the-world, but it's the little cutscenes and witty dialogue that makes me forget about all that and become immersed.Moving on to gameplay, unlike most games ever in existence, this one is kind of innovative with its mechanics. Now I'm sure there have been hack and slash games before this one where you control your swords movements, but this AAA title was actually popular enough to be recognized (sorry indie games). It also feels like an arcade game with two buttons to control light or heavy attacks, which isn't necessarily an arcade thing, but whatever. And you can't help but feel badass as Jack the Ripper, and break out laughing when under a box or rolling around in a metal can.Anywho, this is an interesting piece of work that I think those who don't mind gore should give a try out, they might just be surprised."

,Recommended,235460,8668526,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,SG,"hmmAll signs are pointing to this being a fanservice game.It's probably the best game that PlatinumGames has developed, maybe tied with Bayonetta.The general tone and pacing of Metal Gear Rising is much different than other Metal Gear games, but the method of revealing lore through codec calls was retained. This was inappropriate for the pacing of Metal Gear Rising, and the resulting incongruence was disappointingly jarring. Only a small portion of the lore revealed through codec calls was of the caliber of previous Metal Gear games, which was also disappointing. The story was rickety, and the ending was especially weak.The long dialogue between Senator Armstrong and Raiden was lacking in conviction or basis in the real world, so it was difficult to relate to. Gave me the feeling of ""Hmm, this is kind of BS."" This is another big disappointment, because the topic of the overgrown military industrial complex in the United States is very interesting and relevant, but its presentation in this game fell flat because the moral grayness of the industry and its participants was not explored much at all(as would be expected of a game in the Metal Gear franchise). Instead, the industry's portrayal was borderline sophomoric, shoehorned into a morally black and white nutshell that was not interesting or notable at all(not even fit for a shonen manga).The game also makes a few statements about media manipulation and memes. Again, because these subject matters were not explored as much as they would have been in a real Metal Gear game, the fact that they're even there doesn't feel natural.Because of the faster pace of the game, the time between boss battles was much shorter. Exposition of the villains and antagonistic organizations of the game was truncated, so I was left feeling like there wasn't enough character development(character development has consistently been adequate in Metal Gear games, even for characters that die off early).Jetstream Sam is a real cool looking character that I expected to have more screen time in Metal Gear Rising, only to see him killed off in a way that could have been a lot more meaningful. Included DLC allows you to play as Sam through his story, but it feels inappropriate for this extra backstory to have been DLC; it feels to me like a concession made due to Sam's lack of development in the main story. Sam's dialogue was especially disappointing, because he seemed to be a strongly principled character that Raiden couldn't understand(only a few of the characters in this game have strong, well-defined maxims). Raiden and Sam never actually got to communicate about any of their motivations, which could have catalyzed a change in one or both of them, which would have been meaningful. Sam's similarities to Raiden were not emphasized enough for the two to have had any chemistry as rivals, and the end result reeked of wasted potential.Raiden was never a strongly principled character in any of the games he was in, which is intentional. In MGS2, his naive preconceived notions were turned on their head(at the same time as the player's), resulting in an interesting change in his character that was intended to resonate with the player. This risky move worked to great effect, and has been unmatched in video games since. Sadly, the new Raiden in Metal Gear Rising is impossible to relate to in this way, because Raiden has no well-defined moral opposition to any of the antagonist's motivations(and he doesn't make an effort to formulate any). In the same vein, his characteristic self-doubt only led to the rediscovery of his violent urges as ""Jack the Ripper"", which did not provide him with any new focus or direction as a character. Raiden is a character that was originally designed to be dynamic, and if a character is measured by how much they have changed, then Raiden's portrayal in Metal Gear Rising was an utter failure.Most of the characters in Metal Gear Rising are not characters I see myself remembering for a long time to come. Few of the characters had consistently clear, believable, or relatable motivations(especially not Raiden). Overly brief, insubstantial, or inconsistent dialogue between the characters muddled the already scant amount of character development this game had time for.The game's overall message has also been stunted by political correctness. This has had the dual effect of making much of the dialogue a waste of time and preventing the game from standing out.Short version: It was nice to see Raiden again, and the gameplay itself was not half bad. However, Metal Gear games have a reputation for their gameplay and exposition working perfectly in tandem. Previous games in the franchise have been unmatched at using postmodern expression in a meaningful way, which is a saddening contrast to this game's confused and insignificant message. As a Metal Gear fan, this game was disappointing for these reasons.I give it 3.5/5 units of rating. It's a shell of the game that it could have been. It's still a good game(based on gameplay alone), it's just not very interesting, and definitely not groundbreaking."

Revengeance was a title, that I hoped to get for PC and Platinum Games delivered.It's their first PC port and to be honest, a very good one.Solid 60 frames, no screen-tearing and good graphics.They could've add more resolutions for bigger monitors, but they learn from their mistakes, right?The game detected my controller with no problem and I was able to play this game without any problem with the controller(can't say for Keyboard + Mouse).The story of this game isn't that deep like in MGS... BUT!... it's MGR , a spin-off of the MGS series with it's own little story.The characters in this game aren't that important and you can forget them pretty fast... except Raiden and Jetstream Sam (and the funny faces of Sam and Sundowner).You don't learn anything about how Raiden turned into a Cyborg-Ninja (between MGS 2 - MGS 4).But rather the game take place after MGS 4 where Raiden is already a real Cyborg-Ninja.Same goes for Jetstream Sam. You just learn a little from his background-story. But he is the only character ,next to Raiden, who was really sympatic to me. He was cool and enjoyed fighting. He was like a real Samurai and Raiden's rival.The character-development or in general the characters in this game had potential... but because of the lack of background-story and the reason why they fight, Platinum Games missed their chance to make many of the characters recognizable.I don't want to say anything about the story because I think, it's better to find it out by yourself.I really liked the gameplay in this game.There is a big mix between light and heavy hits and therefore many combos.The blocking/parrying is hard at first because the tutorial is explaining it wrong.But when you get the hang of it, it's one of your lifesaver in this game. Same goes for the dodging abilty.The Blade mode is pretty unique and awesome. Cutting your enemy in the way you want.And with the Blade mode you can use Zandatsu (Cut and Take), in which Raiden cut the power core out of the enemy and using it for himself, which is pretty useful and it looks pretty awesome.The only problem with the gameplay is the camera, which can be very bad sometimes.Now comes one of my highlights in this game: The Bossfights.Platinum Games used their knowedge from Bayonetta and Vanquish for the design and dynamic music during bossfights.None of the bossfights were boring nor annoying. They were unique in music and style.The music is changing whenever you attack a different spot, a different location , an event happens or when you are in blade mode. The music is instrumental at that time until you reach the climax of the battle. Then the vocal version of the song begin to play and you know that something awesome will happen soon.MGR is truly a very good Hack n Slash game, but because of the camera the flow of gameplay can be disturbed and the bad character recognition makes most of the characters ""useless"".I would give it a 8/10.The sequel of MGR has a lot of potential and when Platinum Games will listen to the critics, MGR 2 could be an awesome successor."

The grading system acts as an incentive to get better because who doesn't like getting top grades, right? Fights gradually ramp up in difficulty and complexity but they never feel unfair because you unlock upgrades, skills and weapons that give you your edge back. This also gives it great replayability as you work your way through the difficulty levels earning enough BP to buy all those new weapons and stuff.The soundtrack for this game is outstanding and adds to the atmosphere and pace of the game as well as making you feel really pumped for the fights.

,Recommended,235460,9674150,"Posted: 30 March, 2014",all,MSaint,"My first Metal Gear game was Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation and I played it back in 1999. I enjoyed it a lot, then was MGS2 which I played on my PC; despite many flaws I enjoyed MGS2 as well, but mostly for plot twists at the end (calling them ""over the top"" would be a huge understatement). I also played MGS3 (on my PS2), where absurdity was toned down a bit compared to MGS2 and I still liked it for some boss fights and nice setting.When playing MGS2 and MGS3 you will inevitably encounter comic/absurd/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments (not so much in MGS1), both in action and writing portions, which - in my opinion - can be extremely cringe-worthy as most of the game is presented as serious story. And then Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance comes, where over-the-top, comic and/or absurd actions and dialogues are its bread and butter. And I love this game for that.I longed for a MGS game which doesn't play serious, where proportions of comedy/absurd and ""serious business"" are reversed and boy, MGR delivers. Fight system involves parrying lightning-fast attacks, counters and sometimes simple QTE's. Boss fights are oftenly finished with some extremely satisfying overkills and cutscenes many times are simply for comedic value, like Raiden's disguise or ""otaku guard"". But there are also some serious bits, with my favourite being final boss speech and realization that, to some extent, he is right.I highly recommend this game to both action games fans and non-orthodox MGS fans, as this may be the PC game you were waiting for."

,Recommended,235460,12620525,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,Mordio,"Simply one of the greatest games iève every played really, the combat system is fun to use, the harder difficulties truly test your skills and knowledge of the parry system, and talking about the parry system, it could be better. You'll find yourself dodging and guarding more then parrying, atleast thats how i ended up. the parry and guard button are the same, so you might end up doing one thing you didn't mean to do, which can screw up a good chance to get a hit in. But this doesn't really effect much honestly. The story is ok, it makes the cutscenes worth watching, it is a metal gear game after all. The graphics are amazing, especially in the cutscenes, and the boss fights and themes are epic. The enemies are diverse and each have a different way of being defeated, which could require some sub-weapons that you wouldn't expect to use, like a grenade or a rocket launcher. So the game really pushes you to try out its features, and while on the topic of features, there is a feature called blade mode, which is easily the most satisfying thing ever. you get a chance to chop your enemy into pieces, and rip out their spines, then crush it. And you do this to fully regain health, and fuel charge, which is what powers blade mode. There are also customization options, you can customize your main characters weapon, sub-weapon, hair, outfit, and also upgrade his life and fuel cell gauges. The achievements are fun to obtain and have some good challenges in order to get them, and have great rewards that can help through harder playthroughs of the game. The characters are likable, and all have a deeper meaning behind them, especially the character you play as. As for DLC, this game gives two DLC stories for free, you just have to enter the konami code in the title screen. (Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a) the code only works with a controller. This gives you access to the two DLc stories, where you play as two bosses that re-appear in the main storyline, and play through their own story up until they are seen in the main storyline. Each character in the DLC stories have a different style of combat opposed to the character you play as through the main story, and are each fun to play around with. The soundtrack is the best part, awesome rock music plays in the background of every single fight, and really sets the mood of the game. Each boss theme is sounding appropriate for the type of boss, and the story behind the boss. The bosses, while on that topic, also rock. They range from big to small, and are taken town in awesome and innovative ways, especially toward the end of the game. Heck, even the title screen shows you are in for a ride. As for specs, its a big game, so make sure you have a beefy computer if you really want to experience the game fully.TL;DR: its a great game with awesome combat, bosses and storyline, has cool customization and a kick-butt sound track.Overall: 9/10"

This is a decent port without bugs, issues and any other annoyances. While the FPS value does not go above 30 it wasn't a problem for me. I'd skip detailing the story as it simply cannot be any cheesier than what it is not to mention some of the ridiculous boss battles (especially the last one).What makes Revengeance a good fighting game is the Blade Mode our protagonist, Raiden, can use. This is a slow-mo fighting mode and is intended for close-up fighting only - Raiden can chop up his enemies into - literally - hundreds of pieces. The surrounding area is full of objects that can also be sliced up - this is done smoothly and superbly by the game's well-written engine. Usually, this is for finishing moves and it uses an energy bar that can only be filled if we keep fighting and hitting enemies.Another funny thing employed by Raiden is the so-called Zandatsu. While we are in the process of slicing up our foes an indicator appears for a short period of time. Pressing the right button allows Raiden to take his enemies' innards. This represents energy and as enemies are mostly cyborgs it is not that disgusting. This coupled with Blade Mode can be heaps of fun.The game, unfortunately, is pretty short. There are only 7 chapters and while the first four last almost an hour, number 5 can be completed in less than 10 minutes; chapter 6 only consists of a boss battle and the last chapter was - for me - a too long boss battle.In any case, this is a good hack 'n' slash TPS game with some pretty funny combos and its Zandatsu and Blade Mode offers something unique and interesting in this genre. Hardcore gamers can take on other difficulty levels and some of the more difficult achievements."

As expected from the gametrailer, it has some button-bashing and some crazy and fun SLICING action, pretty much equal to the amount of slicing compared to the famous fruit ninja game ;P.From start this game challenges you with pretty hard tasks which usually needs some game knowledge. Although combo's and moves can be practised in the tuturials you can pick up from boxes, I tried to leave them out, because I found it too distractive for the storyline and just take the fun out of the play-learn-apply way I prefer (although, if you don't know how to block, the first two might come in handy). Between levels are a bit much cutscenes, which do in fact add context to the game and demonstrate great graphics, but often have long durations compared to the levels itself.Upgrades to visual appearances, moves, health or stamina is done quite nicely based on experience point acquired during levels. Of course I HAD to pick the sombrero and poncho uniform :P. Like the latter, the game has more humourous additions, which I will not spoil right away, but do make me smile.Overall a fun game to play. Time to completion might be pretty fast. Considering the fact that this is the first Metal Gear game in this particular style, its really well made and promising. Can't wait for a sequel to this one. I do wish for a bit more of an open-world sequel though (similar to e.g. Prototype)."

If you answered yes to 3 or more, you will probably love it. Let's go into some detail, though.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is set up as an action RPG, with ties to games like Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and Viewtiful Joe. Most encounters can be gotten through simply by mashing through combos - this is how I played the game the first time through, and a good default to fall back on in some cases. The entire game can be completed on Normal difficulty without learning a single combo, which I think is excellent for gamers who just want to hop in and enjoy the action.For players looking for more challenge, or for an experience where they can optimize their performance and master the game, Metal Gear Rising provides ample opportunity. The parry system allows any player to easily block damage, but the precision timing required to counter attacks (especially boss attacks) means that the more effort you invest into learning the mechanic, the more badass you will become. The combos perform similarly: several combos will disorient and execute weaker enemies long before the game will count them as ""killed,"" allowing you to save time and look hella ballin' out of control, rather than just ballin'.The difficulties also provide an excellent opportunity for both casual and skilled players: the effective New Game+ will allow casual players to take their upgrades earned in previous playthroughs to encounters that feature new attacks, more enemies, and more beefy bosses. Players looking for a challenge can hop into harder difficulty modes right off the bat (enter the Konami code at the ""Press Start"" screen to unlock them all immediately) to face more demanding scenarios with Raiden's default loadout, which seems meager after you've finished the game once.Boss fights are also worth special mention, just because of how well done most of them are: each boss features a unique mechanic that requires you to master blade mode (discussed later) to an even more precise degree. This can make some of the later bosses frustrating if you struggle with the controls (which I do for blade mode), but also adds a really interesting layer of skill and finesse to each fight. To make each encounter memorable, each boss has an amazing music score, which ramps up in intensity as the fight progresses, and the tension and thrill of having a vocal track kick in when both you and the boss are on low health is something that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.For the final paragraph of praise, blade mode has to be addressed: this mechanic is takes the game from good action game to over the top action game. As many movies, shows, and cutscenes have done before, Blade Mode allows you to cut opponents and objects into as many pieces as possible. Tougher enemies have damage threshholds on all their major limbs or weapons, requiring you to best them in combat before you can remove their means of attack or slice them in two, making the sensation all the more rewarding when you can finally chop off the legs of a Gecko that's been giving you hell. Blade Mode also has a special mode called Zandatsu, where time will slow down even more, allowing you to precisely aim for enemies' regenerative nano-spine, which when cut during Blade Mode (and then subsequently consumed), refills your health and Blade Mode energy.The last paragraph or two are going to be dedicated to the major issues I found with Metal Gear Rising, but they are fairly inconsequential compared to the excellence that comprises the rest of the game. First, is how little Metal Gear Rising tells you - it will teach you the absolute basics, but it will not teach you anything complex. I had to learn the hard way that Blade Mode swipes can be manually aimed (middle mouse button by default), that the dodge move (jump and light attach once purchased and equipped) has invincibility frames, that yellow attacks are unblockable but orange attacks are just powerful, and that you can save, customize, and go to VR missions from the Codec Menu. I recommend watching Youtube videos that go through some of the advanced functionality to fully understand how the game works, as well as checking all the menus and options to find important features and a TON of extra story content from supporting cast members.The second issue I take with Metal Gear Rising is that I found the precision controls for Blade Mode very obnoxious, which ruined my experience of later boss fights. It becomes less of an issue when you fully upgrade weapons and energy cells to extend the time you have in Blade Mode, but some boss fights required you to cut 3 - 4 boxes in a line (sometimes several times in a row, oriented in different ways each time), and setting it up felt clumsy and stressful, ruining the pace of the fight. Some of this complaint can be overcome by mastering the controls, which I haven't done yet, so take this with a grain of salt: if you are a hyper badass (or can become one), Blade Mode will not impede your enjoyment, even though it might still be somewhat tricky to use.Overall, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time: it's fast paced, super stylish, easy to jump into but difficult to master, and rewards investments into learning the combat system. The story is a little silly, but the game pulls it off by not taking any of it seriously. So next time you have the money, this game is well worth the full $30."

,Recommended,235460,9147680,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,Kurando,"Kojipro and Platinum Games bring the CUHRAZYness to the Metal Gear universe in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Set after MGS4, you play as Raiden, tasked with bringing down a PMC by the name of Desperado. The story is pretty standard action game fare, although it's neat to get a glimpse of the MG world post-patriots.The gameplay is where the meat of the game is at, however. While not as deep as DMC(the good ones) and Ninja Gaiden, the gameplay in MGR is more than adequate and will entertain fans of the genre and newcomers alike. There are weapons, bodies, and skills you can purchase with BP, gained from killing your enemies. There are VR missions to test your skills and unlock new bodies for Raiden. You also aquire sub-weapons from killing certain bosses, however equipping them takes away the use of your strong attack button. This, combined with the fact that they are largely only useful in specific situations makes them much less appealing than just sticking with your main sword. Another gripe I have is the lack of enemy variety. However, the game's biggest draw is ""Blade Mode"", where you slow down time and are able to cut in any direction. This is used to cut enemies into pieces and attack bosses weak points, and is very well done. The game itself is a bit short, even for a game of this genre, but has many reasons to replay it.Lastly, the oft-praised soundtrack deserves a special mention. The music is very well done and fits the game perfectly. When fighting most bosses, the lyrics of the song are from the bosses point of view which is a neat little touch. The OST does its job and really gets you hyped up for the fights, especially the last boss.All in all, despite a few minor flaws, MGR is well worth the asking price and will hopefully be a fixture in the action game scene for years to come."

There really isn't any way to dodge attacks effictively, you have to learn how to block properly, which takes some time to get used to.The game has a total of 5 difficulty settings, which range from pretty easy to ♥♥♥♥ing impossible.Also, there are so-called VR-missions, basically certain scenarios with tasks you have to complete within a certain time limit - some of those are extremely hard, so if you're up for a tough challenge, this is for you.This games main story is fairly short (5-6 hours most likely).You get 2 more short DLC stories and as I said, plenty of VR-missions and multiple difficulty settings.

This of course, doesn't include the dozens of hours I've spent playing this game on console across multiple playthroughs. If you want the short version of this review: it's balls-to-the wall amazing and if you like fast-paced action, you owe it to yourself to buyMetal Gear Rising: Revengance.As a character action game, its extremely solid. More than that, in fact. It feels incredible. The simple act of parrying an enemy's hit at just the right moment, leaving them exposed for a counter attack in which youslice them in half and tear out their still beating heartjust never gets old, even after completing everything. There aren't any styles likeDevil May Cry 4, and switching between weapons is kinda clunky. In terms of ranged capabilities, Raiden can use rocket launchers and grenades, but this tends to break up the action, and feels a little unnatural. It has its tactical utility, but don't expect to be pulling off combos with pistols akimbo like Dante.Metal Gear Rising: Revengancefocuses on sword play, and it does that exceedingly well. Unlike other character action titles (or spectacle fighters, whichever you prefer), the game's focuses more on parrying and blocking than dodging. Doing so requires precise timing, but you generally have a pretty good window to defend yourself. Parrying just as the attack hits (otherwise known as a perfect parry) will leave the enemy open for riposte, which will quickly turn the battle in your favour. It's difficult to describe why, but parrying just feels right, and it never gets old. If you want a game that feels good, this is it.As aMetal Geargame, it's actually pretty good. It's obviously not a stealth game, but rather a character action game set in theMetal Gearuniverse. Though originally designed by Kojima Productions, the game was scrapped late in development and rebuilt by Platinum Games, who handled the gameplay. If you aren't familiar with Platinum, their other titles includeViewtiful Joe,Okami,God Hand,Bayonetta, and nowThe Wonderful 101. They're a studio with quite a pedigree, especially when it comes to makes games with great... well, gameplay. The plot and overall design of the title was handled by Kojima Productions. The result is a match made in heaven. Despite being a spin-off,Metal Gear Rising: Revengeanceactually manages to move the universe forward in a logical way, moreso thanMetal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriotsever did. How does the world handle the aftermath of the Guns of the Patriots incident? How has Raiden moved on as a character? These are questions the game tackles, making it a worthwhile addition to theMetal Gearcanon. In terms of its story, it's about what you'd expect from a Hideo Kojima game. It has the same quirks and cyberpunk elements, but cranked up to eleven. There are still codec calls, but they're entirely optional. The cutscenes are still here, but they're shorter, to put more emphasis on the action. Gameplay-wise, it's a character action game, so don't go in expecting any amount of stealth. There are some encounters that can be avoided, either by sneaking past or eliminating your enemies one at a time. This is achieved by moving quickly and staying out of sight, but its also incredibly simplistic. Still, it complements the action very well. Running past guards and eliminating them one-by-one really does make you feel like a cyborg ninja. Just don't go in expecting a stealth game. There are still cardboard boxes.As a port. it's functional. It's pretty rough around the edges, but it's a port of a console action made by a Japanese developer that's actually functional, unlike say,Dark Souls. On console, this game ran at sixty frames per second, which is uncommon, but not completely unheard of. It still runs at that frame rate, and comes with a decent amount of options, though its still fairly bare bones. The resolution options are lacking, but I got it working by putting the game in windowed mode with an external program to remove the border. There have been a few reports of bugs, but in the ten plus hours I've played with this game, it runs just as good as console. Other than the included downloadable content (which includes the pre-order bonuses, which never came to PlayStation Store or Xbox Live Marketplace), this doesn't play all to differently from the console version, aside from the extra graphical options. Added in the PC version however, is the ability to play all of the cutscenes and codec conversations from the main menu, as well as a boss rush mode. If you've only had a passing interest in this game, or it wasn't your cup of tea on console, this probably isn't for you. If you're a hardcore fan like me, you'll probably enjoy this a lot. If you haven't played it at all, thirty dollars is an absolute steal for a game less than a year old, bundled with all of the downloadable content.As a video game, it's very fun. It's as simple as that. The game is fast-paced, and for character action fans, there's plenty of depth and challenge. For those unfamiliar to the genre, this game remains accessible. If the game has one major flaw, its the length. The story is very short, and will be over before you know it. However, the game gives you plenty of reason to come back to it, with extra difficulty settings that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ side challenges in the form of VR missions that will test your skills to the limit, and collectibles and upgrades scattered throughout. Still, the game will always leave you wanting more, in a good way. You'll want more and more ofRevengance, simply because it plays so damn well. The extra DLC chapters take you through most of the same content, but one of them adds a new boss fight, which is just as amazing as all of the other boss fights. Which reminds me: the boss rights are amazing! They're the high points of the game, complemented by 2013's best soundtrack. The newly added boss rush mode is a welcome addition for this reason, as they're easily the best part. If you want to slice a Metal Gear half, this is a fantastic action game you need to play.RULES OF NATURE!"

Parieren von angriffen gilt.Die Gegner sind nicht zu Stark und nicht zu Schwach was für Normale sowie auch Bossgegner gilt.Doch nicht immer heißt es Actionreiche Kämpfe zu führen, weil man hat einige Missionen wo man entweder seine Feinde niedermetzelt mit roher Gewalt oder man schleicht sich an und Tötet diese leise, diese wahl trifft der Spieler.Der Charakter ""Raiden"" reagiert Hervorragend auf meine Stick bewegungen ohne jegliche probleme, selbst wenn man in Heftigeren gefechten ist, was auch für das Drücken der knöpfe, Schulter und oder Trigger tasten gilt.Gespielt habe ich es mit einem Xbox360 Pad.Zudem kommt noch das sogenannte ""Zendatsu"" welches vergleichbar ist mit dem ""Bullettime"", welches man von einigen shootern kennt.Man kann nach jedem Kapitel dem Hauptcharakter eine neue Rüstung oder Waffen verpassen und/oder diese Upgraden und sich zudem noch neue Fähigkeiten bzw. Moves zulegen.Die Entwickler haben es zudem geschafft Heiße und Schnelle Action mit einer gewissen Emotionalen ebene zu Kombinieren, was für mich selbst eine neue erfahrung ist was das Genre ""Hack'n'Slay"" angeht.Technisch ist das Spiel sehr gut in sachen Stabilität und Kompatilität und habe keinerlei Bug's entdeckt die den Spielspaß zerstören könnten oder mich dazu leiten hätten können es nicht mehr zu Spielen, zudem habe ich keinerlei probleme mit der Performance gehabt, was für eine sehr gute und Saubere Programmierung spricht.Grafik ist Top und die Engine liefert schöne effeckte.Im großen und ganzen ein Richtig gutes Spiel was den vollen Kaufpreis wert ist!Ganz klar 13/10"

(You have to write it like that. It's a law or something.) The combat is pure Platinum; wide, sweeping attacks with palpable impact, all fractions of a second long so you can combo all night and day. With a functional parry system and a frankly glorious cinematic dismemberment attack that pushes Havok to its logical conclusion, MGR:R lives up to the ""spectacle fighter"" title.The soundtrack is on point. In fact, it's so on point, one point can't hold it. It's on multiple points. (Just like Raiden. Look at them toes.) Lyrics cut in when the action is at its most intense, enhancing the already stellar heavy metal and beautifully integrating the music with the game's tone. Plus, the music from the game is available on Spotify, so you can harness the raw power of ""Rules of Nature"" or ""I'm My Own Master Now"" to do other activities, like chop vegetables into way too many pieces. Zandatsu.The only complaint I have is the rapid wiggling of the left stick that many QTEs use instead of button inputs. I find holding your thumb in place and shaking the controller with the right hand is more possible, and it uses muscles I've already developed. ;^)In conclusion, this game is not for the faint of heart. There is blood, dismemberment and emotional trauma, and the game demands lightning reflexes. But it is hugely rewarding, in a way that few games can truly lay claim to."

A word that does not exist in any dictionary, but sounds cool.A worthy representative of the ""Cuhhhrazy games"" genre.Make no mistake this is not the sneak up, stealth Metal Gear. And this game clearly shows it, and even the uprise from the angry fanboys was somewhat extinguished, since the devs cleary made a game resting on a pure fun, over the top action, characters, story, cutscenes etc.Don't be surprised if you find the game somwhat... DMC-ish, it is no strange since one of the big names behind Platinum Games is no other then the father of DMC - Hideki Kamiya: a bald ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who knows how to make a damn fun and  action packed games, even when he is not involved, Platinum Games's logo is enough to know that cuhhhrazy ride is in order.Platinum Games?.... A studio found by (mostly) a couple of ex - Capcom talented guys, who were fed up with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting Crapcom created, so they gave the suits the middle finger and thank God, created a new studio... Ahh Kamiya, you wonderful bald ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you....Anyway MGR is of course high speed action with quick reaction times or QTE as we know them, but just enough, so they won't get much in your eyes, what will get in your eyes is the awesome moments and events, or rahter opportunities to slash poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in over 9000 (pun intended) pieces, but don't worry, they are baaawd robots, so you are not killing humans.... kinda... sorta.Heh who gives a ♥♥♥♥. The games gives you this sweet katana, and don't get me started about the sweet Muramasa Blade you can unlock, upon which even Vergil Sparda will drool. Expect unlocking combos, new ablilities, suit upgrades, new skins, challenges, and most of all: dynamic gameplay which you control. Yes, every time I slash a cyborg and his torso does 180 in mid air, slashing it again on two parts and doing Zandatsu (Stab'n Grab restores your HP and stuff) brings a big grin on my face.Be wary however. The game is hard but fair, you have the means to defend and offend, so if you suck at parry, it's not the game's fault.And what is parry? The moment when you rather deflect an attack by pushing the opposite direction + attack button towards the attacking enemy. Lend it perfectly, and win a window of opportunity to execute slow-mo chopping time... If you're good enough.So in conclusion:+Over the top action+Awesome weapons+God damn this soundtrack... Freaking awesome!+Short campaign? Yes, but extremely replayable and addictive. I have 16hr ingame and counting.., Can't get enough man..+Cool design of characters, weapons.. I mean Kojima Prductions, you know the drill.+Wicked humor and cutscenes.+Keyboard and mouse control is not awkward. I however use Logitech F310 (with X input... check the back of your F310 controllers n00bs, duhh)+You beat up Schwarzenegger's evil twin cousin... In the most awesome and over the top way there is.Bad sides... hmmm... Hard one. I can't find really. You will hate the game if you're not in this type of gameplay.Probably the 2 meh DLCs with Jetstream Sam, who is really awesome brazillian samurai (what?) but too bad he is playable in a rather short and lackluster campaign. The other is Blade Wolf's DLC and it's too underwhelming also.Soooo.. yeah. This game is awesome!Do you want more Cuhhhrazy games?Check them out:- Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakaning (Special Edition)- Devil May Cry 1 and 4- Viewtiful Joe- FREAKING GOD HADN! <-- must play if old Capcom beat'em ups have special place in your heart.- Ōkami- Sengoku Basara- Anarchy Reigns- MadWorld- Vanquish"

The combat is fast paced and engaging, blade mode is oh so satisfying, and the controls are easy to work with. (on a gamepad)Since everybody else is spouting off all of the pros, I'll focus on the cons.  It has trouble keeping a consistent tone, often times urging you to use stealth rather than your blade (in a hack and slash game).  The camera will sometimes screw you over, but not often enough for it to be an issue.Now for my biggest beef with the game.   If you're going for the high score, trying to S rank every mission, the game is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.  You will NEED to avoid taking ANY damage to get the S rank.   To make this even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty, the game will NOT STOP throwing groups of insanely annoying enemies at you, that will ALL spam their own attacks from all directions.  Some of these attacks are even unblockable.   Seriously.   If you're fighting one of the sword dudes, and the as**$&@ on the other side of the room hits you with a single stray bullet (less than 1% damage), guess what?  No bonus, no S rank, restart.    The same is true for the bossfights as well.  If you take a single hit from ANYTHING,  you're restarting.It almost seems like the devs are intentionally trying to ♥♥♥♥ with you at some points.  There is one MANDATORY fight if you want to get an S rank, that has an INVISIBLE ♥♥♥♥ING WALL preventing you from touching your enemies.  On higher difficulties, the gun turret in the room is useless.   You're forced to use the infinite ammo cheat to spam rockets at the enemies.  Thank the merciful gods you don't have to get the no damage bonus to S rank that fight, but that isn't really saying much on a difficulty that you die in one hit anyway.And the VR missions...  Also mandatory for 100%, they strip all of your upgrades off before pitting you against even MORE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty groups of enemies, AND THEN put you under a TIME LIMIT to get the S rank.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ .T.H.A.T.All of the best players all over youtube say:  Even with all of the upgrades, great skills, and the best strategy, whether or not you get an S rank is roughly 20% you, 80% luck.If you're gonna buy this game, don't bother trying to 100% it.   You'll end up killing your entire family out of frustration."

But that really is my only complaints about the game.The game has fair achievements from what I see (apart from the super difficult ones), and the game will only take about 13 hours for someone to play through if they tackle the DLCs as well.Oh yeah DLCs, the game comes packaged with two DLCs on the PC version, and how you access it is through the story menu and then choosing the DLC you want to play, I had no idea that the game had DLCs until I searched through the achievements, so it is helpful advice believe me :P.And that's about it, the game is awesome and deserves to have everyone play it !!!

The difficulty is rather high in this game so I wouldn't recommend it to very casual players, unless they go on the easy difficulty (I first beat it in hard mode and it took me about 8 hours, 2 of those for the final boss). This may be due to the fact that TUTORIALS ARE UTTER♥♥♥♥♥♥and that parrying isn't really explained/demonstrated to you as much as it should be.QTEs are ""done right"" in this game and won't completely break its pace. The ""stealth mode"" isn't that great but sometimes necessary in higher difficulties if you don't want to get gang banged by 5 geekos.The story isn't the best you'll come across during your video game adventure but it's doing its job, bosses have quite some charisma (particularily Sam) despite the fact that bosses are introduced to you 3 minutes before you cut them open. And yeah : boss fights are quite epic, some of the best I've seen in any video games I've played.The cinematics are particularily well-made (japanese studio after all...) and full of action.The replayability is quite high : you have VR missions (some little missions to do on the side of the main story) ; you can replay the game in order to unlock all upgrades / all achievements (good ♥♥♥♥ing luck !) / in higher difficulty modes (the Revengeance mode will be challenging even to the best players, if not impossible (?)).8/10 recommended."

I used to play this first on Ps3 then I got it on PC a while back ago.I want to say this game is hard on like Very Hard - Revegeance. Hard mode wasn't too bad but when you turned the difficulty up even higher it was pretty insane. On Revegeance difficulty you needed like all the skills and like a fully upgraded Fox Blade and you needed to be good at parrying attacks and using the Defensive Offensive skill and have 200% health because all hits usually will kill you in like 2 or 1.If you like being a ninja who can slash everyone in slow motion and kill everyone you face then this game is what you need.Most boss fights in this game aren't too bad but some can be very hard on higher difficulties if you don't know how to parry very well or you don't have the right skills or a powerful enough weapon.The best part of this game is the soundtrack.

You can level up your character in-between missions, but this is a game where personal skill rules, and nothing else. This makes it satisfying on a different level from most other games, and it’s the type of game where replaying it on a harder difficulty or playing the optional VR missions makes sense.I often see interviews with developers where they claim that their games offer replayabilty because of all the collectible items they’ve strewn across the map to pad the length. It always comes across like they’ve completely missed the point of what makes a game desirable to replay. Too often their systems are so shallow that they can barely last for a single play through of their game, let alone multiple times. Hopefully they can lean on a good story to keep the player interested in pushing on, even when the gameplay itself has become routine. This is something Revengeance doesn’t suffer from, on any level.The gameplay systems in Revengeance don’t feel like a clone from another game. At first it feels foreign, which adds to your clumsiness in the beginning. With every fight you’ll get better at timing blocks, learning when to run, when to jump, and when to do glide attacks. It all comes together brilliantly in the boss fights, which are some of the best around. Compared to other games this amount of original design feels brave. What most other developers do is clone another game and then add their own twist on top of an already proven formula. That doesn’t seem to be the Platinum Games way. They know they’re damn good at making this kind of game, even when they throw out everything they’ve done before and craft new systems appropriate for the story and characters they're paired with.Because this is part of the Metal Gear franchise there are some things fans expect in terms of story themes and tropes. There was more than enough here to make me happy. The story touches on themes like the reasons why the military industrial complex exists, the personal beliefs of those who take part in war, and the dreams they try to realize for themselves and future generations. So many things are brought up and touched on that it feels like it’s exploding with thoughts and ideas on the world and everyone involved in conflicts on all levels. It might be overacted and blunt in its approach, but they really tried! The main character has his convictions tested multiple times from different angles by the antagonists.As far as Metal Gear tropes go it features a protracted fist fight between two shirtless men on top of a metal gear, while they discuss their personal philosophies and beliefs between punches. It’s more than I hoped for. From the Hideo Kojima Metal Gear games you can always expect all this to be in there, but since this was by a different studio I wasn’t sure just how hard they would try to keep the spirit of the series in here. Not only did Platinum Games manage to make their own distinct spin on the franchise, but they kept the most important things that make the Metal Gear titles resonate with the players. Its heart is in the right place.I had a fantastic time playing Revengeance, and after I finished it I was left feeling that 2013 was one hell of a year for games. I've spent the past couple months catching up on several big titles that came out during the past year, and like many of them this feels like a must play."

VR mission, unlockables, and the dlcs make the game even better by adding more replay value and being the first PlatinumGames port for PC and it is a pretty solid port, so if you like Hack'n'Slash games go get this one."
,Recommended,235460,16682121,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,Snort Cannon,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a spin off of the Metal Gear Solid games, but will you want to switch from a stealth genre to a more action oriented hack and slash genre ? In Metal Gear Solid Revengeance we play as Raiden. Raiden runs his own private military firm. When some bad guys think war is better then peace it's up to you as Raiden to stop them from starting World War 3. So how MGR Revengeance ? I had an absolute blast playing it. This game has a different pace then the other Metal Gear games. Where in the other ones you have to take things slow to get to your goal this time you have to go as fast and as chaotic as possible. The game play is awesome. It's in the style of a hack and slash game. The game also has something called a Zandatsu mode. Raiden can go into slow motion and chop everything into small tiny pieces. The soundtrack to this game is amazing and it has some of the best music for a game ever. The boss battles are on a huge scale. Some of the bosses are just insane. The game looks great and the PC port is outstanding. Everything maxed out and solid 60 FPS. Sometimes when you overkill your opponent in the Zandatsu mode the frame rate might start to drop but you shouldn't encounter any problems. The game also has two story dlc's included in this purchases witch both are around 40 minutes long. There's also a VR mini missions which increase the play time. The game has a few minor problems. The camera isn't always the best. I was sometimes struggling to see where I was shot from or where the enemy went while I was too busy dealing with other enemies. The game has a few minor bugs. Overall if you are a fan of Hack and Slash type of games this game is a must own. Everything about this game is almost near perfect and for the price you can't go wrong. This is a must own. I give Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance a 9/10"

This game however is borderline not involved with that universe. Raiden is here.. Luckily for cheap on early on you get to change your outfit to Frank Jaegar proper. You still have to hear Raiden whine about crap in the cut scenes though.However, I will base this review on the games own merits. Drawing no further conclusions by comparison to MGS.Pros:You get to be a ninja, GOTY. Seriously though Ninja's are awesome.You get to cut everything up real good.I ran up a barrage of missiles and cut a helicopter into 1000+ piecesYou get to cut everything up real good.Really great soundtrackCons:The enemies are tired and repeat too oftenI didn't find the combos between weak and strong attacks compelling (Left me yearning for DMC/Ninja Gaiden Black)The parry system is fine but its inconsistent. Leading to excessive frustration.There really isn't a dodge system (Offensive Defense is just striking and dodging at the same time, which I also found to be inconsistent. Maybe it was just me but I consider myself on the high end of average at character action games)HE IS A NINJA, WHY IS THERE NO ROLL ABILITY. Major oversightThe camera is unruly. I found it easier to control with Mouse and Keyboard. But that hurt my pinky as ninja sprint and Zandatsu are on Ctrl and L.Shift respectively. I couldn't find a happy replacement for these key bindings either. Apparently it doesn't like my mouses side buttons.Often the best strategy to kill things was to Zandatsu the crap out of everything and run away, rinse and repeat. That got boring, however you get to cut stuff up real good(see the Pros section lol)Even though its only around 6 hours, I don't see myself finishing it. Never say never except in this sentence.I can't truly recommend this even as a Metal Gear fan but it is a fun diversion. For whatever reason there is no mixed option and I wouldn't recommend that you NOT play this at all.Follow my curation for more"

All my worries were over when I started cutting a Metal Gear RAY in half at 1080p, 60fps and no problems with the controls whatsoever. Don't let yourself get fooled by those system requirements. The recommended specs are needed if you want everything maxed out at 1080p with 60fps in the most demanding part of the game. So if you have a decent PC, you'll be fine.The story takes place 4 years after Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, in 2018 exactly. The story is not like MGS, but it's more of a spin-off story with Raiden as the main character. This isn't also a sneaking game like MGS, that's Snake's job.Raiden's job is to cut his enemies in half with his HF blade. The action is awesome! It may seem like mindless button-mashing, but to let Raiden fight in style you have to use special moves and fast reflexes. The boss fights are long and exciting. You'll definitely get an adrenaline rush during the main boss fights! I definitely recommend this game to everyone, it's one of the best games of 2013 in my opinion!"

Thank goodness it support the 360, PS4, and PS3 controllers, with the ONE also.It's not a super looker of a game, but it's a console port after all. Even so TransGaming did an outstanding job bringing it to the Mac and the performance is fantastic. Pity it doesn't support more than 1080p as a resolution though. Even though it allows me to select a higher resolution , it's still 1080p, with just added Letter, and pillar boxing.The gameplay is superb, and handles well. It'll keep engaged, that's for sure. Especially if you're a DMC fan to some extent. The story so far doesn't even seem to require you having played any of the previous games in the slightest. Which is fine, it stands on its own merits.The biggest negatives, is the constant interrupting cut scenes, that can go on for a tad too long. Featuring the cringiest voice acting around, Uwe Boll's movie might have better acting than this.The worst offender is the camera angles though, you control them with the right analog stick.

To put it simply, It's  a spin-off of the ""Metal Gear Solid"" series which features Raiden, a popular character from the MGS games, he was first introduced in MGS2 and then later seen in MGS4 cooperating with Snake.Either way, in this spin-off, Raiden is a cyborg ninja whose role is to provide security and peace around the world, that means hindering the plans of many terrorists and reducing all the commotion in order to avoid a ""war"".Gameplay wise, the game seems pretty solid, if you're new into hack'n'slash games, this won't be a bad experience for you, in fact, the game is really newbie-friendly and you can always adjust your difficulty and back yourself up with some tutorials before jumping right into the game.The game has replay values with boss battles and DLC missions, you can always practice and aim for a higher difficulty, the sword gameplay is entertaining and I'll go as far as to convey my experience: this is one of the only hack'n'slash games that gave me the feeling of might and power flowing through my hands as I pressed the buttons on my gamepad.The sword cuts will get you addicted and pumped up, you can slash through a large number of objects, props, bodies and such, there are limits as to what you can cut for engine purposes and story advancement though.Story wise, if you haven't played the previous Metal Gear Solid games, there's no need to worry. Simply because this is a spin-off and you won't need any information in order to enjoy the plot, if you want to understand better though I'd advice you to look into the characters' backgrounds. And make sure you play the DLC missions last as they deliver a set of pieces coming straight from the main Story Mode which will spoil your experience.Soundtracks: They are well implemented, nothing to say there, everything seems to be synchronizing with the action, drama, and more, the game's soundtrack goes from dynamic to peaceful at some point, you will certainly enjoy it.Finally, the port is pretty good for Platinum's first ever Console to PC port, there's a good amount of graphical options which you will enjoy, the resolutions are quite limited in terms of choices, but you shouldn't expect too much from a port. Aside from that, the resolution personally never gave me any problems, I have all the options I need. From Graphics quality to Zangeki and Zantime, the game delivers a good set of choices to help you run it better and enjoy your experience. It's also well optimized, from the looks of it, you won't be needing a very powerful PC to play it, just make sure it fits the minimum requirements or slightly below to fully enjoy the game.In short, it's a well made port as it even supports options for low-end PCs, just don't expect too much of a high FPS increase after having set all options.Overall? I'd give it a 7.5/10. Is it worth it? Yes, the game's price is pretty rewarding for a game of this caliber, and it comes with all the DLCs along."
,Recommended,235460,8713070,"Posted: 14 January, 2014",all,ZamboniChaos,"Metal Gear Rising: REVENGEANCE isn't an easy game. Let's just make that clear. It is however, a complete joy to play. From the very beginning it glorifies the player and effortlessly delivers brutal, fast-paced action combat. Do you like cyborgs and ninjas? Giant robots? Are you aroused by the idea of filleting your enemies into chunks of man-meat? Good news friend. Good news.Building on the addicting gameplay mechanics of their flagship title, Bayonetta, Platinum Games has created an immensely satisfying action game. All the trademark tropes you'd expect from a Kojima/Platinum collaboration are here. Over the top action? Check. Larger than life characters? Check. Wholesale slaughter and destruction on a Biblical scale? Check. MGR:R fuses these simple pillars of fun with mechanics that are easy to learn yet difficult to master. As you slash, parry, dodge and counter-hit through the world, you almost begin to feel as if you're playing a fighting game. I believe this feeling definitely contributes to the enjoyment that MGR:R provides. The flow of combat always feels natural while delivering kills that are satisfying, rewarding and really fun to watch.The story of the game is typical of Kojima Productions. Evil PMCs are doing bad things. As a member of a good PMC you have to stop them from profiting from the suffering of innocent people. You'll fight villains who yammer on about something philosophical while you're severing their various appendages, but any depth this game tries to achieve is quickly overshadowed by the insanity that makes it so enjoyable. Most of the dialogue is tiresome and the English V/O is cringe inducing. This made the omission of a Japanese dialogue option even more frustrating. However, despite these flaws the story does have its humorous moments and I genuinely laughed out loud more than once.While the combat mechanics of the game are intuitive, mastering them will take time. It took me most of my first play-through before I felt like I could execute moves and combos competently. It also does lack some explanation on what I would consider key mechanics and I didn't feel like I fully grasped their nuances until about halfway through the main story. If you're going to dive in, take some time and browse the ""Help"" menu to familiarize yourself with the controls and basic combos. There are also several VR Missions that you can use for practice. Navigating the menus in-game can also be somewhat frustrating, especially when switching secondary weapons and items in the middle of combat.Bottom line: If you're a person who enjoys frantic action, over-the-top ultra-violence and feeling like a complete badass, than Metal Gear Rising: REVENGEANCE is a game for you. At a $30 price point that includes the full game plus the entire catalogue of DLC, this experience is a steal. As long as you don't expect more than what is advertised, you won't be disappointed.-ZC"

You can go into a mode where you precisely slice up whatever is in front of you. Even when not in this mode the slicing mechanic is the most impressive thing I've seen like it.

Seriously, this game came out way before Trump's rise, and the main villian says ""Make America Great Again!""-Platinum Games knows how to make a fun, action-packed game full of ridiculous setpieces. See: Bayonetta.-A fair amount of skill is needed to beat the game. You cannot just hack and slash. If you played Skyward Sword, it's like they took just the swordplay and made a much, much, much more hardcore version.-Metal Gear humor is back in force.-Awesome soundtrack. I don't really like metal but it fits.-Perfect length.CONS-The game's tutorials are laughable. It's hard to figure out how to play the game.-If you're not already familiar with Metal Gear lore, good luck.-Stealth is awful. It's barely a part of the game, but it's there. I would have cut it out entirely, personally.---Other Notes-Although in typical Metal Gear fashion, the plot is ridiculous and convoluted, it has probably the simplest plot of any Metal Gear game I've played. This is a plus for me, but apparently other people like sitting through literally 10 hours of cutscenes.-If you don't already like Raiden, you're not going to like him here.-Supporting cast is pretty bland."

The completly fast paced over the top action, with loud electric guitars, awesome fights, blood and limbs everywhere,  and a unique ""Blade-mode"" is a match made in Outer Heaven ;PI'm playing with a 360 Controller, and at first it looked like the controls are pretty difficult, but once you practice a bit and start understanding how everything works it's pretty good. i would recommend looking for a beginner guide, since there isn't much of a tutorial, while it offers many mechanics to achieve your goal = cutting and crushing every single enemy in your way, may it be a Metal Gear, Tanks, Helicopters or hundreds of cyborgs.HELL, THERE'S EVEN A COUNTER SHOWING INTO HOW MANY PIECES YOU JUST CUT YOUR ENEMIES. AND YOU HEAL YOURSELF BY RIPPING OUT AND CRUSHING THEIR SPINES WHILE THE CORPSES ( dunno if u can still call it that. maybe rather GOULASH) ARE MIDAIR.Although it's a ""different"" game, you immediatly feel the Kojima/MGS flair. For everyone who hasn't played or liked the other titles (do those people even exist?) it's completly not neccesary to have played another one of them. You can stealth kill every other enemy pretty stylish and easy or just jump into them, while cutting some heads off mid air.   The story is it's own. So if you are interested what are you waiting for? There are no excuses left ;PBut even such a great game has some flaws,  one is the camera = sometimes you just can't see everything, which makes blocking/parrying quite hard- The other thing i  don't like is the diffuculty. Someone recommended me starting on hard, which proved to be right. Since even on hard, unless you mess up completly or have really bad  luck it's impossbile to die, suppose you know what to do. I hope that changes later into the game, or when i will start a second run on the highest unlockable difficulty, getting the achievements. Minor flaws, tbh.One thing that is important to notice that both DLCs are  coming with this game, you don't miss anything, you don't have to purchase anything else besides the game.CONSIDER BINDING THE  SCREENSHOTS-KEY TO THE SPACEBAR! :D"

Even if the price of this game is what it is, I'd definately say it's worth it. I was intrigued by the voice acting.

Yes this game has everything you could possibly need for a few days of fun. When Raiden goes Super Saiyan on yo pooper, you'll understand sooner than later.I enjoyed this game, a fun, borderline technical hack and slash game that relies on a few of its mechanics heavily. Start getting good with that counter from the very beginning, it's the most heavily leaned upon mechanic in the gameplay. Otherwise there is no other way to negate incoming damage. Plus it sets you up for the ""Chop Everything Into A Million Pieces"" Mode. The timing can get wonky at times though making it something you'll frown (curse out in my case) at a few times.All utility type items come straight from the enemies bodies. You will literaly rip the spines out from them, over and over and over and... (repeat x30), before they ever hit the ground. That is by effect of the ""Chop Everything Into A Million Pieces"" Mode, and let me tell you its disgustingly satisfying when you're surrounded then proceed to rip the spines out of 7-8 guys, all before they hit the ground. This is the last of the heavily relied upon mechanics. This one is far more fun in its implementation than the counter system.I recommend this because it can appeal to a wide range of people that may be interested in a hack and slash game. I feel like on easy this could be beaten by a newcomer, making it easy to play, but hard to master in the end. So even veterans of the hack and slash will find it challenging and fun.I'd give it a 7.5/10"

The overall theme is very violent and grim but there are humorous elements here and there. The campaign is very short but there's plenty pf additional challenges to keep you busy. All in all a worthy purchase for any action fan (especially if you like Metal Gear lore). Final verdict: 8.1/10"

The further I got into this game, the better it was.Pros:- Amazing soundtrack really complements the action- Glorious brutal and satisfying over the top combat that makes you feel like bad♥♥♥♥♥once you learn some of the vital combat mechanics.- Some of the best boss designs I encountered in a while- Very cool cutting mechanics that are cleverly used to regain health and in boss encounters, instead of being just another gimmickCons:- Game does not explain you its most vital mechanics (like parry or that you can/should unlock dodge move as soon as possible). It's up to you to experiment or watch a video that explain it better. Being it fairly short game, I recommend watching the video otherwise you may be confused even halfway through the game- Sometimes clunky camera is against you.- Poor controller left stick if you get stun and you have to wiggle it real fast, and often it does not even help you at allEven despite the cons, the game was so much fun. Highly recommended to everyone who likes hack and slash games."

Basicly there are many tutorials and stuff here in guides or at YouTube but you will not learn things like moving while blade mode or what exactly dodging dies and how to trigger it and many other things . Could be better implemented since the ""Tutorial Missions"" are a lot of fun !-- Close to wall combat can sometimes be rly bad due to the camara angle that makes you cry in some bossfights-- Items .. Well well i think the Items made this game some kind of lame at some points and weren't needed . Like throw 5 Granades and Ninja mode everyone to skip a 5 min fight ... Or Health recovery that just sets you to 100% if you are at 0 it makes the game to easy at some points !- George don't want to spoil you buy this guy damn every time i head his voice i was close to hit L2 and mash him into pieces.- Overall the Story isn't rly the strength of this game and since i think the devs know this they could shorten some dialogues .- Well the world is Grey . Not much more to say but some Tropical or Vulcanic stuff would fit well too .- The 2nd Bossfight vs Jetstream Sam took like 2 mins and was just blocking i thought he was one of the strongest :( .- Non skippable Credits .. come on no one watches a 10 mins Name list .Those all are just personal preferences and some little things that have to be changed .++The Fighting mechanics . I thought God of War had decent fights . Never did i know i was so wrong ! At first you jump into the game and think it's simple . But then all of a sudden BOOOOM you discover jumping over enemies combos blocking dodging slicing someone into pieces at the right time and it becomes INTENSE , the respond is perfect and on point , Raiden just does what you say !++The Boss battles ! They are rly entertaining and most are freaking hard ! The last one .... Hell i needed 2 Hours for that !++The learning curve ! You rly see how you are getting stronger as you learn more ! The character becomes Stronger yeah but at the end it's all about you as you approach a boss the 10th Time and see you don't loose 1% at the 1st Stage and Rip him apart ... dat feeling  !+Upgrade and side weapon System : Well you can play as you want and Upgrade yourselfe with weapons or slain enemies .+Different Ways to solve something ! You can sneak and use tools if you want , however the fighting is so nice i always went straight to the face !+Different enemies require different tactics . It's not all just Block and attack ;) !+Costumes ! Well Sombrero .+I thought Raiden was some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ till 1 Part of the Game that changed everything Story and Gameplay wise  !If you are not sure if you want to buy this or not just buy it . Read a Basic guide practise blocking and let the fun beginn ! Don't buy the second Blade if you rly want fun btw ;) ! It Destroys everything !So buy it play it and get infected ."

,Recommended,235460,14288183,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,fenster,"As a long time Metal Gear Solid fan, I was really intrigued by the concept of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.  In many ways, what you see is what you get with Revengeance -- it’s the kind of insane, high octane thrill ride we’ve come to expect from Platinum with Metal Gear tropes and characters crammed in.  Revengeance treads the “over-the-top” line extremely well; despite having a total nonsense story, the characters are surprisingly endearing, the cutscenes are very well produced, and the action is simply a hell of a lot of fun.In Revengeance, you play as Raiden, the main protagonist from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and the cyber ninja from MGS4.  Fans who hated Raiden in MGS2 (and you’re certainly not alone) can take solace in the fact that this is more of the MGS4-style Raiden; Quinton Flynn voices Raiden in a gruff, jaded tone and there is little Rose to speak of.  The story is something about a corporation harvesting brains and a senator fueling a war economy -- truthfully it is even more nonsensical than a normal MGS storyline (which is saying something), but it fits the theme of the overall game well.  Metal Gear Solid fans will find subtle nods to past games and many of the hallmark oddities of the series are present here (see: cardboard boxes).It’s worth mentioning that cutscenes are doneextremelywell, and while voice acting is pretty subpar, there are some standout performances among the group.  The cheesy dialogue classic to the MGS franchise is present in spades, which may be grating for newcomers, but for series fans it is always great to hear.   There are a fair amount of long cutscenes, which I think worked against the game’s momentum at times.  I love MGS cutscenes, but in an intense action game like this, they sometimes killed the pacing of the gameplay.  There is a codec in Revengeance, and while the conversations are interesting enough, I again felt like they killed the pacing a bit.Gameplay itself plays like other Platinum action games -- the focus is on quick reactions to enemy attacks and building combos.  The action is incredibly over-the-top; within the first few minutes of the game you destroy a Metal Gear Ray by slicing it in half, only after running down the side of a building and jumping on rockets in mid-air.  It may be a bit too ridiculous for some, but if you can embrace the crazy, it’s actually pretty amazing.   Occassionally I felt like Revengeance wanted me to really try and be stealthy, but to be honest I think stealth is best left to the Solid series.  The mechanics for stealth aren’t nearly as satisfying in Revengeance and I almost wish they had forgone the option altogether.  Regardless, the parry system is satisfying, boss fights are incredibly epic (mostly), and there is a lot of side content for those who want even more of the combat system after the game is over.Revengeance is relatively short but packs in a lot of side content, including tons of VR missions and two DLC missions (in the Steam version). I’d recommend playing both DLC missions.  The second is definitely the weaker of the two, but I enjoyed both and they provided some longevity to the game.Those looking for a balls-out action game should find themselves very pleased with Revengeance.  The Metal Gear theme is the icing on the cake for longtime fans, but it’s not even remotely necessary to understand the lore to enjoy this game to its fullest.  The action is satisfying, cutscenes are frequently fun to watch, and the craziness is set to full throttle.  Check out this game."

I can't say I'm really suprised; a majority of the publishers are realizing that there's a decent market for PC players. Whether they can create a decent PC port/Game (see the Batman: AA) or fall flat on their face (see dark souls pre mods) is the real question.  Konami/Platinum did a pretty good job!Graphically wise its so-so.  They give you a few options to spruce it up;  1080p (I believe thats the max, correct me if I'm wrong), some AA and better texture quality/filters.  However, I did notice some polygons and poor textures that could only be from its Xbox/PS counter parts.  You can see it from the title screen that its not exactly up to PC standards, but then again this is a beatem up.  Cutscenes suffer from this as well, so don't expect too much of a graphical bump.The most worrisome part of any PC port is how well the developers can manage to translate the controls to PC.  I understand that you can just use your xbox or PS controller, but the mark of a good port should be its translation to keyboard+mouse, other than graphics.  A lot of games have flopped on this; Capcom's RE 4 + 5 were god awful, as was Dark Souls, to the point they were unplayable without a controller.  Thankfully, MGR takes after Batman: Arkham Asylum. A little bit of customization and you are all set to slice and dice your way to victory.The two issues with controls I found in MGR were Blade mode and item use.  I cannot speak for how blade mode runs on a controller, but using the mouse during quicktime blademode events such as Armstrong or Monsoon was frustrating.  Aiming was a bit of a challenge and took some time getting used to how sensitive the blade tracer would act resulted in a few unncessary restarts.  However, I did not seem to have a problem in regular fights for zandatsu hits, so perhaps I just needed some time to adjust.  Using items were a bit of a chore and slowed down the flow of fights, or simply made some points of the game that could be really challenging too easy.  Red Phos/EMPs could be abused to an extreme degree with a combination of ripper mode.Listen to the sound track.  Enjoy the sound track. Be the sound track.Game play is alright.  It's a simplistic.  A little too simplistic.  It comes down to parry everything if u can and offensive defense the rest.  Easy to play, easy to master, which can cut into the replay for some.  Keep in mind, it hasn't stopped me from doing a hard, very hard, and soon a Revengence run.  It is a fun game, it's just that its dumbed down compared to what you'd expect from this kind of game.  DMC veterans might be a little disappointed that its pretty bland, but I found the combination of techniques, weapons, and other items to make up for this bit of lacking.  Others may not see past it, which I will sympathize with, but give it a chance and on Revengence mode you will start to get frustrated.I'll give it a thumbs up for now.  There will be points where you will scream KOOOOOOOOOJJJJJJJJJJIMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAA, but enjoy it for what it is."

Wonderful, wonderful tracks to suit the action.-The parry system sits on a different level from usual dodging or blocking in hack 'n' slash titles, rewarding skillful defense with offensive opportunities.-The Blade Mode gimmick remains fun to use and doesn't overpower regular swordplay.-There is 'a' stealth mechanic, but it isn't very strong or even necessary.

,Recommended,235460,27565982,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,ABG,"“RULES OF NATURE!!!And they run when the sun comes up,With their hearts on the line,For a while,GOTTA FOLLOW THE LAWS OF THE WILD!!!”- Jamie Christopherson, Rules of Nature(2013)Metal Gear Rising: Revengeanceis a hack-and-slash spectacle fighter spinoff from the Metal Gear series developed by PlatinumGames, previously most well-known for Bayonetta. You play as Raiden, cyborg ninja working for Maverick PMC. When the Prime Minister Raiden is protecting is assassinated by rival PMC Desperado, he goes on a quest for revengeance (I’m pretty sure that isn’t even a real word), uncovering a political conspiracy as he does so.Story:First off, it should be noted that MGR  can be played without any knowledge of the story of the previousMetal Geargames, no Metal Gear lore knowledge is required. Apart from minor references, the games story is completely separate to the Metal Gear continuity.Metal Gear has always been a cheesy series mixed with political and social commentary, and MGR is no different. Themes of transhumanism, child soldiers, AI rights, political corruption and memes (not internet memes, but actual memes) are explored throughout the story. In a certain way, MGR parodies the seriousness of the main series, and when looked at from this perspective, I couldn’t help but revel in it. It’s hard not to laugh when Raiden shouts out in frustration “Why won’t you DIE!?” at a boss character, then for said boss character to laugh and reply“NANOMACHINES SON.”When nanomachines conveniently explain everything in the Metal Gear universe, you can’t help but feel the story is one giant satire of the over-the-top ridiculous premise of the whole series.A weakness of the story lies in the way it's told. Much of the character development and lore is hidden, being only accessible by listening to the codec conversations. Because of this the story can be pretty short, possibly clocking in at around 6-8 hours depending on your skill. I’d highly recommend stopping and listening to the codec conversation between every fight as characters always have something new to say, and help fill in the backstory and context of the game. Listening to the codecs extended the main story to around 11 hours for me, so I’d suggest doing that.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=805234208Gameplay:MGR is sheer over the top ridiculousness, then taken to 11. You will parry a sword 10 times your height, lift up the Metal Gear 20 times your height, then slice its sword arm off. You will jump from missile to missile as that said Metal Gear fires at you while retreating, then get thrown into a clock tower, then run vertically down that clock tower while dodging more missiles, and then bisect the Metal Gear. And that’s just the first boss fight. Words can hardly describe the sheer ridiculousness of this game, it is a game you have to play to “get.”The core gameplay has you fighting with a katana using a variety of light and heavy attacks which can be mixed together to make special combos. What separates MGR from other 3rd person action melee games is the Blade Mode mechanic. When utilizing Blade Mode the game goes into slow motion, and you are able to make precise cuts with your katana. Blade Mode is used to replenish health and energy as well as taking out heavy enemy types by cutting off limbs and armor when enough damage is done to incapacitate them. It’s by far one of the most satisfying gameplay mechanics ever made and I’m surprised no other game has tried to copy it yet. It’s one of the few games I’ve played where using a sword actually feels like using a sword, not a blunt stick. Unsurprisingly, slashing a man’s arm off, kicking him in the air, cutting him in half from head to groin and then then cutting those half pieces into another half never gets old.By far the highlight of the game is the boss fights. Every fight is memorable and unique, with each boss using unique gameplay mechanics which test your skill. The bosses are suitably difficult, and are extremely satisfying to play. To this day, I still boot up the game at least once a month to do a boss rush when I need a hit of adrenaline. You just can’t beat the awesomeness of that Monsoon fight.“Memes, the DNA of the soul.”On a side note, I highly recommend playing with a controller. Though you can play with a keyboard and mouse (I’ve managed to complete all boss fights with no damage taken on hard without a controller), the game strongly favours the use of a controller. The movement and camera controls can be extremely awkward, and some fights in the game require precision accuracy with Blade Mode which is best done with a controller.For another short tip, I’d also recommend learning how to use parry properly, being your main defence. Nearly every attack can be parried, and the sooner you learn to master parrying enemy attacks, the better time you’ll have. Along with this, I’d also recommend getting the dodge move (defensive offence) ASAP, which can be used to dodge attacks which cannot be parried.MGRisn’t a hard game, but is punishing if you don’t bother to learn the core gameplay mechanics. The game rewards learning enemy attack patterns and countering them with perfect timing with parries and utilizing your own combos, making for an extremely satisfying gameplay loop.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=805235006Graphics and art style:Hideo Kojima stated in an interview that the aim was to getMGRrunning at minimum 60 fps across all platforms. Unfortunately, all platforms included the dated PS3 and Xbox 360 and its fairly clear that sacrifices had to be made in the graphically quality of the game in order to achieve 60 fps on potato machines. The graphics don’t look bad by any stretch, they just look fairly ordinary when up close. Characters have particularly cool designs, notably the main bosses. All in all, it’s a plain looking game where the graphics aren’t going to win any awards. On the up side, this means even the most average PC doesn’t have much difficulty playing the game on the highest graphics settings.Soundtrack and audio:It’s over the top, it’s somewhat cheesy and it’s ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME. The soundtrack is made of a mix speed metal and electronic music that match the crazy action that’s playing in game, and every song has its own identity when played with songs unique to every boss fight. You can’t play help but hearRules of Naturewhen thinking of the Metal Gear RAY boss, or hearing the piano tune backing the chorus inA Stranger I Remainwhile fighting Mistral, or the pseudo DragonForce guitar riffs and drumming inThe Stains of Timewhen confronting Monsoon, or the sheer epicness ofCollective ConsciousnessandIt Has to Be This Waytwo-parter when facing the final boss in a 30 minute epic ending. Every song takes its own meaning when the lyrics kick in, and each song matches every fight perfectly.With a script and story so ridiculous it plays out like a B movie, it would have been easy for the voice acting to be cringeworthy, but somehow every VA pulls off their roll. Raiden’s voice and dialogue suit his character perfectly, being so over-the-top the game almost tries too hard to make him a badass, but somehow it works. Monsoon is the absolute caricature of an anime villain, and his voice is so ridiculous it matches him perfectly. As for Senator Steven Armstrong, I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone pull off the cheesiest dialogue with such conviction. “Don’t ♥♥♥♥ with this senator.”Conclusion:Metal Gear Rising: Revengeanceis over-the-top, ridiculous, cheesy and fun as hell. With some of the most satisfying melee action combat and a great soundtrack, the game is pure joy."

They have a great stylistic attention and focus on the visceral joy that too many games don't have time for, but on the other hand, they don't seem aware of some pretty core design principles.I feel like this game is the epitome of that problem of theirs.Everything Revengeance does really really well is countered by something it does really really terribly.The game is about swordplay, so they chose not to give you a dodge mechanic and instead focus on parrying.-Oh cool!But Hack'n'Slash games are usually dependant on dodging in order to escape those pesky enemies looking to interrupt your combos.-Oh dear...So they did away with locking onto opponents so you can better keep an eye on the enemies that surround you.-Oh cool!But they gave you a more zoomed in, slightly over-the-shoulder type of view, mitigating your ability to see an enemy running up to kick you in the back until it's too late to stop them.-Oh dear...Platinum was aware that their story is pathetic to an [I'm convinced] self aware degree, and that that's okay because nobody's here for the plot.-Oh cool!So then why does the game interrupt your fun every 20 ♥♥♥♥ing seconds with pointless phone calls and poorly written cutscenes that drag on for minutes at a time?-Oh dear...Platinum understands that the fun of the Hack'n'Slash genre is to throw a bunch of foes at you and just let you have your way with them.-Oh cool!Or maybe they don't, because they put the breaks on frequently so you can fulfil some fidgety quick time event when all you wanted to do was finish them off the old fashioned way but the game says Nooooooo!-Oh dear...The whole game is like that. Dynamite core game play, but too many mishandled mechanics getting in the way leading to a boring and frustrating experience. The camera, the parrying, the enemy design and behavior, all of these things are awesome on their own but were designed with no thought given to how they function in relation to all the other mechanics in the game.It's just a mess! A mess of awesome little things trying their very hardest to be awesome but just getting in eachothers way.edit: Turns out there is a dodge move and lock on, the game just never tells you. That's another problem with this game, it never tells you anything. Hidden items late in the game unlock tutorials for the most basic of gameplay which I would have liked access to HOURS ago!

Everything in this game should be attacked, repeatedly, and from multiple angles. As this is an action game, it's filled with enemies who attack the player relentlessly. In most action games the proper course of action would be to avoid their attacks. But not in MGR:R. Instead, attack their attacks.Zandatsu is a special move that slows down time for everything except the player's attack. It allows dozens of attacks to be performed in the time it would normally take to attack once. That is MGR:R distilled.MGR:R is almost the perfect game. It has one minor flaw. There are some switches in the game that are manipulated by hitting the B button (that is on the Xbox controller; there may be other ways to play the game but I'm not willing to experiment.)

Well... for once the overall length of the game, its pretty short and some of its sections feel way too automated and scripted which isn't a bad thing at all but it just drags after you are used to it and you feel very much like skipping the whole cutscenes and just jump straight into the fast gameplay.I just wish this game would have been at least 6 hours longer lets say have around 20 missions like a Devil May Cry game and I would score this game as high up there with Ninja Gaiden Black and the awesome Devil May Cry 3.What I absolutely love about it thou is its overall presentation, I think Platinum never delivered a bad game so far because none of their previous games were bad and with that I mean Bayonetta and Vanquish of course.Please Platinum keep up the very good work you do because those guys can honestly make a solid hack and slash game as proven before, but I hope they will add a lil bit more depth to their stories and cut back on the over the top cheese xD but I am fine with this game except for the gamelength this gets a very solid 9/10"

There's a great level of customization and replaying the game on higher difficulties yields a number of satisfying rewards. The combat is fluid, slick and somehow feels quite classy on both the player's side and the side of the bosses. And those bosses! Those guys are both challenging, yet enjoyable to fight.

From the adrenaline pumped precision blade combat down to the soundtrack for the game, especially during major boss fights where the rock infused music just hits crescendos and flourishes with the action of the fight, this game is full of exciting fights. I just finished my 2nd runthrough on hard writing this and am going to be going onto even more playthroughs.A few of the small points and issues I had regarding the game first starts with the parry system. Parrying is mapped to pressing in the direction of the incoming attack + light attack. It works, though I think would be better if it was mapped to it's own dedicated key since there can be those moments where you try to parry but end up running forward and swinging. Also the parry system in general feels a bit too forgiving. Once you find out how to essentially spam parry, it makes it a lot easier to survive, so I feel like the parry frames could be tightened up a bit. This isn't to say that you can't make it challenging however since you can perform a parry + counter by parrying during just frames(last possible moment) before the incoming attack lands. Also, the targeting system can really leaves something to be desired, namely  just being able to cycle between the targets you lock onto.Although a short game (~5-6 hours worth of in game gameplay time not including any continues or cutscenes), the replayability factor is definitely there just due to the addictingly good gameplay. The story isn't as thorough or developed like a MGS title due to the length of the game, but it is still there taking many references following MGS4 and is engaging enough if you just take the time to keep following up with the codec conversations. The final boss is actually a fight worthy of being a final boss fight as well, not a pushover like in some games.This game is a definite must for any action game enthusiast out there. That feeling of being empowered and just being able to go HAM on everything is just so satisfying. I highly recommend it."

And while there are some glicthes (It may be do to me using an AMD 7700 card on my machine. Upgrading to an Nvidia Geforce GTX760 later this week to see if it helps improve things), it does not take away from the game for me. The camera can be a little bit of an issue at times, but it's not bad enough that you toss your controller down and rage quit (Think of the camera issues with the original Fable came with instead of the camera angles for X-Men Destiny *shivers*. It's not a game breaker, but could be better in some areas) .I am still having a great time slicing and dicing my way through this Metal Gear Solid stand-alone. I can only hope Konami and Platinum continues this series or perhaps gives us the option to have the Japanese Voice pack for this one at some point. It's a fun game, it contains jokes and easter eggs from previous MGS games, and is a good time despite the minor issues.

One fun mechanic of the game is that you can press LT (I use an XBox 360 controller) to stand stationary while using the right control stick to slash with the katana in any direction you want at rapid speeds. There are points in combat where time slows down when you do this, letting you literally dice your enemies into bits.This game is as brutal and campy as they come, but that's why it's so amazing.

Come to think of it, Why is that underwhelming? This game isn't a reboot or a remake! The usual Metal Gear Solid will still be made with the their classic stealth mechanic so... Why complain about how this game isn't fully based on stealth?Anyway, I'm getting offtrack, This game is a Hack 'n Slash (Or in other words, a Beat 'em Up with swords) where you play as Raiden... Who I honestly don't know what was his portrayment in the original saga, but I must admit, after playing the game, this game obtained my approval, I like this character, However, the plot in the game is... confusing... Never the less, I'd still say it's a good plot, not one of the best you've ever seen, but at least it bring us something entertaining unlike other games who just throw us the first thing they got in mind, oh! And I really have to mention the soundtrack! It's awesome!! Comepletly, over all the tracks from the bosses, They give us some great rock you just can't stop hearing.Now to the gameplay itself, it's actually being a long time since I enjoyed a Beat 'em... Ahem... I mean, a Hack 'n Slash game like this (Seriously? Why have two names for two genres of games that are basically the same thing?) the controls feel good althought you're gonna have a lot of trouble with the fact that attacking and parring are in the same freaking button! At first that simply annoys you, but after playing it I must say, I think it kind of made the game better, it gave it challenge, and it's not that hard to differenciate one action from the other, the game also has the blade mode, where time goes slower and you remain still to give a lot of cuts to the enemies that tear them to pieces, it's pretty fun cutting somebody in over five hundred shreds, you should try that out!In the end, a great game!

On one side I absolutely adore the art-style. These cyborgs and mechs just look awesome. The game is very fast and you'll come to visit many different countries. The story is ok and the fight-system is smooth and appealing.On the other side all environments look pretty much the same. There are no special missions and you're doing pretty much the same all the time. The sequences where you should be the silent assassins are dumb (hiding under cardboxes and barrels) and fighting will always work out too.The most annoying thing about this game is the ""block & parry system"", which - in my case - never worked as I wanted it to be. I know that you have to block (press attack) a second after the enemies eyes flash red, while pushing the analog-stick in die right direction. I suppose the XBox-360-Controller is not exact enough, but it only worked in 25% of the incoming attacks. The developers should have implemented a better system here, in order of having me fully satisfied.The boss-fights could have been very interesting, but especially the last one (including a very very very very long and boring dialog) is dull and uninspired. The dialogues in particular are too long. After a while - despite my usual playstyle of seeing and experiencing everything there is within a game - I also did not pursued the optional radiomessages from your teammembers.All in all I would give this game a 6,5 out of 10. It depends a) on wether or not you can master the blocking-system, b) you like the eastern style and dialogs and c) the prize you've paid for this game (cost/effiency)."

It's a fast paced action, hack and slash game where you play as a super cyborg ninja, Raiden. The game can be very challenging at times, especially if you haven't learned to parry properly, but holy crap is the combat satisfying. Being able to feel the raw impact of your attacks and then just cutting enemies to pieces is so much fun. This game also probably has one of the best soundtracks EVER!!! It's easily in my top 5 game soundtracks of all time, and it makes the combat that much more enjoyable. There are a couple of criticisms that I have though. For one, the game is actually quite short for what it is, so don't expect an epic, in depth experience. The story is also kind of stupid in my honest opinion. The characters can also be quite ridiculous at times, although I think that at least was intended for the most part, and for some of them at least, it lends to their charm. This is all easliy overlooked though by what the game does well, and the fact that you can always get it for a pretty reasonable price. I think it was around $30 on release, and it has been on sale numerous times since then, so if you wait for a sale you could probably get it for less than half of that.Bottom line, this is an awesome game with fast-paced, satisfying, and challenging combat that in my opinion more than delivers. If you love games that let you just evicerate your enemies and doesn't take itself seriously at all, for crying out loud, GET THIS GAME!!"

It does a great ob at showing you the other side of war, that people tend to overlook. That, mixed with the japanese perception of american culture, make for a serious, but still hilarious at moments, story.Gameplay:You're a cyborg with ninja skills and a big♥♥♥♥♥katana, what else can you wish for? Very solid mechanics and you'll feel like a badass everytime you chop up several enemies in one combo.Voice acting is great, Music is awesome and everything looks ande sounds very refined.The only problems i have with this game are:The platforming (in this case auto platforming), is very clunky and can screw you over in a stealth mission, or make you redo a jump, just because you released the sprint button a little, or your character didn't land correctly.The boss fights are amazing. They are varied, and you never feel like you're fighting the same boss. That being said, if you don't learn how to parry (which can be tricky, since the game doesn't explain it very well), you're gonna have a bad time. All bosses REQUIRE you to parry their attacks for you to do any damage to them without getting countered for a lot of damage. So take your time to learn how to parry, it isn't that hard.Lastly, the campaign is a little short, it took me 6 hours to complete the game, while i'm not the best player at this and it took me a few (i think 17) retries throughout the game. Last boss alone took me an hour, so don't forget to take health packs for him or you'll be pulling your hair out!Despite these minor flaws, I definitely recommend this game for everybody to play! Not many games can give you the feeling of badassery that this game will give you."

Characters lacking...character.The graphics are not bad but the textures are really lacking for a PC-port.Overall an incredibly fun game to play and look at with the high-speed action going on.

The game itself is hard and you will get punished. But when you pull it off, it's highly rewarding. The music is face melting. Every bosses has their own theme songs. During the fights, the song will play without lyrics. When you trigger key events, you will hear lyrics and boy... You will be pumped. Mash those buttons! The bosses will destroy you, that's a fact. This game also contains the most badass final boss of all time (seriously, the battle last 30 minutes with cutscenes) The port from console to PC is perfect, no issues though use a controller for your sanity' sake. Also, it contains all the DLC!Though, this game is not perfect. The story is very short. A single playthrough will give you merely 3h30 - 4h of gameplay (without cutscenes) but the replay value is high. The game will stop you often. You will receive codecs transmissions very often and it breaks the flow of the game. The secondary weapons are useless, keep your blades for strong attacks combo. Credits will go for around 25 minutes (I am not kidding) and there is a small cutscene afterwards. Leave the credit go and watch the cutscene on YouTube.Finally, the story is heavily based on MGS4: Gun of Patriots. I highly suggest that you read briefly on the events on the Fall of the Patriots.

,Recommended,235460,12643028,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,AlloyMorph,"What there is to love about this game:- Cutting EVERYTHING to ribbons and watching as your CPU tries to properly calculate where all those physics objects you just created should be.- Spectacle Fighter combos that both look badass in their own right and make callbacks to Cyborg-Ninja-Raiden's first appearance in MGS4. You want to suplex a Metal Gear? You can. You want to slash a bunch of gunmen up with a sword you're holding with your foot? You can. You want to ambush some unsuspecting guards by climbing inside a barrel and rolling at them? It's not optimal but DO IT ANYWAY 'CAUSE YOU CAN!- The most ridiculous Metal Gear ever written that is simultaneously more self-aware of its own absurdity than any of it's predecessors.- The best boss fights I've ever experienced in any game, hands-down. Hard as nails, but satisfying like nothing else once you master them. If you're not experienced with Spectacle Fighters, I recommend buying the White Armor body as soon as you can because you'll die a LOT if you don't know what you're doing.- An iconic soundtrack that will get you STOKED for the action that unfolds on-screen.- Huge replayability. Like every other title by Platinum Games, you don't really ""beat"" the game until you've attained the maximum rank for each of the fights. Combined with huge amounts of collectibles, ""secret"" fights that you have to backtrack at times in order to find and two bonus difficulty modes that only unlock once you beat the game on the hardest available difficulty, there is plenty of pull to keep coming back to this one after your first time.What this game could disappoint you with:- Controller is a must. The PC port is functional, *except* for proper mouse support: you can't bind more than the standard Left, Middle, Right buttons to anything and there appears to be negative cursor acceleration that becomes very obvious when in Blade Mode (how you make presicion cuts). On top of that, parrying is finnicky with the keyboard because it requires you to press the movement key that is facing the enemy about to hit you; easy with an analog stick but far more limiting when done with 8-way digital movement.- The game has a difficult time explaining itself to you; the initial VR tutorial only covers 4 mechanics that the prologue level teaches you anyway and many of the subtleties are never shown to you at all. I recommend watching Chip Cheezum's How to Play guide for this game, else you may find yourself very frustrated with something that you don't understand.http://youtu.be/C7IlIUKP64o- The level design is adaquate at best and uninspired at worst, though this is somewhat limited by the Metal Gear mythos. And though it technically isn't completely linear (as many collectibles are found in dead-ends that branch slighttly from the main path) your chances for exploration will be very limited.- The main story only has a duration of 5 hours give or take, and unless you go through all the codecs to hear what Raiden is saying to his crew between setpieces you won't find a lot of the complexity that Solid presents.- The cutscenes are lower-resolution than the gameplay and run at 30 FPS, which when going from a smooth in-game 60 can be a bit jarring. On top of that they are also uncompressed; meaning that out of the 25GB space the download takes up, only 2GB or so make up the actual game.Recommended: The guys behind this game made Bayonetta, and the director of this game was the director of Viewtiful Joe.

,Recommended,235460,10977650,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Atlas 141,"A truly fantastic game that is nothing short of playing a really kick♥♥♥♥♥action movie.Story: 8/10Having no prior knowledge of Metal Gear, or indeed the Raiden storyline, I really had little idea what was going on or why. There's no real explanation of events (or Raiden's past) which is a little frustrating, but you kind of piece it together as the missions progress. This is the only weak point however, as the rest of the story is engaging, immersive, and at times humorous. The good thing about the humour is that it so well placed and done so well that it fits perfectly with the serious overtones.This is an over-the-top game, but if you weren't aware of that prior to buying, you've really only yourself to blame. It's a cyber ninja fitting giant kaiju mechs, it has to be anime-epic. For me, at least, it never got too silly and never got too serious. It straddled the balance perfectly and it was a wholly enjoyable experience.The game does have an ending, and I was mostly satisfied with it. There was a bit of sequel baiting at the end, but with enough attention focused during the main story you piece together Raiden's post-game activities. Which do occur after lengthy credits.Gameplay: 9/10There is no 'real' tutorial mode wherein you get taught how to combine moves, or what certain mixes create. Sure you get told such a button does this etc, but it's far from exhaustive. It's a quick 3 minute tutorial then you're in, fighting for your life. At first it's a bit disabling, but in the long run I think it's actually a small piece of genius. You develop your own style of fighting and, with the multiple combinations available, you really do come into your own.However, at times, unless you're used to a game like this, you struggle to understand what's required at times or how you're supposed to do something in the intended way. But, whilst occasionally frustrating, you quickly overcome this hurdle and in the end I enjoyed this extra layer of difficulty.Overall the combat is fluid, fun, and feels right. By the final boss fight you're on a totally different level to where you began. The progressive combat system is extremely natural, by which I mean, you become more skilled through practice - not because you're dumping points into a skill tree. For this type of game, it's really rewarding when you master parrying or offensive dodges rather than relying on passive feats to coax you through.I played through on hard (there's other difficulties?) because I see no reason to play on easier modes. And from this I can say that the game can be difficult, and, at times, almost frustrating. But, that's what you want, a challenge. Something that isn't afraid to slap you around a few times and say ""hey, you're failing because you're not doing it correctly enough times in a row. It's not my fault you can't parry/dodge"". And MGR:R does that in spades, at times it will just hold you back and force you into really difficult battles. However, I never felt like i was being /unfairly/ challenged. I was failing because I wasn't doing it right.And it was always rewarding to overcome a fight that I'd been struggling on, especially when you get the S-rank.Conclusion: 8/10The game is kick♥♥♥♥♥ It's a total action-movie-type-game, and whilst i'm not a person that generally goes for those kind of games, this was a real blast and is a shining example of someone that's done it right. I even enjoyed the voice-acting, which some might class it as over the top, but it's meant to be in this kind of game. After the first mission I loved Raiden's voice, especially when he's angry.Aside from the main story there's really nothing more to the game. The 'VR Mode' outside of the story is mostly just random challenges in a VR setting. They're only okay, it's a shame there wasn't an arcade mode or something, or even a 'waves' mode.This is well worth picking up when on sale, or even at full retail price. It took me roughly 14 hours on hard difficulty to complete; on easy you could probably blast it in just under 10. It's not a full priced game like so many are now, and the value/quality is well worth the full price of 20 pounds. There is also a lot of replayability, mostly because by the end you look back at your mission grade sheet and think ""lol can't believe I got a C on that... Time to fix it"". There's also extra difficulty modes which just raise the game to a whole other level.Highly recommend due to satisfying and engaging gameplay, story, and humour."

I like the MGS series, maybe not as much as the die hard fans but when ever I played them I always seem to spend most of my time in the VR missions playing as FOX or Raiden since I am more into those two characters and their fighting style. With that said the MGS series is full of very interesting characters and has some of the most awesome war/comedic plots I have ever seen in my life. Any MGS fan should definitiley give this game a go.As you can see Im writing this review withought finishing the game but I just felt like I had to touch up on a few things just incase anyone in my friends list seen me playing this game and was on the fence with this one. Like almost any game out there this game has its flaws like. At times the plot takes a twist into the awesome teretory with its comedy, like those moments when you are on the radio with someone just like in any other MGS game and you see characters interacting with each other, it brings life to the game in many ways and you start caring for the characters, its cool! there is a ton of dialogue and its all well put together, its like whatching real people have conversations.  At times it can feel like you're going from point A to point B with the levels (which is what you will mostly be doing) but being able to interact with the world a bit by slicing things keeps the fun going and its awesome how you can custom Raiden's looks and weapons. ( I love the FOX suit!! *fan boy scream*)Now for the gameplay, Its good! really fun!! and next to the dialogues its the second best thing in the game. Its such a satisfying feeling to be able to not only control where your blade goes, but also to have control over the speed of the gameplay as you switch from fast paced action to slow motion with the simple hit of a button to cut targets precisely how you want to cut them. The animations are superb as you slice your foes into bits (I sound like a sicko hu? lol) and anything else from cars, tanks, boxes, fruits, helicopters and much more.. even beautiful female foes :[ :DBoss fights are top notch and fun but the game could go without the QTEs during these fights if you ask me. The VR missions which are playable at anytime will give the game some replay value.The presentation in this game is awesome, nothing beats being a Cyborg Ninja in a battle field in the world of MGS.. Raiden looks hawt. Character designs are out of this world crazy and the music is cool, a mix of action movie style themes with some metal. Enemies spand from cyborgs, Geckos, helicopters, a robotic wolf, tanks,  an awesome samurai like cyborg and much more.On the Cyborg Ninja scale, I give this game an 9/10. Kojima did good by giving this one to Platinum games, I cant picture anyone else doing anything better but hey.. feel free to surprize me Mr. Kojima."

76561197999274600,Recommended,235460,11503971,"Posted: 1 August, 2014",all,Toft,"Updated 8/2/14: I realized you can upgrade your weapons and it made the game a LOT more enjoyable and fun. However, VR missions which take away your upgrades is still not fun.Great game. Action-packed and cool fight scenes and boss battles make this game really worthwhile. There are a bunch of flaws in the game though. Raiden starts off as this wimpy little cyborg at the beginning of the game, but by the end, you'll end up pimping him out so hard that you will barely recognize him after you've turned him into a racist mexican-hater. Costumes, life, Zanbatsu meter upgrades are self-explanatory.Finding out how to use the damn moves you just bought is not. There is no combo list so you'll just have to spam the buttons until you get lucky and try to recreate the cool♥♥♥♥♥combo you just did if you want to learn and expand your moves (spoiler: try holding left click, pausing between attacks, mixing left-click and right-clilck). The problem with this game is that they barely explain any of the mechanics of how the game works after you play the tutorial that vaguely tells you how to do the most important move in the game: the parry. The game says: move in the direction of the attack and left-click. What does that mean? The direction of the attacker? What if an enemy in front of me does a roundhouse kick that comes at me from my right? The game actually means from the direction of the attacker but you have to learn this yourself after fighting the giant mooing bipedal tank that does roundhouse kicks. Side note: when you play this game, try not to hold the move direction while you are attacking or this will mess up your parries--instead just walk up close to the enemy and from there only use the direction buttons if you want to parry.On the topic of parries, the game is also VERY parry focused on the later levels and harder levels. The AI is pretty advanced in this game, as in you can still be attacked mid-Zanbatsu execution unlike in games like God Of War or Darksiders where everyone just takes a coffee break and lets you finish before they start fighting again. The AI is ruthless in this game. In the later levels, practically all your enemies have armor and/or attack you in groups. What I mean by that is everyone GANG♥♥♥♥S you. One guy will perform his attack combo so you parry it all, only for the guy next to him to do his combo, which gives the first guy time to do his combo again, forcing you to parry until you get pushed to a wall and hope to God you accicdentally do a perfect parry for an instakill.Pretty much all the AI in the game fights this way. They will cover each other and stop you from attacking one of its members by launching coordinated attacks so you wont be able to do anything but parry all day. Needless to say, if you haven't mastered parrying at this point, you will get pwned really really hard since there's almost never a safe chance to attack, especially against groups of armored moo moos, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s wearing sword-proof armor, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with rocket launchers, and giant silverback gorrila cyborgs that beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Note: Later on in the game you unlock Ripper mode which helps you deal with armor, but it's really hard to build the meter for it if all you can do is parry while the enemy block locks you. Also, I didn't buy any of the boss weapons which COULD help dealing with armored enemies easier.IF you want to go pro, you can try parrying at the last second, Raiden will dizzy the enemy and do an instakill animation, which is pretty much the only way to deal with mobs of armored ♥♥♥♥♥♥s that want to skull♥♥♥♥ you. The combat in this game isn't so much about learning effective combos, but about playing really lame and learning the enemy's attack pattern so you can actually get in a few safe hits.Boss fights are really fun but some of them can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and some are just hilarious. They will most likely kick your♥♥♥♥♥the first time you fight them. I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off when Sundowner (a boss who is really easy to parry) taunts you into hitting his explosive shield only to have Raiden walk around his shield and stab that ♥♥♥♥er in the back. Slickstream Sam's fight takes lots of patience and Armstrong is the cheapest boss since Shao Khan in MK9. All are really fun once you learn their patterns and ♥♥♥♥♥slap them and teabag their chopped up pieces later.In conclusion, game is fun but be prepared to either a) learn the game by yourself since the game doesnt tell you♥♥♥♥♥♥or b) say ♥♥♥♥ all of that google all that♥♥♥♥♥♥online. The combat is fun but in the later levels with mobs of well-coordinated AI that do tons of damage and cover each other's asses, sometimes I think the developers should have just given Raiden a shield because that's pretty much what you'll be doing the whole time. If you like cutting your enemies into so many tiny bloody pieces it makes the SAW movies look like it was made for little girls, if you like a good story, and if you like spamming the parry button all game because you are cheap and you thought the samurai sword was way cooler than the other weapons--This game could be for you!"

Is its combat as deep and intricate as DMC3/4 or Bayonetta? Not even close. Is the story 2deep like the other Metal Gear games? Hell no. But considering the small time frame Platinum was given to make this game after KojiPro screwed up, this is a very solid game. If you haven't learned parrying by the first real boss, Bladewolf, he'll punish you pretty severely. He's a wake up call to what's to come. The block/parrying system is very exploitable though and many small encounters can easily be won by blocking and counter-attacking. The length of the game is also a problem, on average, a total playthrough can range from 5-8 hours. This isn't as big as a problem as it sounds as there are many easter eggs, weapons, and new techniques to learn so replayability helps.Is this a perfect game?No.Could there have been a few improvements to combat and game length?Yes.So that's why I'm giving it a 7.5/10, although it's still GOTY 2013 for me as it was refreshing from the same TACTICAL DESERT WARFARE SIMULATOR 23"

For 7.49$ on at 75% off this game is worth it. Game is short but has a decent enough combat system that it will take a bit to learn how to effectivly get through the game without constantly dieing.

,Recommended,235460,15473079,"Posted: 20 April, 2015",all,Regaccio,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengance is a fast-paced action game that is easy to get into, but difficult to master. It has many cinematic cutscenes and QTEs, but there is no lack of good gameplay here. The game balances gory action with trademark Metal Gear stealth gameplay for a good open-ended feel, that lets the player decide how they want to progress.Overall, I'd say this is an example of a ""cinematic"" game done right: the cutscenes make the battles themselves seem that much more titanic in nature. With the DLC and VR missions, this game will keep you entertained for a while, even though the main story may feel a bit short. I would recommend this game.Pros:- Great story and writing, entertaining characters- Good Difficulty balance: Easy mode is easy, Hard mode is actually challenging, etc.- Good learning curve: the beginning of the game is a bit forgiving, and the final boss fight is incredibly hard- Awesome soundtrack, good use of vocals during intense moments- QTEs and cutscenes do not detract from the gameplay- Open-ended gameplay: choose a more stealthy approach, or be Jack the Ripper if you want- Lots of collectables and some extra content- Good graphic fidelity and stellar designCons:- Main story left me wanting more; I wish it was longer- DLC content was fairly short as well- No Wiimote support, I wanted to slice things apart for realThings to note:- While there are many segments that can be approached stealthily, this is not strictly a stealth game; there are numerous instances of forced combat. If you're looking for a game primarily based in stealth, in the vein of Deus Ex, this is not it. Also, if you're expecting a shooter because you saw ""Metal Gear"", watch some gameplay; this game is primarily about swordfighting.- This game may be too difficult at times to beat without having to retry over and over again, in order to learn attack patterns and get better. If you tend to ragequit when you can't beat a difficult part of a game, you may want to think twice about playing this one."

If you have played any Devil May Cry games, you'll be in known grounds here as this is a heavy melee action game with a decent and engaging plot.You play as Raiden and after a failed mission in the introduction, you're all out for revenge!Graphically speaking, MGR: Revengeance is impressive! Voice acting and music are top notch. Gameplay is really outstanding once you master the controls and mechanics of Raiden.My gripes with this game was mainly the camera. It jerks and reposition weirdly enough in opposite views of where you are facing. Very irritating! And the auto-center wasn't helping either! I would've loved a function to deactivate this big annoyance and sadly, you cannot. However, when you crank up the sensitivity of the camera to the max, it seems more manageable and less frustrating.PROS:+Revengeance on PC includes all consoles DLC. Includes 50 challenging virtual reality side missions and a few alternate costumes for Raiden.+Killer visuals and graphics.+Energetic and engaging music.+Addictive and fun hack-and-slash swordplay gameplay. You really feel like a bad@ss in this game!+Gameplay mechanics are solid. I played with the Xbox One gamepad and the controls were fine and surely more appropriate than Keyboard + Mouse, for an action game like this.+Decent story and almost reminiscent of today's world problems.+High replay value if you seek to unlock every upgrades and unlocks... and there's many collectibles as well! Rising is a short action game but to be expected! It can be beat in under 8 hours on Easy mode and surelly longer on Normal and Hard.+Challenging game for those seeking hard gameplay. Maybe too challenging at times? I suggest to start at easy first!+Ability to replay audio codecs and cutscenes in the game menu.CONS:-Auto-center and unreliable camera, many interruptions during regular gameplay but worse in boss fights. I have found somekind of a fix and it is to crank the sensitivity to the max. It was more bearable that way and I advice anyone playing this game to give it a shot!-Many difficulty spikes; especially at the beginning. I'd advice any newcomer to start the game at Normal and even at Easy. Get the feel of the game and you'll see if it's hard enough for you!-Lack of game options. No way to lower down or even turn off the music. At times, you can't hear properly what is being said in conversations so have subtitles activated! Also, you can't change the difficulty setting once you have begun the campaign; you have to restart another game.RECOMMENDATION:I recommend this game highly to every gamer who enjoy hack-and-slash action type of game. Even if you're a newcomer in the Metal Gear franchise, you won't really miss much as Rising offers its own spinoff and hopefully, its own franchise set apart of Metal Gear Solid. The game might not be perfect but if you can get past the quirky camera and difficulty spikes, you'll enjoy Revengeance very much!RATING:8.0 / 10"

It takes place in the over-the-top world of Metal Gear and since its Japanese it doesn't make a lot of sense a lot of the time but its fun.  It does have a bit of a learning curve and at first I found it quite difficult.  Learning the combat is tough and the camera doesn't help as it is constantly switching all over the place.  There are many upgrades and weapons that you will acquire and using the point system you can buy them to get better equiped.  And the cardboard box has returned as a usable object.  For the price I really can't see passing this up if you like this kind of game.Update:  This is another Capcom game that I get all the way to the end and I can't beat the boss.  I think this will be my last Capcom game.  Really precise timing and button combos are a very Japanese norm in games and Capcom makes a lot of these type of games.  I just don't have the patience anymore to sit around fighting a boss for hours on end to get the timing right.  The fight alone will take you around 10-20 minutes and every death is a complete restart.  Cool game, but too much of a commitment on my part to create muscle memory."

It’s all killer, no filler, with more than enough incentive for repeat play-throughs.The most consistent issue in Rising is its cutscenes. To its credit, you’re rarely made to watch what you’d rather play, but the story bits, interesting though they are for fans, ultimately intrude on the fast-paced flow of combat.Despite its best efforts, developer Platinum Games sometimes gets in the way of its own pace -- especially for those who aren’t into the franchise. However, Rising’s troubles are rarely enough to derail the incredible momentum of an always-entertaining, action-oriented Metal Gear spinoff.

The story is just as dumb but easier to understand than most other Metal Gear games. The best parts of the game were all the boss-fights. Traditionally Metal Gear has great bosses, and for me these are some of the best. They all are completely different and each teach you an important gameplay mechanic, such as Ray teaching you how to attack and Wolf how to parry. What makes the bosses even better is the music that goes along with each. Every single boss song is memorable and I personally know them all by heart. This is by far one of the best games of 2013."

I enjoyed the fact that it primarily focused on parry rather than blocking (however there is a skill you can get for blocking later on). The port to PC isn't bad, not great but by far not terrible, the addition of Antisotropic filtering and Anti-Aliasing make it less jaggy and of course increase the texture resolution some, however don't expect it to look significantly different from the console version aside from that (it does run at 1080p and 60fps however.)Con: the story is a bit short (I beat it in 3 hours on easy.) go for completion, on a harder difficulty however you'll be looking at 5.5hrs+ not to mention all of the VR missions to unlock.Over all: Would Reccomend"

There is plenty of moves to learn and this is very much a game of skill and if you don't learn the moves and the sword play you will not progress on the harder difficulties.The background graphics are a bit sparse though functional but the enemys and other characters are well animated and interesting to slaughter. The bosses are incredible as is the cheesy rock music that plays as you battle them. Not the longest game in the world but with many difficulties and unlockable missions, moves, and some stats to improve you will get you moneys worth. Don't forget to search the levels for hidden items as there is plenty which adds a bit of exploration, also you may find differant paths or optional misssions.The violence is glorious and sexy, if you thought Raiden was a bit a wimp before this (we all do) you won't after. Not a Metal Gear Solid type game obviously but still plent of nods to the world of Metal Gear, including not as bad as you would think steath  which is actually pretty cool. Do yourself a favour and start the game on hard, normal is more like easy if you are used to 3rd person fighting games.It's very nice to see this game running at 60 fps in such high resolution, looks so much better than the 360 version that I own also.

,Recommended,235460,13583354,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,Calenhirion,"Keep a cat or something similar nearby for petting purposes when playingLet me start of by saying one thing: This game is amazingDespite not having played any former Metal Gear games the story really got me hooked. Raiden, is eventhough he is not exactly a hero, or maybe especially for that reason, a great Protagonist. Plenty of cutscenes with lots of action and some bits of humor make the story in this game far more visible than just some voice telling you about why exactly you are killing whom you are killing.Lets get over to gameplay. For my standards, the graphics are more than solid and it felt pretty fluent, even on my not exactly top notch computer. The gameplay is quick, visceral and with a special focus on the blade. Your main weapon feels powerful and versatile, and lethal. All the combos you can perform with it by lining up light and hard attacks are, for information, listed in the help menu. Stealth also exists, but i found myself making little use of it since it seemed more appealing to go for the fight. Other weapons apart from the blade, such as grenades and rocket launchers are available but (at least to me) using them felt far less intuitive than going into melee. The levels follow a format of moving forward disposing or avoiding enemies and going through various action sequences until fighting a final boss, a simple layout which I did personally not mind all too much since the main aspect of this game lies in the combat itself which is just incredible satisfying. Who does not enjoy slicing cyborgs apart to then rip enhancements out of their bodies and using launched missiles as stepping stones in order to slice helicopters apart in a single blow? Raiden feels incredibly swift and powerful but not overpowered and the boss fights are quite challenging.Metal Gear Rising also has an amazing soundtrack of futristic/rock/metal tracks, that just make the boss battles even more epic.There are 2 concerns however which resulted in a bit (who am I kidding, a lot) of frust. Camera and controls. The camera is automated and sometimes this means that it ♥♥♥♥s you over. There were times where i found myself seeing borderline nothing due to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angle. And when playing, you will notice that the controls are catered to a controller, so if you own one,  I would recommend using that instead. As an example you may sometimes find yourself stunned and to rid yourself of it, the game gives you instructions to press ctrl wasd. After a while I figured out that this would mean to keep Ctrl pressed while pressing wasd in that order and then to repeat. Which is stupid, try for yourself.One of the combat functions the so called Blade mode also did from time to time feel lackluster to me. In this time freezing mode you are allowed to freely slice yourself through your opponents while looking for weakened spots to attack which are marked on the screen.In some fights you will have to cut a straight line through an objectbut to line up year weapon in precisely such a manner may often times prove very time intensive which is especially annyoing because the Blade Mode can only be activared for a certain amount of time.And admittedly, I died in this game. A lot. And got a lot of bad combat scores which I felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for. Those were the moments in which i was in dire need of a cat. But Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was the kind of game in which I would just keep on playing anyway because I loved it.For 5€ it is essentially a steal. As long as it is on sale I would 100% recommend purchase. Otherwise the pointed out flaws result in me giving it an 8/10 with room upwards."

Do you care more about fast fluid action and solid gameplay than story?If you answered yes to any of those questions, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is the game for you.Now I must say that as a fan of the Metal Gear Solid series I was more than a little bit upset when I heard that the next metal gear game was not only not part of the solid series, but was also not even a stealth game. But after it came out I watched a couple LP's and it grew on me. Soon I realized that I don't need a deep story filled with rich characters in order to have fun, I just need a high framerate, fun gameplay, and a really good soundtrack(All things the console version of Devil may Cancer was sorely lacking). Thankfully, MGR brings all this to the table and more.If you've played any one of the good DMC games(1,3,or 4) you shouldn't have any trouble with MGR. The only mechanic that some players need to practice with is parrying, but even that's pretty easy. Even the basic layout of the story feels a bit like DMC3, what with the surprisingly engaging rivalry between Raiden and Sam being comparable to the rivalry between Dante and Vergil in DMC3, only not quite as good in my opinion.The Combo system is easy to pick up and gives a decent amount of variety, but I feel that the game really holds itself back in some ways. First off, you can only use 2 weapons at any given time, and the default sword is mandatory. So you can only equip one other weapon and you can't switch from one secondary weapon to another without pausing the game. This limits how much you can really do with your combos and takes away a little bit of the fun in the process. Also, when you equip a secondary weapon, it is assigned to the heavy attack button, so you lose about half of your sword attacks when you use a secondary. I think this was a bad decision on the developers part, especially since the B button on my gamepad is just sitting there lonely and bored for most of the game, since it's only used for opening doors and interacting with certain objects.If you could still keep your heavy sword attacks when using a secondary and just have the secondary assigned to the B button you would have a lot more combo variety, but even with this handicap you can still do some pretty crazy stuff.Raiden can jump from one enemy to another in the middle of his combo, making it easy to interrupt enemy attack animations and set them up for a zandatsu, where you rip out their spine and consume it for health and energy. This mobility along with the zandatsu mechanic makes the game feel different from other character action titles and stops it from feeling stale at any point.But enough about the gameplay, this is a port of a console game so I'm sure you're all wondering about whether or not it's a good port. And the asnwer is both yes and no.Yes because it's not very demanding and it looks good while maintaining a high framerate. But no because it doesn't have any special video options beyond the basic stuff like anti-aliasing and V-Sync. So if you've got a $1500-$2000 rig, don't expect this game to make the most of your processing power.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes hack and slash, character action, or just fun gameplay over story and plot."

The two key features that make it stand out are the ""cutting system"" and the counter/parry system. You can cut objects in the map, enemies, almost everything into pieces, and its very fun. No other game has anything like it. The parry system has you point the directional stick towards your attacker and press ""x"" at the right time. If you do it just before the attack you counter and can enter blade mode for a finishing move, too slow and its a block.The games all about style and finess. It feels great to block, counter and cut everything. Character designs are cool, and the map visuals are decent. Story and voice acting is cheesy, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.The PC port is very good. Decent graphics options, can play with a mouse/kb, runs at a constant 60 maxed out for me, its good. The only complaint on the port is the resolution is capped at 1920x1080. Its not a deal breaker but its worth mentioning. I believe the modder who hacked Dark souls has a fix for this already for MGRR, and Im sure it will be patched.For 30 dollars and considering it comes with all the DLC that was released on console its definitely worth the money.

So metal gear rising is the spinoff of the classic metal gear solid games. The game itself has some really intresting story but I found the characters to be pretty  boring most of the times. Now the gameplay it's really fun trust me with some of the most intresting mechanics for a hack and slash game like the exellent blade mode to take down strong regular enemies and bosses. I also want to give some credit to the bosses in this game that forces you to use different tactics to take them down, and man those bosses are hard even in the normal difficulty.The only thing I find a bit annoying with the game is the target lock especially when you fight against a fast opponent. At last I want to congratulate Kojima Productions for giving me one of the best final bosses I ever encountered, this is how you make a final boss!

It has sort of a steap learning curve, but once you mastered that you will only be slowed down by your own computer, which might get into framerate troubles when you cut a cyborg into more then 350 and more pieces. Story is wonderful absurd and comes as a total standalone for a Metal Gear game. If you have never played MG before you will not be lost, you might wont get some inside jokes. If you played MG before you can forget most everything as this game does not play like MGS but more like DMC. The soundtrack is fitting, dialogues and cutscenes are of high quality. AI and leveldesign are good. Enemies will communicate, try to gank up on you and reposition if they feel the need to. Most levels have been designed to enable the player to choose between an stealth- or fightbased way of dealing with the situations. The overall playtime is not ""epic"" but nice given modern games lenghs, my first clear took be about 6,5 hours without skipping stuff, but this version includes the DLC's which add up another 2 hours of gametime, plus the VR-Missions that will surely give you even more hours of fun. Given the price on release was 20€ one cannot say that you dont get your moneys worth with this game."

If you are expecting pure Stealth and Espionage here, throw that out the window RIGHT NOW. This is not Metal Gear Solid, This is Metal Gear Rising and it will make you remember that. Raiden from Metal Gear Solid's 2 and 4 takes the role of the main character, as he Hacks and Slashes through enemy soilders to uncover a sinister plot while also getiing his revenge against a Mercenary faction that humilated and maimed him. As said before this is not a stealth and tactical espionage game that Metal Gear is known for, This is pure Hack and Slash at it's finest, while there are stealth moments here and there, most of the time you'll be fighting enemies. The overall feeling and tone of this game is Over the Top and Japanese absurdity to the core and it is NOT ashamed of that fact. Cutting things with your sword feels immensly satisfying and with Raiden's Zandatsu ability, you are able to cut your targets into little pieces leading to gratifying kills. This game is loads of fun, but it has it's issues. Parrying with your sword against enemies is pretty awkward and can lead to many frustrating deaths if you are not perfect at it. I am not going to lie this game is pretty hard, even on the Normal setting I still found myself dying a bit. Overall, Rising is a very enjoyable game, fans of the Hack and Slash genre will find some real fun here. And if you aren't a fan, try this game when Platinum puts the PC Demo out. (Lord knows when though.)"

Running around as an OP cyborg dude was very enjoyable, and the fighting felt responsive and satisfying. The game shines at just being utter nonsense, and the over-the-top fighting, or lifting a massive robot hundreds if not thousands number of times your own size by its own sword, or cheesy oneliners and poses all contribute to the experience. If you take the game seriously you're doing it wrong. This is the kind of game you play for an hour or so, getting super hyped by the fast pace, fancy particles, and high-octane music, and then come back to after you've calmed down a bit. Speaking of the music, the soundtrack fits very well and really gets the hype going while you're slicing things to smithereens. The final boss fight is a bit BS if you're playing with keyboard+mouse, though, in my experience.I'm guessing some hardcore MGS fans won't enjoy the game too much, because if they're expecting a game like the MGS games, they will be sorely disappointed. However, people who enjoy cheesy over-the-top spectacle fighters, and don't care too much about the 'Metal Gear' label, should find this game quite enjoyable."

Ever. Period. (Be warned, it's a hard fight)-Nanomachines, son.CONS-The controls take practice to understand, especially with the 'tap stick at an enemy and press attack at the right time to parry' function. A lot of people have a hard time understanding how it works. If you don't get good with it, you won't have a fun time. If you master it, you'll have some sick battles.-Short game is short because development spent most of the time coming up with the cutting engine. Then the original director was fired. Then no one knew how to make what was left into a good action game till Platinum Games saved the day. Again, short, but it's still worth plenty of replays.FINAL NOTEOne of the very few ways Konami can win the hearts of some of it's old fans is to have Platinum Games start working on Revengeance 2. This game is in serious need of a sequel. It would be such a shame for the use of its slicing engine to be... well, cut short."

There's a boss that is outright untouchable during a boss phase and can only be parried. Or be stunned with a EMP if you have one on hand. The other has several sheilds that go up. If you hit them, they explode taking out 30% of your health, The sheilds are also hard to get rid of with this games horrible sword mode system which can't be aimed like this boss wants you to. If you try the sword mode and screw up- 30% Of your health, gone. And you deal insanely low damage on your first run on this game. I was forced to run behind the boss everytime he puts his sheilds up. And even then there's a helicopter shooting you from time to time. If you want a fun relaxing hack and slash this isn't for you.

,Recommended,235460,28897831,Posted: 1 January,all,Aquarius,"I'm not very good at these kind of games, but I still had an absolute blast with this game. I bought it on a whim during a sale after enjoying MGSV and the Metal gear series in general for many years. Gameplay is just so much fun (even on wuss mode for me) and Raiden's moves are a joy to behold. This game is just so over the top and has insane action sequences that made me laugh, but in a really fun summer blockbuster movie kind of way. The voice acting is cheesy as hell in parts (like other parts of all the Metal Gear games) but it sort of suits the crazy characters. The music in this game is perfect, it really gets you hyped up to take on the bosses.The game does however have some really annoying camera issues at times and anyone who is new to this type of game could probably easily get VERY frustrated at the bosses. However, learning them and defeating them is very rewarding. Just be ready to lose. A lot. You get weapon rewards from some of them, I had so much fun with Mistral's staff thing it's just nuts how enjoyable it is to kill the enemies in this game. I didn't really like wiggle the analog stick to break stuns, maybe it was just my controller's wear and tear but sometimes it just seemed to do nothing. That said, this game was still awesome.

I was thoroughly impressed beyond the hype. The combat was smooth, and made sense (even with a few glaring issuescoughparryingexplanationcoughbut that was overcome with practice and fidgeting around in a tutorial).If you want a quick burst of adrenaline, bad jokes, 33dgy5m3 R4id3n, really good music, all in a neat, well executed package that can be done in an afternoon with MASSIVE REPLABILITY, then look no further, friend.__________________________________________________Story: 6/10 (Average/Above-Average)You play as Raiden, the protagonist from MGS2 and a main supporting character in MGS4. He joins up with Maverick, a PMC, in an effort to raise money to support his family. A normal escort mission goes horribly wrong by the hands of rival PMC, Desperado Enforcement. Raiden wants his (re)vengeance.Let's be real here a second. It's not the most fantastic story ever. It is however, serviceable, and at times, effective. It takes the MGS technological lore and turns it up to 12. It's simple, and that's just what the game needs - impetus to move us along and give us a breather. The gameplay is the excuse for the story, in other words.Characters: 7/10 (Above Average)There are only two returning MGS characters: Raiden and Sunny. Raiden is a man on a mission (literally) of his own accord. Sunny is a happy reminder of what he accomplished and more - she helps Raiden on his journey. Their interactions are actually really meaningful, given the context of all the events that happened in the Solid Storyline.The new characters are given plenty of screentime if you want them to. I'm serious. Their characterization is completely optional. Why? The Codec returns and they are there for support/advice/humor/what have you; that being said, you can totally ignore calling them. To sum it up, we've got: a jolly ex-Soviet soldier, a historical/locational profiler with fantastic dreadlocks, an analyst (and save point) who ate her way across the world while spilling coffee, a philosophical killing machine, und Herr Doktor und his hands!Gameplay/Combat: 8.5/10 (Really Solid)Lots of goodness here. Fast-paced hack-'n-slash with a cybernetic flavor. All your combos are rather simple, but the high-octane present makes you need that smaller list at times (that being said more options are always nice). The parry system is what gives people alot of grief. Once you figure it out/get used to it, it makes sense and isREEEEAAALLY satisfyingto chain together parries or get perfect-parries. You also have a small array of special weapons. Some of them range from rocket launchers, grenades, and even some of the weaponsthe bosses use.Personally, my only gripe here is with the camera. It can get wonky. It's not bad...but there's sooooo much better.Some other things worth noting are the lack of on-the-fly weapon changing, controls for KBM, and some really punishing enemies, regardless of skill/performance. The weapon switching is most likely due to the game not being able to handle it. KBM are actually solid. I had no complaints when I used it - I wouldn't say intuitive, but definitely comfortable. A controller is far superior here though. The enemies...well...you'll find the cheapest way to beat 'em...Performance: 8.75/10 (REALLY Solid)I don't have a goodgamingPC. I still get like 55 fps regularly; only dipping below 30 when I overkill the game engine with pieces or action. I'm pleased. I'm super pleased as punch right now. Most of what I found; this game is stable on all PCs I know of (currently), and it will take a ton of work to make it stop.Music: 8/10 (Good Stuff)TWO tracks got nominated for aGRAMMY.I think that should suffice.Nah, but really. It's Heavy Metal. Lots of it. And the best part? It totally fits and is dynamic to the stage of the fight you're in. Jamie Christopherson and crew do a great job here. One of the handful of games that made me get up and buy the soundtrack."

I played this game for about an hour and so far and it is amazing. The only thing I don’t like about this game so far is the some of the camera angels, but I saw an option to change them. The camera angles get stuck in weird directions when you do to dice up the enemy’s. So I might mess with them and see if it makes it better. So far I am enjoying the story and combat very much. The graphics in this game are really good not amazing but it will give you quit a thrill if you look at the landscape and the detail that when into it. I recently became more interested in some combat game, but I can really see myself playing this game a few times.The combat in this game is excellent and very fluid and enjoyable. The feature where you dice up your enemies into bits is giving me chills because it’s new every time very nice feature.

The one complaint I do have in that area is the massive focus on parrying, I don't mind that but it makes dodging feel useless especially vs bosses.. The world , while not a graphicly power house, does look very nice and then there are the in game sounds and music, oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god they're amazing.

My only gripe is that it was too short, but it has very high replayability. The story is very dark, but gripping.

Overall this title again show Platinum Games at it's best in this well put together game that packs in excellent boss battles as well as realistic cutting mechanics that allow you to actually cut in the angle you want. This is a nice PC port with all the DLC included from the console release and includes extra VR missions to keep you invested after the 10-15 hour campaign. However I would not likely recommend this game to any Metal Gear Solid fans due to the stealth elements falling a bit short of the ""Solid"" series. Nevertheless this game is an excellent edition to any Hack n Slash fan's library and I am looking forward to a sequel should one be announced."

As someone who used to be a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and was bored to tears over MGS4 this is a huge breath of fresh air.  It only took me like 6 hours to play through this but its the funnest 6 hours I've had in quite a while.  I was hesitant to try this game out because ♥♥♥♥ing Raiden... Guy nearly ruined MGS2 and got way too much screen time in 4 for my liking.... Then I finally got this on the holiday sale and I'm so glad I did.This is a game that is all about just being entertaining just for the sake of it.  They stopped trying to be serious at all and just went for as much cheese as they could put into it.  This is like if Expendables was a parody.  Not one moment of this is meant to be taken seriously.  From the cheesy voice acting to the over the top plot that just pokes fun at itself at every turn.Then there's the gameplay.  Some of the tightest controls and combat I've ever experienced in an action game ever.  Platinum is known for this kind of tight gameplay but this my first from them I've ever touched so now I know exactly what fans are talking about.  The boss battles are some of the best things in any game ever and I can see some replay value in trying to better my score and trying the different secondary weapons.

The enimies are quite challanging even on the lowest difficulity which is good and the way you can upgrade Raidens equipment is cool as it allows the player to have a different experiance every playthrough.The Story for me was a little bit difficult to figure out so I had to do some research on the other MG games to understand, not much back story was given to the main characters and I felt that the game expected the player to have played the previous Metal Gear Solids. Overall this is not really an issue for me personally as I looked up a couple of plots but for someone going in unknown territory this can be off-putting. I suggest those that want to know more about the story and want to understand it a little more to watch some videos on the other Metal Gear Solid games but this wont spoil your experiance whatsoever.Hands down Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard which also includes dynamic music that changes whenever you enter ""Blade Mode"" plus the feeling of slicing up a epic boss that you have died to countless times to pieces feels really rewarding. I have personally added some tracks to my phone as they are so damn good!MGR:R has the best boss fights I have played in a video game in a very long time maybe due to the fact that not many games today have boss fights that are as interesting or are difficult to beat as the ones in this game as other games tend to hold your hand throughout. One boss I died to around 15 times on Normal difficulity (maybe I just suck lol) but having that challange there feels awesome! The mechanics of each boss makes them each feel unique and difficult in thier own way, each boss has thier own strategy to beat so running at them whailing your sword about like a idiot will only end up with you getting your rear kicked.Being someone who has never played any Metal Gear game in the past I am really happy for giving this game a go. I have only mostly play RPG's, Shooters and Stratagy games so this is the first Hack n' Slash I have played since Devil May Cry many years ago. From what I seen the other Metal Gear games are a lot more stealth based than this one but I really want to give them a go now and I cant wait for the next Metal Gear game.If you are looking for an awesome Hack n' Slash game with unique styled and memorable epic boss fights, an awesome soundtrack and a game that does not hold your hand throughout then Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is your game."

I've played the MGS games from Konami and have played a couple of good games by Platinum Inc. and this feels like an awsome mix of what the two companies are capable of.The story is awsome, and the cutscenes are some of the coolest i've seen. The music is extremely good, and very well fits the mood of the game. I played this game with rather low settings so I could make sure I had 60 frames all through out my playthroughs, but even at lower settings the game looked nice. The combat system is very fast paced and fluid, it also has a lot to offer that makes it unique from other action games like this. The game does have somewhat of a stealth option but I wouldn't try to play that way, just go right into fights ready for intense sword battles. This game can get pretty hard, and while it's no trouble on easy mode, each mode after it ups the intensity by a lot. I guess this is a reason for the stealth; if there are big hordes you think you may not be able to take you can try to sneak past them. The one thing that I can say got me down when playing this game was the ending credits screen that showed up after I beat the game, while only playing for a couple of hours. It does have some mission modes and extras, so you can try them if you still want to play a bit more.

The combat is fluid and you'll get better the more you play, the story is over the top and thrilling from start to finish, and the boss fights are some of the best in the business. If for nothing else, I recommend this game based solely on its boss fights, in fact. They're dramatic, heart-racing, and more than anything: Fun.That all being said, you may want to refrain if you're the type of person who will only play through a game once, and not touch optional singleplayer content that has no affect on the normal campaign missions.

You'll be thrown in to ridiculous situations, but in a positive ""wow who thinks of this stuff?"" kind of way.There's tons of secrets and very well hidden collectables hidden around every mission, so you're bound to come across something different each time you play through it. (You can also unlock different modes to the game, starting out with Easy, Normal, and Hard and climbing your way up to Very Hard and Revengeance mode.)However, this game is absolutely nothing like the other games of the series. You're pretty much all melee combat here, with the exception of a few grenades, rocket launchers, etc. And if you liked Metal Gear for its unique stealth missions, there are some missions where you can do so, but the game won't scold you if you choose to run into battle like an angry ape, slashing your sword side to side at full speed.Another plus is the unique and hyper soundtrack that will slide into any action packed situation (all situations are action packed, therefore every track is flawless).The storyline is pretty linear, but you will come across challenging bosses that will stand in your way.The keyboard controls are easy to use, but gameplay is best with a controller as the game does fully support them."

Ive completed it in 9 hours and wasnt rushing at all, could be even less if it hadnt been for the challenging last boss. I will definitely try higher difficulties but i feel they could have added few more missions. Also there are too many cinematics and fast action sequences as in press f or space in order to beat the boss. I dont really like that.

If you're going to market a game as a hack and slash, make it a hack-and-slash. Maybe it's because games like Dishonered have spoiled what I would consider real stealth, but the stealth in this game is almost shoe-horned in, and not really well done.Overall, this game was fun, despite some awkwardly thrown in stealth moments.

Despite its short main-game, this title is a lot of fun and displays a surprising amount of deapth in terms of game mechanics. The difficulties vary enough to encourage second playthroughs and multiple VR-missions and the included DLC-campaigns (which are both a great change of pace and a whole lot fun) prolong the enjoyment even further.Visually the game is really satisfying. Some might critizise the texture quality (It's not THAT bad, in all honesty) but cutting your environment into bits and pieces and looking at the result afterwards is hella pleasing.Plotwise the game is a typical Metal Gear Title with all its cheesiness and morals. It's overdone in many places but you won't mind because it is ""suplexing-a-giant-mech""-kinda overdone and who doesn't enjoy that?That all being said the game does have some minor bugs - one pretty annoying one for me was the missing sound durin pre-rendered cutscenes.

,Recommended,235460,21552194,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,Ghun,"I really wanted to like this game especially since I started playing it after I finished the Metal Gear Canonology. I recommend this game to those who have never played Metal Gear Solid 4. I cannot recommend this to those who care about the Metal Gear world and story because Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is not Kojima's vision for what could come after Metal Gear Solid 4. Playing this game right after Metal Gear Solid 4 hurt, it seemed to void everything that was done in that game, and this is most likely because the game was initially planned to take place after Metal Gear Solid 2 and before Metal Gear Solid 4. That being said this is not a bad game in the slightest, if you like over the top action or other platinum games (keep in mind this is not a kojima work), then this game is for you. The music is not what I expected from something with Metal Gear in the title but this is a spin-off and Platinum game so it's passable if you're ok with electronic rock, industrial metal, alternative metal, and hard rock. The graphics are good and the game runs at 60fps in game, however cutscenes are 30fps and are questionable if they run in engine like other Metal Gear games or are just prerendered, because they don't look as clean as the gameplay. Gameplay is good for the most part as its much more action driven than any other metal gear game ever because you play as cyborg Ninja Raiden who no longer has white blood only in the non-Japanese releases of this game. (Proofhttp://youtu.be/crkPkFnrE94?t=31s). The game does a very bad job of explaining how to parry so for up to a boss called Monsoon I never did it, I had to look up a tutorial online because the game explains it as a light attack in the direction of an oncoming attack, never emphasizing the importance of moving the analog stick while attacking. I'm used to games that rely on parrying as a mechanic forcing the player to successfully parry in order to progress. They should had a forced vr training for parrying in the beginning of the game. Some parts of this game help me imagine what I assume playing bayonetta is like, because sometimes you are running and jumping on missiles etc and then other parts frustrate me i.e. the stealth sections emphasis on sections because only certain parts of the game allow you to stealth, which if you are a fan of doing non-lethal or stealth in the Metal Gear Series, you really can't do these things well or you have to unlock the non-lethal weapon later. The stealth is sad because it even has the detection alert timer like other Metal Gear games but you really can't hide very well and try again, if you get caught you have to cut your enemies into mince meat, and it's very easy to get caught because enemies have huge cones of sight so you just have to inch past them using the box. I played every Metal Gear game and I don't even use the box as much as you have to in this game. The stealth is really forced, like most of the humor in the game. I may sound like I'm ripping on this game, but that's only because I'm just a huge metal gear fan and I expect a lot of polish. This is an 8/10 for sure, but for me it's unplayable because I love the resolution of the MGS4 so much I don't want the universe of MGRR to be real."

,Recommended,235460,34681234,Posted: 2 September,all,Splatoobi,"This Game is neat[slight spoiler warning]I say that its neat, because there are a lot of mechanics or moments that make the game fun,but an equal amount of problems that'll frustate you immensely.For example: most enemies emit a red flare before they attack, and you can tilt the analog stick (or presumably move the mouse) into the direction where you think the attack will hit, and therefore counter said attack.The Problem with this mechanic is that there were a lot of times where enemies would just stick to you when you are trying to move away. Also even the most easily dispatched enemies have a combo attacks with which they can temporarily lock you into position.Another example: Some enemies, the normal ones later on in the game, but specifically the gorilla type enemies, will sometimes emit a yellow flare instead of a red one, which indicates that they will try to grab you with an attack that you cannot simply counter. The normal enemies will literally chase you down for two seconds, and then they lock you into position. The gorilla type enemies will lock you into a short animation where they hammer down on you.Both of these grab moves can be evaded by in either way jumping or running away from the enemy, and they can both be cancelled through rapid movement of the left analog stick (or presumably the mouse).The Problem here is that these enemies show up far too many times in the late game. When a gorilla grabs you, you have so little time to prevent them from smashing your face in (again through moving around the analog stick), that it is most likely that they'll be able to perform the whole play for you.When I said that these enemies show up a whole lot in the end-game, then I mean that there won't just be one gorilla running around pummeling your face in, instead you'll have a herd of gorillas chasing after you, all the while you'll have to try and dodge the attacks of smaller enemies, which will instead use the counter-able attacks, which in turn cannot be dodged. You'll simply die over and over again, not because the game is made more difficult through new enemies or stages, but rather because they decided to opt for the mario-maker-artificial difficulty. Its not fun, its annoying.And those were two of a lot of problems with this game. And I was playing on normal.Anyways the story is pretty simple and the main protagonist is the edgiest kid in town.It can still be hilarious hack'n'slash fun."

AlsoSPOILER ALERTlast boss is a problem as the devs used the dumbest possible way to make him hard, you have 3 boss fights before the actual final boss and end up wasting your health packs (also limited to 5) before it, and of course the last boss has twice the health and strenght as other bosses.3- Too much talking and custscenes, but pretty much standard on any MG game at the time. But the reason this is an issue is because at times you could literally walk out of a cutscene to a dialog scene straight into another cutscene.Overall it's a good game but the flaws can be bit much as they are present on every stage of the game."

The combat system is so fluid and natural, especially the blade mode which allows you to slow time (like a total ninja) and hack and slash your enemy to pieces as if you were cutting butter, it almost feels like you're wielding a katana while slicing your enemies into itty bitty pieces.2. The story is deep and as per Konami games, often filled with outrageous humour and breaking physics laws consantly.3. The weapon upgrades are balanced and require you to put in the effort of hacking and slashing enemies over and over until you grind enough points to spend on them, often by repeating missions, but the rewards are well worth the effort.Cons:1. Combat can eventually get repetitive and frustrating if enemies manage to chainstun you over and over while being locked in a corner, making movement a forced priority in order to win.2. The main story is too short imo (DLC adds a bit more backstory) but the game itself lacks replayability, once you defeat the big bad boss, it's over, no reason to continue playing except for achievement grinding or maxing upgrades.3. The long, dragged out but detailed dialogue between each characters can sometimes get boring, especially during the boss fights or talking with allies and after hearing it the first time, makes me skip through all of it every time I replay the missions (it's my personal preference, I know some of you out there will probably love to listen to the dialogue over and over for any MGS lore easter eggs)."

If you are in a similar situation, don't hesitate. You won't regret it.Nanomachines / 10Combat is just GREAT. This may very well be one of the best Hack N Slash games I've ever played, up there with Devil May Cry. The fact that it has the stones to not give you a freaking block button is enough to give this a try.While I disagree with the people saying that it had ""memorable"" boss fights, I concede that most of them had really interesting set pieces and visual concepts. The thing that gets me is that they were, often, really boring and padded. Bosses feel like they have way too much health and it can hinder the pace greatly.Aside of the high-octane action, there are also some optional stealth sections which are actually pretty cool. More than a throwback to other Metal Gear titles, this served as a nice opportunity to explore and exploit the environment in ways which were not that useful in direct combat but still very fun. It's a much welcomed spin on the gameplay to keep things fresh, but specially nice because it is completely optional and you can just as well sword-blaze your way through. There are also battles (and itens but who cares about those) ""hidden"" through the maps, so you have incentive to explore.I think it speaks highly of its design that the fun I had with the game was very direct. I was simply playing it, doing my thing. And it was awesome. I very much like when a game is good because ""it makes you think"" or ""has innovative concepts"", but I'm also very much for the notion that games need to be fun, without the meta. This is one such case. Playing the game is its greatest reward; and, specially nowadays, that is a feat to be recognized.However, and on a related note, do yourself a favor and don't expect a nice story out of this. I would watch everything once, because, you know, NANOMACHINES SON, and why the hell not, but it's just... So incredibly bad.It is a massive shame that of all the things this game could have inherited from Metal Gear Solid, the one thing they chose to incorporate full strength was the bloated writing. Nothing is said once that can't be said seven more times.Technical Considerations:Played this on a Mac. Really good port, definitely recommend it. Haven't come across any glitches and there are plenty of options to make sure the game will run well. I own a Mac Mini circa 2012 and had to bump it down to lower resolutions to keep it smooth, but it did work and the game played all the way through at a smooth and consistent speed.Regarding PS3 controller support: It's fully functional but the game has no specific labels. So get used to seeing Square referred to as ""4"", L2 as ""5"", etc. Works great tough. Really responsive.TL;DR:Game is technical fun. If your vision of a good game time is reacting to split second cues, facing up to challenging encounters and being rewarded for your skill, you'll be right at home.Miscellaneous Information:Game was played on Normal. Took me about 7 hours (in game time) to beat it."

I picked it up for £5:00 In the Steam winter sale and I have to say it is the best £5 I have spent in a long time. This game continues in the story of Raiden a Badass Cyborg With a Katana. If this isn't enough to convince you to buy it then I don't know what is. It is a typical hack and slash game to all intents and purposes except from what the game calls ""Blade Mode"". Within the combat by simply holding the shift key (I played with mouse & Keyboard) When the prompt arises you can slice your enemy into pieces. Very good combat system and as for the boss fights well. They were furfilling if you play on a higher difficulty, after struggling over and over to finnaly deal that finishing blow and to an amazing soundtrack at the same time no less. This truly is one of the best games I have played for a while. I got 10 hours of gameplay from completing it once and I am currently re running the game now on the hard difficulty selection to collect the final upgrades to Raiden and the collectibles. Story line was a pretty decent one providing you pay attention however there is one thing I will say, it wasn't until a few missions in I learned you can block attacks by light attacking (left mouse button) and moving towards them at the same time will cause raiden to go into a block stance for their attack, this could of been taught a little better but as I said, deffinatly a game to play if your a hack & slash fan (y)"

,Recommended,235460,8721700,"Posted: 15 January, 2014",all,CommanderFlynn,"Firstly, from so much playtime from the Console game, I was skeptical at this being ported over. Platnium has never done a PC game before, let alone a port - and that is somewhat evident in this port. However if this is the quality of ports we are going to have in 2014? It's looking to be a good year.My first small gripe is the texture quality. It's somewhat evident that the game is using low-res textures even on the highest of settings. It's a small gripe, because believe me, the only time you'll notice this is during the cutscenes when you're not actually doing anything and paying attentiont to...what this game has for a story.Secondary are the options, the resoltuion will auto apply every time you select one. A small gripe but I know some users that have experienced black screens from selecting too high of a reoslution (for some reason) so take it slow when doing this :).Control wise I have no complaints. It's fairly well done with each key being rebindable. However the blade mode is somewhat...broken using a mouse. Precision cuts are fairly difficult to do and you're not simply offered the same precision as using an analog stick. For that reason alone I would highly recommend a controller for MGR:R HOWEVER - given time I think it can be manageable.Metal Gear RISING (please note the RISING part of the title) is a spin off game developed by Platnium with Kojima helping them out. Instead of the tactical stealthy espionage of Solid Snake (albeit slightly present with stealth kills) You play as Raiden - yeah, the weird wimpy guy in MGS2 turned badass in MGS4. A cybernetically enhanced swordfighter. After a protection job goes...very badly to say the least, it's up to Raiden and his team to stop the enemy before♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan.As a standard in a Metal Gear game, the story is of Kojima quality, albeit can be confusing at times if one isn't paying TOO much attention. I feel that many pure PC gamers will be very conffused as it does play reference to the older games on the console. (I'm surprised the collection wasn't ported to support this) However the use of the Codex to call your allies is a nie way of explaining some stuff to the player that may or may not have had the chance to play the earlier games.This game is an over the top hack and slash game. And when I mean over the top, I'm not sugar coating it. If you don't think blocking a huge arm sword from a huge robot, and then throwing it into the air is not over the top, well...it is. And it gets better as you get further into the game.Boss fights are...well actual boss fights. Challenging and making use of the Blade mode is usually a must to gain an advantage. The old ways of learning boss patterns and attacks are present here but not really needed untill you get to the harder difficulty levels.The game has SOME replayabiliy, but not too much of one as  compared to other sinlge player games. The story will take about 7-10 hour, mayber longer and then you got the DLC stories (which I haven't played but I can promise are excellent, diving into the head of the slick samurai Jetstream Sam and Raiden's companion Wolf) After all that you simply play to unlock all the weapons, costumes (which are plentiful minus the ones that come with the game) weapons, and difficulty level. Including Revengence difficulty which is pretty much dark souls in the case that YOU WILL DIE.Overall it's a great game that is loads of fun. I can't recommend it enough.Also the soundtrack is awesome, one of the few that really goes well with the game!"

Well, to be honest I was expecting this to happen, since this IS a third person hack 'n slash game.So I highly recommend investing a little money for a decent PC supported Gamepad.  I Played this with Logitech F310  and it worked perfectly.---------------------Technical statistics:I haven't managed to find any bugs at all during my playtime and the game runs crystal smooth at 60 FPS, with no framedrops.  Well,..erm only time I had framelag happened when I was cutting three army helicopters into atoms in the Blademode.  I think the framelag at that point was acceptable.Also, I don't own the best, top notch PC at the moment, so that's one thing.The graphics look fine to me, but most of the textures are a bit low rez, but that is to be expected when a game gets ported to PC from the consoles.  AA goes to MSAA x8 at max and texture filtering to Anisotropic 16x at max.There are no 4K resolution options, but atleast it goes to 1920 x 1080, which is a good minimum for me.  So atleast this should run smoothly with a bit less powerful gaming PCs.------------------------------------------------------------About gameplay:So the fighting is very combo and timing oriented.  I havent tried this on the highest difficulties, but alteast on normal and hard, there is some room for error.  Not too much though.  Learning to parry and dodge at the right times will come in handy and learning the weapon combos and movesets will result in some awesome combo windows.....and then there is the Blade Mode.Had enough with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and want to just slice things up?   Well, The Blade Mode will do exactly that.  When you use it, it will put you into a blade stance where you can do vertical and horizontal slices, while the world stays in slow motion and you get to screw gravity and the laws of physics in general.  So fast, so aggressive and so rewarding.Needless to say, the combat is very high paced and full of action and yet manages to get challenging, especially with bigger enemies and bosses.  Sometimes I almost had  a Dark Soulish feeling with it,  only with an OD of adrenaline and cyborgs put into the mix.  Very satisfying.There is a good number of weapon and skill customizing options in the game aswell and the better you score on combat, the more points you will be awarded to spend in skills, uprgades, skins and so on.The game also includes a stealth system, which I find funny.  Cardboard boxes, barrels and hologram distractions are at your disposal.  I guess this is Platinum Game's way of making honor to the Metal Gear - Franchise.  But hey, I suppose one man army cyborg needs to hide too sometimes :).Story is quite good in my opinion and yet has alot of random humor a la Platinum Games.  I kind of respect the comic relief in such a serious game and this type of mature (and less mature) humor hits me well, as long as its doesn't mess with the main story.  And it doesn't.Overall,  Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a very enjoyable high paced hack n slash, adrenaline fueled, metal music powered mayhem game and works very well as an anger management at that. :)A good buy if you are fine with using a controller and dealing with a lot of enemies."

Had to download Windowed Borderless Gaming as a workaround.Story 7/10- Go into this game expecting an over-the-top attitude- Lines are pretty cheesy and corny but it kind of makes fun of itself.  I was personally driven to play by the gameplay rather than the story-Doesn'trequire knowledge of the MGS universe to enjoy.Controls 8/10- Made by Platinum Games so expect some level of button mash hack-and-slash- Overall it's fairly easy to pick-up and there are tutorials but it doesn't fully explain the advanced mechanics of the game- The camera wasn't too intuitive at certain situationsIf you're fighting indoors, the camera controls may go into auto mode and start swirling around you for no                                 apparent reason.Graphics 9/10- It's a port from the PS3/XBOX so the pre-rendered cutscene remains in 30FPS- I believe the game is locked to 60 FPS but it's not that big of a deal.  In-game graphics are rendered perfectly to your rig.- The game is surprisngly smooth and beautiful.  The quality was much higher than my expectations for a port.Music 10/10- THAT ADRENALINIE PUMPING METAL/ROCK MUSIC!Unlike other games that constantly replays battle music on every fight, Rising does a great job mixing it up.  Throughout different battle phases, an instrumental track begins to play and eventually kicks-in the vocal layer when sh*t goes downGameplay 9/10- Pretty much DMC/Bayonetta style gameplay although it probably doesn't have the same number of combo streams   The game isn't really made to be played as a combo master protagonist.-  The unique selling point is the ability toliterally cut almost everything into tiny pieces; there's something about being able to mutilate your enemy's limbs that makes itSO FUN.  There is some level of physics involved but it's probably downscaled to prevent CPU lag.-OptionalThere is a stealth mechanic... but it's nowhere near the level of MGS.  You can jump on enemies and you would still be a silent ninja.- Amazing boss encouters fights.  Even on hard mode they are extremely rewarding.Weighted Score 8.5/10Would love to see a sequel.

The mechanics are well thought out and masterfully executed, and each boss demands mastery of a specific aspect of the game's combat, culminating in the final encounter, which calls upon all the skills you've learned over the course of the game.This game is fairly short, clocking in at around 7 hours for a skilled player, but only a very small percentage of that could be called filler, and the harder difficulty modes and included free DLC side stories provide a good bit of replay value.The moments when you hit the final stage of a boss encounter, and the vocals kick in on their massive electro-metal themes are well worth the price of admission."

,Recommended,235460,9162120,"Posted: 17 February, 2014",all,Banana Sam,"Metal Gear Rising is the game that reminded me that simply being fun is merit enough for a vidya to be great.It's ridiculous, over the top, cheesy, bombastic, and completely disregards the already dubious narrative of the Metal Gear series, but Rising manages to be one of my favorite games.  The gameplay may seem slightly shallow at first, until you realize it's purely skill based and will reward you for what you put into it (especially on the very hard/revengeance difficulty levels).  Instead of bogging the player down with knowledge of animation cancels and complex combos (like DMC3) or making everything braindead easy (God of War), MGR strikes a balance of requiring the player to master the timing of attacks in order to successfully parry and counter their foes.  This becomes especially important on the harder difficulties as the game quickly becomes a high-skill battle of quickly kill or be killed.I would go so far as the say that the combat reminds me of Dark Souls in that timing and knowledge of animation frames are more important than anything else.MGR:R is great beyond its core mechnanics as well.  It features some of the most memorable and interesting boss fights of all time, and a soundtrack that's so cheesy it's great.  There's a good reason this game has taken on a somewhat cult-like following that shameless spouts its numerous one-liners and absurd catch phrases.All in all, I highly recommend MGR to anyone that understands why quite literally throwing a giant mech into the air and slicing it in half while the music screams ""RULES OF NATURE""   is the pinnacle of vidya escapism."

It's optimized well, and framerate drops are minimal. The actual gameplay is as great as one would expect from Platinum, with the addition of Blade Mode adding a whole new layer of fun to combat. The highlight of gameplay is undoubtedly the boss fights. They're all excellent spectacles, with great challenge and amazing control. Not to mention the absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. The mere alert themes are exciting enough, but the boss themes are absolutely sublime. Each has its own style, from the keyboard/guitar/classical piano mix of ""A Stranger I Remain"" to the speedmetal-style adrenaline rush of ""The Only Thing I Know For Real"" to the climactic beauty of ""It Has To Be This Way"". And the lyrics in each explain the backstory and personality of each respective boss. The story itself is what you get when Metal Gear goes off its medication, and is one of the most over-the-top and hilarious game stories I've ever experienced. The replayability is excellent, with a New Game+ option and weapon upgrades to keep you busy. However, the highest two difficulties are absolutely dreadful, with you often being swarmed by heavily armored enemies that can kill you within seven or eight hits. The final boss becomes absolutely insane on these difficulties due to a previously forced-loss scenario suddenly becoming possible to fail at. Overall though, Metal Gear Rising is an excellent extension of the series, and is every bit as great as one could expect a Platinum game to be. I give it a 9/10."

,Recommended,235460,13878393,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,BadassFreeman,"I'll be honest: I have never been a fan of Metal Gear. I like Stealth based games, but this series just has TOO MUCH STORYLINE on it. I like good stories, but when most cutscenes take from 5 minutes to 10, I just get bored. Because of that, I've been trying to stay away from this game, I though it was more of the same sh#t... Until this Holiday sale, where I saw it at 4€. I had arround 5€ left on my Steam account, so I decided to give it a try, and see what is this madness all about. So, where did they ♥♥♥♥ it up? Simple,they didn't.I will talk about the bad things first, though I have to say it took me sometime to find bad stuff to talk about, and most of it are just little problems:First and foremost, even if the gameplay is nearly perfect for a Hack n' Slash, the game does not teach you the controls properly. Now hear me on this one, I HATE when a game holds your hand, it's terrible when games keep throwing tutorials after 6 hours into the game... But that being said, I had issues with it, let me give you a proper example:One of the main moves you'll have to learn during the game, is the Parry. It's nearly Impossible to play this game without parrying your enemies. Where's the issue? The game tells you about parrying enemies after you have already defeated a boss, WHERE PARRYING COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY USEFUL! This example isn't enough? Let me give you one 10 times worse:Another move that can be EXTREMELY useful during the game is the ""dodge"" moves. Some of the enemies are extremely difficult to dodge without it (more on that later). And when does the game teach you to do this move? Uh...Never?I watched videos in Youtube about the game, and I saw people doing the move, so I got curious and tried to do it. When I was already12 HOURS INTO THE GAME, DOING THE DLC'S, I found out how to do it. WHEN I DIDN'T NEED IT ANYMORE! There's no excuse for that, even the most basic ""Hard-core-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; games out there, like the Over-rated Dark Souls tells you how to do crap in the Tutorial stage.The second problem I had are a few bosses of the game. As usual, I play the game from start to finish in the ""Hard"" difficulty because games these days are just too easy. And well, I had no issue on it, the game felt challenging, and the bosses were amazing... Except the last boss. I did die a few times with some bosses, but because I couldn't follow a proper way to defeat him in the first try. The final boss instead throws attacks that are just confusing to follow and fell cheap as f#ck. Let me explain it properly:When an enemy is going to do an attack that you can parry, you can see a red light comming from his eyes, that's what tells you that you have to parry. What happens with this boss? Of all the attacks he has that you can parry, some of them have this light come up too early. And what happens if you parry too early? You get hit anyway. I don't get it, did the devs miss that? Or they tried to punish people with extremely good reflexes? I was playing in the Hard Difficulty, and his hits did extreme damage, but I was getting hit because of a game flaw. That's not a challenge, that's unfair. And not only the Final Boss has this issue, a few other enemies have it as well, like the Wolf-like robots, and the Gorrilla ones also have a few attacks were the red light appears way too early and makes you get hit for no reason.Another little issue I had with this game, is maybe a strange one to explain: How the story is done. During the game, a character joins Raiden, a robot named Blade-Wolf. He's cool as f#ck, he has a nice personality, good and memorable quotes... And yet he's not playable in the game? OH WOW NEVERMIND, he's playable in the DLC, so it's good...UNLESS THEY DECIDE TO MAKE HIS STORY LASTONE HOUR. And that's including the 15 minutes of cutscenes. What the hell, man? I was really looking forward to play as Blade-Wolf during the game alongside Raiden, but the game only gives me the chance to do it in a painful cheap DLC (that thankfully it's already in the PC version of the game) that uses maps from the original game, with only a new boss and some new tracks. And the same goes with the other DLC, Jetstream's story: 3 bosses that areALL RECLYCLEDwith one or two new tracks, and a character that we all wanted to play way more than the game allowed us to.My final issue with the game are both the camera and the stealth sections. Now I understand the game has ""Metal Gear"" on the name, but Stealth feels like a joke. It's hard and boring to pull-off, and feels dumb when you can just kill everyone in arround a minute, anyway. The camera was getting in the way through the entire game, specially when you lock into an enemy. The worst part about it is that you need to move in the direction the enemy is attacking to Parry, and with the camera moving in all directions, parrying can become a pain if you use the Lock option. I recommend only using it on bosses, and even then it can f#ck you up at times.Now that being said, let's talk about what's good about the game... That's pretty much everything.The story doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's great. Why? Metal Gear itself is just TOO SERIOUS in my opinion, and this game instead was quite entertaining. Everything moves arround some sort of ""Cyborg-Ninja"" named Raiden (or Thunder-bolt, for people who want to♥♥♥♥♥♥him off), who for what I know was in Metal Gear 2 or something, and everyone  though he was a f#cking sh#tty character, who goes into a quest of vengeance because of what happens in Africa, during the tutorial mission. I won't spoil much, but I'll stay that you don't need to know about the Metal Gear Saga, and that the story is great from start to finish, even though the final battle looked a bit... Rushed.Combat feels amazing (when it doesn't glitch like I said before), and even if it feels like it ripped-off some stuff from the ""Afro Samurai"" game (I recommend that game too, but it's a console exclusive), it manages to stay original and true to itself. You have your own sword, and can get new weapons when defeating bosses. I didn't use those weapons much though, because it's a pain to switch weapons during combat... But the ""Spear-like"" weapon was really helpfun for when you get surrounded by enemies. You can also use Secondary weapons that you find during the game, such as Rocket launchers and grenades. I didn't used them much, they were helpful in their own way. During the game you get ""Battle Points"" (actually f#ck that, for me they were Badass Points), that you can use to upgrade yourself, or purchase new armors, something that makes taking more fights helpfun, something that makes stealth even more pointless by accident, but believe me; f#ck stealth in this game.The best part of the game is probably both the Bosses and the music. I'm not joking arround, this game has one of the best soundtracks I've heard so far. It comes close to Bastion's soundtrack, AND THAT SOUNDTRACK WAS LITERALLY PERFECT. I'm still listening to the soundtrack while making this review, THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS. The bosses in the other hand are just over-the-top, and that's something that confuse me: Wasn't Metal Gear a realistic game? BECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN CYBORG-NINJA DOING MULTIPLE SUPLEX TO GIGANTIC ROBOTS, AND THE FINAL BOSS IS LITERALLY MIXING MECHA-HITLER WITH HULK HOGAN. That being said, I had LOTS OF FUN with the bosses, they're just... Beautiful to watch in fights, have solid animations, EXTREMELY BADASS SOUNDTRACK, and insane quick-time-events that make it look like an episode of Dragon Ball Z, with so many explosions, it seems like the game was made by Mr. Torgue and Michael Bay.For 4€, I feel like I've stolen this game. Personally, 10€ for this is already an extremely fine deal. Of course, if you're a cheap b#stard, you can wait for better deals, but it's up to you. You better learn the Rules of Nature, though!"

The enemies can be brutally hard when you come into this with no prior experience with this game and with there being a lot of different kind of enemies with a whole lot of different attacks, you won't really feel confident on what to do properly till you've gone through the game at least once. I played through the game on hard which I probably shouldn't have. Still though, the problem I have with this game (and unimaginably unfair bosses that require almost precognitive abilities to fight is no where near as annoying as this) but the camera hates you. The camera believes it knows best and often you'll find yourself getting killed to brutally beaten to a pulpe because the camera has it's own ideas and you have yours.

It is very short (your total ""completion time"" for the main story will be 6-8 hours, however this is assuming you never die or explore.)  There is a lot to be done in terms of 100%'ing and the unlocked difficulties change the way AI works as well as the enemies you will face.  I never tried the easy/normal difficulties, but I found the Hard/Very Hard/Revengeance progression to be very fair and I certainly stopped playing in anger a couple of times.  Anyone who says this game was too easy probably just used the fox blade (was a DLC weapon on PS3, but comes with the game on PC.  Don't use it and you'll be fine.  It instantly kills all enemies.)I would only buy this game if you have the intention to replay it.  The core gameplay is extremely excellent, the only real limitation is the sometimes finicky camera (I never had problems with it by my second playthrough.)If they made DLC or any kind of extention to this game, I would buy it immediately.

The game is based around the former whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ named Raiden who now returns as a cyborg ninja badass because reasons. Well, we all know it was ♥♥♥♥ing Japan. The gameplay is extremely simple and is mucked up by the inclusion of an almost useless upgrade and spec system. The music is pretty much overly dramatically, whimsically, weird J-pop of some screaming teen about to climax over hatsune miku. The ♥♥♥♥ing Japanese virgin he is. Anyway the boss battles do hand you a whole lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t after the first two, the parry system only works when it wants to, and the camera is not free form in the slightest, always locking back to its default position after trying to look around which kills the stealth mechanic. Also, THERE'S A ♥♥♥♥ING STEALTH MECHANIC. You may be reading that as if I'm excited when in reality I want to go to the specific ♥♥♥♥ face of a man who came up with that idea, hire a 400+lb transvestite hooker to sit on the man's face for at least 36 hours strait doing nothing but forcefully queefing all over his now uglied mug. Yes, I know the stealthing is easy to the skilled but ♥♥♥♥ him specifically like I'm the rain god that only rains upon that flaky ♥♥♥♥♥ in the coffee shop. The game isn't taxing until you turn up msaa to 8x and that CPU death setting to its highest setting. The game is locked at 60fps and has dodgy textures but who gives a damn? I don'.

The first thing that comes to mind is that this game is not very demanding at all so a lot of computers should be able to play this.Second is that the story is awesome, with loads of unique characters and an interesting story for raiden pact with metal gears and MEMES (once you play you will get the memes thing).Third is that they do a job making game mechanics for the Metal Gear franchise's Raiden, the bad a$$ cyborg ninja we all know and love to step up and fight in his own war.Fourth is the soundtrack. The sound track is AMAZING, each boss has a perfect soundtrack that really captivates you.boooohooooooo. Time for the reasons I dont like this game (there pretty dumb though). Raiden pulls some stupid impossible feats (not gonna say the feats for spoiler reasons but they are really cool) as awesome as they may be they just wouldent work. Second is that a lot of the time youre doing the same thing over and over and over again and it feels a little repetetive. to slash youre way through a scycraper with floors of enemys that you have to fight or sometimes sneak youre way through.Overall this is one of the best games I've ever played and would recomend it to everybody."

However, the game expands on the idea of cooking into a whole new open world, first person, Havok physics engine based, Unreal Tournament HD Vision, EA Sports; it's in the game, hamburger flipper. Though the game is critcially acclaimed to be promoting of the fast food genre in video games, I believe that it promotes our Lord and Savior Solid Snake. If you didn't notice, the first two words of this game, ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,"" is an anagram for ""ANAL SEX,"" also known as Solid Snake's favorite side dish. Solid Snake also makes appearances in past METAL GEAR games, such as Cooking Mama: Pirate Ride and Wolfenstein. You would also think that this game's developers made it on Earth, but you're more wrong than a Chinese man not enjoying his fresh cooked dog (Call of Duty Dog).Years later, after playing this game in Full Vision Audio by Mountain Dew(TM), I found out that my dad had already completed this game, and of course by the laws of, not only physics, but also chemistry, that I had already played the game. I had wasted a good deal of time and money to construct the spaceship in order to watch this near a black hole so time could go by faster since the new Superman movie was seriously boring, but then all of a sudden Batman intruded. I had to take out my handy dandy notebook and write the names of everyone near me at the time on it, then they all died (happily of course). Of course, this feature is DLC and you can only buy it if you have the latest version of the XBOX ONE COMMAND MODULE.A few hours later, I told my friends that I could not ""yeet."" They murdered me to death, but of course I managed to make my way out of that sticky situation. Of course, how could I die but come back to life. ""That's impossible, of course!"" you would say. But of course, you're wrong. You would think that, of course, I died. However, of course I didn't die. The projectory that I set, of course, had went off course. This off course trajectory, of course, would cause a semi-modular menstruation by the off course airplane that I constructed, of course. On the contrary, I managed to, safely of course, steer myself on course, instead of off course, to an, of course, safe position. In that position, of course, I was not off course so I was able to, of course, live. If you don't get how I lived, of course, then you are, of course, off course in your thoughts on how everything works (of course).Centuries pass as Gaben finally gives me back my $7.49 that I payed for this game. However, it is not adjusted for inflation. I got 20 ruble back, but 20 ruble now is only .003 ruble back then. I ask my dad to sue, but my dad said, ""Sue? What you need Sue for?"" I told him Gaben make♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He said, ""Vodka."" Dad then was kill.After my dad's funeral, I had to counterract the off course of my life into a new direction. I moved to the United States and gained around 700 pounds. With these pounds, I moved to the Great Britain and rented an apartment. There I began my career as an artist, and here I am.This game taught me all the basics of football without the hassle of waiting for my opponent to play E4 on his first turn as white. 10/10"

Also, it is Platinum's FIRST PC game, stuff like that underlines where higher companies like Rockstar have failed. Regarding Free Blade Mode, if you just stick to Left & Right Click you'll do fine but physically swooping the mouse to do cuts with your sword while it works I used it wrong, you just use the mouse to line up exactly where you want to cut & simply *click*. I was using it the way my 360 controller is used, while it works that way it was not the only way it could be used.Yes, it is short but it seems designed in such a way where replaying the game is fun, the boss fights are quite well done & the OST fits with it too. You'll be fighting a boss, listening to the lyrics it seems to be from that bosses point of view.

,Recommended,235460,8648530,"Posted: 10 January, 2014",all,Luke,"Firstly, let me just say what an utterly amazing port of a fantastic game this is. I cannot fault it one bit, except for not being able to bind actions to my mouse.GameplayFast, fluid,funand has really story driven cutscenes to mix it up. Ah yes, cutscenes. There are a LOT of them. Personally I love them - I play games for the story they tell and to be a part of it.Parry SystemThe parry system is the first thing youmustmaster. It is essential to playing this game. Many different types of enemies will let you know when they're about to perform a parryable attack and most of the time they're uninterruptable, so  you really need to parry those attacks. It takes a little bit of time to learn it, but once you have it, you're set to go.CombosThis is where the fun is. The various combo attacks you can perform are highly satisfying and very stylish, all being able to parry cancel out of without a hitch (except for strong blade finisher/Pincer attacks). You purchase them (along with weapons and upgrades) with an ingame credit 'BP'. You're able to equip them or unequip them once you've purchased them. This can be particularly useful if you get an ability without knowing what it does exactly, and then once using it prefer not to use it.SlicingSlicing has to be the most stylised and over-glorified ability in this game. It is so satisfying it will make you cry tears of joy while getting 500+ hit combos and slicing a fool into 400 pieces. It is very rewarding and is key to certain encounters within the game. Or, you could slice a watermelon into 115 pieces. The possibilities are endless!StealthBeing part of the Metal Gear franchise, you'd expect some form of stealth ops in this game. However, stealth play in this game is completely optional, you are not forced to sneak around. However, if you do choose to, you will find it mildly boring or highly amusing. There's no crouching or 'prone' movements to help you feel stealthy, which I personally don't like. I wont spoil for when it's fun, you will see while playing!CollectablesThere are numerous VR Training terminals hidden throughout the game world, as well as many item boxes and 'easter eggs'. By easter eggs, I may or may not be refering to naughty posters on the wall. Ahem.Pros* Great, stylish combat* Excellent story* Fantastic environments* Music. The music in MGR:R isamaaaaazzzzzziiiiiiiinnnnnnnnng. I'm not even joking!* Extensive upgrade system with multiple skins and weapons to purchase (with ingame credits)* Epic boss battles* Amazing visualsCons* I've found you are unable to use 1920x1080 resolution - it defaults to 1280x720 even after selecting 1920x1080.* No mouse binds (but you can live without that, really)* At first you're thrown into the deep end. This can lead you to getting overwhelmed until you learn the combat system.* Somewhat useless sub-weapons (grenades etc)ConclusionI personally haven't finished the game yet (currently on the last boss.. what I think is the last boss. Pre-DLC) but from what I've experienced thus far is a rollercoaster of fun, style and joy. The music brings the battles to life and the combos are so well animated. There are a lot of variety of enemies to keep your wits going and pulse beating while trying to hit those massive combo numbers and parrying at that crucial moment to avoid breaking the combo chain.If you like the genré of hack 'n' slash this game will be a very nice addition to your collection. I highly recommend it."

Needed to download a mod to fix it, otherwise it is a good PC port. Looks good and runs really, really well.Gameplay was interesting, seemed like it's what Star Wars The Force Unleashed should have been all along. It can get fun at parts, but blocking is a chore; you have to press Up+B to block attacks, but the game constantly confuses this as your attack move, making you constantly get hit despite trying to block.Cinematics were excellent (although they take up dozens of GB in your drive) and very well animated and directed; but dialogue was WAY too long, almost to the point of parody (or is it?). Bad voice acting everywhere. Story was insane, but I gather that Raiden is the series' equivalent to Shadow the Hedgehog, and enjoyed various points in the story for how hype they were.Game is intended to be replayed, with you constantly getting better, unlocking better gear and getting better scores. If you want an action game in your library, it's a great choice."

I have currently played through the game one and i’m planning a second play through. My first playthrough took around 8 hours. I dont know weather to proud It took me two days to beat the game or sad I played 8 hours of one game over the weekend.The story of the game is that a was has just ended. You are a bodyguard for some rich politician. Its take place in a dystopian future where technology has become very advance. You are Raiden who is a badass cyborg with a big sword. Some other badass cyborgs attack your car and they kidnap the politician and kill him despite your best efforts. They killed him because, he was passing and act that would ban certain types of war. The war lords did not like this and they hired a hit on him. Later you figure that the people who killed him are really bad and they and are killing kids who living in third world countries and they take their brain and put them in cyborgs. You put a stop to this. I would say if you are very big on story in game the story is only ok.The gameplay of this game is flawless. The third person hack and slash feels very natural and the parry system is easy to learn. The combos are all easy to execute. Also each level of the game has parts of combat that specific to that part of the game. When you fight the tutorial boss you jump from missile to missile then you run on top of him with your sword while slicing him to bits. Each level feels like the developers spent a long time working on its and feels awesome. The camera angles were great and the every fight felt good. This is easily the game best feature. I would say the only thing that needs work is the stealth. There was no crouch button that helped you go slow.The graphics of the game were also amazing. My outdated build still ran this game at a high frame rate while keeping the game looking great. All the lighting and textures were crisp and the game was very immersive. This is possibly the best PC port I have ever played.Yet another amazing part of this game was its sound. The kinesthetics of slicing some cyborg to bits was greatly complemented by the sound. Whenever you hit someone its sounded like it hurt. It felt real. The music of the game also greatly complemented the game. It has a kind of emo rock music that makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ The music worked. There was never a soundtrack that felt out of place.All in all this game is my favorite game I have ever played. It was well done and I recommend that everyone buys it who has not already."

,Recommended,235460,13435648,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Fish,"Revengeance is worth every penny whether you pay full price or get it for 6 bucks in a steam sale. Just a couple of things you should be aware of first.1: The camera is your worst enemy. The stealth elements are made unnecessarily complicated by the camera. It will not stay the position to which you move it, it will zoop around to face forward in about 2 seconds. If you intend to use some of the stealth elements, be prepared to constantly wiggle your aim back and forth to keep your eye on the prize.2: The game is pretty damned short, with chapter 4 being disproportionately longer and more difficult than the rest. The DLC should help as well. Be warned that Blade Wolf's DLC is much more stealth oriented than Sam's. Many disliked it for that reason, I loved it for that reason.3: In the final battle, you will be using an unfamilar weapon which drains energy much, much faster than the typical main weapon. You will be expected to line up and cut an object thrown at you 3 or 4 times in rapid succession. You do not need to line up all of the boxes (you'll know what I mean as you play), you can miss one or two.Now get out there and jump on missiles for the first time since Twin Snakes."

There were alot of fun moments for example the second boss involves cutting a large breasted woman into many many pieces. (a part which i especially enjoyed) However the parrying system involves a fidley manauver where you have to flick the right stick in the direction of your attacker and press x (xbox controler) at the same time this dosent seem too bad but considering that x is also the light attack button. This means that if you timing is wrong insted of parrying an attack you will thrust your face towards the enemy who is about to attack you basiacally serve yourself to the enemy on a plate. Other than this minor anoyance there are not to many other problems my biggest pet peeve is the length of the missions the first few missions are rather long. The first three missions around an hour each however towards the end they start to get lazy and make missions that are just boss fights and cut scenes (the jet stream sam mission) they slightly make up for this with the final boss fight which is one of the longest and hardest moments in a game i have ever experienced thats not to say i dident enjoy it. in conclusion i enjoyed my time with metal gear rising and would defenetly recomend it to anone who enjoyes hack and slash games with a twist of metal gear.

,Recommended,235460,14396380,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,Shippo1992,"First of all, let me say that I was pretty happy when I found out this was coming over to Steam. I had played it on console not long after it came out and really enjoyed it. As a big fan of Metal Gear, it is definitely different from your typical Metal Gear game and what I'm used to with Metal Gear. However, that said, I still had a lot of fun with the game and think it to be a pretty good game. It's not as long as other Metal Gear games, but it's still a good length, considering it's a hack and slash game and all. I was pretty impressed with the music as well, which I thought to suit the game good and the kind of music that definitely puts you in the mood for the fights and slashing away at the enemies. With visuals, I was impressed with them as well. The Metal Gear series never seems to disappoint, especially when it comes to visuals. With visuals considered and when I saw the system requirements for this game, I was really sure I wasn't going to be able to run this game. However, I was able to run this game at 1080p resolution and high settings with a good framerate. Essentially, I was pretty impressed with the great optimization of this game. And then there's the story. Despite being a hack and slash game with focus on action, for a hack and slash game, I thought it had a pretty good story. I wasn't too shocked about it, but it was nice as though remaining true as it game to the Metal Gear series, despite being a hack and slash game. All in all, I had a great time with this game and would definitely have another go at it. I think it's a pretty great game and would recommend it to my friends."
,Recommended,235460,13980337,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,Drivershaft,"Just to preface this review, this is not your typical Metal Gear game, there's a reason this is called Metal Gear Rising and not Metal Gear Solid. This is a semi-canon side story along the same vein as Metal Gear: Ghost Babel or Metal Gear Acid, but that by no means makes it lesser in quality than a traditional Metal Gear Solid game.Gameplay:This is a game that can be easily approached in the same way as a traditional hack and slash action game, you have your traditional quick and strong attacks, a dodge button (that you have to unlock via the customization menu) a counter attack, a ""devil trigger"" mode called Jack the Ripper mode and harder difficulties that can make the game insanely hard, and all of these elements combine into fun hack and slash action.Where Metal Gear Rising separates itself from other Hack and Slash action games is in its inclusion of blade mode, when the game was first revealed the concept of Zandatsu or ""cut at will"" and ""cut what you will"" was the prime gameplay inclusion that set the game apart, and it works beautifully. Throughout the game you can use blade mode to cut enemies in specific places. Most of the time this is used to cut out electrolytes to heal himself and recharge his blade mode meter. You can also use blade mode to cut off specific pieces of an enemies armor to make them easier to fight, as well as cut off arms of enemies for collectables, and it is also used effectively in boss battles to make the player cut with accuracy.There is also the inclusion of optional stealth during sections of this game, most notably a section where the player is put into an area engulfed in darkness. You can perform takedowns of enemies if you sneak up on them behind. It can become very fullfilling to scope out a map and enemies routes and positions and find a way to take them all down to avoid having a traditional hack and slash fight. This is highlighted exceptionally well in the Blade Wolf DLC included that makes stealth takedowns almost required to get through the DLC.Story: This is a weaker area of the game compared to the gameplay portion. Metal Gear is renowned for having a gripping and overpowering story, but gameplay was definitely the focus of this game. The story takes place four years after MGS4 and you play as Raiden as a cyborg ninja. The introduction level basically puts you in his armor from MGS4 and then you get new armor you play as for the entire game. Raiden is tasked with taking out the Desperado PMC, he's on a personal quest for vengeance. The story is passable but ultimately forgettable, there are a handful of mentions of previous metal gear characters but nothing much worthwhile, the most exciting tie to Metal Gear is the inclusion of an aged version of a character during a later portion of the game that is very well handled. Honestly the worst part of the story is a character named George who is an annoying character, has an annoying voice actor and has insufferable lines.Replayability: There is so much included content in this game and the gameplay is so fun that you'll keep coming back to it over and over. There's unlockable costumes, artwork, models, swords, wigs that alter gameplay, side weapons, vr missions, moves. Tons of codec conversations and VR Missions after the main story is done, ridiculously difficult hard modes, an amazing ranking system, and the DLC from the console game is included in this steam package automatically, including the gray fox DLC.Music: It's the best soundtrack to a game I've ever played, I don't know how they thought of it's inclusion but it's genius."

I didn't know what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on most of the time and there were a lot of references to previous events that I can only assume were in previous MGS games. Though something tells me this is probably just as wacky to MGS fans as well. I mean I have always heard there were some silly elements to MGS but it surely can't be this silly?I have to say it is kind of refreshing to see something that is so wholly itself, full of character and flavor even if it is kind of bad. But it is bad in the way that you cannot tell if the game knows it's dumb. This is one of those games that sometimes seems really clever and then sometimes seems purposefully dumb, it is just all over the place, which gives it an endeering charm.But, it's an action game so enough with the talk about the story and tone, is it a fun game? Yes. It's a fun and fairly challanging game. I'd recomend anyone just looking for a mindless hack and slash to go ahead and play on easy because normal was still fairly hard and you can't change the difficulty level after you've chosen. Though if the idea of a fairly challenging hack and slash game gets you really excited then this is the game for you."

I, for one, certainly hope so. The camera angles are a bit strange and clunky, but easy to adapt to. Sometimes the camera just goes bananas, like when you get knocked back in to a wall that you didn't realize was there. Definitely meant to be played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard work just fine. Havn't bothered to change any controls, the you can definitely remap keys (or, at the very least, see what keys do what). Parry takes some getting used to performing, but overall flows great. The boss fights can be difficult at first, but once you figure out the strategy, they die fairly easily. This game takes place 4 years after the events of MGS4.The most important thing to remember is that this is Metal Gear Rising: Lightning Bolt Action. NOT Metal Gear Solid: Tacticial Espionage Action. While there are stealth elements available, this installment relies more on fast-paced action.I noticed a lot of people complaining about the 'lack' of graphical options and resolutions, however the game plays at 1920x1080, and has more than 'a few' graphical options.A solid 10/10 from Hido Kojima and Platinum Studios. And for 30$, it is definitely worth it.On a side note, Platinum studios has already released a notice indicating the 'always on' DRM was not intended, and actually a bug. It was patched on January 10th, today. Source:http://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-rising-pc-online-requirement-is-a-bug-not-drm-update/1100-6417053/"

I played it using my keyboard and mouse and was satisfied with how it handled, but the option is also there to use a handcontroller instead if you prefer.It took me a couple of days to complete the game on Easy (took me about 13 hours of total gametime), and I feel it was worth the effort all the way."

This game has pretty much no tutorial. I found out everything by accident with lots of botton mashing.

There is a simple splendor that you reach as you go into slow motion and shred ememies into the individual elements that make up their bodies.This game is packed to the brim with over the top anime styled action scenes and cheesy B movie dialogue which is does not detract from the game at all it makes it 10 times more apealing!The bosses are Probably the best part of the game though, as you would expect of a metal gear game they are creative and have over the top accents and not to mention the ♥♥♥♥ing music that correses your ear drums whilst you fight them creating a bubble of Hell yeah! which takes you to the summit of mount olympus!If there are flaws in this game i havnt seen them because i was having such a good ♥♥♥♥ing time.Do you like fun?

,Recommended,235460,14051014,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,Faizyr,"This is my favorite game of 2013, since there were barely any good games that year.if you are into spectical fighters like devil may cry , bayonetta or god of war you will probably like this game alote.STORY:the story is pretty linear although that doesn't make it bad in anyway i think it actually commends it of sorts.It's a story that is very different from other games and quite disgusting in someways  including brains ;Dyou might get more attached with the main charecter with this story or simply skip everything if you are here for the mechanics and fighting. you are not missing much if never played any metal gear game.(i should add that you don't need any knowledge of previous metal gear games to understand the story,   it is in the future and almost everything is new in this game)Music :the music is absolutely amazing which has metal and rock in it, which is probably the only game that makes sense having it in and doesn't sound wierd at all , its a soundtrack you could listen with your friends and not get eyeballed at why you are listenning to this :Pthe music is also dynamic so depends and what you are doing the music will change to a melodic state or into a guitar solo for example.MECHANICS:the focused mechanic of this game is that you can cut freely with your sword in anyway you want  //blade mode/// by simple holding a key  or button and then slash  precisely where you want it to  go. you can do some pretty crazy slashes including seperating enemies body parts one by one, and if you do it precisely you get more points which you can use to upgrade your charecter.every  enemy you see will have somekind of way to defeat them with blade mode which will be needed to master on harder difficulties.Gameplay :with that sword slashing goodness mechanic that gameplay standsout from other games in this genre.but as usuall you have a kind of a combo list to know all attacks which there aren't as many as i would personally like.But they are all pretty fun and synergizes pretty well with the mechanics,when you fight there will be an arena style of a fighting area : you cannot proceed until you destroy all enemies or something like that.you the sword is not the only weapon you use in this game , you also have secondary weapons and side arms.Controls :the controls are quite clunky if you are trying to use blade mode and such so i recommend having a gamepad to play this one , it will be alote easiersecondary weapons being something that you can combo with your sword   and sidearms something like rocketlaunchers for flying enemies or grenades.DIFFICULTY :the dfficulty of this game is quite great for players that like a challenge and would like to either replay or start from nothing again.I recommend starting the game on Hard or above because : hard difficulty is the actually normal difficulty originally, if you play anything under that it will be  too easy and unchallenging if you are not new  to this genre.every higher difficulty will not make the enemies have more hp. the enemies will simply do more damage, will dodge more, and try to counter attack you,will try to surround you and will have even more attack moves.The best thing of this difficulty system that you also do as much damage to them as much as they do to you with counter attacks so it's kinda fair. You can pretty much kill every enemies with one  counter attack,You can almost one shot bosses in the game if you are good at counter attacks (counter attack method :basically attacking at the same time the enemy is attacking, doing it succesfully will either kill the enemy or deal alote of damage)PC port :The port from the consoles is actually good which is quite something from a developer's first try on a pc portit has all its basic things like anti aliasting which  helps  although the graphics were barely changed from the consoles , so you will see some pretty ugly pixelated textures.and for some reason there is not 1920 x 1200 and up resolution support so keep that in mind .the game runs absolutely smooth with everything on highest setting.i hate giving a verdict but here it goes.The game in general  is amazingly fun and will make you replay it atleast one more time, for its crazy gameplay and the most fun boss fights you will encounter in any game although with its lack of depth  that this game needed like switching between weapons on the fly , more attack moves ,and linear and almost uninteresting maps, metal gear rising  is a 8/10 in my books.it is right next to beyonetta for its crazyness and charm.(if i left anything out let me know, i forget sometimes :c    )"

The story keeps you interested and the gameplay is intense and exciting.The game can make you feel powerless when it wants to and is unforgiving when you don't have a concept down. For example; the first boss I didn't quiet understand the blocking mechanics which made the fight almost impossible but it teaches you that it is nessiary because you really wouldn't be able to do much later in the game if you don't master it.There are lots of quick time events. I'm not a huge fan of them but they are fitting to the game play. There are lots of different enemies and they all are very diverse.Now the first few stages your mission is not really clear but the story is in pretty good motion by stage three.There are some referances to other MGS games however you don't need any of the knowledge to understand the story, which is nice.This is not a sneak around game, however, it gives you opertunites to be steathly...which can be akward and clunky sometimes. The game was designed more for combat, which is smooth and well thought out. The game is also rewarding. For example: when you get to fight the people who bullied you around in the starting stages.Overall: Very appealing game, you can tell a lot of time when into creating it. Has a good length to it.

,Recommended,235460,23311676,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,Scopedog,"Even after finishing it, I’m still not clear whether Metal Gear Rising is a hilariously on-point parody of all Metal Gear’s excesses, or simply the stupidest game ever made. Everything is a 13 year olds idea of cool – from the squealing, gleefully earnest crapness of the butt rock soundtrack to the ludicrous implausibility of some of the cutscenes – Raiden starts the game piledriving a robot a hundred times his size while wearing cybernetic high heels.Sometimes though, you’ve got to give in to your inner 13 year old boy – and you’d have to have a heart of stone not to be entertained by the preposterous spectacle of carnage on display here. There’s a robot dog with a chainsaw tail that waxes philosophical, and a nanomachine enhanced battle senator who bears a suspicious resemblance to♥♥♥♥♥♥Cheney. There is a literal giant robot crab that you have to cut in half with one of its own 30 foot pincers. The English voice acting and scripting is completely horrible and absolutely recommended over the Japanese.However, this is developed by Platinum games – and they marry that excess with razor sharp, beautifully crafted mechanics. Everything here is in service to the blade – dodging here is replaced by parrying, which can be chained into an attack of your own if timed perfectly. More so even than Platinum’s other games, this is a game that rewards aggression and skill, with every defensive manoeuvre a beat that forms a part of the overall tempo of combat.The big gimmick here is “blade time” – Raiden can slow time and slice in multiple directions (using the analogue slick, or a mouse if you’re mental) to artfully dismember opponents. This had the potential to be a cool, but ultimately wasted feature – Platinum have made it a core component of the game and mastering it is key to success. Most of the harder enemies (and bosses) need to be beaten up a bit before they can be turned into cyber confetti, and many will have parts that can be cut off as they are weakened which will alter the way the enemy fights. This adds a welcome tactical layer to every fight – do you focus on the gorilla guy until you can chop his arms off disabling his extremely annoying crush attack, or deal with the combo breaking rocket launcher guys first?At least, that’s what it’s like once the game clicks. For whatever reason, the game is needlessly obtuse when it comes to explaining it’s mechanics, and dumps you in the deep end with some very hard encounters and one of the nastiest “wake up call” bosses I’ve ever seen. Absolutely crucial information is glossed over (such as the zandatsu, a mid battle method of healing done (naturally) by tearing out your opponent’s cybernetic spine), and a quick ten minutes with an FAQ is recommended to fully explain the basics.There is also a strange, somewhat vestigial stealth component, made more difficult than it should be by a fidgety camera. This is thankfully entirely unnecessary – while it will often be better to tactically assassinate a couple of difficult enemies before engaging properly, it’s equally possible to just go in boot first and carry the day with skilful swordwork. Both the stealth and the clunky, unnecessary sub weapon system are the only hints of this game’s troubled development before the reigns were handed over to the ever reliable Platinum.A quick note on the PC port – it has a maximum resolution of 1080p, but runs at a solid 60fps on any half decent hardware. There has been basically no attempt to improve this for the PC – the environments are dull and textures very low res, all concessions to getting the thing to run at a stable 60FPS on console. It plays flawlessly, and in motion it still looks pretty decent but it’s definitely not going to be winning any beauty contests.The game also comes complete with the two DLC where you get to play from the perspective of Jetstream Sam and Blade Wolf. These are short but fun vignettes that add a bit of value – had I paid full price on console I might be less well disposed to them (they’re almost exclusively recycled levels and bosses), but for free, they’re a neat little bonus."

MGR is probably the best example of a game being more than just the sum of its parts. The combat is a bit button-mashy (with slowly reacting AI) on lower difficulties, map design is mostly point A to point B, and the weapon variety is very limited. Somehow the game overcomes its shortcomings by combining ridiculous over-the-top cutscenes, a diverse OST with tracks ranging from traditional MGS-style ambience to blood-pumping boss themes, and a cast of uniquely difficult bosses that all feel like properly fleshed out worthy opponents for your anime cyborg ninja.Western devs are trying so hard to remove bosses and ""video gamey"" elements that when something like MGR comes along it feels like a breath of fresh air despite doing nothing revolutionary. MGR is a video game made by people who actually play video games and it shows. Bosses will beat techniques into you and make you get good, only to have the next boss require you to ""unlearn"" and adapt your previous strategies. MGR's bosses are an outstanding example of good game design in every way possible... I honestly can't remember the last time I played a game with such memorable boss fights.MGR manages to feel like an extension of MGS while standing on its own strengths. With a plausible plotline (within the MGS universe at least), charismatic bosses, a likeable supporting cast, and actual character development in an action game, MGR creates something unique by smoothly melding a bevy of genre staples. I don't know if MGS fans will want to pick this up, but its hard to deny the adrenaline-pumping awesomeness of Metal Gear Rising."

Jebus, this thing is huge, 24 gigs, that my friend, for some of us with poor infrastructure is torture- My personal meh moment - no Japanese voice, I found the English VA average at the most, not bad, but you know... (I looked it up earlier, apparently its a contract thing so they couldn't have the Japanese VA for the PC release)- Feels a bit short, yes there are replay values and it got that nice compact feeling without them trying to stretch it mindlessly, but I just wish there're few more chapters...

The crux of your enjoyment will really rely on how well you take to the parry system which isn't the easiest, yet still fun to use.Cool outfits and slight customization options for armor and different weapons. There're some Gray Fox items you can purchase that are super cool that, unfortunately, made me want to wear nothing else.Nice little side story with fun cameos. It definitely gets super wacky with the characters and combat proportions thanks to Raiden's cutting gimick.NEUTRALDifficulty is a bit weird on this one. Honestly I think this is a game you could really sink your feet into if you get a feel for it, but I don't think that will be a lot of people. Again I really think that enjoying this and getting a feeling of mastering the difficulties comes from perfecting the parry system, which I'm not a giant fan of. Also to get S ranks on combat sequences, you can't take damage. That's bound to be frustrating if you mess up like the 8th combat sequence during a stage.BADOhhh there's an elevator sequence that got me real salty in here. I'm not a huge fan of that one.SUMMARYOverall a fun experience that you should jump into if you're into the Metal Gear Solid universe. I played this after Metal Gear Solid 4 and had fun."

I got it because I love Metal Gear and played all Metal Gear Solid games so it would be nice to see what happened after MGS4, and I love the little references to MGS4.Continuing on to the actual review-y part.MGR:R is amazing in all aspects of a port, it's got good controls, all the DLC (Always a plus), a fun and unique gameplay. BUT. It's  really short, it'll take you about 6-8 hours. And it reused two bosses that you killed in R-04 before you kill the third boss. Sure, the music is awesome, sure I love these bosses but it really felt like the time in Metal Gear Solid on PS1 where you had the backtracking which would take about 2 hours doing that so. That's what I honestly felt. And I know you can beat all Metal Gear Solid games in 4-8 hours depending how you play and how cautious you are.The music is one of the greater parts of this game, it fits the tone of the game, it fits the Boss Battles.The story is one that I haven't seen in anything else, which is nice.The gameplay is the greatest thing I've played in a hack and slash, with Platinum Games clearly showing that they respect the franchise, that they actual did try and succeed making something good. Unlike some other developers that like to ruin the franchises when making a game for that franchise *cough* *cough* Ninja Theory *cough* *cough*There is one issue with this game. BUGS.

To put it in perspective, titular Metal Gear is a giant robot capable of launching nuclear warheads, in most games in the series it's fought near the end. Here? It's the first boss, and it only gets better from here. The combat is very fast-paced and rewarding, though the parry system is hard to get used to. Something that I must mention is the absolutelyBADASȘsoundtrack. I don't recall any songs from MGR that I disliked, and the final boss wouldn't be half as awesome without his theme.You will not regret playing this game.

As opposed to the standard formula of having swords like blunt weapons, Metal Gear Rising features ultra sharp high frequency blades which can cut through almost anything. Why should you care about that? Because it allows you cut through many things however you see fit. You can slice an enemy into a million pieces, while carefully directing your slices. In other words, the sword physics are amazing.It's mostly a combat driven game, but the story isn't bad, it also blurs the lines between good and evil, really making you question your character's motives. It has awesome boss battles and a great soundtrack that goes along with everything , it's a great game.

I have changed the review from 'not recommended' to 'recommended', but the body of the review review remains unchanged:I'd recommend just watching the cutscene movie on Youtube.The story is this game's strongpoint. It's a spectacle fighter, not a bad one, but it's lackluster. When you think 'spectacle fighter' you think of speed, flashy attacks, combos and just general badassery. Raiden brings badassery to the table in spades, something you'll see in cutscenes. This is why you can get all you need out of this game by watching the cutscene movie on Youtube.Spectacle fighters are all about speed. This game has that, for the most part. You'll be hacking and slashing through enemies with your sword in a fast, fairly good-looking manor. The thing is, there's no dodging. This is a HUGE problem. You can parry enemy attacks, most attacks, in fact. The problem is is that spectacle fighters are about dashing around and ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. The lack of dodging serverely limits this.Another problem with the game is the camera. Too much of the mob battles consist of running around dodging any attacks that may come your way while you try to sight your next target. Sure, there's a lock-on function that really helps in boss fights, but the camera is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The combat system is shallow. Just sprinting, left-clicking and right-clicking or if you use a controller it's just sprinting, hitting this button and hitting that button. There's an extra 'blade mode' that lets you control indivitual sword slashes, but it's a pretty shallow mechanic.If you can get past these flaws, this game will probably satisfy your needs, but those flaws are hard to get by. Like I said, you'd be better off just watching the cutscene movie on Youtube.+Badass protagonist+Badass antagonists+Philosophically robust+Cool swordplay+Sweet quicktime events-No dodging mechanic-Bad camera mechanics-Basic combat system"

A spin-off featuring Raiden from the metal gear solid games.It is good to note that this is a port from the console version of Revengence, with all included DLC. As far as ports go, this is a ace job. It runs smoothly with little to no problems. It responds to switching from keyboard to a controller almost instantly.The story is rather deep for a game of this genre (as of all metal gear games), and sometimes that actually can hurt the pace of the game. Sadly you can't have metal gear with a big story of sorts. I won't spoil anything for the readers however, so you can enjoy it to your hearts content.When it comes to the game's audio we have above average voice acting which can be a hit or miss depending on the person (for a japaneese game, i've heard FAR worse dubs. Listen to ""star ocean - The last hope"" english dubs and you'll be thankful for this) The soundtrack however  is FAR from average however. Each boss has awesome set themes for each of them and the music for the final boss fight is fantasticIt's difficalty is hard, but fair. Almost all attacks in the game are either avoidable or signaled to you in a way you can understand easily (enemy glows red = can be blocked. Enemy glows gold = dodge) While smaller enemies can be dispached with ease some of the larger and more complex ones can be rather punishing, especially if you are crowded by a group of them.One thing I Will have to say that in all metal gear games bosses have easily stood out in terms of awesome, and rising is no exception. Each boss is a well crafted battle with their own attacks, defense, taunts and arenas. We have bosses with multible arms that can be cut off to reduce their defense. Bosses with explosive shields and even ones that drive around with a mech the size of a city block.Pros- High Replayability- Great, solid combat- Amazing ability to cut any enemy to infinite number of parts (depending on how your PC can cope. Mine starts screaming at me pass 200+)- Epic Boss fights- Many unlockables and secerts- Awesome soundtrackCons- Minus Cutscenes, rather short (around 3 hours of solid gameplay).- Some combat details are missing, causing confusion for new players.- Pace sometimes distored by long cutscenes.Score - 8.8 / 10 - Pretty awesome for the first attempt at a action game in the world of metal gear. From the looks of things, a sequal will be in the making. Hopefully this sequal will be made before people start doing stupid things and then blame it on the nanomachines."

Whilst the story still has that weird-anime- political and social critizing- drama air about it, theres definetly less of it and bundled tighter together (but the anime stuff has been dialed up a notch).There is one thing tho that really made me reconsider giving this game a thumbs up. one of the last boss fights is so incredible boring and incredibly frustrating and I´ve played dark souls and bloodborne so im not new to hard bossfights but that one was so♥♥♥♥♥♥slurping annoing and heres why.The whole game you are used to more open enviroments when fighting then suddenly the game confines you to a small space and takes away camera controll from you, which really ♥♥♥♥s ya up since you can only move from side to side really and cant quite see where you are going which ended in me often running against an invisible wall as though my life depended on it (which it did) and me not noticing because the ♥♥♥♥ing camera basically twisted my neck 180 degress.

Does it have great and varied combat or is it challenging?No, no, no and no. However this game took me by surprise with how plain and simply fun it is.Combat system is lacking in some areas. While comboing is flashy and entertaining, usually it's better approach to just mash regular attacks. It isn't particularly hard either save for very few fights and ""stealth"" is just plain awful. But all this is made up by the fact that it just is way too fun to whack a giant mech-robot with a katana and in the end slice it into three billion little pieces. Yep, it's great. Music and characters also keep the same approach, they're rather bad, but just simply fun and fitting to this game. I've found myself widely smiling through most boss battles just due to the cheesy metal and sheer madness this game offers.As for visuals, game looks like it was made for consoles (and for a reason), but all in all visual style is interesting and good enough that lack of texture quality and some other aspects doesn't really bother. Game runs well on older hardware and as long as you have a decent computer you can push up most everything to highest. 1080p-> resolutions aren't supported though, so people with 2,5k and 4k displays might find it bit bothersome. I've moved back to 1080p monitors recently so can't say for sure if this has been fixed so don't shoot the messenger.Game isn't very long, but there's good 4-7 hours to play in story mode (much of that are cutscenes though) and a metric ton of optional content. Replayability is there too, you can buy upgrades and different weapons and outfits to allow slightly different gameplay 2nd time through. Personally I'm going through 3rd time and it's still pretty fun.If you enjoy spectacle fighters you will probably like this game, I know I do."

Namely, parrying is a technique which is particularly hard to master, but bosses and larger enemies will rock your world if you don't master it. This makes it in general extremely rewarding to pull off, and the ""Blade Mode"" thing adds a layer of uniqueness to the game, using the ability to cut robots and cyborgs into pieces with accuracy but, again, it's not that easy and takes some getting used to.However, the game commits the cardinal sin of making it realy easy to get stunlocked. If you take too many hits in a row and you haven't managed to successfully parry any of them, you get stunned. There is no dodge and you can't in any way move out of the way of an enemy's combo. When you are stunned, and you will be stunned A LOT, you need to mash WASD to get out of it. The problem is, you will almost always be caught in ANOTHER combo by the time you escape, and the damage mounts up really quickly.Also, the bosses are utterly obnoxious until you've figured out their attack patterns, especially one of the later bosses, a Metal Gear piloted by an insane American politician ( the writing's a bit wierd, btw) which is the low point of the game, because of terrible hitboxes that make it really hard to dodge its attacks.Still, a game well worth playing, even if all thw bosses are only hard because they take atvantage of the game's slightly awkward physics (I mean, there are bosses who run around you faster than the camera can keep up, and then completely blindside you. That's not fair, that's just rage fuel.)"

Want to turn a soldier into pulled pork? Go for it! Want to turn a giant mech into a huge pile of rubble? Have at it! Want to blow someone up with a rocket? There are plenty! Want to try to sneak in? Good luck!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Boss fights - Hardcore Epic. These are what stood out most for me in the game. I won't spoil anything but there is really nothing more epic than a 1 on 1 swordfight showdown between a couple of enhanced cyborgs to the death. Or perhaps a giant Mech?Regular Fights - Fun! Chop cyborgs, helicopters, mechs, Metal Gears, anything! Toss them around like ragdolls then cleave them in 2 (or 50) and rip out their spine just to face an endless hoard more of them! Things can get repetitive but that's only if you decide to make it that way. There are always many different ways to deal with situations!Stealth Factor - Not Practical. All MG games have stealth in them, but In the short time I've been playing, I've tried sneaking a few times. It is extremely difficult. There are ways to hide from certain enemies, but beyond that, sneaking is more of a wait for the guy to turn around and stab him, rather than other MG's approach of infiltration. I'm not saying it is impossible, it is just very hard and you have to be very patient. (And besides, why would you want to sneak in when you could just hack and slash fury your way through the front door?)Cutscenes/Story - Epic. It follows after the MGS games and into Raiden's story after MGS4. If you played that game, you'll definately want to know what he's doing after it. As for the cutscenes, I've never been disappointed by MG cutscenes. They always impress and I find myself watching them over and over... and over... and over... and over...Soundtrack - You like heavy metal? Good! This game has plenty of it! Nothing like cleaving your enemies to bits while listening to some hardcore metal.All in all, this game is extremely fast paced, hack and slash style, with a storyline to die for. If you're an avid MG fan, this is a must have, even if you don't like hack/slashers the story is worth it. To those new to the MG series, a few things in this game won't make sense, but that leads me to point you to go get them! MGS is literally one of the greatest stories I have experienced in my gaming life. From happiness, to sadness, to despair, to hope, to anything you can think of. I love the MGS game and would recommend them all to anyone."

I love the series myself, but just know this is a spin-off, and stealth is discouraged in this. Despite this, though, the game still retains the humor and learning curves of the main series extremely well."

Not too story driven and at the end, I felt like I was watching a 2016 political debate. Nonetheless, playing as Raiden has never felt so good. The controls are smooth and the combat handles surprisingly well with the lack of a lock-on.If you do decide to pay attention to the story, it is interesting enough. Just don't expect much in that department. MGR does have a good amount of good old Metal Gear humor. That alone would have kept me happy. However, there is more. The boss fights are genuinely challenging and the soundtrack for this game, oh my lord the soundtrack. Just youtube it if you want a taste of the epic music you get to listen to while you become the most badass ninja known to mankind.I could say more, but I'm bored and this is my first ever review.

,Recommended,235460,8637011,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,LiquidOcelot,"I've played this game before on PS3 and while I technically haven't played the PC version for very long, I skipped around to the most major boss fights and played them with the highest graphical settings to test how well this version works relative to the original versions on consoles. This is not a review about the actual gameplay, though to keep it short, it's one of the best games of its kind to date. For reference, I am running the game on a gaming laptop, a Lenovo Y580 with an NVIDIA GTX 660M and an Intel Core i7 3630QM with eight hyperthreaded 2.4ghz cores over 4 physical cores.Graphically, the game supports very few options for resolution, but it helpfully defaults to a windowed 720p setting that mirrors the look of the original game and lets you expand from there. Only a few basic resolutions seem to be supported at present, though they might be adding more in the future and have explicitly stated that they intend to listen to the demand for them. Outside of that, basic options for Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) are present as well as inverting horizontal AND vertical mouse axis controls if you don't use a controller, editing every single keybinding in the game, and settings for shadows, ""Zangeki"" (the number of cuts you can make to objects), ""Zantime"" (the time that these cutted objects stay on screen), as well as your standard Anisotropic Filtering and Blur settings.For me, the game loaded with the highest settings possible as the default, maybe as a result of auto-detect or something similar, but this was only for the windowed, 720p resolution that the game has by default. I set it to my monitor's default of 1080p full-screen and it quickly adjusted without delay. Upon loading a level, I couldn't help but notice that the shadows were incredibly well-detailed. This is already an immense improvement over the console port which had such low resolution shadows that it felt like rust on an otherwise shiny trophy. The game seems to be either capped at 60FPS or it uses forced VSync, though the difference shouldn't really matter as the game is, as the logo and promotional materials might suggest, lightning fast as it is.Playing with a 360 controller feels just as natural as the console version that I am accustomed to while looking and running better, but I was surprised to find out that Platinum at least tried their best with the keyboard controls. As usual, the mouse controls the camera while left-click is a light/horizontal attack and the right-click is a heavy/vertical attack. WASD moves, Space jumps, CTRL is weirdly set to Ninja Run, and Shift is set to Blade Mode. 1, 2, and 3 are set to the more secondary options like changing your weapons or listening to codec conversations. If you absolutely cannot use a controller, these controls will do for the most part and I was surprised at how easily I got used to them.That said, there is one major problem, and that is how the game handles the mouse movement in general. It uses some kind of reverse mouse acceleration not unlike the iffy Dark Souls PC port that we were given some time ago before it was ""fixed"" by the community, making all of your mouse movements feel more like an analog stick and less like an actual mouse. This can take some time getting used to and it's far from the end of the world, but the most major consequence of this is how the game handles the lock-on system. Using a controller, the right-stick lets you switch targets if you enable the lock-on system, but since the mouse is essentially mapped to the right analog stick, any slightest mouse movement can trigger switching the enemy you're targeting. If there were some way that you could only switch targets using something like the mouse wheel instead of actual mouse movement, it would be infinitely more tolerable, but it's also possible to get used to the current scheme.In closing, the game is a surprisingly decent console port that feels very optimized for my system, but I cannot speak for others. I had no trouble reaching the cap of 60FPS by lowering the Anti-Aliasing somewhat and the improved graphical quality really speaks volumes if you can look close enough to notice it. Sometimes there is some slowdown, but as somebody who is intimately used to the console version, this is expected and it is significantly less noticeable on the PC than consoles where it would go down to what looked like 15-20FPS in some scenes. If you use an NVIDIA GPU and an Intel CPU like I do, take this as a solid (no pun intended) recommendation. It's a superb game made better by a surprisingly well-optimized PC port that only needs a few control tweaks to be completely playable without a controller handy.PS: If you've played it before and want to unlock everything from the get-go, enter the Konami Code on the title screen!"

You've been warned.Other than this, the game is nice looking, fast, exaggerated (jumps, runs, etc), compulsively crunchy and funny to play (except for those ♥♥♥♥ing metallic gozzilas).I think it would be easier to handle with an XBOX controller.Keyboard and mouse make it a tad difficult to combine samurai run and katana attack modes, which are fundamental for everything.Well, it was fun until the second big bad boss appeared just after the few beginning scenes.Namco is well known for doing games that way, with impossible bosses to beat but, man, give me a breath. You are chaining those ♥♥♥♥ing bosses too often!.Bored of impossible fight with messy controls.Maybe for console teenagers worth the time you spend fighting again those impossible bosses.Not for me.

His ripper personality I find is a bit cheesey but luckily he doesn't have much dialogue like this.Only gripe is the camera in some instances but for me this is very minor and doesn't impact the gameplay much.If you like fast paced action games ala Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Vanquish.

,Recommended,235460,14583096,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,Air,"After having finished the game, I'm honestly not sure if I liked it in the end or not.The gameplay mechanics were a mix of good and bad concepts. The slicing mechanics and boss fights were usually very fun but getting stunned, having to do so many quicktime events, and extremely linear levels got in the way of that.I personally felt like the writing was pretty bad. It was so clichéd and predictable. It also happened to be hilarious to me(especially the part with Armstrong at the end) and I couldn't tell if the writers were trying to be silly with the story or if they were honestly trying to make a serious story at times. I might be holding the story up against other Metal Gear games, but I did expect a bit more out of this game in term of story, even if Kojima didn't work on this.The graphics of the game were good, not anything breathtaking but they were good enough for the purpose of the game, no problems there. However, I do not like the usage of pre-rendered cutscenes in this day and age for pretty much any game, especially considering that the cutscenes here were of the same graphical level of the game itself. The cutscenes also take up ~21GB of about 25GB of the game's data.All in all, to me, it felt like a typical hack-and-slash game with a few new ideas. It feels so much like other games of the genre. If you're looking for that, then this might be just for you, but you might be disappointed if you're looking for a Metal Gear game to equal the rest."

Monsoon talked about memes - this spawned two; ""Nanomachines, son"" and ""RULES OF NAYCHA!""Within minutes of starting the game you'll be fighting a RAY, running across its tail and bisecting it for all it was worth, then you'll fight robot dogs, a chick with more arms than she knows what to do with (and a rack that she does know what to do with), a Registeel with double sai, a dude with explosive armor, a tricked out samurai that half looks like Ezio, and the most badass senator ever.The only downsides also include the lack of better textures - they're the same as they've always been - and the size of the file, falling just short of the 25 GB mark, but then again, it is value for money - you get all the story packs which would push the console size to 15GB anyway.

It has an interesting enough narrative but is made special by its frantic and addictive third-person hack and slash combat. Honestly, I\'ve never seen a game do exactly what this game does. The ability to slash and chop your foes into tiny little pieces (literally) while performing insane adrenaline-fueled combos makes for some really addictive gameplay. It was often difficult to put the controller down. The combat is so good, in fact, that I found myself growing increasingly impatient with the dialogue sections where you are forced to stand and talk to one of your associates over radio. I literally wanted to be in combat at all times. Eventually I gave up on following the story and just spammed whatever button allowed me to skip through the dialogue. The story just was not interesting enough for me to care.Unfortunately, the weak story and annoying babble between Raiden and Doktor is not the end of this game\'s problems. An incredibly unruly camera plagues some of the more intense fight sequences in the game to the point where you will often be killed because your camera is stuck in a wall and you cannot see your opponent winding up their attack. I got very good at blocking and parrying but when I can\'t see my opponent because my camera is in an entirely different room than my character, there is nothing I can do. This might be less of a problem on the easier difficulties, but on hard, an unruly camera is a real killer. Other than having one of the worst cameras I\'ve ever seen in a third person action game, period, there is some severe laziness and just mouth-gaping moments of incredible unfairness. Keep in mind I only played the game on hard, so perhaps these are less of an issue on normal or easy. There is a checkpoint system at the start of each boss, but each boss has multiple stages that you must go through before you can defeat them. If you die on the final stage, you must start the entire fight over. This isn\'t anything other games haven\'t done before, so consider this a minor complaint. The point in the game where I had to stop (because it was literally impossible) involved me fighting two very challenging bosses back to back with no checkpoint in between them. Here\'s the kicker: I had already defeated both bosses earlier in the game. Yes, that\'s right, recycled bosses are a big thing in this game. On top of that, the sequence where you re-fight them makes absolutely no sense as you completely killed them earlier by slicing them into tiny little pieces. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason for how or why you should have to fight them again, other than \""These are AI-controlled versions\"" or something along those lines. The problem with this fight is that immediately prior to the checkpoint I was forced to fight three very difficult enemies all at once which were essentially mini-bosses. Completing that fight required me to use all but one of my healing items and all but one of an essential item for the second boss in the next fight. By the time I got to my current checkpoint I was down to one healing item and one electromagnetic grenade (the essential item I mentioned). There are no ways to acquire more items from my current checkpoint. I am forced to go into the dual-boss fight with only one of each item that I need multiples of. So, I kill the first boss easily each time with my healing item and grenade still in my inventory. Now I must fight the next boss who I will call \""The Boss of B.S.\"" He has a stage where he becomes completely immune to your attacks (all of them) unless you hit him with that grenade I mentioned. The problem is I only have one of them and he has multiple stages of invulnerability. If you dont have the grenade, he will just kick your poor pathetic rear-end while simultaneously being completely immune to your attacks. There is literally nothing I can do. I\'m stuck with my only option being to return to my previous checkpoint with the same number of items in my inventory. It\'s just so frustrating that I should have to fight these bosses again and then get stuck on one because I don\'t have enough of a particular item. That is a combination of both lazy and just plain bad game design if you ask me. I suppose I can replay the entire chapter and make sure that I have more grenades and healing items for the boss fights, but that would require more effort than I am willing to put into this game anymore. The game can be a joy to play but the random and ridiculous difficulty spikes, camera control problems, and recycled bosses turned me off from it in the end. It\'s a shame because I think I was close to beating the game. I really can\'t recommend this game in its current state, which, judging by its age, is also its final stage."

Each boss has a special gimmick and style that you have to adapt to.-The music is high-octane and well composed. RULES OF NATURE!-Blade mode is a lot of fun to use. Cut, cut, cut, chop, chop, chop!-Some very cool action scenes. To name just a couple, surfing on missiles on your way to attack a giant robot, and Raiden entering ""Ripper"" mode for the first time.-Senator Armstrong is a fantastic villain. His motivation makes sense and he's just a lot of fun to listen to. He played college ball, you know.And now the cons:-Absolutely awful camera. This is a hack'n'slash game. Why in the hell would you give an over-the-shoulder camera to a HACK'N'SLASH!? Your field of view is so small, I often take a ridiculous amount of damage from something off behind my camera just because I couldn't see more than two feet behind Raiden.-Horrible description of your only defensive move. Your one and only defensive move is the Parry, which is accomplished by simultaneously using your Light Attack and moving towards whatever direction the attack is coming from. Sounds easy, right? Well, thats because it actually is easy, once you figure it out... on your own. The game does a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job of telling you how to do it and you will be shredded by everything until you figure it out. For me, that point came at about 3/4 of the way through.-Shoehorned in ""stealth"" segments. Again, this is a hack'n'slash game. Your main objective is to hit things really hard with your sword. In an attempt to connect itself to the other Metal Gear games, Revengeance tries and fails to create stealth segments for Raiden. ""Stealth"" in this game only translates to waiting for the enemy to turn around, then killing them instantly from behind. Theres no intelligent AI detection, shadow and light mechanics, or even a crouch.-The title. Who in the hell came up with the word ""Revengeance?""-Pick up and forget inventory. I'm mostly talking about the pickup weapons that you find, like rocket launchers. I usually forget that I even have the special weapons and there are no segments where they seem like they'd be too useful anyway. I have a lightning sword, dammit, who needs rocket launchers?-While Armstrong is a fun villain, none of the other villains are memorable in the least. The fights with them are fun, but I don't remember any of their personalities, motivations, or backstories at all. That might be because almost every single one is introduced and then fought in the span of a few seconds. The only exception is Sam, but his fight is so anti-climatic after so much buildup that he might actually be the worst of them all.-Goofy story. I knew going in that the story wasn't going to be the strongest component of this game. It suffers from the same things as every Metal Gear game before it. Trying so hard to ride the line between ""Serious"" and ""Satire"", that it comes off as just stupid. The plot? Stop an evil corporation from harvesting childrens' brains.♥♥♥♥♥♥ thats dark. I like it! Wait... I have to take a ""DOOMP?"" Oh, it's an analogy that sounds like dump. Haha, Kojima. You got me. Theres nothing wrong with humor in serious games, but the way it's done here is just sloppy and unfunny.-Pre-rendered cutscenes. This is a serious pet-peeve of mine. With digital distribution quickly becoming commonplace for videogames, why increase the file size of your game a thousand fold by including pre-rendered cutscenes? The cutscenes are also locked at 30 FPS, which is a little jarring when the game runs (on my machine, anyway) at 60 FPS. Also, I don't get to see my cool Inferno Armor. Shame, Kojima!Despite all of this, Revengeance isn't an awful game. But it certainly isn't a great game either. The swordplay is fun after you learn how to parry, but thats really about it. I give it an honest 6/10.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to ready my flame shield."

It also has an incredibly horrible camera, which constantly turns away from the enemy.At first I thought it maybe was my old 360 controller(thumbstick slightly broken) which made it impossible to parry properly. I therefore invested in a new Xbox One controller but the issue still remains. So what happens is that whenever you want to block, the character will just continue to do the quick attacks and leave you open for the enemy to hit you. It's sort of a 50/50 chance for the block to actually trigger.I've encountered numerous bugs, unfortunately I couldn't record them with Nvidia's software and for some inexplicable reason the game for me is locked at 30 frames per second."

,Recommended,235460,10251984,"Posted: 27 May, 2014",all,rein,"One of the under covered hits of 2013, I find that Metal Gear rising truly takes what we saw Raiden doing in MGS4 and made it into an entire full length game. It's over the top redieculous action with Cyborgs and Metal Gear's abounding throughout and enough limbs being severed and blood being spilled to fill the Pacific. Each boss is fight is incredibly well planned and downright insane with their own traits and attack patterns. Characters aren't exactly the most three diemensional but ones such as Jetstream Sam and blade wolf are actually suprisingly entertaining for a Metal Gear spinoff, dare I say even some of the best in the series? Unlike previous Metal Gear iterations, you will not be spending most of your time laying down or CQC'ing enemies in chokeholds. This game, as you can see from any screenshot is focused around blade play similar to Devil May Cry with a mechanic called Zandatsu where you control Raiden's blade movements in order to percisely slice your enemies into little bits and then target a specific area where once cut you tear the enemies ""spine"" out and use it to fully restore your health and fuel cells which allow you to use the aforementioned ability. One thing that stood out to me in the mechanics of this game was the excelllent blocking mechanic, it wasn't based on holding a block key but rather facing an  enemy and using a light attack which parried the attack allowing for an opening in the opponents defense. A negative part of the blocking mechanic is the sometimes intoxicated camera which can position itself in some unruly places where it is incredibly hard to judge which direction to actually parry without using sound to locate your enemy especially on bosses like Blade wolf and Jetstream Sam. Other than a minor gripe regarding the camera, I found that the games textures are somewhat lacking (although that is nothing new for the metal gear series, I'm looking at you Ground Zeroes) although the character models and weapons are modeled with meticulous detail, and the color scheme is great and much lighter than the washed out previous Metal Gear (Solid) games. In addition for long time fans of the series, unfortunately few characters from previous games make appearences in favor of featuring a new cast (reappearing characters are: Raiden, obviously, Sunny, a Snake cameo within a hidden kendo sword which allows for a no kill playthrough, and some other slight nods to characters such as solidus snake). Despite not having many returning characters, this game truly feels like a Metal gear title, with it's zany story and outrageous characters all formulating an incredibly entertaining experience which you won't be forgetting anytime soon. Oh, and don't even get me started on the soundtrack, I'm sure others have thoroughly covered Jamie Christopherson's excellent heavy metal based soundtrack."

,Recommended,235460,8663586,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,Wilcar,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the annoucement that Konami and Platinum Games were bringing this title to the PC. Now, truth be told, I was a little bit nervous when I saw it being ported to PC simply because Platinum Games haven't had much of a track record when it came to PC games/ports, but I decided to push my luck and pre-purchase this game again. I say again because I already owned it on the Xbox 360.Turns out my luck paid off, as did the luck of countless others that purchased this title. Amazingly, Konami and Platinum Games seem to have done a wonderful job of porting the game onto PC, minus a few issues that a few users are getting, but to be fair, most games have some form of issues on a day one release.Graphics wise, turning all the available settings down to their lowest makes the game look quite similar to its console counterpart. I have not tested what the game looks and runs like at the highest possible settings, simply because I'm not sure if my machine could handle it, but I'm willing to bet the game looks rather good with everything cranked up to max. Most of the options you would find in an average PC game nowadays are included, although resolutions only go up to 1920 by 1080, so if you are one of the few rich people that have a 4K resolution monitor, you'll be sad to hear this game won't support it.Gameplay wise, this game is a solid opposite of your standard Metal Gear Solid game, with a healthy focus on action as you hack and slash your way through numerous enemies, although a light stealth element is prevailent throughout the game. Most of your surroundings can be manipulated by your blade in some shape or form, with trees and cars often splitting into multiple parts. The same can be held true to your enemies as well, with the ability to slice them into hundreds if not thousands of pieces before ripping out their spines. You actually get rewarded for doing this as well by getting all your energy back, which you will need as the game goes on.The dramatic set-pieces in the game stand out as some of the most jaw dropping moments you'll see and expreience, ranging from parrying the sword arm of a giant robot before launching it into the air and bisecting it straight down the middle set to one of the most hype pieces of music you'll ever hear, to fighting a man made out of magnets in a collosal rainstorm. No, I'm not making that up either.Speaking of music, the music, THE MUSIC. SWEET JESUS, THE MUSIC. The musical pieces in this game are some of the best that have ever been produced by both companies, rivalling that of the pieces from both MGS3 and MGS4. Every boss has their own track that gets more and more intense as the fight goes on, cullminating in some of the most BRUTAL lyrics as the fight draws to a close. That doesn't mean that all the best music is limited to boss fights though; standard encounters with the enemy mooks are equally satisfying in terms of music.Both of the DLCs that focus on different characters are equally impressive, providing players an insight into what happens before the main events of the game. In addition, you also get all the DLC from various pre-orders and consoles for free! BARGIN!Overall, there isn't much more I can really say about this game without actually spoiling it. If you like exceptionally hype, over-the-top action sequences set to epic music, compelte with a somwhat impressive storyline to boot, then you should definately consider buying this game. Let's hope for a sequel, eh?"

Works nice with Steam controller though.- Game tries to blend mechanics from classic MGS games into hack and slash genre. Especially stealth is completely bothersome.- Tutorials are unlocked by finding items throughout the game and are explained as mini missions. Playing them results in restarting from last checkpoint when coming back to game. Also when you buy new moves, game tells you what they do but doesn't say how to perform it.o Boss fights are too long and too repetitive. Maybe I missed some special tactics to use but if so, game wasn't suggesting them nicely like DmC does for example.STORY- Characters are flat. I couldn't care less for anything they say. Dialogues remind me of some bad amateur theatricals I saw in past. I wouldn't even mind it so much as it's just hack'n'slash game but your comrades constantly pop up on your commlink telling you more and more boring intel.VISUALS+ All game models look great.- I can't say the same about game areas though. They are generic and easily forgettable.CAMERAThis is the real killer of the game. I played it with mouse first but it was insanely frustrating as camera is automatically adjusting all the time. This is not something you want if you hold mouse in your hand. With gamepad it was better but still bad.- Camera is positioned too close to Raiden. Thanks to this you can't see what's going on behind you. To avoid getting hit from behind I was running around but as camera adjust has little delay you can't even see where you run.- In blade mode your movement keys control camera which ofter results in you looking away from enemy after entering blade mode.- You can't lock on enemy that is out of your sight even if it's the only enemy around. Lock on marker is not visible very well so sometimes I wasn't sure if I managed to lock on or not.CONCLUSIONWithout the horrible camera I would actually recommend this game but as it is, it's just sheer frustration for me."

I'm not sure whether this game should give me an impression on the series or not, but I have to say this is a damn good action game.Story is bland at most, but it isn't boring nor is it unapparent so far. I'm becoming fond of the characters and Raiden is growing on me. ( He looks like David Bowie from Labyrinth )The combat is fast paced and full of action. I wouldn't say it's DMC or Bayonetta material, but it is unique and fun at best. The first mission sends you off fighting against an enormous ''Metal Gear'' ( Big Cyborg Monster Thingy ) which was freaking AWESOME. This game leaves a good impression in its first hours and I hope it stays that way.I don't know how well this game ran on PS3, but IMO, if you already own a PS3 version, don't get this one. There's not a big difference in the textures from what I've seen and the FPS is fixed at 30 most of the time. I mean-- It's not worth purchasing a second time for little to no changes and upgrade.So far I give this game an 8/10. I'm really liking it so far.

It's mechanics and the way it deals with alerts is very different to any other Metal Gear title that I've played. I think that might be in part to the designers, if I remember correctly the devs are not from Kojima. So it has an ever so slightly different flavor to it. But I got used to it as time goes on.Its also kinda sort. I think I beat the whole game in ~4-5 hours. There are two DLCs that come with it but it took me only 35-45mins to complete each. There is also the whole VR missions that you can obtain per mission but I didn't bother with those because they were objective based and not story.If you like hack and slash games with an air of samurai/ninja elements, then this might appeal to you.

If it's on sale, I'd definitely say buy it, but if it's not, it's up to you.Pros:-It's fun to chop enemies and objects up into hundreds of pieces-The story is good-The game looks nice and it feels cool to rip out robotic hearts-Music is really... Solid?-The final boss was legitimately challenging and tough-The game has one villain that I really liked (and the rest were decent)-Some interesting side weapons acquired from the games bossesCons:-A terrible title-Over half of the bosses are just sponges whose sole purpose is to just absorb hits and dish out a bunch of unfair attacks-Some of the enemies just feel unfair as they will do things like pin you down and do tons of damage and you must whiddle away at them until you can break their armor/limbs, which is a pain"

It does not ♥♥♥♥ing work.Steam version does not work if you play on monitor connected with HDMI cable. And if you let go the idea to play on your tv you will be disappointed none the less. Steam version crashes every time the game tries to save. At least that how it seems to be. But it crushes, that i know for sure. Every god damn time. Unplayable.I own the game on steam so i have no regrets for pirating it from torrents. Pirated copy works just fine in every way possible, including playing through HDMI. And that's pisses me off, but at least I can play it.Outside the fact that steam version does not work, it's a fairly good slasher, It has cool cutting mechanics, but to be honest they don't really create that much of interesting gameplay. For most of the time it's pretty generic slasher mechanically speaking.It has story and for slasher it's pretty good.But it has some serious design problems as well. For example, the first boss, Blade Wolf, is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. Because the game did a bad job explaining how to parry before that. And even when you somewhat master parry mechanic boss is still really hard. Overall I beat him on 10th try i think, might be more. Yes, i'm not very good at the game, but that's not the point. The point is, for some reason next boss is extremely easy, I beat him on the first try without any problems. So the game is pretty inconsistent in its difficulty.Also there are some very bad platforming sequences. There is a scene where you have to run on a bridge that is being destroyed under your feat and it's pretty hard just because it's badly designed and controls in this particular sequence are pretty unresponsive.And overall, game just does not bring that much of a satisfaction. I can't name the exact reason why, it just doesn't feel that good.But to be honest, boss fights (outside Mistral - too easy) are really good and entertaining. The game is not very long, i completed it in 10 hours and im not very good at it, so you can play it just for the boss fights."

,Recommended,235460,14169613,"Posted: 25 January, 2015",all,Kargor,"I still ""have"" to recommend this since a ""No"" definitely isn't warranted, but there are some caveats. The combat is just wild, confusing button mashing; the quicktimes don't usually work since they appear in the middle of other button mashing so you're automatically hitting the wrong buttons. The quicktime running sequences tend to have impossible camera angles so you basically can't do them without a lot of retries to figure out what you're supposed to do.The final boss was outright annoying; they gave it countless smaller fights with little to no indication what to do -- I somehow ended up getting through it (on easy) on my last health pack, but most of the time I had no idea what I was doing so I'm assuming it was just luck.So yeah, they could work on the combat, although it does work out, somehow. Even the flying enemies, which are annoying as hell since you're a melee fighter, are cooperative enough since they do tend to descent every once in a while so you can reach them. Don't know what makes them THAT stupid.Beyond that, they've set up an interesting world, although most of it is explained through ""phone calls"" to your team, as you're discussing how events relate to things that have happened in the past, or just generally to the world as it is.The game is reasonably flashy, especially when you finally get through those boring, annoying or even frustrating boss fights and get to pull off some fancy moves with just a few quicktimes. There's also a lot of cutscenes in general, or just some team member calling you."

Nothing is more awful than seeing mistral, or any one of the mechs you fight, start to attack, and then your camera snapping 180 degrees, and then getting hit before you can even move it halfway back.

So when you press the wrong button at the wrong time you watch 1s of animation for your attack (that you can not interrupt, despite knowing that this attack was the wrong choice), then watch 3s of animation when your enemy does its attack and then your character is incapable of moving for one more second. Then you can finally continue playing the game. Fighting in this game is just the opposite of fluent.Then there is the block mechanic. It consists of pressing the attack button at the correct time. Standard enough. Then I found out that there is no penalty for pressing attack to early or after a block. This means that block can be performed by mindless button mashing.Camera: The camera always stays very close behind your character. This means that quite frequently enemies hit you that you just couldn't see because they were off camera. Sometimes even your playable character covers most of the view. It's one of those games where the camera is the biggest enemy.Quick time events: I'm convinced that QTE's are the most pathetic substitute of gameplay in existence. This game has QTE's.Tutorial: The tutorial is way too short and doesn't tell you very important basics of its mechanics. So prepare for a phase of frustrating trial and error till you figure out on your own how the controls actually work.Story: It's stupidly over the top. That can be a compliment. However, this game is so up its own♥♥♥♥♥♥and takes itself so seriously that the cringe reached a level where I could not enjoy the story anymore. Also the story is everywhere, meaning that it constantly interrupts the gameplay and becomes annoying.Highlight: That moment where the evil, psychopathic, mass murderous senator explaines that he wants ""to make america great again"" was pretty hilarious (or frightening)."

I must say I'm not a big fan of the ""hack and slash"" as steam calls this style of game but I was able to overlook it in Bayonetta, but this game has nothing but hack and slash and I find it really boring.  Don't want to remember the different combos and don't want to wiggle the left joystick back and forth when I get stunned. No thanks.  Plus the environments and gameplay was incredibly repetative.  Yuck!!!  If you are reading this trying to decide to get this and do not yet have Bayonetta - I recommend you get Bayonetta instead and give this a skip.

First play through you WILL die trying to understand, and adapt, to their fighting style. (or not, if you have godmode on or wtv).-Characters are bland, it takes special care to make a badass cyborg with a giant sword boring-Same enemies all the time (except for bosses), so combat becomes repetitive, and predictable-Unskippable cutscenes here and there, specially during or before boss battles.Conclusion:It's a neat game, the gameplay is fun, but that's about it. There's really no story, just cut cut cut cut cut and more cut. Alot of the time i felt lost about my abilities, and because it's so small, you'd have to play a couple of times around to get all the weapons unlocked. The game has alot of funny moments, especially between missions, but the probelm is i am not sure these are supposed to be funny or not. Sometimes i was not sure if i should be laughing, because the tone seemed to be serious, and here i was laughing my butt off. The bosses are fun, but that's only after you die three to five times to understand how they work. And since the fights in between are always the same (same run of the mill soldiers), you go in blind to the boss fights, and since the tutorials are so bad, i ran through the game handicapped, not knowing that i had a bunch of extra resources and abilities that wouldve proven useful during the boss fights, or in a pinch against a buttload of soldiers.Overall, it's ok, but i wouldnt pick it up unless it's on sale.

And, of course, the ♥♥♥♥ING camera.  The camera would be perfectly acceptable for most games, but for a game like MGR:R, where you ABSOLUTELY MUST be able to see incoming attacks in order to block or dodge them, this camera is absolute♥♥♥♥♥  You will constantly be getting hit by♥♥♥♥♥♥from off screen you couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing do anything about because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera.  You will be constantly fighting the abysmal lock-on functionality which doesn't really lock-on.DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT TRY AND USE THE KB+M CONTROLS IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY.The best first move in any fight is to back way the ♥♥♥♥ up JUST to make sure you can ♥♥♥♥ING SEE YOUR ENEMIES, and even this will only half-way work because the camera is that ♥♥♥♥ed.And let's not even say ANYTHING about the Zendatsu mechanics or controls, especially with M+KB.  Ugh.  Or how the game just loves to give you quick time or other reactive events but then sometime just fail you even if you follow the onscreen prompts perfectly.  Or how the game is WILDLY inconsistent about its own mechanics, like how it uses a red flash to indicate a blockable attack throughout the ENTIRE game, only to make the final boss do redflashes on unblockable attacks.Also, do you like dodging behind an incoming strike, only to have the enemy do a single-frame pirouhette and hit you anyway? Or, the attack just ♥♥♥♥ing hits you anyway, because the hitboxes for all the attacks seem to extend behind enemy models?  If so, you'll LOVE MGR:R!Or get this: in the final boss fight, there's a section where you have to Zendatsu three flying rocks in a row in a precise manner.  The first two rocks give you a special cut line indicator that you have to line up before cutting (by the way, moving your mouse/joystick too fast automatically cuts for you, causing you to die!  GREAT CONTROLS!  I LOVE FIGHTING AGAINST THE CONTROLS!).  The last rock appears exactly the same.  BUT WAIT.  YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR SLASH.  YOU CAN'T LINE UP THE CUT.  It turns out all you need to do is hit X for a quick slash that happens to exactly hit the boxes.  Super easy.  Only, literally everything on the screen indicates you need to line up the cut like you have to EVERY OTHER TIME SUCH A PROMPT IS GIVEN.  I actually thought my game was bugged, and was only able to complete the boss after googling what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on.Actually, you're going to be googling♥♥♥♥♥♥A LOT because it is so frequently the case that what you need to do is exactly the opposite of what the game tells you to do.  Starting from the tutorial, which gives you blatantly incorrect instructions on how to parry, which is the most essential and basic move in the entire combat system.Oh, also, this action brawler likes to give enemies incapacitating attacks with no grace period in between.  That is, it is completely possible to get stunlocked for 5, 10, even 15 seconds if you eat even one attack.If this game merely took one or two pages from the Arkham series, like having consistent hit indicators and mechanics, and having a camera that ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU ENEMIES, or having a lockon system that ACTUALLY WORKS, it would be fantastic.  As is, it is an exercise in frustration made all the more frustrating because, as I said, on the rare occasions that you aren't getting ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥by the terrible camera, unexplained (or worse, mis-explained) combat mechanics, bugs, and baffling control choices, the game is a real gem.It has a great sound track, cool graphics, and some very neat ideas and encounters.  It's just a shame that so much of that is buried under♥♥♥♥♥♥  It's like, you can see the glimmers of a 9.5/10 game there, but the camera alone prevents it from being anything above a 7.  Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ the camera.  AND WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE POINT OF A LOCK ON FUNCTION THAT STILL ALLOWS THE LOCKED ON ENEMY TO GO OFF SCREEN.  EVEN OCARINA OF TIME MANAGED TO NOT DO THAT.So, while I did enjoy a lot of the game, my overall experience and impression was pretty negative.  When the game actually enabled me to play it properly, it was a real blast.  But, the controls and the camera are so terrible that the game really suffers."

The camera is amatuer at best; Mario 64 had a way better camera. Whenever I position the camera to my liking, it would flip around after a few seconds. In small spaces, while fighting, the camera is all over the place. The combat would have been great if it wasn't for the whole blocking mechanic. Would it have really been too much to map block to a button instead of having to press ATTACK and forward??? The game only teaches you a few skills as you gain them but the rest you will have to figure out for yourself though vague descriptions after you purchase them. I had to go to YouTube to figure out how to use the blade time or whatever that's called. There are some boss battles where huge things are thrown at you and you have to specifically cut them or you lose a huge chunk of health. This sounds simple but you have to use the analogue sticks to make the right cut but if youre slightly off, it's not going to work. I find myself randomly slashing all over the place because I can't seem to control blade mode. Later in the game, the boss battles get ridiculous. For example, in the final boss, you start fighting a battle you have to lose then comes a 5min cutscene, fight a losing battle again, another 5min cutscene. Through the whole game you fight like 4 losing battles. The one losing battle in the begining makes sense for the story but the rest are there probably to make what might have been a 3 hour game 5 hours. Did I mention you can get game over on some of those losing battles? Speaking of the story; there's hardly any story. Basically, Raiden is in an organization that protects people. Another organization killed a guy Raiden was protecting and punks Raiden. Raiden comes back looking for revenge. While going through the story you find out bigger things are in play but it's too confusing to figure out what and why; even for a Metal Gear game. Also, it seems the game expects you to already know about certain characters that show up out of nowhere. For example, you never see or hear about the last boss until you reach him. He felt tacked on....just to make the game feel longer. It should have ended when you killed the samurai guy.5/10"

It is a crying shame because this game was fun for about an hour before I finally have decided that enough is enough.Noteworthy: Do not attempt to run this game if you have an HDMI setup. This was my original attempt and the game was painful to look at since it would run with a severe underscan and at 24 FPS. Once I changed my main monitor to run through DVI, the game ran at 60 FPS with no issue. That is absolutely ridiculous.I only have two hours put into this game. The first hour, I had an absolute blast in. I was able to cut pretty much anything I wanted to into as many different bits as my processor would allow. Which is a lot. It was satisfying to cut enemies into ribbons and although the dialogue was laughingly bad, it was enjoyable in its own right. The texture quality is very mediocre and I really wish they had given it a boost for the PC port.Now, the second hour is when things just kind of fell apart. I met Blade Wolf. He's the third boss of the game and requires a lot of parrying, which this game sucks at explaining how to do. But that could be forgiven if the camera wasn't so abysmal. Trying to parry Blade Wolf? Good luck! Because you have to parry in the direction the attack is coming from... and don't forget that if you don't parry in the exact direction, you will fail the parry and be punished brutally.An hour into this game and this kind of a funkiller is absolutely wasteful of a product that has a really great first hour. This boss could have been fine if the camera actually properly worked and wasn't all over the place in terms of use. Completely inconsistent and you often can't see what's going on.

The combat feels stiff and unresponsive. I can't count how many times i tried to block and instead hit someone and vice versa. Also since you have to attack the way you want to block an attack you will in nine out of ten times miss the very small window the game give you and just turn around insted. This becomes a huge problem too since it is the only defence you have. Jumping is not an option agianst bigger enemies and ninja runing takes a secound to start so you are f***ed against unblockable attacks.Ninja run is just a cinematic that kills you if you press any buttons when you use it. Try to jump over a car yourself and you fall of the bridge and die.It also has a upgrade screen the game don't tell you about but you need to use it since it is the only way you are going to survive. The game becomes very hard after the first level. I died about ten times on the robot wolf fight because unupgraged he can stun-lock you to death. And that was on normal mode.There is not even a tutorial to help you learn how to play either. The VR Missions that teaches you things like how to block attacks are unlocked after you play the first level. When i finaly beat the robot wolf i was awarded the sub-weapons tutorial. The problem was that i had allready been useing sub-weapons for about 20 min before that.TLDR: Very still and very broken. Skip this if you like games with a competent difficuty.

You tap, tap, tap, as Raiden does his stupid, flashy moves, and before you realize the guy is dead, Raiden automatically turns or rolls towards the next opponent and begins slashing him. Imagine taking the wonderful Streets of Rage 2 and no longer requiring the player to turn towards the opponents and focus on positions. You press attack at least two meters from the nearest opponent and Axel/Blaze turns around and lunges at his/her enemy. The enemies in Metal Gear Rising mostly just stand there, taking their turns, letting you hit them with your dumb combos, until it comes time to use blade mode.The parry is so similar to the attack that you barely have to put any effort into parrying. The parry animation only activates when you're being attacked, so you can just spam the attack while pushing the stick towards the opponent. I'm usually pushing towards the opponent anyway. The timing is so simple most of the time. I would have rather just had a parry/block button. You do so much parrying in this game.Being able to replenish the whole health bar with the numerous energy cells makes the combat too simplistic. I guess they expect you to play it for the high scores, but I couldn't care less.Blade mode, the freestyle cutting ability brought over from the original stealth-action concept, Metal Gear Solid: Rising, doesn't work that well in an action game. I had trouble cutting certain things the way the game wanted me to. Your opponents are frozen (even in mid air) so that you can perform your crummy cutting and harvesting.Sometimes, you get grabbed and have to shake the analog stick really fast to free yourself. The only way I can shake the stick fast enough is by using my right hand. Why would you require rapidly moving left and right the clumsy digit of your non-dominant hand? It requires considerable dexterity and is bad for the analog stick.I don't want Dance Dance Revolution in my action games. QTEs don't coincide with a game's controls. They don't feel like an extension of the gameplay; they feel arbitrary. They're just kind of strange. You think you beat a boss, but then you ruin your score because you're not ready for the on-screen prompts. When I saw the first QTE after not playing MGR for a while, I thought for a second, ""What is this?"" And then I remembered. By that point, I was already dead. I would rather just have non-interactive cutscenes, like in the older Metal Gear games, so I can pay attention to what's going on instead of focusing on the button prompts.The bosses have some of the most bloated HP I've ever seen in a game.Hack and slashers like this are monotonous, always fast fast fast fast, room after empty room, the same enemies over and over. MGR makes my arms ache. It has like a hundred different moves, but you only ever need to use a few them to win. There's no purpose or depth to it, beyond trying to look cool. The weak stealth bits didn't help with the monotony.I never liked Cyborg Raiden. I preferred him as he was in MGS2. His ending was one of positivity, so it was a letdown to see him become such a mess in MGS4, all because fans didn't like him and didn't find him ""badass."" As if we needed ANOTHER cyborg ninja in MGS. He was much more of a character in MGS2 than in 4.The political rock fails to excite or immerse me, though I like the progression of it during bosses.I can't think of anything else the game does particularly well. I dislike the characters, the ridiculous and often cheesy cutscenes, the bare environments, the annoying camera... But this review was mainly meant to be about the combat, because I know not to expect much else from a stylish hack and slash game. Devil May Cry 3 is the only one I ever had much respect for."

I do think it's a decent monoblade dismemberment simulator, chopping up guys into 500 pieces (the UI even counts them) to consume their spines is fun, at least for the first 100 times.However, this game is frustrating in many ways. The biggest gripe is the camera, which is just terrible, it always points in the wrong direction, gets you stuck in corners and does NOT show the one guy you are expecting to parry. When you finally are ok with the bad camera lock, only about 75% of your deaths will be attributed to crappy camera positions.This is also Cutscene: The (Not-A-)Game. It's more like a movie, most of the pretty over-the-top action scenes happen in cutscenes so you can't even play them yourself. A normal level progression is that you watch a 5-minute cutscene, get to chop up two enemies, listen to a 1-minute phone call, you chop up a couple more enemies and there's another 5-minute cutscene. Most of your time will be spent watching cinematics and there's a lot of those.Some of said cinematics were entertaining, but more often than not the dialogue is cringeworthy, especially the main character's. It might be better if you adjust to the mindset of a 12-year old angsty anime fan. Maybe it's a Metal Gear thing, but most of the time the story seems to take itself too seriously even when it's about ridiculous superpowered cyborgs whacking each other with buildings. I did like the optional phone conversations though, they were entertaining and had interesting details about the backstory.It's also Quick Time Events: The Game. When you actually get to play, most of your time will be spent reading key prompts to mash accordingly, especially during the bossfights. I also dislike the controls in this game, a lot of the moves seem to be designed to whack your gamepad sticks straight into retirement, it'd probably be better with a fighting style gamepad to pull off those full circles and Track & Field-style stick wiggles without breaking apart.My main story completion clock said a bit over 5 hours at the end, but I don't think it counts cinematics, so it's not a particularly long game even though there's extra DLC missions and challenges.I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're really into Metal Gear lore & story. There are better games in this fighting style, even if they don't feature a badass free-aimed concrete-slicing sword. If you do get this game, make sure you have a high tolerance to the faults listed above.To pay tribute to this game's multinational characterization, here's a recap in finnish: Tämän pelin kameraa on varmaan käytetty suolentähystyksessä, koska se on TÄYSIN PERSEESTÄ."

I feel I should not recommend this game based on the polarity of Steam's yes-no rating system and that this game does not deserve to be perceived as ""very positive"".+ Is it a good game? Yes.+ Is it fun? Yes.+ Does it look incredible? Yes.~ Is the UI good? Meh. It looks great but anyone who thinks about it knows it only looks nice; it's missing lots of options and it's clunky with a keyboard - I work in UI and this bugged me a bit, but it's fine.- Is the camera good? No, it's terrible and it's one of the things that ruins the game.- Does it play well with a keyboard and mouse? No, this is also terrible; the lack of mouse accelleration means if you try to turn quick it doesn't work, so you're forced to use a pad.  Some people don't notice this so perhaps they always play games that way (or are console gamers).- Is it enjoyable how after every encounter you're forced to stand around for ~10s while you appreciate your score? No, this is really frustrating. I want to keep my adrenaline up and smash someone's face in, why is my map hidden? Where am I going? I'm losing my buzz right now.- Is combat nice? It certainly looks amazing but at the core: parrying is clumbsy and slow, and combat mechanics are inconsistent.  Combine this with a terrible camera and it's really not enjoyable at times, and those times are enough to colour your view of the overall experience.I should really recommend this game but ""very positive"" is completely unrepresentative of the massive flaws it has.  I put the game down after 5 minutes because I couldn't stand how poor the controls were. I picked it up again later because I didn't want to miss out on a Platinum Games game and because it really is mind-blowingly stunning.My partner's also a gamer and she returned it.

The player is constantly fighting with where they want to look and move because of this auto-camera crap. Looking around should not be a bobble head balancing arguement with lousy controls. The gameplay suffers from this the most.Also, any sort of sword combo ends up being severely reduced to button mashing when it could be taking advantage of the directional sword movement simply because the auto-camera distracts the player from being able to use it right. Half the time when you enter the sword movment with the shift key, you end up facing the wrong direction.

You attack whenever you want to block and never is there a time when you are blocking but it would be better to attack. Some enemies have random super armor that parries every single one of your sword strikes without effort. That puts you into a hitstun animation that gives the slowest enemies time to hit you.Then this damn BMI ERROR. What the actual hell does getting hit by an EMP, a bullet, and a dropkick have in common that changes your Body Mass Index in such a way that you are stunned for 3 seconds or more? That leads to a qte that you cannot possibly do in time before they get a free hit or two in on you.This leads into the QTEs. Screw QTEs in every possible orifice.Bosses are a pain that you have to learn how to cheese, usually by ninja dash running.Normal fighting is split into enemies so easy to kill that they are glorified health ups, and stupid enemies that act like bosses but are faster to kill and don't hit as hard. There is never a time to use combos, because they either get you forced into getting hit by the bosses and stronger enemies who just shrug off the attack and hit you through it, or you may as well dash strong attack the weak enemies and then go into blade mode and instakill them. THERE ARE LITERALLY NO OTHER SITUATIONS!Then there are the cutscenes. They make Raiden look epic. Too epic. They are great cutscenes, but make you wonder why you ever have any problems if Raiden can rip the arms of GIANT metal gears and run strait up buildings. Why am I climbing this stupid tower full of enemies if I can run up the side and only encounter resistence from helicopters?Stealth is also short of passable. You have to be RIGHT behind the enemy and press a button. That's fine. But are all these soliders deaf dumb and stupid that they don't contact anyone over a com link that they are being stabbed?

MGR lacks replayability.  There is no variance other than difficulty to the standard campaign levels, which are the most enjoyable levels because your combat upgrades carry over there.  Your upgrades don't apply to VR missions, which I think is pointless.  Jetstream Sam's DLC is depressingingly short, a condensed version of the standard campaign; Blade Wolf's DLC alternatively is longer and more interesting as a story but overly complex in terms of gameplay (how are you supposed to complete a jump puzzle with a character as long and clunkly as Wolf?).If you want to feel like a total badass while resolving some anger management issues and can get past the fact that the game will be boring after beating the campaign once and farm for your upgrades that let you be completely overpowered in the earlier levels, go ahead and buy this game.

As the players busies himself with making the Unstoppable Metal Gear (which made memorable boss fights in MG 1--3) their ♥♥♥♥♥, alternative rock plays in the background, shattering any chances Metal Gear RR had at redeeming itself, it's completely unforgivable given the amazing and original sound scores to previous Metal Gear games.This game came from a studio that worked closely with legendary Hideo Kojima, this atrocity of a game is unacceptable. When I first heard of MGRR I was exited bearing the name Metal Gear alone brought high hopes, unfortunately this game was a massive disappointment nothing but a stain in the Metal Gear Series it's like tears, they never fully come off."

I bought this along with Metal Gear V: Ground Zeroes, thinking it would be the perfect companion. Boy was I wrong, unfortunately  the combat system, while slightly innovative is the games biggest downfall. Coupling this with the clunky camera, which is highlighted to the extreme during the third boss fight it produces a frustrating experience. While I did manage to get past that specific boss fight, from this point onwards I felt like the controls were working against me for the remainder of my time played.If you can get past the frustrating issues, and get a better mastery of the game by sinking in extra time to practise it's mechanics and understand how to play with it's flaws I believe it can be fun to play. However if you just want a hack and slash that has solid gameplay, with a great feeling combat system and camera, I would highly recommend DMC: devil may cry."

It's not very bad either, but to see everybody singing its' praises so unilaterally will give people the wrong idea.It's a hack and slash game that has it's moments, but a lot of issues as well. Here are some of them:- There are lots of camera problems. You can't see your enemies a lot of the time. There is also a boss fight where the boss will be hidden by the combo counter a lot of the time. I mean, seriously?- The combat focuses heavily on parrying and blocking. The person who thought that the block button should be the same button as the attack button should be shot. The game has lots of trouble deciding if you are blocking or attacking, causing you to die a lot at the more difficult bits.- Blocking also requires you to press the thumbstick in the direction of the enemy. However, the camera problems really mess this up a lot of the time.- Even if you pull off a parry, and the animation plays, you will sometimes still take full damage and get knocked off.- The boss-fights can be very unfair. The game's A.I. decides whether or not you get hit, not your skill. A lot of attacks cannot be avoided properly. Even if you figure out what to do, it will often fail. The bosses also have attacks that seem to require a charge-up, but sometimes they will execute them instantly. I don't mind hard games, but then, if you are really practiced you should get good results. This just feels like random chance a lot of the time.- The pacing is off. It has some very long cutscenes and some very long boss-fights. This game would benefit from having more regular enemies as a diversion you can have some fun practicing your skills.- The game wants you to be stealthy, but it doesnt work because this is a hack-and-slash game.The game isn't all bad and definitely has its' moments, but if you decide to check it out, I suggest you do so at a hefty discount.5.5/10"

METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE.... Wow, thats aweful. Who thought that was a good name? Revengeance? Someone obviously took two cool words and stuck them together. Unfortunately, the game is littered with a simular pattern of incompetance.Okay. Before I bash the game too much (and I will) let me first say that the gameplay is fun and exciting. Killing bad guys is satisfying and  thats half the battle if you ask me. The game looks pretty good as well. Not great. But its definitely on the better side of the graphical spectrum.Okay, here goes: My first complaint would have to be the dialogue. It is so terrible that it made me cringe several times.  Its obviously a really rough translation and SO CORNY. On top of that, the dialogue is backed up by a plot that 1.) Is extremely simular to previous Metal Gear games and 2.) Not substantial enough to be remotely interesting.Previous Metal Gear games were compelling and well thought out. This game however feels  rushed and doesnt really draw you in. I was very aware of the fact that I was playing a game. MY ♥♥♥♥ING IMMERSION WAS RUINED!!!!!!!Secondly that damn camera was constantly getting caught on walls and changing angles for no reason. There I am planning my next move when all of a sudden the camera has a freaking spaz attack.The worst thing about this game however is definately how the explain NOTHING to you about its combat systems. The tutorial is a joke. There was a point about 10% into the game where I almost gave up on the game because even the most basic levels and bosses were giving me trouble. Thank science for Youtube. What were the game creators thinking??? Why dedicate so much time to creating elaborate game mechanics and then not explain to the players how to use it. So frustrating.The game's length is about 7-8 hours. First playthrough. Which is pretty short if you ask me.Also the final boss is the most annoying part of the whole game.

Who's idea was it to put parry and light attack on the same bleeding button? It's ridiculous the amount of times I have been halfway through a series of attacks, noticed the enemy was about to attack me and tried to parry, only for Raiden to attack again resulting in me getting smashed in the face by a giant metal boot. Especially when the RB button is only used to target enemies and could be used as a parry button. Bear in mind that this is with a controller and I don't know whether it is the same on M+K.- The Camera: The camera on this game is awful, especially during combat sequences, it can be improved by targeting the opponent but this will usually mean that you can't see where you are going unless you are running at the enemy.- The Story: This story just doesn't interest me, it's your plain, boring 'this corporation is evil... the leader is evil... destroy the corporation...kill the CEO. BOOOOOOORING.- No Enemy Specific Tutorials: There are lots of different enemies in MGR:R and at no point does the game explain the weaknesses of each enemy or explain how they attack, this means that beating these enemies comes down to just trial and error.- The Frustration: All of these negatives come together to create a really frustrating game especially during the boss fights.Therefore I cannot recommend this game because for the large majority of the time I played it I didn't enjoy myself, and I probably won't be able to complete it otherwise I will go grey and have wrinkles by the ripe old age of 19."

The early bosses were actually fine. Pick the pattern and win with a bit of time and patience. The further on you go the the more frustrating it gets. Bosses feel scripted and over powered. No matter what upgrades you have, they are rendered useless as the bosses will punch through your health with ease and take what feels like no damage from your attacks. They will frequently break through your Parry's and stun you over and over in the same attack. There is an option to button bash out of them but they take so long to actually work I am not even sure it is doing anything. Same if a boss gets you into a hold or cinematic attack of some kind. Button bash away till your hearts content but you will not break that move. The damage they do in these moves is unreal!In Summary-----------------Although I enjoyed some of the fighting and stylish moves on offer. A lot of the time you are put into fights where you feel you are fighting a small army of mini bosses that do too much damage and take too much time to put down. Bosses are the same.

It's a game about gameplay that does a poor job at explaining it. You have to go to youtube and find some vids explaining important core principle. Then according to the review I read, it's a joy, right ? Not for me. The parry mechanic depends on the side of offense, the side of offense depends on the silly camera which ends up in random miss. Parry being the core gameplay mechanic you can kiss any idea of enjoyable time playing it goodbye. It does require skill, quite a lot actually, but if I put myself in that state of mind I want accurate game mechanic. Random side parry + cloudy timing on each strike + ""absolutely mandatorr trial and error at each new opponent"" make this a zero fun experience for me. Loosing is surely irritating but it's the lack of pleasure in winning that put me out of it.I think that the good batman games really turn this game to shame in the way they have actually working fights. MGR:R looks clearly elite but IMHO does a poor job at making its gamedesign work. Unless you're starving for that kind of game, there are quite a few better. Too bad, slicing guys sounded exciting.(... ah and the story ? Well it's good if you're a twelve yo, I guess, but it's way too violent for me to let you play such a game if you're that young.

And even then, there are some enemies that are still alive after hundred cuts, without limbs,forcing you to slash furiously them until they die.- story is garbage.- useless dog/wolf. He does nothing, even if he always say ""I will scout ahead"" or ""I will patrol ahead"".- high heels. The main character have high heels. And run like hell with them. No♥♥♥♥♥♥.. I can't really imagine a ninja in metal high heels. Oh, and he put his sword in heels and fight like a bladed Chun Li. As I said, I don't like Anime very much and this is too much for me.- too many phone calls. God, after every fight someone from your HQ think is a good time to call you and talk. And in the mean time you can't run or do anything usefull. No, you just walk around with a finger in your ear...- I know we can't talk about realism in this game, but riding an elevator about 8 minutes it seems too much.- awfull decisions and inconsistency - there is a level where you climb a hundred story building (of course, by elevator, by running the walls... and falling and flying on a robot and... forget it) only to get another elevator to go down in a undergroud train station or whatever it is! Why the hell he does that? Only to force us to play? Oh, and you went through 80% of level cutting walls and tanks? Meet the indestructible wooden door (or the ♥♥♥♥ing wire fence).

There is a lot of moronic dialogue with a lot of stagy hand movements. I don't know, maybe other will like that, but for me it was painfull to watch. I don't know, the dialogues between characters keep reminded me of Johnny Bravo but without the fun. ""Huh ha, don't touch my hair!""- movement restrain after a fight. When you complete a zone (a fight) you can't proceed further because you have to read the results. You are in a box with invisible walls (well, not so invisible if you approach them). You can't go further in game, just stay and stare at the fight results, which are as inconsistent as the rest of the game: longest combo 33 - get 1000 BP; another fight longest combo 87 - get 800BP.

I have played the Windows version on the same Mac in Boot Camp, and the game is fantastic. But the Mac port is awful, frankly, buggy and slow. In Windows version, the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera turns - very strange, but if you move mouse slowly, it is not an issue. But in the Mac version, it is much worse, to the point of being unplayable, maybe due to performance issus. As for the bugs - I've never seen so much in a game! At least, not in the first 5 minutes of playing. First that bad guy who was carrying the prime minister got stuck in the terrain, and then I got stuck in the sky after fighting a huge robot. So, if you're only buying the game because of the Mac version - expect bugs.I uploaded two screenshots with the glitches. I'm on a Macbook Retina 2012, and as I said - on Windows I had no bugs whatsoever and the game was running just great. Except for that strange ""reversed"" mouse sensitivity, but it can be lived with.I wrote a negative review chiefly to warn Mac players and to attract attention of developers/publisher, because they didn't reply to my support inquiry at all. It is their first game ported to Mac, they need to be told how things are for Mac gamers. I'll update my review when they fix this stuff and switch it to positive.

,Not Recommended,235460,15731951,"Posted: 7 May, 2015",all,외계인,"This is by far one of the most frustrating games I've EVER come across to on Steam. So many f*cking reasons why this game made me want to bust my own nut. You can always trust the Japanese to make games with sh*tty mechanics.1. If you're in combat with a bunch of enemies surrounding you, your instincts will tell you to keep spamming the mouse since this is a fast-paced game. But, if you want to run away from an enemy's attack as you're spamming the mouse, you cannot run for a couple seconds because Raiden has to finish his f*cking moves before you can run again.2. The developers did a pretty sh*tty f*cking job at explaining to players how to block. I had to go on Google and learn how to block enemies' attacks there.3. VR Missions are pointless. I bet hardly anyone ever plays them.4. Holy sh*t! What is up with the music?! What kind of r*tard enjoys listening to sh*tty Japanese rock dubstep music?! Why couldn't they just play beautiful epic music rather than that dubstep Linkin Park sh*t?! I actually played the game with the music volume down to 0. And if you watch any MGR:R gameplay video on Youtube, every r*tard there has the music on, so I'm guessing majority of Metal Gear fans like listening to sh*tty Japanese dubstep rock with auto-tune.5. Health packs only replenish 100% of your health, it never replenishes your health fully. So if your maximum health is 150%, health packs will only restore your health to 100% rather than 150%, soooooo what in the actual f*ck is the point in upgrading your health then?6. Everytime you die, you will have one of Raiden's friends going like ""Raiden? RAIDEEEEEEEEEN!"" I tried to skip their crying, but appeartly, you cannot! When you die, you cannot restart until one of Raiden's friends is done with their f*cking annoying ""Raiden? RAIDEEEEEEEEEEN!"" Just like Resident F*cking Evil 5! Who the f*ck thought that was a good idea?!7. The enemies have such HIGH health, and I'm talking about those regular weak-looking enemies. I actually hit them with my sword so many f*cking times just to kill one of them.8.  Sometimes when enemies hit you, Raiden will be stunned for a few seconds and you'll get that f*cking annoying ""BMI Error"" message right above Raiden. YEAH THATS TOTALLY NOT F*CKING ANNOYING AS SH*T AT ALL! THAT WILL TOTALLY HELP ME OUT WITH BOSS FIGHTS!9. Oh and speaking of boss fights, I was stuck on that boss fight with Sam for HOURS! HOURS! The camera is so f*cking bad! How the f*ck are we supposed to parry when the camera keeps centering?! I was trying to look for an option to disable that, but you cannot. NICE JOB DEVS! As I was fighting Sam, there are 4 boxes that contain health packs, I was trying to slash the boxes so I could get the health packs but I could not because the f*cking camera wouldn't stop centering and focusing on Sam. As I was running to those boxes, Raiden's face was right at the camera so I couldn't see where I was running to. It turned out my camera was on lock-on to Sam, the game never said anything about camera lock-on. Again, I had to go on Google to disable that. One more thing about Sam, I love how some of his moves are nearly impossible to avoid, like when Sam would sometimes do that multiple slashing move on you, and when Sam would hit you at the very second you get right back on your feet.10. Final boss fight, phew! Oh man, I cannot wait to talk about this f*cking boss fight. This boss fight was WAAAAAY too f*cking long, and I thought the final boss fight with The Destroyer in Borderlands 1 was too long. This boss fight had like 3 sections. The first section, Armstrong would be in this giant robot thing and you would have to chop off its legs, but here's the problem with that section of the fight, it gave you ZERO health packs. You will have NOTHING to replenish your health. And to make that section of the boss fight even MORE fun, Armstrong would summon those 2-legged-no-armed cyborgs to back him up. The second section wasn't too bad, but the third section of the final boss fight is where you and topless Armstrong are surrounded by fire and Armstrong would throw these huge trucks or tanks right at you and you HAVE TO slice those vehicles up in Blade Mode at a certain angle, and you only have a couple seconds to do so, if you fail and those projectiles hit you, you will lose 100% of your health.F*ck this game, this series, and anyone who finds nothing wrong with this r*tarded game."

It is a spectacle fighter, or at least it triest to be. You are playing as some kind of cyborg/animecrybaby thing but you never really get to feel like an unstoppable killing machine.Since spectacle fighters are required by law to not have good stories then you have to accept the insane rambling that is the story in this game, but by god they are trying their very hardest to make your brain implode. In true anime style characters spew their life's story and all motivations for their actions before fighting. You get the idea.The gameplay consists of your regular spectacle fighter stuff, severely hurt by very poor camera controls. Since you often fight several big robots at once the fights are reduced to a big cluster♥♥♥♥ with you desperately swinging while trying to figure out in which direction the punches are coming from. The game has no simple ""dodge everything"" button like most spectacle fighters and relies heavily on a parry system that required you to face the direction of the incoming attacks. This of course makes no sense combined with the poor camera. There is a proper dodge of sorts, but it requires good timing and it is not a good way to deal with defense. The entire fighting system is built around parries and counter attacks and you should always be on the defensive and react to the enemy.I played this on hard because ""normal is way too easy"". Hard is HARD. I gave up on the final boss because there is absolutely zero room for errors on it and I just couldn't be bothered.If you do pick this up, then you should immediately make friends with the parry system and not try to avoid using it. You HAVE to learn it in order to deal with the later bosses.What makes this a hard sell is however the biggest problem: The game is not fun. A spectacle fighter should be just that: A spectacle of explosions and ridiculously proportioned bosses. The game certainly has the size of the bosses to some extent, but it is simply much more frustruating than fun.In summary: Stupidest story in video game history(?); poor camera; reasonable fighting system handicapped by the camera. The game is simply not the fun spectacle you expect from this genre of games.  I cannot recommend this game. The price paid was 10 dollars."

Maybe it's just that I played ""Vanquish"" by Platinum Games on PS3 and, since I really loved it, I had very high expectations from this title. The fact is that at the beginning I found it to be insanely difficult : while a caress by the most insignificant enemy of all will wipe away almost entirely your life bar, you'll have to beat your joypad (forget to use the keyboard) like a raging blacksmith to make a zero-point-something damage to your enemies. After some practicing, things get a lot easier (learning how to use properly Raiden's equipments helps a lot, also) but the truth is that for the most time you will be engaged by endless boss fights (this is probably the only game in history where bosses outnumber ordinary enemies !). That's a pity because, boss fights apart, game action is great. My advice : wait to grab it on sale and it will be worth it."

I have played almost every single game that they have made.Ever since the original Metal Gear: Solid for Playstation, I have been a fan of the series. When Grayfox made his first appearance, I wanted to play as his character. They later released the VR Missions. You wouldn't believe how stoked I was to find out that you could play as Grayfox in the VR Missions.Fast forward 15 years. Metal Gear Rising: Revengence. I was beyond excited that I could play as a cyborg ninja again! Unfortunately, the gameplay just didn't follow through.Here is a small list of what I like and dislike.Negatives:- Horrible Camera makes it hard to focus on enemies and easy to get stuck in a corner.- Too many annoying boss battles, not enough actual mission. I wish there were more swarms of enemies to chop into little pieces before I get to a boss that annoys the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me.- Gameplay mechanics are rather awkward, leading to a frustrating gameplay.Positives:- Beautiful.- Satisfying. Because of the difficulty, nothing is more satisfying than defeating a boss and going through a little interactive, cinematic cut scene that inevitably ends in the boss being chopped into a thousand little pieces.- Cool upgrades and skins. You can be Grayfox! They have a skin available for purchase (with mission points) that makes you look like him!"

The biggest issue is the camera combined with the fact that it doesn't have a normal dodge/roll mechanic (like other Platinum games do have) - you have to press the left stick towards an enemy and press light attack. That's 2 buttons instead of one to make sure you don't get hit. This doesn't seem to work 100% of the time and gets even more trying considering you can get attacked by multiple enemies at once AND the camera flies all over the place, preferring to look at walls rather than the enemies you're fighting. Then you also need to be pretty precise with the timing so you need to learn all the enemy telegraphs in order to successfully parry.So to sum up: you have no idea where attacks are coming from because the camera is all over the place, and if you do manage to catch an enemy attacking you probably mistime the parry due to weird telegraphs and if you DO time it well the parry just randomly seems to fail anyway. Now, since you're pressing light attack the character attacks instead of parries, then obviously gets hit, knocked all over the place making the camera have an even bigger spaz attack accumulating in the controller taking an unscheduled flight to the other side of the room.Oh but there's a sidestep/dodge you can buy at the start of the game! That would be great if it didn't suffer from the same issues - it just doesn't work 30% of the time. You can literally do the dodge 50 times in a row and quite often it will just not work. And that's just out of combat, when it gets hectic there's no way to get it working reliably.Other than that there's probably a lot to like which is why it's such a shame the controls make it unplayable."

Raiden is on a business trip while all of a sudden by Desperado, a rogue PMC involved with terrorist activity. While Raiden fights Desperado, Sundowner, their leader, kidnaps and kills the prime minister Raiden was working with. Raiden then fights Sam, a Desperado agent, and gets defeated, losing an eye and an arm in the process.Raiden is then reconstructed and sent on a mission that would open his eyes to what Desperado is actually doing, quitting his job and embarking on a quest for vengeance.The game plays in 3rd person perspective, using your sword to attack. Combat is fun, except for when it takes place in a short area because it leads to camera issues. This factor is annoying, making combat much more difficult. At one point in the game, you are forced to fight in an office building, making for this a common issue.The inventory system is one of the worst I've seen yet. To open your inventory you must press either the left or right arrow in your dpad (if your using a controller).

Almost straight away the game took a turn for the worse; think Dark Souls without the fun. I mean, even on NORMAL difficulty, basic enemies are able to take about ten times more damage than you unless you manage to get lucky with the fiddly parry mechanics.

Here's why:GraphicsGraphics are quite good, and rather demanding, but the issue I have with this is that it does nothing differently, it's just your standard, run-of-the-mill, I'm gonna look awesome but also cost a fortune in both CPU and GPU power, graphics, that are by now, quite dull, and revisited to hell and back. As always, just lower the anti aliasing and the game goes from Lagville to Smoothville by bullet train.Game PlayThe gameplay was what was meant to sell this game, and in many ways it is rather cool. I mean who doesn't like to go into super slow-mo mid fight and start hacking a single enemy to itty bitty pieces, completely ignoring the some 4-6 other enemies surrounding you as you do this....Like a real ninja...The Gameplay is poorly designed and centered entirely on swordplay, which in and of itself is underdone, and sorely lacking. The game is one of those titles which requires a certain level of smoothness, streamlined even, if you will, in order to captivate the audience properly. This game did it wrong, and focused far too much on one thing, while leaving the far more important aspects, stagnant in the wake.The swordplay for example. There're entire system mechanics dedicated entirely to the sword mode thing, which enables you to carefully plan out your swings to carve your enemy JUST right so that you can rip his f***ing spine out and get points and HP for absorbing it into your magical cyborg body. But the sad part here is, that it was executed EXTREMELY poorly. Even with its designated playing mode; Controller, the game is utterly impossible to control. You're meant to point the Left Stick in the direction of the incoming attack while pressing X in order to block the aforementioned attack. Considering you have a camera which twists and turns at random(especially bad if you focus an enemy), this is extremely difficult to do, and blocking is just so difficult, with such a small benefit for doing so, that 10/10 players seem to simply go with jumping around like a freaking lunatic bunny on LSD in order to dodge the bullets and swords and bombs and s*** that gets flung at you from all sides.Ninja Run is meant to add a sense of 'Assassin's Creed' running to the game, which entales simply running forward, and your character will do all sorts of bright and shiny cool moves to jump and dance across obstacles. In this game, however, they tried to add this hit feature only to fall short. Ninjarun is a pain in the ninja butt to use, and seems to fail and faulter constantly, where your character simply drops off a ledge like ""OH YOUS A NINJA BUT YO NINJA RUNNING POWAHS NO WORK ON THIS HERE PARTICULARHARHARHARHAR SPOT! Why!? I DUNNO!""And let's not even speak about Stealth....Why not, you may ask.Because it isn't there.You heard me, this game's attempt at being a stealth game is a complete f***ing joke, and not only highlights the stupidity of the enemy A.I in the game, but the stupidity of the developpers too....The A.I: Imagine this....Ninja cyborg super soldier from hell(and only one eye) runs very casually/noisily across a metal beam on the ceiling, jumps down with a loud THONK! and runs over behind you going ""THONK THONK THONK THONK"" the whole way, only to instantly stab you in the back with a ""SHLK! SHHHPSSSSSSHHH! (< Blood spew noise)"" followed by more Thonking and stuff...You'd imagine the A.I soldier like 7 feet away with his back turned would realize that those odd noises was PROBABLY not one of the other Ninja cyborg mercenaries just having a malfunction in their urine extractor....Cause I admit..If that WERE the case? I'd not have looked too...I don't need to see a♥♥♥♥♥♥covered part robot, part human...Nah...The Devs: I'll just boil my long rant about their stupid mistakes and their attrocious time/money-saver strategy bull**** down to this simple game breaking problem: It's a game that favors stealth....Without a stealth mode...That's right, you can't crouch and hang from ledges and be all stealth like, no! All you can do is run forward REALLY noisily like its f***ing robocop RUSHING to get an oil change(Thonking anyone?), jump around, swing swords/other misc melee weapons at people, and shoot RPGs, and throw hand grenades!..DOES THAT SOUND STEALTHY TO YOU!?And to top it all off....The game is calm shatteringly difficult! Even on Normal difficulty it took me upwards of 17 tries to beat the first boss..Some cyborg dog thing...SEVENTEEN TRIES....What made me finally win? I realized how pointless it is to try and parry with my sword and started LSD bunnyhopping around like a retard whenever the dog would go ballistic and somehow turn into a flawless ninja attack dog(in intervals).CustomizationThere really is none...You can choose from commando/fire/white body armor...Commando being green and sporting extra rocket launcher rockets from the beginning...That's it...It doesn't look different apart from being puke green. The Fire one is red and sports extra grenades from the beginning...That's it...It too doesn't look different apart from being menstrual blood red. The white one is blue(I'm joking its white) and doesn't come with any cool weapon extras...It just lets you heal faster. La-dee-da. Other then that there're only 2 cosmetic options which I can only assume are cameos from the game's predecessor title....They too look like utter, underachieving piles of s***.What about new cool combat moves then? not really. You get a total of 7 or so new moves to buy with this strange currency you get from hacking left arms off of enemies, and each one is honestly just an upgrade from the stock one you start with. Weapons get unlocked over time, but really, its just to make sure the combat animations don't get old...What does a ninja do when his moves get repetitive and boring to look at after watching them hundreds/thousands of times?...He grabs a polearm made out of linked together robot arms that shake hands in a chain to form a spear...Yeah, that works as a whip too by the way!Ugh...I don't even wanna say more about this underworked, cheap and sad attempt at continueing a genuinely fun franchise...Well except one thing....Put all I've just said into consideration...All the bad I just told you, and now consider thisunderlining,  . over the i fact to cement it all in the hall of shame where it belongs:The whole game takes 23.6 Gigabytes of hard disk space.That's it, I'm out. TL;DR: Bad game, don't buy it, go with Warframe or Blade Symphony instead...Far more polished, and better executed, 'and' its online based..."

This game is the definition of expioting the name of metal gear appeal to the fanboys of the series and before you brun me alive on a stick ... let explan in details why this game is kinda bad .First off , the camera in this game is absolutly insane you couldn't even contol it even if you wanted to . When fighting a single enemy it is manegable but add more to the mix and everything will go crazy . even with increasing the senstivity it is nearly impossible to keep track of all the enemies specially later in the game . Speaking of Later .... the length of the game , this one is really short ... i mean you could finish it in 5-7 hours and belive me if you're not into achieving high scores you would't even care about giving it a try for a 2nd time which means 0 replayability .Most importantly THE CONTROLS of this game !!! OMG i never seen anything soo chaotic like this attack and block aka parry with the same button !! I'm ok with creative ways of controls but common this is kinda heictic if you asked me . Probably all the ppl would say no it's brilliant , well then stop spamming it .. in addition to that it will devalue all the moves that you will buy as upgrades ,which is kinda a bad thing if yopu asked me .Finally in trems of the value of money ... i strongly vote against it .

I had reservations and doubts and pretty much knew it would suck, but paid $60 on PS3 for it anyway.Suffice it to say,  when this game came out. I broke a controller because of this game. The first time I've done something that childish in over a decade, and it hasn't happened again.That is how poorly designed the game is.Example: Blade mode literally does not work, at least it didn't on PS3. There are two bosses where you MUST use blade mode the proper way, or you die. The thing being, it never really gives any indication what the proper way is , and blade mode is a horrible way of blocking in the first place. Because you have to parry everything - there is no block. Very bad decision for a hack and slash game when literally every hack and slash ever made allows you to block and counter attack based on timing.Other than the technical failures, the game presentation is completely inconsistent. There is no rhythm or flow to the play of this game. Normal enemies - soldiers - are pathetically, pointlessly easy. In comparison, Geckos are moronically hard. Yea I'm aware of what they are, I played MGS4 - wherein Raiden easily fought them by the way - and they shouldn't be doing as much damage as they do in one hit. Not to mention Dwarf Geckos, give me a break, if they swarm you. This is my major problem with the game. Each level is pathetically easy even including the annoying and often overpowered minibosses, but then comes the other major problem with the game.Bosses: Bosses are so, so, so stupidly, out of place ""difficult"". And that's the thing, they aren't even difficult. The last boss is the easiest boss in the entire game, if  you don't screw up. In fact, the fourth boss is actually the hardest in the game. As if that little fact wasn't enough, you actually have to fight the third, fourth, third, fourth, and fifth bosses in the same hour of gameplay - three of them on the same level, on the same life bar, too.So you go from murdering everything, which Raiden should be doing, to getting his♥♥♥♥♥kicked by these rejects. Itbreaks the suspension of disbelief, even in a Kojima game, for that jarring of a contrast between actual gameplay, and cinematic boss encounters."

Make an engine where you can aim and direct sword slashes, then have the enviroment react and actually get cut up. Amazing concept, and executed well, given our current technology. I'm honestly amazed how far games have come in the recent years, and this is another step. I would love to see destructible enviroments like this in the future. I honestly had more fun cutting up trees and making weird shapes than I did with the actual game.That's where the praise ends.- The camera will reset in some of the worst places, causing your character to perform a 360 as you reorient yourself.- There is a distinct lack of freedom. This is by NO means a sandbox game. It's like guiding a missile down a hallway. Sure, it's fun to watch the explosions, but you're still confined as HELL.- Quicktime Events. That's all I really need to say. They tend to destroy the gaming experience in almost any game they are placed in, especially when the buttons they want you to press are used for nothing else in the game! ""Press X here to block a giant attack! Right click here to continue the riptose! Left Click! Right Click Spam! GOOD JOB! YOU DID IT!""- Some of these boss fights are annoying as HELL. Fight a giant robot. Kill the robot in an epic way, GRANTED, with quicktime events. (I think we all have to agree the Rules of Nature playing made that boss fight) Part 2 and 3 of these fights? Ehhh? Not even close. The first part you have an arena to run around and fight in. Parts 2 you're stuck on an insanely small strip of ground and have to dodge a massive robot. Logic. Part 3? You run down a collapsing building and generally play minesweeper. Fall in a hole? RESTART. Get hit by the laser? RESTART. Not jump at the right time? RESTART. At least it has the common courtasy to give you a checkpoint at each phase.- The HORRIBLE character designs. Honestly, seeing the previews for this, I thought there was going to be some grand betrayal or storyline resulting in revenge. No. Not even close. I won't spoil anything, but this makes a B-Movie look GOOD. The plot is thin and flimsy, the characters 2 dimensional, and the reactions in SEVERAL places don't make ANY sense! Prime Minister being stabbed in my face? Emotionless Reaction. 5 STARS.All in all, this isn't an AMAZING game. The combat is fun when the camera doesn't whip around. The cutscenes just drag ON and ON. What little combat you get in the first hour or so is limited to HALF the cutscene's durations. I swear the first half felt more like an interactive B-Movie. Don't buy this if you're a fan of the Metal Gear series. Buy it if you want some mindless fun chopping up baddies with some bosses and a LOT of quicktime events.

I started this game with an open mind, knowing it wasn't the tactical game other MGs are, but I immediately felt a disturbance in the force. Let's begin...PC PORTWhen the game opened, a window greeted me. ""Oh, it must be 1999,"" I thought, ""maybe I opened my SNES emulator!"".Then I realized it was my latest purchase, and I hurried to the customize menu.That's when things began to go wrong.It doesn't feature the resolution I play with, which is 1920x1200, so I had to play a 1920x1080 windowed. There are indie games that are more flexible than this one.In pain and hurt by this, I start the game.FIRST BLOODAfter a slow tutorial you learn the game has basically two buttons you must smash to go ahead, plus an""activate for effortless movements""button where you don't have to do♥♥♥♥♥♥to go over obstacles and a""stop time and cut sh*t""button that lets you sushi up your enemies.I was thinking ""This game f-ing plays itself"". But I didn't know it got worse.I started a mission and - behold! - smashing buttons on my controller got the job done.I tried to parry, but it was the same key as the hit button. I have a xBox controller: I have 10 keys I can press and you force me to use the same button for hitting and parrying. Nice job! I don't feel like an idiot at all, having to use just a couple of buttons to play the game.THE F- YOU CAMERAThe camera earned its own section. You can rotate it BUT IT ALSO FOLLOWS YOU.That means that if you are trying to fight, let's say, a boss that moves fast, you may center the camera on him while you dodge his attacksjust to see it move away, pointing to you.It doesn't care if you need to know where your deadly enemy is, why would you?Dark Souls has been out for so much time one would hope people learned how to do a decent third person action game.LEVEL DESIGNThe level design is plain. Just plain. Follow the road, don't explore too much (or we will put an invisible wall, just to remind 2014 is here but nothing changed, mofo), just go straight ahead.Really nothing to say here.CUTSCENESWhen you realize how many cutscenes there are just in the first hour of game you'llknowthis game plays itself.That's the pattern: go ahead, kill a couple of minions, now kill a bigger one, CUTSCENE, walk 20 meters, CUTSCENE, ninjarun 40 meters, hit a guy, CUTSCENE.It's worse than the other Metal Gear games. Kojima, write a movie already!THIS GAME PLAYS ITSELFUnder 3 combat buttons - check!""Press me to do everything while chasing enemies"" button - check!Refill life when killing even stupid minion - check!And just when you think it can't get worse, someone over your codec goes ""Yo Raiden, did you know you can SCAN THE AREA AND KNOW WHERE ENEMIES ARE, EVEN BEHIND WALLS? AND DID YOU KNOW THAT SCAN REVEALS WHAT YOU CAN CUT?"" and just surprises you. The game just stopped being a game and started being a... don't know.

Game is in quotes because I can't call this trash a game. Because games are fun. You see, it tries to be Devil May Cry, but fails MISERABLY. DMC is about using a variety of attacks to be stylish. This is ""Press X and Pray: The Game"". You never want to use Y attacks, because then you'll need a half second to switch to the X button and BOOM. G'over. There goes your score you rightfully earned. Good try, fruit.The story is pretty much Raiden going from ""battle-scarred hero"" to ""edgier than Shadow the Hedgehog, Donte, and Heaven's Feel Emiya Shirou combined."" I mention Emiya because he turns into a sword, more or less. There's also♥♥♥♥♥♥about nanomachines and a bunch of reddit memes that /v/ eats up because it has the Metal Gear label. However, even Kojima-san cries himself to sleep thinklng about how people started on this godawful game.The characters include Jack ""The Edgehog"" Raiden, Jetstream ""♥♥♥♥ing horrid boss fight"" Sam, Monsoon ""Heavy Metal theme"" Idontknowthelastname, Sundowner ""LE FORNICATING IMPERVIOUS FACE! XDDDD"" Discbreaker(because he's ♥♥♥♥ing hard as balls until you realize you can parry the shield dash, which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid because there's 0 enemies that you can do that to besides him), Senator ""LE MICROROBOTS, BOY FACE! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"" Armstrong, who's the shoehorned villain(SPOILER ALERT), and a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s you call on the Codec(read: never, because of how immerision breaking it is). Oh and Mistral too but she was fun and not a terrible meme so I'm not giving her an insulting middle name.Anyway, I mentioned the fanbase. /v/ has a raging hard-on for this♥♥♥♥♥♥and it's gotten to the point of brony-tier obsession. You talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about it? ""HURR DURR U HAS NO SKILL RULES OF NATURE STANDING HERE"" Skill is a buzzword used by lucky and/or experienced people with large egos, first off. Secondly, while the music is the one good thing about this game, it should've been released as a CD. In fact, this game should've been a movie. Seriously, 5 hours is how long it'll take to beat the campaign. Yes, MGSV:GZ is 2 hours, but you know what it was? Fun and with so many ways to play.Final score? Literally the worst/10. At least Gone Home didn't pretend to be a game. I need to replay Twin Snakes and lament how ♥♥♥♥ed the franchise is if the clowns at Platinum keep it up.EDIT: I hear you skill♥♥♥♥ keep talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about me. ♥♥♥♥ off, I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing badass at this game.

Bringing up the pad maybe will change my mind, but up to the moment it is the worst my purchase ever.1. First and the most important - not friendly to the newcomers. Brief and very uninformative tutorial, unanimated moves list (hey, have you ever seen Fable 1?? I don't even talk about DMC series!!!!), additional tutorials as a VR missions, no information on vital point of attack. The game just put you into the middle of the fight with no explanations of rules or triggers or gives you valuable infor after (!!) it was actually needed. Even Darksouls was more friendly to me.2. Controls. WSAD to control the camera during the sword mode? WTF??? Took me lots of dying on the intro mission (!!!!) to understand it. Lots of separate keys that could have been made easier? Separate X from the F just for one function? Very reasonable (no it's not). Timing of attacks, movent/attack control - never heard of it?3. Glitches. Lots of glitches. Most concerned with the camera. Was really nice to not see the UG in the intro on the second fight, to look at the ground than attack was coming from above. Abnormal changes of movents - then tryin to sidejump, instead just jump into the plasma shot. Glitches with the swordmode - promting to activate just to understand you can't reach the target, or your character just moved away from the target then it is most vulnerable. I do really hate that. Oh, and I always wanted to study Japaneese. No really, and the developers knew it. How else can you explain that the ierogliph in the right means to enter into the swordmode or ninja mode?4. Gameplay. Capcom, hello! It is 2014 now, not 1998. It is not the first slasher in the world. While you can tolerate with the corridor walkthrough, the process itself is not so fascinating. Lots of moves you want probably use. But they make you purchase them - after last DMC I can't get it. 20 moves from the start for what? Just to fill the button mashing? Telephone is another isse - though a good idea it starts to make you boring after the second misson. Too much details at once. Combat with UGs is always a pain. no understanding of the weak points, no sidejumps or sidewalks, bad locking system - i just wonder wh I need it at all? What a brilliant mind makes us block the big bad sword of the first UG in the beginning and makes us weak against all the leg kicks of the small UGs?5. Style. I can't say the graphics is bad. Very good in fact. But the style is too edgy and the interior is worse than character details.The only reason you will like this game - if you are a Metal Gear fan, never played such games or just enjoy slasher in any kind. For me - better try DMC again."

Yup Platinum games made a kojima game.Rising feels just the right amount of clunky to almost make Raiden feel like Snake after one too many energy drinks. Which isn't necessarily what I want for a ""lightning fast"" ninja game. The game plays somewhat like ninja gaiden, so the inaccuracies of items and a lock-on camera that doesn't want to stick tend to detract from the experience.The sword cutting can be amazing, but far too often controls or the camera pull your attention away from using it in combat. By default, holding the cut button causes the left stick to move the camera - no you cannot move, and yes you were trying to go forward when you hit the cut button. Choosing one of the few other control schemes still often left me correcting for badly timed camera action.I wouldn't say the story telling of this installment is where it excels, but this game artfully oozes badassery akin to how other Metal Gear games incorporated a bizarre 60's pulp. The game does feel like it was going for mainstream appeal and eskews lengthy cutscenes forsequences like quick-time running events - most of which have Raiden taking out several hundred tons of concrete.As far as the pc port goes, the quality is notable. There are several graphics options, including options for the number of physics objects on screen and the timeout on them.

Works for me, but it should be mentioned, because for many it does not.Hardware recommendations? It works, but laughable for a title than runs on last generation consoles!Graphic Options? A joke. Honestly? Three options for resolutions? In 2014? And one is actually 800x600? Again, in 2014? It does look pretty good though, despite that rather puzzling bit. So, nevermind, right?I'm trying to warm up to the game right now, so it may take some time until I expand this review to a full one, but for now:It looks pretty good, has okay sound, no story to speak of (thus far) and the controls handle like a buttered cow on ice! In blade mode you hardly hit anything because your reach is nonexistant, in ninja mode you can at least dodge properly, but only fight ""hit and run"" style, which is at least better than trying your awesome combo moves in close quarters, because you get either stunned for a few seconds, thrown to the ground or both at the same time with every single enemy hit. Blocking an attack is rather difficult to do in 1 on 1 and outright impossible against more than one foe. In result the combat has no real flow. Either I am just really, really bad at this or the game merely did a pretty bad job at actually explaining how it works. (And, yes, I am playing with a gamepad and played the ""it's-not-even-3-minutes-long"" tutorial.)Maybe this will get better with time. The only thing I can say for now: It feels massively inferior to ""Remember Me"" (which I finished yesterday), and that is a rather sad accomplishment considering that (a) the combat was rather mediocre in that game and (b) ""MGS: Revengeance"" has offered nothing else but combat so far.Both games are on par with annoyingly interrupting the flow of the game with cutscenes and audio transmissions that prevent you from doing anything while slowly walking with a finger in your ear, though ""RM"" made the folly of cutting into the flow of combat even, then again it had better cutscenes. Touché.I want to like this game, I really do. But it won't let me. I will try for a few more times, but if it remains that stubbornly un-flowing, I will not ignore that.

The first mission bugged out and the second time you fight the metal gear the camera got stuck looking at the direction he jumped from in the cutscene, then when I restarted said battle one of it's set piece moves bugged the camera out to look directly up and stay there while the fight was still going on and he'd finished his set piece move. That was litteraly the first impression the game gives you and it doesn't get better. The combat system relies totally on the 'parry' move and gives no means for basic blocking and very limited dodge capabilities, which are made harder by the terrible camera. At this point I've litteraly fought a handfull of basic soldiers and the first 2 mini bosses and I'm already willing to put the game down for being so lacking in basic hack and slash fundementals.If you want to play a meat puppet for the AI to whale on this is the game for you, otherwise go look for something less masochistic to play."

If you're looking for a stealth game, keep looking. This one's about the action. Remember Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4? He's back, and better than ever. This time, he's ready to kick ten times the♥♥♥♥♥ with ten times the strength... well, that is, unless you're in Revengeance mode.Yeah, you heard me. Raiden, kicking♥♥♥♥♥Suplexing Metal Gear RAY is only part of it.And that's with hisobsoletebody. You can hack apart enemies like they were made of cardboard. Chuck EMP grenades at cyborgs and UGs, andshred them to pieces.The story starts with Raiden acting as a bodyguard for the Prime Minister of a war-torn country somewhere in Africa. Suddenly, two mysterious cyborgs by the name of Jetstream Sam and Sundowner appear, and Sundowner takes off with the Prime Minister. Raiden prepares to pursue, but then is confronted by Metal Gear RAY, whom he defeats twice. As Raiden approaches Sundowner, the Prime Minister is killed. Raiden prepares to kill Sundowner, but Jetstream Sam interferes and takes Raiden on. Raiden barely manages to survive, losing his whole left arm as well as his eye. Raiden, however, undergoes surgery and emerges with a new body, that of which far surpasses the old one in terms of capability. As he discovers that Sundowner is part of Desperado, a PMC that was actually a terrorist organization, he makes an effort to stop them once and for all. However, along the way, he encounters a completely different threat, one that he must put an end to lest history repeat itself.The only things that I didn't like were that the story was pretty short, and Raiden didn't have a lot of moves. If the story were two or three times as long, it would've been absolutely wonderful. There was one particular chapter that I won't spoil where it consisted of only a relatively short and disappointing boss fight, which could've been ten times as amazing. The combat was great, but Raiden didn't have that many moves (Unless you used the special weapons, but then you'd have to switch to them, which you can only do after standing still). A lot of the time I found myself in constant repitition of one or two combos. The DLC stories for this game are amazing, though, and breathe new life into the combat that may or may not become stale during the main story.All in all, I would give this game a 9/10. Kojima and Platinum Games could'veabsolutelymade it worthy of a perfect 10, but in the end I had to go with a 9 due to a couple flaws. If you are thinking of getting this, I completely recommend it. You'll have tons of fun."

But later you start think - how to use block correctly? How to face to enemy? What abilities  your enemies has and how they work?  How to get stronger, improve stats and weapons? etc.  When you get answers for those questions the game is found as very enjoyable.Every boss is puzzle, some more some less. The first battle with Wolf is pain, but if you learn to block - it is easy. Mansoon looks as impossible to defeat until you start block his attacks. This game is not about attacks spaming - you should move, react to abilities and block. After you learn to battle the game becomes easy.PC version is nice. I didn't see any bug. Thanks for keybinding. I've tried to use the gamepad but found the mouse+keyboard more comfortable.This is my first MG game. I don't know any story background but I like this game. The general line is very simple - bad guys want to do evil, the hero confronts them. But game shines in details, in characters, dialogs, small background moments and face emotions. Sam and Wolf are the best ones. It is sad that I've not any PS to try other MG games.There is only one disadvatage for me - the game is very short! Even three campaigns and twice replaying Raiden are not enough. The achivements/gear/rating farming is not fun imo."

So further Metal Gear  never really attract my attention. But this Metal Gear looked different and so i give it a try.I have to say i not regret it to buy this game, is simply love it. You cannot compare Metal Gear Rising with the Solid Snake series. The comparison is unfair. Beacause the focus of this game is not the sneaking around thing, it's about action, action and more action. Sneaking your way through is only one possibitily to make your way through the game. An oppurtunity you will not use that often, after you have learned the challenging fight system. The fighting system seems not that hard at the beginning when playing on easy. But i can say it is. When playing on normal and trying to accomplish more sophisticated combos gained from your enemies or trying to block the damage away, it'll give you a hard run for your money.One can estimate that the developers wanted to make this difference and tell us another story. The story of Raiden, also known as Jack The Ripper. An extremly dangerous and brutal slaying cyborg.The cutscenes are worth seeing, although they are totally exaggerated. I by myself had to laugh a certain times, because of these excessive action and movement Raiden shows among these cutscenes and in-game. That kind of action reminded me of DMC a few times. A friend of mine says that there are to many cutscenes. And yes he is right, the game often hand over control. I don't dislike that, because the cutscenes are worth seeing, like i mentioned before, but i can understand when others do.I often read that the camera movement is a big contra for a lot of players. I cannot tell how camera behaves on PS3 or how difficult camera movement is when using a game controller. I can only tell when playing with mouse and keyboard the camera movement behaves similar to well-known RPG's or other action adventures. You can always turn the ""spot"" to the action or wherever you like.So, conclusion...If you like games with excessive action. If you like cyborg and swordfight action. If you like DMC and similar games. If you want a game that can be very challenging on harder levels, then say hello to one of your new favourite games: Metal Gear Rising.If not, this game is not made for you."

Or, dodge the attacks if you don't care to time it and just want the quicker recovery, and they become punctuation marks in your combo. Also, be glad the enemies take so many hits, because the last time you faced them, they smashed you, or you didn't think you worked over them justright, andthis timeyou'd like to show them a piece of your mind.Every single one of your attack animations and mechanics in this game seems to have been so refined and worked over that the game starts to take on qualities of a musical instrument. Fellow instrument players will understand: whatever demons you think you have inside you, this game is going to bring them out, and applaud you for every button press under their influence. There is even a cutscene in the game that will pretty much sum up your feelings about the game.

In actuality, a much weaker PC runs the game just fine if you're willing to CUT some of the graphical settings, shadows and AF mainly.If you like fast-paced, unforgiving and challenging but fair action that don't ask too many questions, then this is for you. The straight-forward approach and extremely satisfying combat akin to DMC3 and Ninja Gaiden is the meat of this game. The story and the characters have their entertaining quirks in the story and optional codec conversations, but the real meat of this game is the gameplay.This is all action, no tedious padding, and while that's probably what makes the game shorter, it adds to replayability and it just feels like a particularly well CUT movie: parts that add nothing to the whole will be left to the floor of the cutting room."

But drip-fed upgrades and a variety of unique weapons spice things up. The only thing that I found to completely stop the flow was secondary weapons, like your rocket launchers and such; you'll be dashing dizzly about the screen, barely able to keep your eye on what's going on, and you tap your secondary weapon button. Suddenly everything stops, and you have to move a rather clunky aiming reticle - or grenade arc- to your target. Completely kills the sense of speed. And they're largely a waste of time anyway.Definitely recommend playing with an Xbox 360 controller or any controller, just the perfect twitch device for this kind of hack n slash.Cons:Story and dialogue is unsurprisingly lack lustre and the voice acting is about average.The environments are drab and poorly textured, compared to the sharp textures and animations of the combat.Crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥camera.

There is no time for calculatory strikes, it's all fast and no time to think.And my biggest problem with the game, and the reason I ALMOST gave this a 'No', is that it uses quick-time events VERY LIBERALLY. For example, almost all opponents stun if they hit you enough. Some opponents can stun you easier because they hit harder. How do you get out of the BILLIONS of stuns/snares? (For the PC) Holding down control and rapidly mashing the WASD keys. This isn't fun. When will developers learn this?

Yes the story is nonsensical, yes it doesn't have highres textures. BUT GOD DAMN IT PEOPLE its one of the most amazing combat engines ever, and the framerate is silky smooth. Get a controller and get ready for feeling like a badass through the whole length of the game. (around 7+ hours + DLC missions and VR Missions) If you liked Capcoms DMC or Platinum Games' previous Bayonetta you will absolutely love this game. If you haven't played those its time for you to delve into what these games bring too the table.(Also it doesn't seem like the port has any issues, looks and plays better than its console counterpart)."

It's got the political intrigue of a Metal Gear game combined with the neck-break speed of an action game. I've been a fan of games like Ninja Gaiden in the past and have gotten bored of them pretty quickly, but Kojima Productions and Platinum have done a fantastic job keeping it fresh with this title. The moves are quick, easy, and yet deep enough to string together some insane combinations. It's also quite difficult at times. I'm currently playing on 'Normal' mode, and intend to graduate to 'Hard' after I beat it, but I'll have to up my game, and it isn't often that I have to do that. Not that I'm that good, it's simply that games have gotten easier over time. This game has the difficulty of an old-school beat-'em-up with the story that I expect from Metal Gear. Playing as a cyborg-Raiden (complete with so many different cuztomiations...including a you-know-who cameo as a costume) is really awesome and makes you feel like you truly are an unstopable military-psychotic-cyborg-jack-the-ripper.I'm barely through the second boss but I'm already addicted. I intend to update the review once I'm finished with the game and I'm quite certain it'll just be more praise. This game will certainly keep me occupied for quite a while.

With Raiden once more being the lead role in a Metal Gear game it tends to rub fans of the series the wrong way since we all love us some good ol SOLID SNAKE.That being said, MGR is not MGS. Although it has has elements of stealth available it is at it's core a fast paced, hack n slash. The battles are fast paced and also has it's Parry system which is critical to halting your enemies attacks and in order to create openings for you to deal the decisive blows. This is made even more apparent in boss fights where successfully deflecting their assaults can mean dealing a critical strike to your foe or suffering one yourself.The game also features the ""Blade Mode"" which is an outstanding means to slash the ever loving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your enemies. Blade Mode slows down time to crawl and you can slice your enemies to bite size chunks (Granted, Blade Mode can only be maintained in short bursts). Targetting specific body parts can cripple your enemies or can lead to a sexual ZANDATSU finishing move which allows you to tear out your enemies insides and absorb their energy to replenish your stats. The Blade Mode is also ciritical in boss fights as you often need to strike the enemies weak points to inflict any long lasting damage. Throw in some QTE (Quick Times Events) and you have a very satisfying system.My first playthrough clocked me about 6 hours. Now, CALM DOWN! That was on normal difficulty and the game has immense replay value as you can unlock stat upgrades, Boss weapons and VR missions to squeeze even more value for your money.Pros:- Fast paced, visceral combat system.- SOLID Boss fights, well scripted encounters.- Outstanding Graphics and Visual Effects.- EARGASMIC Soundtrack (RULES OF NATURE).- Immense replay value.Cons:- Weak Story. (Cliched and down right weird in some areas).- Weak characterization. (Characters needed to be fleshed out more).- Inflexible Upgrade system (Limited Customising options).Buy the damn game.

It would have been fine except you need to move your mouse into the correct position then click to attack however moving your mouse too fast ALSO makes you attack so I found myself messing up in instances where the game forced me to swing when I wasn't ready."

The only problem I had with it is that it's too easy once you figure out  that you only need to mash forward and light attack to win all fights except the last boss fight of the game. Seriously, the last boss fight was the only fight in here that was even remotely hard and that's due to their being elements that you can't dodge as well as some memorization of attacks needed. This game would have been perfect if it was harder.I would still recommend this game even though it's easy as the soundtrack, visuals, and presentation are full adrenal. Also, because it's cheap and there aren't many full action games like this out there. Hoping there's a sequel that will address the easy gameplay."

Unlike most JRPGs that tease you with a great boss fight and then go ""and now to explain how I went from being a dirt farming to where I am now"" and leave you with less enjoyable combat for the next 60 hours until you get back to where the story started off, this game doesn't give you a taste and then take it all away, anything you can do in that first boss fight you can do the entire rest of the game, no spending hours upon hours to get back to that level of enjoyable combat, its there from the get go.I know that is a compairison to a different genre, but the point is that the game starts out with enjoyable combat and interesting boss fights and keeps it going. With that said I would definitly play it only with a controller because though it is playable with a keyboard and mouse, its definitly meant for a controller, then again thats pretty true of the genre for the most part.With that said, though this is a port of a game that came out on consoles a year before it came out on PC, its definitly something worth having in your PC colection even if you already played it on consoles. Though I love my mostly Indie collection of games, I would love to see more of these type of well known titles come out on PC with good ports, heck I would rather own a mediocre port of a game on PC then own a game on console, but that aside hopefully less games are console exclusives and more games that have been traditionally console only come out on PC. (Kingdom Hearts, Pheonix Wright, Shin Megmi Tensi, Fire Emblem, Metal Gear, and Monster Hunter to name a few)Either way, if you where on the fence about picking this up due to the fact that it is a port of a year old console game, its worth picking up, it even includes all the DLC that was on consoles, so even if you can pick up a console version for a few bucks cheaper, this game includes all the DLC (which probably still costs more just for the DLC then this entire pack for PC)"

Try this.It starts out pretty neat, ""Oh hey I'm some sort of robit ninja and I can hack fools apart."" And then you find Zandatsu, slice some things into pieces and think ""Damn this is really impressive technically I wonder how they did it."" And then RULES OF NATURE HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥I'M AWESOME THIS IS AWESOME YOU ARE THE BEST BOSS EVER. And then you play beyond the first level and it doesn't stop.Most encounters are a decent mixture of enemy types, all of whom will shake themselves into different priorities and difficulties as you play. They all have their unique attacks and patterns, as well as synergistic stuns and locks that will open you up to attacks from others. For example, Raptors I could eat for breakfast, but Mastiffs? Can't handle them, never could. I've gotten better of course, but it's illustrative of how differentiated the enemy types are. Ask two different people and they'll probably have entirely different enemy preference and technique, and that deals into whether you decide to stealth an encounter or go in sword blazing, or even take out the tough guys from stealth and then mop up. A varied selection of explosives and other staple sub items give you plenty of tricks and ways to open, or avoid encounters entirely. It's not a stealth game, as was never the aim, but the stealth holds up pretty well regardless, which is nice. You can fully heal in mid-combat by stealing people's gatorade, and sometimes it's a matter of keeping some grunts alive simply as health stations just in case things go awry. There's a degree of strategy to fights that belies the simple slice n dice it seems to be on the surface, and that's neato.A fantastic OST driven by guitars, WUBs and the ever-present HYPE. There are a few situations where this melds perfectly into gameplay, most prominently in the boss fights, but also in the pseudo-stealth segments. There's sneaky-deaky versions of most ambient tracks, and you're sneaking around and everything's going fine and just around this corner and you're safe and ! WUBWUBWUB GUITAR RIFF and then it starts getting really crazy but you don't mind cause you can take 'em cause the music tells you so. I found that it would serve a dual purpose, depending on the flow of the fight. If you're dancing around lopping bits off of every cyborg in sight, it only serves to amplify how INVINCIBLE ROBOT NINJA BADASS you are. If you take a hit or few, especially if your low health warning is beeping away right inside your ear, it still tells you to get up, dust off, you can take him and the horse he rode in on just listen to these wubs how could you not take him he's a total ♥♥♥♥♥ you're a badass go on you can do it you can take him and that's how I beat Sundowner for the first time at 3.9% and it was the best feeling ever. Supremely quotable lines in just about every boss theme make replays an exercise in anticipation and joy, and the vocals kicking in when you start kicking♥♥♥♥♥is just another gold nugget on the pile.Every single boss is well-designed and extremely fun to play. Every one is also HYPED to hell and back, be it personal grudges, horrible history, dramatic cutscenes, whatever. The preceding few minutes was always me thinking to myself, ""Oh boy, I get to fight that ohh I can't wait stop talking and get to it dammit."" The soundtrack swells appropriately and gets you pumped up to do damage, and the cutscene dialog, though cheesy at times, serves to heighten the tension and mostly start manic grinning. If you manage to do well, you feel invincible, slashing pieces off people and gliding through their attacks, laughing all the way. It really is a rewarding feeling, though that may just be the adrenaline. When you do get wrecked though, it doesn't feel particularly cheap. There's always somewhere else you could have been or a risk you shouldn't have taken, but once you restart the whole cycle goes back to the beginning and you can take him you can take him etc.+Slick combat worthy of experimentationReplay value in both campaign and VRExcellent OST both in and out of gameGreat BossesMasochist difficulty availableGreat DLC missionsHYPE-Short for a single playthroughSome degree of cheese and edgeKind of tough to get a handle on at firstUnskippable credits and other small UX/UI flubsI loved every minute of it and I've played through it several times, with a view to do Revengeance one of these days.

Got the swing of things within the first two hours, there is essentially no blocking. parrying and dodging enemy attacks are your only methods of defense.  That being said you can parry nearly every attack thrown at you with good timing, and it looks amazing when you parry a flurry of attacks from bosses one after the other.  I'm on the very last chapter or level if you would, it was overall not the most difficult of games on typical normal difficulty.  In fact I was only stuck on the first boss before learning to parry correctly.  You gain points after each chapter based on your performance which you spend on upgrades including new moves, Raiden's look, and base life stats.  Overall well worth my purchase for 14.99 on the Steam sale.  Any fan of MGS2 who enjoyed that brief brief stint of Raiden with the sword at the end owes it to themselves to play this at least once.  It's no Devil May Cry in terms of hack n slash combos, but its still very satisfying slashing enemy entourages to bits in very flashy eye pleasing ways."

The main character moves like an enhanced robotic Assassin but can't climb up walls which is odd because he does just that in a few cutscenes.All in all, the game is completely worth getting and I reccomend it to anyone as my cons are really just small complaints and nothing very serious."
,Recommended,235460,8640783,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,SimplyToon,"All I can say about this game is wow.. just wow.I remember first hearing about this coming to PC when Kojima tweeted it in the June 2013. At that point in time I was super excited and couldn't wait for it to come out, then later in October of 2013 he tweeted a picture saying ""Rising PC version looking good, even the shadow looks beautiful."" And finally I logged into Steam in December and not only finding out the Winter Sale had started, but this game had released on Steam. I immediatly, and let me repeat, IMMEDIATLY bought this game without hesitation. And then after waiting impatiently for its release, I played it the hour it came out. And let me tell you.. I have yet to stop playing it.Let me discuss how well the developers ported this game.1. No 30 FPS cap.That's right folks this game is not locked at all, it runs at 60 FPS and is as smooth as butter.2. The options are detailed.I hit a major disappointment when I bought Assassin's Creed III as the graphics options were only three sliders ranging from ""Low, Medium and High"". And from hearing the hated comments about Metal Gear Rising being a bad port, and the absurd system requirements, I started to worry. But I checked the options and they did not disappoint me at all. They range from antialiasing to the Zangetsu options. This game is playable at a solid 50 FPS on my Intel Dual Core and AMD 6450, no where near an i5, i7 or an NVIDIA Card.3. The game looks amazing even on Low setting.I run my game without antialiasing and think it still looks great being ran at 720p.4. We get all the DLC and extras included without charge.The game was already on sale for $20 when I got it, and we get the DLC for free? Pinch me.Now let me discuss how itself is an amazing game.1. It works as a standalone title.The game is much different than the other Metal Gear games (although in a way manages to keep its feeling of being one) and everyone won't like it but this ties right into the mix that fans know and love, while not alienating those who have never played an MGS game in their lives.2. It's violent as hell, but manages to also have a sense of humor.Blood, gore, violence. This game is built on it, but also manages to keep a good laugh in some parts of what the other Metal Gear games have.3. Great fighting, Combos, and Training.This game immediatly throws you into the action of fighting, but also doesn't leave you hanging on the controls. It teaches you numerous time on combos, tactics, and skills you can use. VRTraining comes in handy alot, especially for first timers to games like this.4. We get to know more and focus on Raiden.Now don't get me wrong, Snake will always be the main protangonist, but with such an awesome side character as Raiden, (especially in MGS4) how can you not wan't to play as him and learn a little more about him?5. Metal Gear Solid fans will love it.Like I said, yes, this game is completely different than the Metal Gear Solid franchise we know but that isn’t what Revengeance is aiming for. It's supposed to be breezy and free, and fun. What’s without question is that this game still feels like a very welcome part of the universe.Graphics: 18/20Story: 14/20Gameplay: 19/20Replayability: 15/20Soundtrack: 18/20Overall: 84/100This game is a great edition to the Metal Gear franchise, and I feel bad for anybody that doesn't give it a chance."

I'm also bad at video gamesin the back of my mind, I always wanted to come back to the game, and I later did (Apr 2015). I looked up how to parry, and then started where I left off in a rainy Colorado plaza right before the boss. I was finally hooked, because I could finally parry. I've loved the game since.but,they really shouldn't 'pass' you in the parry tutorial if the player doesn't actually know how to do the mechanic. a friend of mine also quit because the emphasis on parrying was understated in its own tutorialI didn't like the story the first time I went through the game, because I was trying to fit it into the metal gear universe, and it was souring it as much as MGS4 did. but as it went on, I learned to love it for the absurdity. the cutscenes became the dessert, the cherry on top of the fighting, rather than a chore. it was particularly enjoyable as someone who played the other games (especially MGS2), spotting the similarities to other games (like Raiden's insertion to the war zone at the beginning of R-01, mimicking Solid Snake's MGS1 insertion and Big Boss's MGS3 insertion)the customization menu is a lot of fun, giving you rewards for playing the game, and adding a lot of replayability to it"

I played with KB/M as usual and it was a little tough to figure out the slicing mechanics with it. I don’t quite understand why you couldn’t change your slice angle with the mouse instead of the keyboard, absolutely made no sense but I managed (poor PC optimizing, that’s a naughty BAD developer). The story was good but in typical Metal Gear fashion it was confusing as hell and I couldn’t remember any of the characters from the past games, if they were even in the past games. That’s the problem with the MG series I have always had, stories are pretty good, confusing as♥♥♥♥♥♥but still good however the games are so spaced out that I can never remember details from previous games I feel I should know. I have played them all but Snake Eater and I still couldn’t give you the gist of the story, doesn’t matter it’s still bad♥♥♥♥♥ I also feel like you finally got to play the character Raiden how he was always meant to be played. I know there is a lot of hate for his character but I think he is badass. I’m kinda glad the game didn’t drag out any longer though because it was starting to feel a little long winded toward the end, yes even for a 6 hour game. I was expecting some kind of Solid Snake cameo…nope. If you like the MG games and this comes up for cheap I say go for it.I almost forgot to mention I had to play this on easy, I tried normal and got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked relentlessly.

,Recommended,235460,17440051,"Posted: 8 August, 2015",all,Lenmacca,"I played this on the Xbox 360 back in 2013 when it first came out.First off, I will say that Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance should not be taken seriously. This was a mistake I made the first time around. In my youthful naivity, it went straight over my head.Now, I would compare it to the recent short-film, Kung Fury, in that it isn't supposed to be taken seriously--this is a ridiculous, action-packed, bombastic experience, and it's absolutely hilarious for those reasons. Another good example to compare it to would be Jurassic World. It's a little bit difficult to expect this from a Metal Gear game, which is why I suppose it's called Metal Gear RISING rather than Metal Gear SOLID.Having played it again, I remember how painful the controls are to get used to, particularly the blocking system, which must be timed perfectly and to a tee in order to successfully block an attack. However, once you get used to it, which does require alot of patience, the games controls are pretty decent.Unlike other modern games (and indeed keeping in line with the tradition of earlier Metal Gear games), this is full of fantastic boss fights. Combined with the games control scheme, these bosses are quite challenging--exactly what a boss fight should be like. I can still remember the final boss fight in particular, which is testament to how memorable it is!So yes, I would recommend this game if you're looking for a game that is essentially a ridiculous, over-the-top 80s action movie. However, if you're looking for a game with the emotional depth and dramatic flair of a Shakespearean epic that typically comes with a Metal Gear Solid title, you won't find it here."

The combat mechanics are really great in this, linking big combos and the chaos on screen as you hack and slash away at everything and everyone around you is really enjoyable.The free blade slicing is fun to use as well. By entering a different state you can take control of where you slice by using the right stick, this gives you so much control and allows you to hack at a weakened enemies soft spot to grab BP (an ingame credit for buying new skins/weapons/moves/health etc).The boss fights are well made and I found them pretty challenging, that last one took me a few attempts. But it pays as it feels a real achievement to do it.The above topped off with an enjoyable story and backed up with decent cut scenes makes this a blast. I would recommend it. Game took me around 7 hours so its not a huge time ivestment but its all the better for it."

,Recommended,235460,17436182,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,Jewy Lewis and the News,"I'm going to start my review with a bold statement.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeanceis one of the most over-the-top, over-the-limit, overly-Japanese games I've ever played.It's not without its flaws (and there are a few of them), but the game is so great you'll find yourself choosing to ignore them.First of all,the graphics are gorgeous.There are particle effects for days, to appropriate some cool kid slang. The atmosphere is fantastic; supposedly taking place in some alternate timeline 2018, everything feels both futuristic and impressive in scale. It's that cool future, the one that isn't dystopian and gritty but is clean and sleek. It looks kind of like a less saturatedMirror's Edge.The level design, in turn, looks great and is just varied enough to keep you interested, although I did get the feeling that some assets were re-used along the way.Revengeanceis a hack-and-slash, and boy can you hack and slash, not to mention that you can also dismember, behead, eviscerate, and explode.The game features an incredible destruction enginefor both characters and the environment, better than the comparableRed Faction: Guerilla; if you see it, you can chop it into a million pieces. However, unlikeRed Faction, the level design is linear, so there are plenty of boundaries you can't carve your way through.The linearity barely crosses your mind, though, sincethe combat is absolutely unparalleled.There might be less combos than, say, theDevil May Cryreboot, butDMCnever looked or felt this good. Your primary weapon is an electrified carbon fiber ""High Frequency blade"", but explosive projectiles can be found throughout the levels and sub-weapons can be purchased after you defeat the boss they belong to. They add a little bit of diversity to the combat, but not a lot. Using and experimenting with ""Blade Mode"" (which utilizes the destruction engine), though, makes you giggle like a schoolgirl and makes you come back for more.The only thing better than the combat, and I mean this seriously, is the game's soundtrack.Composer Jamie Christopherson, collaborating with rock-oriented electronic outfit The Maniac Agenda as well as heavy metal producer and ex-Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader, put together the fastest, most action-packed, and largest-sounding electronic metal I have ever heard. Even if you're not a fan of it, you still have to admit that it fits the atmosphere perfectly. Personally, I've listened to it over and over again since the game first came out.The first level perfectly demonstrates the synthesis of these over-the-top elements. I found myself screaming in wonder the entire time like a redneck at his first NASCAR race. ""The President of Generic African Nation has been kidnapped! There are cyborgs here! I can dismember said cyborgs! There is a hundred-foot-tall mech rising out of the sea, and now I'm destroying buildings and jumping across its missiles and slicing it in half!RULES OF NATURE! AAAAAAAAHHH! THIS IS SO COOL!""And there lies the problem in this game. Yes, the fact that it's so cool.You get the feeling throughout that the developers made a list of awesome things to do and places to fight and then tried to weave a story around it.It's messy and convoluted and makes very little sense overall.Likewise, the boss designs are awesome, but when mashed in with their context they make no sense. Why is a boss whose body is held together by magnetism talk about the ""memes of the soul""? Why does a gigantic bald Californian cyborg withscissor bladespreach the military-industrial complex? Why does a robotic dog with a chainsaw tail engage in a philosophical debate about free will? Why is there aBrazilian ninja? And what thehellis the game's final boss trying to say through his convoluted, schizo-Darwinian speech?It attempts to be preachy at points, but it tries to preach about far too many things. Technology? War? Humanity? Freedom? Nanomachines? I'm not sure what point the writers were trying to make. I'm not sure they know themselves.Additionally, the friendly characters pretty much only exist for plot development, gameplay explanation, and the occasional crack at comic relief. They're completely unnecessary for the most part and some don't even need to exist at all. Then there's the fact that this dense, complicated story unfolds through about maybe five hours of gameplay.Now let's get to the flaws in said gameplay. I get that it's aMetal Geargame, butwhy the hell is there a stealth mechanic?This is a hack-and-slash about blowing up cyborgs and grinding everything and everyone into little pieces; a stealth mechanic iscompletelyout of place, unnecessary, and you will never use it.I suppose it was an attempt to add variation to the gameplay, which there is very little of. Sure, the combat may be unparalleled, but for the most part it's the same thing the entire game. Just hack and slash, hack and slash, hack and slash.On a brief side note, you're going to want to use a controller for this game. Playing with a keyboard and mouse just feels downright stupid.Now that my rant about what the game gets wrong is over, would I still recommend it?Oh hell yes. Absolutely. To anyone and everyone.I can't quantify whyMetal Gear Rising: Revengeanceis one of my favorite games.If my review says anything, it should just be ""eh"". But great games aren't about numbers; they're about how they make you feel.Revengeanceis just big, dumb fun with the highest""Holy Crap Factor""I've ever had while playing a game. This game just feels great to play. It makes you feel great. For that, it deserves two cyborg thumbs up."

Triple-A+++, would buy again, probably twice.Weirdly, when the volcanic torrent of absurd/absurdly-fun violence ebbs once in a while, there's even an old imperial buttload of story and lore in here to delve into to.

In fact, I could say that they did it better than the console versions.

The genre of ""spectacle fighter"" refers to games like God of War, DMC, and Platinum Games' own Bayonetta.  Like these titles, Revengeance features over-the-top, fast-paced action.  Revengeance's specialty is the way it handles the use of a sword.  Raiden's sword can cut through nearly everything, and the player can activate Blade Mode to strategically dismember their enemies, or to just cut the crap out of a car, a tree, or the supports to the bridge where their enemies stand.The story, from what I know, is in the wake of MGS4 and cranks everything up to twelve from the beginning.  This transfers nicely to how ridiculous and awesome the boss fights are (i.e. One boss has a two swords that attach together like scissors, while the intro boss is a huge Metal Gear Ray).  Each boss also has their own amazing theme music, and lyrics to each kick in during the final phase of their fights.The PC port is nothing too special, but it is certainly functional.  It is mostly the same as the console version, with the same textures and still being capped at 60 FPS, but there are a few settings that can be cranked up, mainly the ability to run the game at 1080p.  On top of that, it is very well optimized, at least for my middle-end system (4GB RAM, GTX 550ti, AMD Phenom 2).  They did as best as they could with the keyboard/mouse controls, but this game is meant for a controller.The PC version does, however, include all DLC, which will add a few hours to an otherwise 4-5 hour main story playthrough.  The game certainly encourages multiple playthroughs, as there are five difficulties and a plethora of unlockables and secrets to collect.For fans of over-the-top, fast paced action, awesome boss fights, and slicing your enemies into tiny pieces, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is perfect for you."

Revengeance has the ability to stand alone as it's own story seperate from the MG world (although SOME knowledge works). The story is very simple, yet it's intense, over-the-top, campy, and incredibly self-aware in it's hyperbolic story telling and fan-interactive jokes. The game runs on the first playthrough around eight hours. I fired through this the firs time in one sitting, and was surprised at how quickly it ended, but it's not a bad thing. The brief nature of the game (even briefer once you start skipping cutscenes) makes it a very replayable game. The game has DLC which involve playing other characters. These add 2 or 3 hours to the games playtime, and they're fun, but don't at much to the game (although it is free at this point).Combat is fluid and fast. Compared to other Platinum games like Bayonetta, it's very similar, but slightly simpler, and a lot faster. Every boss has simple mechanics, but still each boss is not only an interesting character, but also appropriately challenging, and utilises the combat mechanics of the game to the fullest right from the start of the game. Movement through the world is very linear. A slightly more open experience would have brought the play time up, but at no point did I feel like I was on a rail. Every area is an arena essentially.PROS:Appropriate for people new to the Metal Gear universe.Good story telling, with a healthy mix of camp and serious elements.Very replayableCombat is fluid and comfortable.Free additional content.CONS:That additional content is weak.Incredibly short playtime.Huge leap between Easy and Normal (i.e. babby mode and too hard for me mode).Lack of openness to the world.If you're a fan of the metal gear series, or you're interested into it and you have the disposable income, go for it. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone. However, if you only have a passing interest, wait for it to be on sale and get it for a couple of legal tenders. This is an incredibly solid play experience that unless you like you're games 2gritty4me you'll love."
76561198029901597,Recommended,235460,16638296,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,Medical NM,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a surprising fun hack and slash game... especially if you enjoy this type of gameplay.First, the system requirements to play are high, as you can see by the georgeous quality of detail (as seen from the above gameplay still shots and the game's trailer).  I am really sorry if you do not meet these high standards, but if you believe that your computer can 'rise' up to the challange of grinding those 'metal gears' to run this beast of a game, then please feel free to continue reading this review that I have written...The game itself is worthy of its purchuse, just for the vast amount of detail that went into the story, the beautiful art style (very colourful, very detailed, with very creative character / enemy / boss designs), the gameplay is very solid and easy to figure out very fast (its a hack and slash - press A to hack and B to slash).  Mind though that as this is a hack and slash it is preffereable to play using an game controller (prefferably XBOX 360 control) rather than keyboard and mouse (NOTE - I am not saying you loose anything much from using just keyboard, but I just mean it makes the overall game much more enjoyable and alot easier, both for the player and their keyboard respectfully. (don't destroy your keyboard with all of the key slamming that you will be doing).One of the most enjoyable elements from this game comes from the unique and creative boss fights (most notablly occuring at the end of each stage).  No spoillers, but every boss fight is fun, each involving a unique way to drain their lifebar.  Their difficulty relies heavily in the player discovering the boss patterns and easier attacking approaches that can be taken when fighting (this becomes especially importnat when playing on higher difficulty settings).(Those who know hack and slash, please feel free to skip past this)... Now, those who do not know hack and slash, the Metal Gear Rising: Revengance does this genre justice, staying very true to this genre.  But, although there are many fun moments (for majority of each level) where it is so action packed that you won't know whats happening (due to the fact that you are kicking so much butt), however, there will be moments (prior to and after these action packed moments) where there will be graces periods / lack of fun, where you will be moving to the next section of the mission where nothing happens.  Again, this can be common with many hack and slash genred games (therefore, don't be surprised)Personally, I am not a 'Metal Gear' fan, and as this was my intro into the series, I was very confused on all of the various characters introduced (both reaccuring within the main series and those who speciffically for this game).  The plot itself was interesting, but again I found it lackluster and really confusing (again not knowing its overall releavance to the main series, plus not being familiar to majority of the 'metal gear' lore).From the overall game that I have played, after completing the main storyline of the game.  Additional gameplay becomes availiable that follows specific characters scene during the main storyline.  Its not just playing with an alturnative character skin, but it is its own game specifically focusing on specific characters from the main storyline (plus they have their own unique cutscenes).Additionally, in regards to many of the negative comments, many appear to be having issues with various bugs and other game crashing problems, however most, if not all, of these problems appear to have been fixed. (these problems may have been a result of not having the correct system requirements) (this is just an oppinion, not that I know this as fact)BOTTOM LINE:Purchuse ONLY if you have / consider to have the top of the line graphics card and are up to par with the high systems requirments.  This game will hack and slash your computer appart (graphically wise) if you do not meet those system requirements, so be careful.If you are a 'Metal Gear' fan, I hope(d) that you enjoy(ed) it...By now, you have either purchused it (so why are you reading this 'review'), or waiting to encounter one of those ""rare/shiny"" Steam Sales to appear... at this point, play the waiting game and WAIT until it goes on sale.If you have the system requirements and you love the hack and slash genre and especially if you like the 'Metal Gear' franchise, this is a MUST HAVE in your extensive Steam collection.(If you know your Metal Gear - 10/10)(If you do not know your Metal Gear - 9/10)(If you do not have the system requirments... then why on earth did you continue reading this review?)"

And I am so glad that I did. After some much-needed research on how to properly counter enemies and perform combos I fell in love with the combat. The boss fights are especially wonderful and tons of fun. The ridiculous speed of the combat and various maneuvers Raiden can before both through specific button combos and well-placed quick-time events caused me to experience some wonderful child-like glee.On an objective level I do think the dialogue is awful. Most of the writing falls flat and some of the English voice actors were just plain obnoxious. But--somehow--the further into the game I got the more it grew on me. By the time the story had come to a close I genuinely cared about Raiden and what would become of him. The writing was so painfully cheesy but completely self-aware that once I embraced it for what it was trying to be I couldn't help but smile at all the over-the-top bad-assery and silly one-liners.All in all, despite its shortcomings, I really thinkMetal Gear Rising: Revengeancesuceeded in capturing the essence of what people want out of video games.

I just want to say that the music in this game is really a great and it gets u pumped up for the boss fight ahead. The game is not very long, I beat the game in about 8-9 hours and the two DLC mission packs took me about 2-4 hours. However, the main game is one of THE funnest  games i have ever played. From the crazy stealth Zendatsu kills to the ripping of people's spins, thid gsme just oozes fun and awsomeness from every orafice. The Bladewolf DLC was a little boring untill the final boss fight, which i won't spoil. The DLC was basically a lot of the Zendatsu insta kills from behind by being a sneaky robo dog metal gear thingy. Thecombat was similar to how Raiden controles, but you are a lot less powerful health and energy wise. The Sam DLC was pretty bad. I felt that almost all of the bosses you face were cheap and took WAAAY to much time to kill. While the standard game had hard bosses and some easier ones, the ones in the Sam DLC all felt cheap and made me want to rage quit the game on several occasions. However, the way Sam played and his combos were really interesting. His charge lunge and just his charge moves overall were very powerful, but they took a long time to charge up to full power.Bad:Ok as i previously stated some of the bosses were really cheap, especially on higher difficulties. I felt the Sam DLC showed this the most as the first boss in the main game was really easy, but the one in the Sam DLC♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my♥♥♥♥♥for a solid hour befor i learned how to avoid his spams and just what combos to use. The last boss in both the main game and the Sam DLC was also cheap, but I would say he was a lot worse in the Sam DLC. He was just really hard in the main game with a few unfair attacks although they could be doged. However in the Sam DLC the final boss spams unblockable homing attacks tat he somtimes uses 2 and 3 times in a row. Now this dosn't sound horrible at first but keep in mind you can't block these attacks, so they almost always hit you. And my final complaint is the music. Now im saying the music sucks it's just that they use the same song over and over again for each bossfight and then don't play music any other time. So those are the only things holding this game back from greatness.Thanks for reading, if you made it all the way through that is, c ya"

I had gotten to the end of the game and had to defeat the final boss. As hard as I tried, I couldn't. It was infuriating. I couldn't parry or dodge his moves, I couldn't get a solid hit in on him, and thanks to the mass of miniboss fights beforehand, I had no healthpacks to revive myself with. I almost gave up, but instead I hatched a plan. I would go back and replay the other chapters so that I could farm healthpacks and get enough BP to unlock the Fox Blade, which, I had heard, was better than my standard sword. As I played through all the previous chapters, I began to realize a great many things. I learned of a great many health bonus powerups that I had missed completely by blazing through all the chapters at ludicrous speeds. I learned how to work with the parrying window and how to trigger perfect counterattacks. I learned that in Zangatsu mode, precision and accuracy were often more important than volume and bloodshed. I became better. I felt it, and god, was it satisfying.When I finally got around to challenging the final boss, I did so without using a single health pack and with my standard sword equipped. Once a fool, then a student, and now the master. I felt like a badass.VIOLENCE BREEDS VIOLENCEMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a third-person slash'n'slash'n'slash game where you play as mop-headed robot ninja Jack Raiden. It is ""Da Future"" and apparently Robot Ninjas are a ""thing"". This is all you really need to know about the story. The meat of the story is actually pretty succint and is told very well, so long as you don't just skip all the cutscenes. Near the end of the game however, it begins to border on absurdity, with an evil cyborg senator stealing brains from children so he can fund the creation of a giant cybernetic tarantula to kill the president and wage a war so that everyone can go to war to stop war. Nanomachines, son! Luckily, aside from the preachy moments where you argue philosophy with the bosses, MGR's story is aware of how exactly ridiculous it's story is. You'll be laughing your way through the final boss fight when you're not screaming at it's stupid QTE's.MERCY IS FOR THE WEAKMGR is a hard game, mostly because it doesn't do a stellar job at explaining its core mechanics. It essentially tells you that this thing called ""swimming"" happens to exist, then throws you into the deep end and tells you to swim fifteen laps before you hit the shower for the day. Sure, you'll drown, but you'll keep trying again and again because, you know, videogames. The mechanics are simple, but mastering them takes time and practice, and is all the more satisfying for it.THERE WILL BE BLOODSeeing these mechanics in action, however, is visceral and rewarding. At the beginning of the game, you'll run down an exploding building and slice a fifteen-story robot clean down the middle with your sword. Counterattack an enemy perfectly and you'll kick him into the air, cut him into a thousand tiny little blood-soaked pieces, rip out his spinal column and devour it before the mangled remnants of his body even touch the ground. Most of the time, this isn't done in a cutcene either: you actually get  to do these things, controlling when and where your sword will bisect your opponents. It very much helps that the game looks beautiful on PC. The game is optimized incredibly well, with Medium settings looking gorgeous and High settings rendering every drop of rain in the title menu. Granted, Resolution is capped and 1900 x 1200 at 1080p, but that shouldn't be a problem for most people. If it is, the game can be run in a window, but Windowed Fullscreen mode is sadly absent. Also, don't listen to the haters. The game runs perfectly fine with a Mouse and Keyboard. I played through the entire campaign on both Normal and Hard with MKB and no problems whatsoever.AND WE WILL NEVER STOP UNTIL THE FLOOD HAS CLEAREDMGR's campaign is short, but the game has a ridiculous amount of replayability. Killing enemies earns you BP (read: XP) which you can use to purchase upgrades and new moves and equipment. Every battle you complete is graded, ranging from D to the vaunted S-Rank, and many battles are hidden rather than placed for you to see, encouraging you to seek out violence. Add in achievements, multiple difficulties, hidden secrets, and unlockable items, and you'll be spending much more than five hours on this five-hour game. The game also comes with additional content in the form of DLC missions in which you play as side characters, but I found Sam's mission to be a bit too dull and Wolf's mission to be a bit too short. Also, I hit a bug during Sam's mission that prevented any items from dropping, preventing progression, but attempting to replay it later fixed that.TIME TO LEAVE THEM ALL BEHINDMGR is not without a host of problems. The camera is bad. Really bad. Essentially, though you can ""control"" the camera angle, the camera will automatically adjust every time you explore a new angle of a room or level. In theory, this is fine, and worked for many a Metal Gear game, but in practice, because of the fast paced and highly mobile combat of MGR, you will often find yourself hopping and running all around a room, causing the camera to go batshit insane. And if you get caught in a corner by your enemies while this happens? Better reload a checkpoint. This is even worse when coupled with the disorient mechanic, which causes the camera to shift slightly whenevery you successfully parry an attack. Even worse though is the stun mechanic, which will be incredibly punishing for new players and an unneeded nuisance for experienced players. Many mechanics and features of other Metal Gear games make strange cameos, like the stealth sections, but these feel janky and out of place. Also, the game relies heavily on QTE's for the boss fights, as well as QTE-lite sections where you have to do things like run across a bridge while its exploding and a single wrong step forces a restart. Despite all these problems, none of them truly diminish the thrill-a-minute action frenzy that is Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.THE UNENLIGHTENED MASSES / THEY CANNOT MAKE THE JUDGMENT CALLBut you can!

,Recommended,235460,8744130,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,SuperSemantic,"To get it right out there, this game is fairly hard, and it doesn't tell you ANYTHING about how to play it well beyond the basic controls. That's left up to the player. If you hate games that hold your hand, you will love this game.It's a Platinum* game, so comparisons to things like Bayonetta or DMC (or even Viewtiful Joe from the studio's days as Clover) are apt. Rising is a little less unforgiving, and easier to pick up in my opinion, but about as hard to really master. I don't claim to have mastered it yet, but every time I play, I get a little bit better. By the time you beat the game, you will be decent at it.The ranking system is fair - clear a fight extremely well, and you are ranked accordingly. Mistakes cost you, and you don't get an overall S for the chapter unless you cleared every single ranked fight with an S.While it differs from the rest of the Metal Gear series in that it is an action hack'n'slash rather than a stealth game, it works really well. The story is solid, and not nearly as insane as some of the series' other titles (I'm looking at you, Peace Walker). It's about a ten hour game when played at a comfortable pace, and each of the DLC campaigns takes about an hour. The VR Missions can keep things fresh for a while, but the main story is this game's bread and butter.The first three difficulties are simple progression (enemies hit harder, think faster, and aim better the higher you go), but once you get to Very Hard and Revengeance, prepare to get absolutely wrecked. Platinum was absolutely sadistic with the enemy placement, compounded by the fact that enemies will stop waiting their turn to attack you, and very often you will find yourself needing to parry multiple attacks near-simultaneously. Add on to that the fact that you die in two unparried hits on Revengeance mode and you've got yourself a challenge that will never really go stale. It's not unfairly hard, because you are given every tool you need (and then some) to cope. It's a matter of player skill at that point.I cannot recommend this game enough, even after only playing it for 27 hours at the time of this review. Seriously, do yourself a favor - clear a day or so, buy this game, and chug through it. You will not regret your decision."

,Recommended,235460,8746797,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,520,"Before we begin: You NEED an Xbox controller for this game. It is a beat 'em up, and while it tries to adapt to keyboard and mouse there are just some types of games that need a controller. This is one of themAs I mentioned, it is a beat 'em up. A very violent and fun beat 'em up with some impressive combat mechanics and awesome graphical effects - you really feel like you are the badass cyborg ninja you play as. You can even cut enemies into (literally) hundreds of pieces, and healing involves performing a very guesome (and very satisfying) execution move. It's not all hack 'n' slash however. There are plenty of stealth sections in the game, almost as a throwback to the mainline series' bread and butter. But here it feels different. Here, you dont usually hide for the sake of infiltration but assassination. The controls just dont lend themselves to lurking in the shadows.The mechanics are simple to understand, hard to get right, and very rewarding if you do. You have a heavy and a light attack, to block you throw a light attack at the direction of the enemy, and in some cases, you can counter with a Blade Mode execution. You get a 'fuel' gauge that, when sufficiently topped up, you can use Blade mode, where you cotrol the blade movements itself with the analogue stick, to either cut an enemy's limbs off when they get a blue overlay, or rip them in half and get their healing device (which will max out your health and fuel), but this assumes you've weakened them first. Later on in the game, after the protagonist has a moment that would make Kira from Death Note seem completely normal and harmless, you also get a Ripper-mode, that lets you absolutely rip enemies apart in a few short hits, but burns through your fuel gauge.The boss battles, as with the best of the Metal Gear games, are badass. They aren't particularly innovative like Metal Gear Solid (that of 'switch to controller port 2' fame), but they just feel epic. If you remember Metal Gear Solid (the original), and the final boss being a Metal Gear...That's the first boss of this game. And this time you haven't even got a gun. Bosses throughout are a mixture of combat with some QTE's added in, but more often than not the QTE button actually reflects ingame controls, with a little modification to adjust to the scripted event. And the QTE animations are completely over the top, like slicing through the Metal Gear while running across it, as if the tank is made of butter. Over the top but oh so very awesome.When you fight a boss there tends to be a whole lot of stuff going on that affects your fight or just looks awesome. Explosions, sparks, shockwaves, on a visual level, it can be sensory overload, but you usually have to check your surroundings for things that will try to harm you too, such as three-armed orbs (why?) and tons of explosive crap. The visual overload can be said for the whole game, it's just ramped up for the bosses. It looks good and adds a twist to what would otherwise be a straight forawrd fightAs for the audio, its the same story. The soundtrack is not only fantastic, but it's also fantastically executed. when your near enemies but they don't know you're there, the rock music plays, but at a low volume and some instruments held back, almost as if to say ""oooh there gonna be a fight"", and comes into full force the second you come into contact with the enemy. The soundtrack for the bosses is even better, and is well-executed. It will play this awesome instrumental for the first half of a fight, but when it gets to the turning point, a QTE will come up and all of a sudden the vocals kick in, not by accident but by script. It's a small addition to the music but it makes all the difference in how you're feeling, it amplifies the badassery. This is sound engineering done right.I did have a few bugbears with the game though. The camera system just doesn't work like it's supposed to. When you're in a group fight, it doesn't zoom out to let you see the surrounding enemies. The Lock-on system won't let you switch targets unless that target is on the screen. It also makes facing both flying and ground enemies a pain. Aim for the ground targets and you cant see the flying ones, aim for the flying ones and you can barely see whats going on at the ground. Metal Gear Solid fans may want to steer clear, unless they are also a fan of Ninja Gaiden and it's ilk. This is not a stealth game, even though there are elements of itOther than that, I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who is into fighting games and can suspend disbelief at the kind of stuff the game throws at you. Rating this 9/10"

This game is awesome, and there is no reason why nobody should not play this game other than not liking Hack and Slash games or that you don't have a Xbox controller (Get one and a wireless adapter). I'll just get to the bare minimum, as there are other reviews that can explain the combat system a lot more than I can. The game isn't as complex/difficult as other Hack and Slash titles like Devil May Cry (The old ones, not DmC: Devil May Cry), so it should be a great game to get into the genre, even with the learning curve it has at the beginning of the game. While the main story is around 4-6 hours long, the number of additional content, as well as the replay value and the two extra DLC stories (Even though they are 30 mins to an hour long) allows the game to easily give you around 20-30 hours of gameplay, even more if you decide to 100% the entire game,Also, you throw a gigantic robot the size of an office building into the air like it's a pillow while a guy screams ""Rules of Nature"" into your eardrums.

Spin-off of the Metal Gear series so expect a lot less stealth and a lot more slicing cyborgs into 100 bite-sized pieces. The game is short, yes. About 6-7 hours on average for first playthrough on hard, watching the cutscenes and all. Maybe more if you're a completionist and try find items etc. But the length doesn't really matter since like a lot of games in this genre it's meant to be replayed many, many times. The replay value of this game is one of its strongest points, with so much to unlock, previous rankings/time to beat and just the sheer fun you can have even after multiple playthroughs. Combat is fluid yet equally challenging on the harder difficulties. The story isn't exactly the focus of this game, so don't expect something incredible. As for the port there are some minor issues (see the Steam forums), only 2 of the smallest ones I've encountered (not being able to skip one of the cutscenes that you can skip on console, and the mouse cursor appearing when in menus/cutscenes despite using controller).

These are the types of games where you have to dive really deep into the gameplay to get a strong feeling of accomplishment. Turns out I'm not that sort of player. If you are not interested in playing a game to its limits, are easily frustrated, or have a tendency to button mash, this game will not be for you. (Also: as per recommendations from others I played on Hard difficulty.)MGR has a fan fiction feel to it, the story carrying on from Metal Gear Solid 4 and the game really doesn't go out of its way to tell you about what they are talking about. In Summer of 2016, many of themes that are present will be a little too close to home. The voice acting is terrible, but in the corny, sappy way that a B-movie has. It always feels like there are some elements of the story have been skipped over, either because they wanted to keep the story brisk, or they just didn't want to spend resources dwelling on it.The game has a beat-em-up vibe to it with the player facing three opponents under most circumstances during regular enemy encounters, but varying it up with different types of enemies with different attack patterns. The game really emphasizes defense with its parrying mechanics, but given that your parry is also your attack, you often feel like you don't have as much control over your character as you'd like. You will also be fighting with the camera in combat and even the lock-on system has a tendency to fall off of a target.Stealth mechanics are included in the game to allow you to thin enemy numbers if not completely circumvent a fight. Detection is iffy, and has been since the MGS developers removed detection cones from the series starting in MGS3. In MGR, you may be directly behind a foe and still be detected by them for no good reason.Boss fights have great adaptive soundtracks that progress as the fight progresses. There is  alot of flair and spectacle during the fights, but in the end, the fights are not enjoyable to learn. You will be frustrated with attack patterns, the right-trigger QTEs never seem to register the first time, and often you feel like the game is pitying you when you finally finish it after several tries. You don't feel like a badass ninja in these circumstances and it's only after another playthrough or two that you feel better for it. In all honesty, I game up on the final boss.Long story short: If you have the drive to be able to play with accuracy, speed, and preciosn, that you have to struggle to master and overcome, then MGR is right for you. For people like me, it just wasn't an enjoyable climb."

I can easily place it within my personal top five of the series, which for a franchise that spans 10+ games, is rather impressive. Many other Metal Gear fans may disagree with my opinion of this game, and while I admit that their reasons are certainly valid (it's clearly a dramatic departure from the rest of the series, and many believe its storyline and gameplay to be a betrayal of the series' spirit and core values), I must assert nonetheless that there is a simple satisfaction to be found in slicing enemy cyborgs in half, suplexing massive crab-mechs, and unraveling political-corporate conspiracies through long-winded, convoluted philosophical dialogues. Despite its bizarre nature in the face of the greater Metal Gear Saga, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance proves itself to be a game that is uniquely, viscerally enjoyable; a testosterone-fueled rampage through series conventions that, in my opinion, does indeed retain the inner spirit of the franchise that made us all love it back in 1998 (or perhaps even '87). I believe that if given the chance, Metal Gear Rising will surprise you. In fact, you might even find yourself grinning as you hurl a giant bipedal walking robot into the sky and cut it to bits, blood coursing through your veins. Let 'er rip!"

I've played many good and bad games, but I have never had as much fun as I have in Metal Gear Rising. This is the only game in the Metal Gear series I have played as of this review, and it does kinda hurt the experience as there are references to other games that don't make that much sense since I haven't played the other games. Anyways, let's get to the review.ProsThis game is crazy fun and chaotic. Brings a unique and good feeling when you get to just slice and dice everyone into a million pieces and then tear out their (spine?)The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and well done. I actually listen to some of the boss songs in my freetime. People who like Heavy Metal will most certainly enjoy.The story is pretty fun. It's def no masterpiece, but I liked it so that's all I really care for.The game came out in 2013, but it still looks really well. Not saying it shouldn't, but for those who care about graphics, this game does not disappoint.The boss fights are one of the most well done things I've seen in a game. While it does bug the hell out of me that some of them end in quick time events. Other than that, every boss has their own opening and song, and it just makes the experience amazing.ConsThe game is solely single player. The game is super well done and I love it but for those who maybe want a co-op game, sorry :/The voices or animations sometimes feel awkward.The game also feels far too short. I beat it in under 9 hours, and I kinda wish that there was more to the story. Like I said, I liked the story, but I feel like it was just way too short.Something that personally bugs me, is the lack of Wolf (your ""dog"") fighting with you. He just seemed to run ahead and scout the area, but never helped you fight anyone, which could've had unlimited amounts of potential for really nice looking combos or even boss fights.Another thing that is personally one of my concerns, is that the game is going to have no sequel. The ending sorta sets up a sequel, but now that Konami and Kojima split, the odds of getting MGR2 is practically 0.Also, the camera at certain parts of the game feels like a drag. Gameplay inhibiting? No. Annoying? Yes.While there might seem like there's a lot of cons, do remember that I absolutely love this game, and I feel the need to show the negatives in order for other people to know. The more I love a game, the more flaws I find in it. Easily top 3 favorite games I've played. Def would recommend this game to anyone, especially when it's on sale."

I wanna be like him."" Throughout my MGS4 playthrough I was left wishing that just PART of the game would allow you to play as the indestructible cyborg Raiden, but alas, nothing (although I do love me some Solid Snake.) This game is everything I wished for almost 10 years ago, wanting to be a ninja cyborg swordsman monster-slaying badass. It fits the ticket just right. What I loved so much about this game is that it allows you to absolutely decimate your enemies, but make a wrong move, and you're toast buddy.

The action and controls are quite good, the QTEs actually feel fun to use, and I have been able to suspend disbelief for the most part.I have been told that the game-feel shifts at the final boss, but so far this is an enjoyable game.  Very happy to own it.SPOILERS AHEAD (maybe)---4 hours in------This a great spectacle fighter, but I am often pulled from my immersion by gimic-gates; fights where the rules change to force you into performing a certain gimic.  Such as a specific fight where you have to be good at manual slicing, down to the degree (accuracy isnt great with a 360 pad, might try learning mouse controls).  I have proven that you can brute force your way through, but at 20% boss life, the game nerfs your damage to the fractions of percents unless you perform the gimic.  So it results in a boring 30 minute fight.Many parts of the game are like this.   Like a platform that you have to lower while fighting.  Sure you could jump up half a foot, but there is an invisible wall until you completely lower it.The game also has the trademark Kojima ill-placed philosophy debates.---Post Samuel fight-----F***ing Japan....I would've even accepted magic teleportation instead of this anime cliche'.---Final----It's sad that so much work and care was put into such an ultimately boring final fight.Yeah, the Zero Puctuation review was spot on."

I'm going to keep it short and address points of the game that I disagree with other reviewers on.Many people call the precision slashing technique a gimmick but it's not. Being able to precisely slice and dice an enemy to expose their spinal cords and rip them out(among other things) adds a lot of depth to the gameplay. Plus it's just fun to methodically chop up furniture, trees, vehicles, and other objects lying around.I see people saying this game only lasts a couple of hours. I don't see how that's true. The main campaign took me 10 hours on my first playthrough which is a lot for this type of game. There's plenty incentive to play through a second time and find hidden bonuses and unlock all of the customizable content. On top of the campaign there are also a boatload of VR side missions that could very well keep you busy for hours.Simply put, this game is just fun to play.

But for all the problems this game has, damn is it fun.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (awesome title) is a twitch arena brawler, complete with lot's of mechanics (QTEs, perfect timing parries, sword-time precision cutting) that kept me feeling like I was getting better as the game went on. Most of the boss fights are excellent, exciting clashes with outlandish characters, all while a bumping heavy metal soundtrack serenades the combat. And the story, my god, the story is the most hammy, over the top mess that I've seen in videogaming for donkeys' years.The main antagonist in the game is the camera. I suspect Raiden accidentally killed the camera's family in a previous MGS, and now it's taking revenge on him by refusing to show enemies on screen. It's like wrestling with a large cod. And yes, the designers could have done away with stealth sections, and shortened the cutscenes, and make the beginning a bit harder. But no other games let you cut a cyborg ninja into 134 pieces, rip their spine out. and swallow their electrolytes.10/10 will play some more."

It’s a game worth replaying, loaded with dozens of VR missions, 2 other playable characters with their own play styles and a story that’s crazy with a presentation that’s outrageous and delightful.It’s an innocent joy of what is excellent about video games and it not afraid to be just that."

You could stealth in some areas, but why bother when you're an unstoppable killing machine hell bent on murdering everything in your path in order to save the weak......Okay so the story is not the strongest point, in fact there isn't a huge development or anything memorable beyond some of the most annoying flow breaking sequences i've had in a game like this.  This game is a fantastic game, very responsive, completely tight controls and another great action game from Platinum Games.  The only downside is the fact the game, minus cut scenes, is pathetically short.After i beat it my save game time was 4hours 58 minutes, and i let it sit for about half hour hour as i worked on something else.  This game is quite literally a sit down beat it fast and skip cutscenes, for most a 4 hour play session could very well lead you to beating this title.Like most action games there is a ranking system rating on how well you've done, so there is that for the 'elitist' in us to try and get ""s"" rating on every fight part then S the entire mission etc.  Also for the collecting / secrets they added in a really cool chop off the left arm sequence.Morbid and psychotic?  Asbolutely, but it fits with this game that quite literally counts the PIECES you are chopping yourvictimsenemies into.  The hack and slash system with added collectible left arm makes it have some sane portion to an already insane sequence.Raiden ""matured"" during the Metal Gear 4 days, and no longer seemed to carry the burden of his former alias of Jack the Ripper, however this game brings it right back out of him.  While the intention is to get you to like Raiden more, I never did not like him, and my opinions havent changed much, however my biggest gripe with this game, in fact the series, is the voice acting is god awful.If your game has a major amount of cut scenes in it, you'd think splurging ont he voice acting would help not make me want to gouge my ear drums out as to stop the pain from this god awful cast.  Don't get me wrong there are worse out there, but it becomes glaringly noticeable how bad these are because of the fact there isn't a good 30 minute break where you are NOT interrupted with some sort of story plot shoved down your throat.Overall was it worth the $30 price tag?  If you're a fan of action games and like replaying them to better your last score, then it is most definatly worth it, you won't find much better.  If you're looking for a deep story with great character development, while these characters for the most part are established you don't get much information on the cast, other than they talk too god damn much.To each their own, the time I played it was fun from begining to end, the shortness of the game irked me, but the boss fights, gameplay, and mechanics more than made up for it, something that can easily be picked up and beaten quickly to see how well you stack up against your previous play."

If you're confident enough, play through Hard difficulty first time.- One of the bosses felt extremely easy and cut short later on in the game, you'll know which one I mean when you get to it.- For some really dumb reason, the game only supports enough screen resolutions to count on one hand. I had to play in 1366x768 rather than my native resolution of 1440x900, teaches me for having a rubbish screen resolution.Overall this game far exceeded my initial expectations, and I certainly look forward to having a second playthrough on one of the harder difficulties. This game is awesome and makes you feel awesome, despite having a few minor drawbacks such as the screen resolution issues and an underwhelming difficulty level. If you're a fan of Hack 'n' Slash games, definitely pick this game up. It's only £20 and comes with all of the DLC featured on the console releases of the game. Scratch that, if you like video games in general, give this game a try. You will not be disappointed.

Now that I've finished it (twice) I can say that I'm glad I did.   It's fun, there's never a slow moment, and you feel like a mega ninja badass during it.  Even more importantly they managed to make sissy blond girly boy Raiden into a likeable badass, complete with his own self-contained story arc that surprisingly leaves him in a much darker place.  Additionally, the music in this game is killar, mixing action rock music complete with the occasional lyrics rather than Metal Gear's typical somber tone.Unfortunately, there are a few issues that prevent this from becoming a top pick game for me.  The camera angle is often frustrating, and there's a lack of tutorials that make the game progressively harder as you go on and grinding the final boss fight to a halt until you figure out a mechanic on your own (i didn't know you could upgrade a weapons stats, and I didn't know you could slash diagonally... they tell you about horizontal/vertical slashes, but never mention you can control the angle with the right analogue stick).  It also feels like Hideo Kojima is shooting himself in the foot by allowing cyborgs to be so insanely powerful in that it makes any non-Raiden Metal Gear games set in the future somewhat unnecessary as he'd be highly outclassed (necks are likely unsnappable, and they (or at least Raiden) can see through walls, as well as being able to punch you through a building).  There's additionally a controller problem, though that may be on my end since I just got a  new PS4 controller, in that when you use an item such as a box or rocket launcher the attack buttons goof up, with light attack being held down and heavy attack not registering.  However, if you don't use a controller (or perhaps if yours just works) then it won't be an issue.Don't let the few issues this game has stop you from trying it if you are interested, however.  I've run through this twice already, and am considering another run it's that much fun.  It's a bit short, and including all the cinematics in the game it took me about 9 hours to beat.  Without cinematics it would probably take about 5-6 hours, which is pretty damn short, but the time you spend there will be a lot of fun."

It does have flaws, but the core gameplay is just fantastic.The problems mostly stem from the port. It is a pretty solid effort for a developers first try, but certainly not perfect. I had a lot of trouble with putting the game in 1080p. It did not work in fullscreen when I used the 1080p resolution for whatever reason. I could not tell you if it was only a problem on my setup (I do use a television, they sometimes cause some games issues) or a problem overall. I fixed it by running the game in windowed mode and then using a program to force ""borderless window"" mode, effectively making the game fullscreen, but I'd rather not have to come up with a solution and just have it work. I can't say I tried mouse and keyboard controls, but I would recommend a controller for this game anyway. The port in other ways is pretty good though. There are acceptable graphics options and the game looks better than its console counterparts showing they bothered to add some polish to the game. The framerates stayed smooth for me, but I do have a very powerful setup (i7, GTX 780, 8gbs of ram).The other flaws in the game come from the plot. I'll cut straight to the point: the dialouge is terrible and the voice acting is too. When the story just starts getting good, a really bad line is dropped. Some of themes come through anyways and frankly, the story is enough to give you a reason to slice people up.But the gameplay is VERY good. It is a very strong hackn'slash with one mechanic called ""blade mode"" which lets you stand still and aim the sword in any direction you want. It gives you a real attachment to the sword and gives you a lot of freedom in deciding exactly how you will dismember your foes. This mechanic makes the game. Without it, the game would still be a competent hackn'slash, but being able to meticulously slice foes, bosses, and almost every object in the game just makes you feel like such a badass.The game also has very good boss battles. If you like giant epic fights, this game has them and it is nice to see boss battles that amount to more than ""hit the glowy orange thing"". The mechanics for bosses stay the same but twist in ways that are just flat out fun. They get a little relentless towards the end, but still fun.Overall the game was just a fun experience. Sure the plot is not great, but I can rip out a dudes spine and use it as cyborg energy and then use his left hand to make cyborg enhancments... and I cut these parts out carefully. If you like hackn'slash games, get this on sale and give it a go, I think you will really enjoy it.Also for those curious: It does work on Nvidia shield but you will need to manually set the resolution to 720p if running in windowed mode."

I watched a couple of trailers and thought it looked a bit different so thought I would give it a shot... oh how much of an understatement I would learn that was.This game is absolutely nothing like the MGS games. Some may say that is a bad thing, to me it is the complete opposite. This game is extremely fast-paced, with lots of hack n' slash play where you basically just get to take your frustrations out on multiple enemies, looking absolutely awesome while you do. The game is down-right beautiful to look at, and runs very smoothly.My only criticisms of this game are probably coming from having just finished DmC. The camera can be a little annoying at times and does not move as fluidly as other games in this genre. The other issue I have found is that I'm currently sat in mission 3 and, frankly, I have yet to really find a need to use the more complex button combos and can basically get away with mindlessley mashing X and Y in any combination. So long as you master the parry system, you're sorted. I am hoping this may change as I progress further through the game.It's not all bad news though. Probably my favourite part of this game is the Blade Mode. Using multiple quick strikes to slice up your enemies into tiny little pieces never gets old. Ever. The fact that they have made it so that you don't just have to use X and Y for vertical/horizontal strikes and can actually use the right analogue stick for more fluid strikes just makes it even sweeter.I also love the fact that they have included a character upgrade system and I would argue that I think the upgrade system in MGR is better than ones found in nearly all other action games on the market. It is not simply ""here is a list of moves, buy them as you go along"" and you can actually upgrade far more elements of your character and customise more based on the way YOU play with things like different suits that contain different perks.Overall, this game definitely has an awful lot of appeal to those in the market for a fast-paced action game despite some minor annoyances at times with the camera angles. But this is not something that is likely to stop people (including me) from playing it all the way through. It also seems to have quite a bit of replay value as well."

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance has those good mechanics in abundance.Slicing and dicing enemies has probably never been so much fun on the PC, every hit you land feels rewarding. The developer really managed to give you the feeling of having a lot of punch. I think I've also never seen gameplay that felt so fast.The fighting system is well thought out, the enemy variety is high enough and fights are challenging.Additionally, boss fights should be mentioned: They usually have several phases where the bosses get new abilities and do different things than before which leads to interesting fights.Thegraphicsare ok, not the highest resolution textures you will have seen in a game but they do the job. My only gripe with the optics of the game would be that they lack variety, everything looks kind of same-y and they sure liked to used grey and brown colors. Most of the time you wont mind or even notice though because you are constantly moving at insane speeds.Thesoundsthey used for your attacks and the sounds of the enemies are generally good. The soundtrack suits the action perfectly and keeps pushing you forward. Synchronization is fairly bad though.Myproblemswith the game?Thecamerais all kinds of bad, sometimes jumping all over the place; even the lock-on feature often doesn't help when there is more than one enemy. The difficulty of a game shouldn't be 50% higher just because the developers didn't manage to get the camera right. I actually think this might be competitor for ""worst camera in an otherwise good game"" together with (parts of) the Legacy of Kain series.Thestoryis forgettable. Luckily the game doesn't take itself too seriously but the story was so bad in my opinion that it made me skip many cutscenes and click away most of the dialogues after maybe 2-3 hours into the game. If story is important to you in a game then you should avoid this one. To me the gameplay makes more than up for the sub-par story.Overall, I would recommend this game, the good things outweigh the problems I have mentioned by a loooong stretch."

Но мне кажется, что второй способ во-первых не всегда доступен, а во-вторых просто довольно скучный. К минусам можно отнести слишком длинные для жанра ролики в которых клоуны-злодеи пытаются говорить о философии. Это дело оценят только хадкорные фанаты MG, да и те вряд ли отнесутся серьёзно. Ещё игра довольно маленькая - у меня на прохождение основного сюжета ушло часов 7 и это учитывая то, что последнюю миссию я переигрывал два раза, да и роликов в совокупности со сценами на движке хватит не меньше, чем на час. В итоге получаем примерно 5 часов геймплея. Правда я с удовольствием пройду игру ещё раз и обязательно посмотрю традиционные VR Missions.

The game even counts them for you, that's what kind of game this is.In typical Metal Gear style the game is framed in extensive exposition and stupid humour, if you're not the biggest fan of that it is entirely skippable though. For people new to Metal Gear there is enough explanation for anything that actually matters. The Tutorial is a little short and fleeting, seemingly on purpose, what kind of badass needs an explanation on how to murder things after all? Just use the buttons and see what does what. There is a Combo list available in the pause menu.The biggest complaint I have about the game is the occasionally dodgy camera control. It always looks to lock onto a nearby enemy, even if you manually override it. This leads to some confusing camera angles with multiple enemies in confined spaces, which are fortunately few and far between.All in all, a must have for fans of stupidly over the top slashers AND for those that appreciate a satisfying combat system that rewards skill and timing."

This game takes the Devil may cry hack and slash gameplay and puts it in the metal gear universe, sounds like win win? Absolutely!!Since the last DmC game fell flat on its face I honestly thought the fast paced over the top make you feel like the god of gaming genre was dead, this game lets you know one thing, it ain't dead, it was just resting. The good old hack and slash genre is back and blood thirsty with this title, giving the underrated Raiden near unlimited power should you be willing to master the mechanics, at first I was a little fustrated until I mastered the parry's, then it all fell into place and I'm exectuting combo after combo, this isn't a difficult game to get used to, but it can get off to a rocky start.Gameplay is extremely smooth, Ninja running through the map reminds me of Assassins creed, effortlessly hopping and ducking past obstacles like they're nothing, this game just wants to look cool, and it works. Graphics are stunning, I can't believe this is a console title the visuals looks far too good, just see for yourself.What's most important about a game in this genre? I'd say it's the combat, you'll be pleased to know its extremely smooth and simple, light attacks, heavy attacks, and Zandatsu, a time freezing slash the living s**t out of everything in front of you mode that you get plenty of opportunity to use. Best advice I can give, don't forget to parry!! Honestly you will find yourself underestimating what Raiden can and can't block, take an attack from a weapon the length of a house, chances are Raiden CAN block it (hope I haven't spoiled anything there). Boss fights are super over the top and will make you angry, you'll restart time after time because you'll want to turn the bosses into dust. Music is a big factor in this game and it'll only stir your anger even more, its fantastic.This game emphasizes one thing, lots of blood and guts, cut anything, I mean ANYTHING that gets in your way with no effort, ripping out the vitals to heal your own wounds, sound nastyyet...fun?Well what are you waiting for, its time for JACK, TO LET ER' RIP!!"

The only downside is the large cutscene files, which they needed to compress better and the lack of high quality textures.  The flow and gameplay are identical to the PS3 and 360 releases, with a higher resolution, (1080p vs 720p).The mixture of fast gameplay and heavy metal music just melds brilliantly.  If you haven't played any of the previous Metal Gear games, don't worry.  This story is all it's own as well as the gameplay.  The MG Solid series focused on stealth and patience, while this is much faster paced.  Just when you think the game is going to slow down, it just keeps the fast pace going throughout.  This may have also caused the short game length, though.  The good side is that it's highly replayable."

The game apparently has some kind of DRM that requires you to be online to play it.This is not an acceptable state. I play games on my laptop precisely BECAUSE I can take my laptop anywhere, wifi or not.Now that that has been said for TL;DR people.In the FIRST playable section of the game, you fight mooks, cut them into tiny bits, then you have a sword fight against a Giant Robot with a MASSIVE LASER CANNON. This is followed by a few more mooks, while chasing a bad guy through streets and rooftops, followed by a second fight with the giant robot which ends with you running atop it's own missiles to get to it, then running down the side of a building to stab it in the electronic brain, followed by a mano-a-mano duel against another swordsman atop a speeding train.This is all in the first 15 minutes of the game. AWESOME.It gets crazier from there as you then get the ability to cut the guys healing bits out and grab them in over the top, highly acrobatic cutscenes that defy gravity. Then you have a Swordfight with an ATTACK HELICOPTER and WIN.The first time I landed and watched that attack helicopter fall to pieces just a bit more before exploding, while my character refuses to look at it(cool guys don't look at explosions...) I was hooked. Maybe it's not the greatest game ever, and it does have a few control/camera/wtfjusthappenedIwasblocking moments, but overall the game is highspeed fun.I had a similar reaction to this game as I did Asura's Wrath, which I likened to playing an interactive anime.Great Stuff.

Game offers tons of content, not so much in environments (was cut to maintain 60FPS on consoles) but gameplay-wise entoxicating.The entire story can be replayed many times in increasing difficulty settings, to prove a challenge for anyone to S rank (looking at you hack n slash fans). DLCs provide short stories behind two of the supporting characters, one of which is my favourite - Sam. His gameplay is a lot different from Raiden and can take a while to master dodging and power attacks instead of perfect parries and light attacks.In any case, definately worth the money for game + dlc. The soundtrack is the most fitting you will feel in any game so far - with dynamic songs that play differently depending on how well you are doing.Your local achievement hunter will get atleast 50 hours of gameplay to master Revengeance S ranks and other difficulty increases.Personally i played it on PS3 and PC, favoring the PC version, even though I play with mouse and keyboard.Also includes hillarious facial expressions (google Jetstream Sam Colgate smile)."

Resolution only goes to 1360x1080; not something major the game still looks fine at it2.The Supporting characters are horrible; by the time you finish the game the only characters you'll probably like are Raiden,Wolf, and Jetstream Sam;the other characters either have no existant personalities or involvement in the story, while also being VERY sterotypical.3. The story is utter incomprensible nonsense;For example, Raiden is having a moral dilemma over killing people who he thought had a choice, then he decides screw that it's his nature to kill, then he says making children into killers is wrong, Finally at the end we see him about to chop up some pmc's that confronted him.4. Raiden isn't a strong lead character: he worked fine as a supporting-main character, but lacks the strength solid snake and big boss had.5.The actual final boss is anti-climatic.6. The camera is evil: it will swap over to the worst angle possible if  you get into a corner and either be too sluggish or too sensitive7. The Learning curve is awkard: Most of the time you'll nail the controls after the first 2 bosses.8.Boss battles are too short: I've found that through my playthrough of the game it takes longer for me to kill a group of mobs than it is for me to kill most bosses.Now here is a list of what the game gets right:1. It cuts down on the QTE for actually gameplay: They made a smart move to cut down on using QTE as enemey finishers and replacing it with the blade mode mechanic.2.Combat has a steady flow: It doesn't feel like you're starting all over again if you get knocked down as well as giving you the ability to cripple your enemies( you can actually cut some of them so they're just a torse your fighting.)3. Soundtrack is amasing: It fits excellently what happens on screen.4. Keeps part of the Metal Gear series identity: It keeps stealth kills( it is possible to clear an entire level with them), hidden objects to collect, as well as their rather silly easter eggs5. Keyboard & Mouse actually work well: This being a port of an action, hack-n-slash, beat-em'-up game I was surprised at how well it handled with K&M.All-in-all its a great game thats worth a try when its on sale(story mode is pretty short)."

We’ll get to that in a moment.A summary is noted at the end for those not interested in a detailed analysis. Including pros and consWARNING: May contain minor spoilers.NOTE: I have not played anything other than the main story.First Impression:The game looked very very satisfying; Spectacle fighter genre, power fantasy, literally cutting objects in so many pieces your computer grinds to 1 fps. Yea, this looked like a lot of fun. With that, the expectations were set relatively high, but nothing exceptional when comparing to i.e. Darksiders (not 2).The StoryThe idea seems great, you start off as Raiden in a tux, looking all fancy, and you’re ready to get fighting because it’s a freaking spectacle fighter, of course you are. The intro lasted a tic too long in my opinion and didn’t really show much logic too it either, but oh well. You’d expect this from the start of the game, but later on however, things don’t get much better, you’re often stuck with long unskippable cutscenes, that kinda outstay their welcome. Apart from this the whole character progression has a few interesting turns, but apart from that, Raiden does not feel all that interesting or great of a character. Overemotional, no strong resolve and definitely no empathic connection, which you’d obviously want with the main character, shallow as it may be. Raiden just feel like a guy that just came to do stuff, because it was his job, claiming to fight for justice whilst not even having the slightest notion of what that entails.Other characters on the other hand are certainly, at least seemingly, more interesting. Characters like Sam who you can sense in every aspect is more than his face and words let on. (and in my opinion is cooler in almost every aspect than Raiden) My personal favorite is (Blade) Wolf however, being possibly the most entertaining, human feeling and logical character in the game… who happens to be an AI (oh the irony).The GameplayThe game (when playing) is very satisfying from the start, along with some proper boss fights and interesting mechanics. Destroying massive enemies, making very satisfying dismemberment kills and overall fluent moves. Where Metal Gear Rising goes wrong however becomes more and more apparent as the game moves along. Most enemies work well, have proper AI’s and make fighting them both satisfying and interesting, it however quickly becomes spoiled by the enemies that don’t work well. The best example would be the mastiffs (gorillas). The majority of their moves are unblockable, by grappling you and forcing you to try and escape in a QTE button mash. With the controller however, this means wiggling the left analog stick to the point you need 2 hands for just the stick, or otherwise you fail by default, either that, or your thumb is your fastest moving finger of both your hands. This is frustrating, and where for some this may be an immersive factor, in my opinion, it only breaks it, by forcing you to do a QTE in the middle of combat which you might end up doing 5 times per gorilla, per fight.The key note here is unbalanced systems; they could have implemented dodge mechanics, or make the moves blockable, or make them at least not include a QTE. In the current state, the game is 50% killing with a grin, 30% shrugging in frustration and 20% waiting for animations or loading screens to end so you can play again.Technical stuffThe graphics look good but the framerate might drop in the more intense areas, and the options menu does not allow for proper configurations; you will probably require a relatively high-end system.The game was not properly playable at first however; the game initially locked to a 30hz/24fps, which is bare minimum for ‘smooth’ images, and far far below par for a modern game. It seems the game wasn’t ported all that properly. The fix was relatively simple: download and use Windowed Borderless Gaming and my game was back up to 60hz and 60fps.Other stuffI finished the game in one session of 7 hours, of which only 4.5 hours were actual progress.The music is great at first, but gets weaker when nearing the end, that is, if you like metal. Good music for the setting though, although the end-fight truly feels like the end-sprint, as if you’re already watching the credits.The physics are living up to standards, meaning lots of slicey fun time.SUMMARYPort quality: 5/10, It’s no Dark Souls, but it does have some issues.Graphics: 7.5/10, Nice and flashy, suits the context well.Gameplay: 6.5/10, It’d be a 5/10, were it not for the excellent boss fightsStory: 6/10, To much pretense, too little character development and billions of cliché’sLength: 7/10, if it were a better game, this’d be a lower score.Sound: 7/10, good music, although the sound effects and voice acting was a bit meh.Pros:-	Gameplay is very satisfying at it’s highs-	The music is good-	Graphics look nice-	Good side characters-	Fancy moved and flashy effects (it’s a spectacle fighter)-	Great boss fightsCons:-	Gameplay is outright frustrating at it’s lows-	Poor port-Nothing is skippable-	Uninteresting main character-	Long cutscenes-	The startup credits that take about a minute.Final Verdict:7/10, play, have your fun, and forget it ever existed after finishing it.Buy it when on sale"

While it's not without its shortcomings (pretty short and gameplay can be a bit repetitive), Revengeance has some of the most exhilarating gameplay ever. The game's clear selling point is the boss fights, and the final boss in particular. The controls for keyboard and mouse are a bit clunky but the game is still playable unlike other PC ports *cough Dark Souls *cough. Overall its a good game.

It was a pleasant surprise for me!Now let me say I was never a big fan of Raiden. He was annoying as all hell, and wasn’t that interesting of a character. That was until MGS4 where out of nowhere he was this kick♥♥♥♥♥cyborg it was cool for about 20 minutes and then he becomes a pansy all over again. Granted you weren’t able to play with him in MGS4 outside of the multiplayer, but in the multiplayer Raiden was stiff and the blade wasn’t anything special. It was stupid for a shooter multiplayer game. Then in 2009 Metal Gear Rising was announced by Kojima Productions. It would be featured as a prequel to MGS4 and would be focused on a blade mode that would allow you to cut anything with precision.That sound all cool, but I thought at the time it was incredibly stupid, especially when I saw the demo footage of the game. It looked slow and clumsy like in MGS4, and while the Blade mode looked cool it didn’t seem that practical. After the demo footage we didn’t hear anything about the game. No other footage was released and no other news. I thought the game was going to be cancelled at that point.Until out of nowhere Kojima announced that they would be partnering up with Platinum Games, that caught my attention right away. One of the best Japanese action game developers taking a game that in my opinion was broken and could never be as great as they wanted to be. It was even quoted by Kojima himself that the game wasn’t going in the direction they wanted it, but in Platinum’s hand I knew they would deliver.OH MAN did they deliver. It’s a high octane roller coaster from beginning to end. The combat is basic hack and slash kind of action. It’s not bad at all it definately feels like a platinum game combat system. It has a variety of moves that you can perform not in the scale of Bayonetta but not as shallow as Anarchy Reigns so it’s a good middle ground. The movement is great,  the ninja run makes it really easy to move around the areas and the ways to defend yourself are great, you have the parry which has a huge window to block with and later on you can purchase a move that can side step and attack at the same time. Let me tell you this move is essential!The stages in the game are nothing special. They are just there, they are not bad but there is nothing that stands out. The stealth isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. It’s not as good as the other metal gear games but it’s not terrible. Almost all of the time the stealth is optional, and you really don’t get penalized for not going through a certain area undetected, except more enemies. Where the game really shines is in the boss battles. Each boss battle is unique and tests your skills with parrying, dodging and blade mode.  Speaking of blade mode it isn’t as broken as I thought it was going to be. Not only at the end of every boss battle you use blade mode the cut the boss down to little pieces you also use it on common enemies, and with them you can perform a zan datsu which allows you to take the energy cells of the enemy to fill up your health and energy up to 100%. Now that does seem broken but on the higher difficulties it is really needed. Now there are other weapons like rocket launchers and sub weapons in the game but without quick change buttons like in Devil May Cry or Bayonetta I never used them.The story is good, not amazing, but good especially for a metal gear game. The basic plot without spoiling anything is that Raiden is on a quest for Vengeance and Revenge hence the title ReVengeance. Raiden goes after the PMC group Desperado and uncovers a dark secret about them. That’s the basic premise that gets you through the game. That’s the best way I can put it without spoiling anything. Believe me its better than how I explained it.Let me tell you now the game is short I beat it in about 5 hours, but it’s a fun as hell 5 hours, and as soon as the credits ended i started the game on a harder difficulty. It’s just that fun of a game. The bosses are amazing. Action is (for lack of a better word) Solid. It’s just a great game."

I've played a total of about 10 hours I think, anyway.So first off, I gett to about halfway theough the game and figure out what the game's ""block mechanic"" is. Which they do try to teach at the beginning of the game, but they do a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job of. What you do is ""parry"" the atacks, though Raiden pretty much is blocking, but the way you have to is even more annoying the direction they're attacing from and X. NO not just one button a movement and a button, because those work so well in any game...well this one does it just about as good as any other...it frigging sux at working.There isn't even a dodge roll, or any other avoidance manuever, and guys no jumping doesnt help either.Second, now this is before all the figuring out Oh hey I can live now by ways of the parry, Some of the enemy's attacks are magnetic. You may berunning away, you'll even see them CLEARLY miss you by feet....NOPE still caught and hit, cause again...PARRY only fools. This goes with some of the enemies that like to hug you, then respectively beat your face in. Which jumping wil only get you ganked from the sky and then respectively getting your face beaten in. Not to mention Out of all the grabber enemy types, they are allllllll huge mofo's (Including the final boss)., but can 360 you even if you do manage to jump away from them, to only nab you when you touch your big toe claw foot thing on the ground, and then  I think you know what happens to your face, respectively.Third, my advendures of raiden were filled with excitement, then I hit that midpoint of the game where you have to fight  the first boss, then right after you beat that boss....guess what, out of no where the second boss of the game, to by which is FAR MORE INSANE TO FIGHT, pops in and says heloo to you. YOu beat him and guess what.....beaten and distraught....you have to fight the thrid game boss. And this is where it got me, this whole fight there is 1 helicopter in the air shooting at you the entire time. not to mention this is the 2nd hardest boss fight you'll have on hard. you have to be precise.....like PRE-CISE.....preCISE! or you die.... a lotAnd the last point I'm goin g to make about the issues with the game, there is no way to buy health packs, or repair gel as it's called, there is an upgrade screen, you can buy new skins and weapons, buuuuuuuuuuuuuut no health pack vendingmachines. Find yourself in a couple boss fights like me. and the second to last boss fight is a biotch with no health pack things...well you can find some, Prepare yourselves on hard save up, make sure you have atleast 3-4 when bossing the boss....or be precise with your broken parry mechanic.P.S.

Play it on a hard setting, and you got your self the best action experience you could probably ever have.The Pros:- Great music- Fast combat- Engaging boss fights- Blade Mode (It's amazing, end of story)The Cons:-  Short Story (I still enjoyed it, but some people will have different opinions)- Max Resolution is at 1980x1080- some small camera issuesThe negative reviews I see for this game only complain about the graphics. They would argue saying that it's 2014 and they demand a better product. The game came out early 2013. You SHOULD NOT have some sort of high expectation other than the DLC that game out. However, I do fully agree that the resolution cap ifor the game is a agreeable complaint for gamers (like myself) who play on a large screen.Should you buy?The game is defenitly worth a buy; I would buy it at it's current price.

At times the move set seemed difficult to harness and the battles seemed to trap me in a corner with multiple enemys using unblockable attacks.  The game and the characters seemed to be pushing the fact that  the game was a stealth based game but any stealth portions were awkward and not centered around such a mechanic.  I was drawn to this game after finishing Deus Ex: Human Revolution by the similar story and feel but they ended up being more different than I thought. all in all this is a great game with a fast pace but at some times ruined by trying to be something that it was not built to be.8/10"

Graphics and voice acting is mediocre but that doesn't matter because cutting cyborgs to pieces is fun anyway! Can recommend to anyone that likes the genre.Downs of the game are the camera (as with all the games from the genre) and the parrying system, which I would prefer on separate button, this contextual thing (you press light attack btn + direction of enemy attack and it'll just parry, if the enemy is about to attack) is just not very reliable."
,Recommended,235460,14494739,"Posted: 15 February, 2015",all,Devanor,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is, unfortunately, only the second Metal Gear game I've ever played, so I can't really compare it to it's predecessors (The first I played was Metal Gear on the NES.)What I can say, however, is that the game is a truly amusing game when it comes to the hack 'n' slashing. You really get the sense that you are superior to the enemy, even when slightly outnumbered, but you aren't all-powerful, and recklessness can and WILL get you killed.During fights, you have two things that will keep you alive: Parries, and nano machines.Parrying is just like it sounds, you deflect the enemy attack. What I did wrong at first, was that I missunderstood HOW you parried. I thought you were supposed to parry similarly to how you block in Mount and Blade: If the enemy swings at you from his left, you raise the shield to your right. Wrong. Instead, if an enemy attacks you from up front, you press Forward + Light Attack (Left mouse button defeault). Just the same, if an enemy attacks you from behind, you press Backward + Light attack.Secondly is nano machines. All enemies have a package of sorts in their bodies somewhere. Using Blade Mode (Shift Defeault) you slow down time somewhat (Beware! Enemies can still attack you like this, so don't go abusing it thinking you're invincible during the duration.) and somewhere on the enemy you will see a red-square marker. if you line up the Blade Mode so that you cut across it, and then press the Action button (F Defeault) you will steal their nanobots and energy for yourself, replinishing your health and energy.While I haven't played all that much, what little I have have been very enjoyable (Baring the battle on the train, you're supposed to lose that one... I hate losing, even if it's story-decided.)If you decide to buy this, I would strongly recommend playing through the tutorial at least once."

,Recommended,235460,9308544,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Lucas 117,"Let me get this out of the way first:Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is awesome, and well worth 30 bucks.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay in MGR:R is fast-paced and highly satisfying. The first time you cut a guy in half, your jaw will drop. Then, you'll do it a hundred more times and not be tired of it. Part of the reason for this is because of a mechanic called ""blade mode"" in which you can slice and dice in any direction you see fit. For example, you can cut someone in half at the waist and watch their upper body slide off their lower body while their legs remain standing -- it's very reminiscent of something you might see in a Kill Bill movie or an anime.Part of the appeal of this game is because of blade mode and the fact that enemies rarely die in the same way twice. Want to cut someone's right foot off? Go for it. Decapitation? Done. Or maybe you just want to cut off their right arm so they can't hold their gun anymore, that's fine too. As you can see, there is a lot of room for ""creative killing"" and it really increases the replay value of the game.There is a lot of variety in enemy and level design and this keeps things fresh. While there are a fair bit of ""quicktime event"" prompts, they're not too obtrusive. In reality, these quicktime events usually involve some of the most mind-blowing moments that happen throughout the game.GRAPHICS: Beautiful. I have no complaints here and not much to say except that they're awesome.SOUND: The sound effects are fitting and the music helps you get into the action. If anything, I wasn't too crazy about the vocal tracks in most of the songs, but I tended to kind of phase it out after awhile and didn't notice it much.CONTROLS: This is one area in which I have a complaint. There is some kind of negative mouse acceleration going on which can't be disabled, and it's a little annoying. Basically, it means that small, slow mouse movements don't register and this sometimes caused me to die (mainly near the end of the game when precision was required). That said, it's not THAT noticeable, and while it could certainly be better, I feel that it doesn't detract too much from the experience as a whole.REPLAY VALUE: High. There are a ton of unlockables and things to get from playing again on higher difficulties and accomplishing certain tasks. Plus, you get scored at the end of each chapter and some people might appreciate trying to beat their previous score in a level.STORY: It doesn't really ""continue"" the Metal Gear Solid storyline in any real way, but, instead, branches off on a different path to show what Raiden did after MGS4: Sons of the Patriots. In traditional MGS fasion, the story is told through several cutscenes, some of which are rather lengthy. In fact, the cutscenes of MGR:R are one of the most impressive aspects of this game to me. I was blown away by the animation, the voice acting, etc. The cutscenes seem to be mostly (or entirely) done in the in-game engine and are a joy to watch.CONCLUSION: Overall, this is simply an awesome game which I feel has gone mostly overlooked by the gaming population. It drips with AAA quality and is fun to play -- what more do you want?"

NOW IM MANUALLY SLICING PEOPLE INTO BLOODY PIZZA SLICES IT FEELS LIKE IM AN ACTUAL PSYCHOPATH AHAHAHAH DIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIE so yeah fun buy pls.This game is full of animesque stereotypes as one might expect of the metal gear franchise if you're into that stuff, but the typical over the top action and partial hamminess of Metal Gear storyline is merely amplified in Platinum's take on Kojima's solid universe in this spinoff featuring the Raiden guy people didn't care about until this game (though I secretly cared...). It's also one of the most satisfying hack slash/character action games I've EVER played, mostly due to its unique blade mode mechanic allowing for precise kills for bonus points, certain boss fights or collectibles (though mostly its easier and just as gratifying to just swing away until they're bloody pixels flopping like a ragdoll before exploding).It also controls smooth overall though a controller is highly recommended since it is a console port. As per usual the story may be a hit or miss depending on your attitude to metal gear story telling in general, but is sure to entertain none the less and overall still feels like it'd fit within established canon despite being an exaggerated spinoff. Cutscenes and codec calls can be plentiful but mostly skippable/optional if you're impatient for non stop action though both often come in fast spurts (hurr) rather than just be constant maintained action.Overall whether you're a veteran or new to metal gear games or the character action genre, this game will have a little something for everyone looking to try something different, and whom want to enjoy for a good old fashion slicing and dicing sci fi cyborg fun time."

Although the game misses to properly explain how to block enemy attacks outside of the Tutorial, it is easy to learn, understand and execute. Something going Hand-in-hand with the gameplay are Bossbattles. And they are epic. Each Boss has different advantages you have to overcome to win.The games biggest weakness however is the leveldesign. It's average at best, extremly linear and is basicly just going from point A to point B to point C with cutscenes scatterd throughout. Cutscenes tell a story (or should at least) but the story of MGRR only exists only to give the player a reason to keep slaughtering thr hordes of different enemys (which become repetive rather quick). The Bosses have little backstory, the final boss is introduced way too late for me to care and the only interesting aspect is Raidens Charakterdevelopment which comes off way too rushed (except for the scene before the Monsoon bossbattle).But these problems/weaknesses are tolerable next to the great Gameplay, the amazing Bossbattles and the motivating music (propably the biggest reason I've played the game for 27 hours).Final verdict: 7,5/10"

More than that would be too expensive knowing, even in Hard, you don't play more than 8h/10h. Replaying value is quite ok though if you want to go for records"

But this game endeavours to be something for everyone. So naturally there has to be story, and it's full of drama and plot twists. There are silly moments and funny moments, but for the most part it remains serious. It's a Japanese game but it feels like a Western one. Besides, if you just want the action without so much story, then skip the cutscenes and fast-forward through the CODEC calls.I'm no good at quick-reflex fighter games. I can't master combos, but I don't have to. This game has an easy mode that lets me enjoy the spectacle and thrilling takedowns without giving me carpal tunnel syndrome. The game still has some challenges and I couldn't make it through without some effort, though what I had to do relied more on knowing how to parry, how to use sword mode (it's weird at first and righteous once it is learned), responding to Quick Time Events (QTEs) and to stay in touch with my inventory items.Visuals and sound are excellent. Some of the best animation and acting I have seen in an action game, though I chuckle at the monologuing... It feels operatic. Raiden can express a lot with what natural facial features he has left; Even one eye says more than what can be delivered in spoken dialogue. The scenery lacks detail and realism, but that's okay because this game is all about the action and ninja-running through the rest of it.One last point [POTENTIAL SPOILERS]: I like the fact that this game strikes a balance between the humourous and maudlin. There are moments, like the famous ""undercover"" moment which amounts to Mexican racial stereotyping that would make Speedy Gonzalez look innocuous. But the game seems to be aware of this and mocks itself for having such a ridicuous idea. Look, it's a cyborg in a sombrero. Also to counter-balance this there are people of various races who are equals in terms of importance, power, intelligence, etc; I don't like games that have a compulsive need to demonstrate characters smoking, but in this game it is almonst non-existant, the only puffer is a villain; I also don't like games that relegate females to roles of childish and perverted sexual fantasies. Although there is a sexy female character, and there is a childish female, there are also intelligent, powerful females too, sometimes a combination of all those things. And like other games in the Metal Gear universe, characters and automatons are designed to be both brute fighters and sexy. Machinery has mounted guns, yet they have ballet legs, for example.With all of these points in mind, this is why I love the game. It has everything. It has excellent production and a distinct design voice, yet its appeal should be universal. Everyone can play this game. It's hard if you want a serious challenge or relatively easy if you just want to enjoy the thrill of the game.The game also has replay value, and with the DLC contents included there should be more to do than a single playthrough. The game recorded my first playthrough at over 5 hours, and I skipped many but not all cutscenes and most CODEC conversations. But Steam tracked this as over 9 hours, though I admit some of that was puttering around the menus."

I will now have 3 categories for the, Gameplay, Story, and Replayibility.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of MGR:R is where the game shines, but be warned if your a MGS fan and are hoping for similar gameplay then this is not the right one to choose, there no gun play at all what so ever, moving on, it has a similar combo/combat system to that of the DMC series, with upgradeable abilities and new unlockable abilities there is a expansive way of builbing your combo and slash system, also if you unlock more secondary weapons along the way, usually after every boss fight, so if you dont like your alternative attacks just try out a different atlernate weapon, the alternate weapons are similar to that of having your gun, or guns in DMC except that its more for melee range, the combat feels great and the ability to slow time and repeately cut your enemies BIT BY BIT is one the funnest parts about the combat, now there is some stealth but obviously that do not really pay attention to it that much and focus more on combat, one thing that is very fun about the game is that the blocking is balanced, now what I am about to describe may not sound balanced but when you try it you will see what iu mean, the blocking is GREAT it doesnt feel like assassins creed how blocking is the easiest thing ever how you endlessly combo people without getting hit ONCE, it aint like that at all, the blocking is that you have red attacks which flash a red lens flare for a split sec on your screen to indicate the attack and are blockable but what you have to is right as the attack is about to hit your have to press attack and move the direction the attack is coming from at the same time to block it, i you do it to early you will be stuck in a somewhat long recovery animation which leaves you wide for an attack, and you have yellow attacks which are unblockable but dodgeable, usually alot of attacks in yellow end up hurting you instead if you try to attack them in the middle of there animation but they are not as common as red attacks and usually big enemies have them, the BOSS BATTLE ARE AMAZING they are my favorite part of the game, each one feels so different from the other, each boss has a completely different way of you fighting them and them fighting you, and each boss feels refreshing and new, they also feel very well crafted, overall the enemies and combat in this game is the best part about MGR:RSTORY: While the story is'nt the best part it is not terrible, the character Raiden is AWESOME, and really has a nice character design, but some of the character's feel kinda corny, but hey whatever, it is still a good game overall but really this is not a game meant for story richness, this game is meant more for its gameplay.REPLAYIBILITY: THis game has nice replayibility TO ME that is, alot people find DMC like game repetitive with its combo and enemy system but other LOVE that part about it, and to me I love it the enemies always feel fun to fight and you always will have a challenge as a player, there are parts towards the end of the where i died alot to standard enemies instead of a boss fight, which is nice to see because alot of games lack difficuly and often fall short in replayibility because you loose that sense of a challenge, but in my opinion this MGR:R's enemies are always fun to fight and can be a challenge but Replayibility is a very bias and debating opinion in hack and slash games, but to me I love this game, if I were to rate this game out of 10 I would give it a solid8.5/10"

Shows you the ropes, attack blinkers, can't block this, block that,                    get good at our minigames and we'll give you another health bar. There is very little fun in being shown how to play this game.I complained last time about there not being a good block or evade... That isn't true, there is, and I learned it, I can almost perfect armstrong up to the projectile... Then I die, when I skip the minigame, things go smoothly... Point is, this game is not skill based, it feels luck based and that they tried to make a wii game for consoles... I die because I can't aim my stick correctly, I get no nano because I am not playing the game their way. Block his moves, dodge is grabs three times, perfect dodge his aura blast. Cut the box on his back.I feel like I'm playing the worst parts of devil may cry... Because if I wanted it to be, I could sit here and play this through one time in a day. I haven't owned a game like this since megaman. Looks great, decent story, good acting. SHORT. Wayyy too technical to be this full of gimmics. this game knows how other action games work and punish you for knowing them. Stop jumping out, start dodging and blocking and you'll see what it becomes... A long phone call with slash backgrounds and a bunch of rock music boss battles.I want to like this, but if the only reason I'm not beating the game is because I need more nanopaste or to get lucky, I'll just come back when I forgot how painful that idea is. The pace, and the rpg elements are nice, but I can't condone that being why we get such a small game. I have not played the dlc... I really don't care for it currently.If you want to play this game, grab the slashiest game character you know, resize enemy hitboxes in their favor, add elements necessary to win without any nanopaste, add gimicky moves that break your spirit and make you rethink your almost perfect pattern until you realize one move that is rarely completed is what's killing you. Add minigames that are probably a shoddy attempt at making your game mainstream playable and you'll have this game.I really wish I could say better things about it...

It is so much fun to run around as a cyborg ninja and cut dudes in half, or in thirds, or in fourths, or in hundreths. That satisfying feeling of being able to rip out someone's spinal cord and use it to fuel your cyborg rage is what got me to keep on playing this game. Raiden, along with the Winds of Destruction, are some very interesting characters in the game that you'll, at some point, become attached to.As for the story.... It was eh.. By the time you finish the game it will leave you with wanting more. It will make you think that it wasn't enough. You can beat this game in 3-7 hours (Depending on how fast you playthrough it).

This is especially cool with some robotic enemies, because you can chop off things like guns and missile launchers to make them more manageable.-Robot Buggy the Clown keeps talking about memesIf I had to list a few complaints, they would amount to the following:-The occasional hostage situations really slow down the game when they show up. I never manage to get them right on the first try, and it's only through lucky aim with EMP grenades that I manage to win them, usually.-The game tells you very little about the various tips and tricks Raiden can employ, but also sometimes it seems like they overlook pretty important things.

Featuring amazing boss fights, the ability to target your strikes to slice enemies into countless pieces, and one of the best metal soundtracks in gaming, the game allows you to be an absurdly powerful swordsman while not sacrificing difficulty on higher levels.Story:The plot follows Raiden, a cyborg ninja under the employ of a PMC known as Maverick Security Consulting. On a mission in Africa to protect a prime minister, his convoy is set upon by agents of a rival PMC called Desperado. Although successful in taking down a skyscraper-sized Metal Gear mech, Raiden is critically injured and the prime minister is killed. Raiden, now with improved cybernetics and out for blood, embarks on a crusade against Desperado, uncovering a larger plot in the process.Gameplay:This is one of the areas where this game truly shines. Armed with a High-Frequency Sword, you set apart slicing and dicing opponents. You have the ability to enter Blade Mode, which allows you to slice enemies into precise pieces with aimed strikes. Want to slice off the top of their head? How about simply turning them into cubes? Go for it! You may enter this mode any time, and you can slice through normal foes, sufficiently damaged harder ones, portions of the environment, and bosses, once you've triggered the finisher at the end of the fight.Bosses:The game does these superbly well. The bosses are well-designed foes with their own unique characteristics and backstory, and the fights against them are extremely memorable.Soundtrack:This game has one of the best soundtracks in gaming. Each boss has its own unique theme, and they are magnificent. You might be familiar with Rules of Nature, the song that kicked off a meme in some circles when the game was first released.Graphics:Decent. Though they aren't the greatest visuals ever to grace a monitor or television, the graphics in this game are hardly ugly by any stretch of the imagination.Conclusion:A must play for fans of the genre (no Metal Gear experience required!).

Therefore, the main question to ask is - is it worth the full price point? Yes. Yes it absolutely is.

It has the most preposterous, exaggerated story and gameplay conceived by humans, and I guarantee you will be absorbed completely into its insanity. The back-and-forth of parrying blows from enemies and countering with your own combos before manually slicing them apart is addicting and exhilirating, and you will be rocking out to the metal soundtrack the entire way through. I go back and replay the boss battles from the chapter select regularly as the most reliable method to cheer me up. If you get the chance, take the plunge and LET 'ER RIP."

I've purchased it some time ago in a sale, and I finally got to play it because I've got myself a controller, but I've gotta say, this game would have payed off if I had purchased at its normal price, because this was one of the best hack 'n slash games I have ever played in my life. With no Metal Gear games played in the past, I felt like this was the best entry I could find. I mean what could be better than ripping apart thousands of enemies with a half-cyborg?So what the game has to offer?- it has a pretty good combat system (which was fairly hard for me to learn, but after I've gotten the hang of it, it was actually a pleasure to parry attacks, and then cut the enemy into a hundred pieces with zandatsu)- an amazing soundtrack (and the credits are well written too)- lovable characters (I also liked the relationships between them, like, for example Wolf and Raiden were super amazing together)- fantastic bossfights, they really felt like BOSSES, who are way stronger than your usual soldier (in fact I felt Armstrong to be a little unfair, but he was beatable too, and he provided a great challenge)- great character models (Raiden looked really cool, and so did the other mechs and cyborgs)- a nice story to wrap all these things up (my only problem with it is that it's not longer, haha)I can't really tell anything about the replayability, since I've just finished the game, but I can see myself playing the vr missions, or something, so I guess there is some.In conclusion, I'd recommend this game to everyone, because it's truly awesome.

,Recommended,235460,13462135,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,hoyholyhoy,"It's a love-hate relationshipWhat I love:- When the action gets going, it really gets going. From cutscenes, to boss battles, to even small skirmishes with goons, it can get really crazy.- The blade mode or whatever you call it (standing still to cut things up) is probably the best thing about this game. Being able to cut most things up into hundreds of bits is what will undoubtedly keep me coming back.- Great port in terms of performance. I mean, I have a really nice PC but still, on max settings there is absolutely no issues whatsoever (in terms of graphics, lag, bugs, etc.)- I've always been a huge Raiden fan even despite criticism, and though this is clearly a whole different playing field in terms of genre, I find him wholely enjoyable, even if sometimes a little cheesy.- For a last gen game, which also looks miles worse than the main games, I'll admit in-game it just looks absolutely fantastic at times. *at times*- Fun customization: Getting to wear the fox costume, have different weapon sets, skills, etc. is a good way to keep from getting bored too quickly.- I'm a big music guy, and I gotta say I really love the soundtrack. It's so energetic, with a cool twist of heavy electronica, industrial, rock, pop, a little of everything really. I'll actually turn it up every time the songs kick in haha..What I hate:- Horrible quality cutscenes. It's like they're rendered at 480p or something. The action is fantastic, but terrible quality nonetheless.- Platforming in this game can be downright torture at times. You can jump, sure, and sprint (which is really fun) but I find myself often spending over 20 seconds trying to scale on crate or wall to get to the next section. Cutting through fences is sweet, but the bad spaz jumping over boxes and attempted double flip jumping onto a platform only to land back on the ground again just makes me want to punch the screen and totally destroying immersion.- Though I love the blade mode or whatever it's called, there's times I find myself stuck between it and normal fighting so I get hit when I'm trying to block or I can't STOP swinging until my meter runs out or I get hit and it's frustrating at times.- Speaking of combat, blocking. Blocking in this game is shotty as all hell and leads to some of the most hair rippingly frustrating times I've spent in a game in a while. For instance, the first boss (I won't give away) had me start over at least 5 times because whenever I went to block or parry, I'd end up just straight up attacking (from a far distance away) and got cut up like a fool. Maybe if it were realocated to a different button or something...- A lot of the characters are super cheesecore. I totally understand that action games aren't the place to find deep story or anything, but you should always go for likeable characters and so far the only ones I care about are Raiden and the robot dog.Compared to other recent action games I've played (DMC, Bayonetta 2) I'd say this stands up there as something to try out if you're a fan of the genre. I would note it doesn't come close to Bayonetta 2, as that game is quite literally flawless, but this holds up a fight. As a very very long time MGS fan, it's hugely different in almost every aspect, and you shouldn't expect to be playing anything like those games, but if you're like me and can enjoy any game if it's worthwhile, I'd say this is a good choice. Some annoyences, but this is just me being picky, nothing that makes the game unplayable.I'd say buy it on a Steam sale, got it for $6 and really who could complain at that price."

That was just plain weird.> I was annoyed at a lot of other design decisions too - for a game that heavily emphasizes parrying (which is never properly explained), it drops the ball in later parts with unparryable attacks and no indication of which attack cannot be parried. Equipping a secondary weapon also breaks primary weapon combos, which I wasn't particularly a fan of.> Boss fights were generally intense and fun, except the final boss which ruined the mood for me. It wasn't ""hard"" in any innovative way, it was just frustrating with a ton of health and minor damage dealt - something I'd consider a cop out.> The story is pretty bad, and I would have been fine with that if it didn't take itself too seriously.I'm still recommending it because even if it's not perfect, it does some things very well (like the action, when the camera works properly), and I would be lying if I said I didn't have fun with it - which is what matters in the end.[Also, game has a lot of QTEs which I'm totally fine with, but apparently a lot of people aren't.]"

TL;DR. Skip to the bottom.First of all, it's Metal Gear. True, it's a MG game with a breakdancing cborg ninja and combat as the main focus but it still has that feel of a somewhat ridiculous but still terrifyingly evil plot, a great and genuinely funny and interesting script and support staff and you come away feeling that you're richer for the experience. On that note though, if you haven't played a MG game before, a couple of references will go over your head but I played this before the previous chronological installment in the series, MGS4 and didn't really lose much from it. Most of the relevant details are explained throughout and most characters are brand new too. The one to be concerned with is the protagonist, Raiden himself. To help, former child soldier, forcibly converted into cyborg, manipulated throughout his life, has wife and kid who are somewhat mentioned.Next, the actual gameplay. Not only will it actually run on most specs, despite what you might think, it runs well. I played with mouse and gamepad and though I recommend the GP I played the game to completion quite well with a mouse too so don't worry too much. It's typical platinum stuff, enemies come, you get kicked to pulp and then you figure out what's going on and destroy them, the central mechanic here being the parry. Though you can dodge and unlock a counter, I didn't figure out parrying until my second playthrough and it does change the game. Once you get it down, the game feels a lot more natural. Where this differs from other Platinum and Spectacle fighter games is that Raiden has a lot of mobilty and you are encouraged to use that, though without tacked on platforming sections, as the Ninja run ability takes care of that, automatically climbing or crossing small gaps. Combat is fluid, feels surprisingly intuitive and, as you'd expect from a MG game, some exceptional Boss fights. The final boss in particular is a marvel of modern gaming, difficult as hell but somehow never cheap and once you spend a bit of time with him, challenging but beatable and every time you do you feel like you've earned it. Despite many only showing up for a single scene, each boss has a fully fleshed personality and backstory and feel like actual people, rather than another disposable enemy. You also have the option of stealth in many areas, this being MG's central mechanic. It's optional and somewhat well implemented in a game that clearly isn't designed for it fully but there are times you'll get seen when you shouldn't and times where you can be stood just behind an enemy and can literally run circles around him and he won't fully register. It is optional and if you just run in swingin, you'll never notice but the game will actually tell you off for this in places. A little annoying but nothing game ending. Finally there is the Blade Mode mechanic. Essentially a time stop, you can slice anything into any number of pieces, often used for puzzles, combat and health recovery. The main method is to use blade mode to harvest enemies power supplies but you can also use it tactically to slice off individuals limbs (a sidequest involves getting 30 certain left arms) or to block projectiles (again, bosses work beautifully).Finally, the part of MG that people either love or hate, the cinematics. The cutscenes look very impressive, voice acting is brilliant and though it's a little lazy in places (with a weird moment at the endgame where major plot points just kind of come in from nowhere) quite well together. They tend to be quite long by game standards, amybe 5-10 mins or so each on average but they are quite sparse and actually feel well integrated as opposed to lazy storytelling. The soundtrack is another weird one. A weird, metal, core mix that ordinarily, I'd hate around 85% of, it fits so well with the game that it's made me enjoy the soundtrack independantly. Once again, the bosses in particular have their own theme and are just wonderful.To weigh up then: PROS: Story, Music, Gameplay, Characters, Graphics, boss fights (get it for them alone!), QTEs that only show up on occaision and work mostly within your ordinary controls, with plenty of time to achieve them.CONS: Length. As with MG games, the actual length outside cutscene and optional conversations will be low and get lower on each playthrough. About 5-6 hours or less would be average.Music may not be for everyoneNor is the cinematic style.Gameplay can get repetitive, in hack and slash fashion."

So I've never really played any of the Metal Gear games before, but I know enough to realize this is a spin off story. Got my hands on it quite a while back, but never really got the time to really get into it.Recently however, I did. Finished fighting the last boss just a few minutes prior to writing this review. Which is likely a bad idea to get a really objective look on the game. Because the impression the game left me with was something in the tone of ""OH MY LORD THAT WAS SATISFYING! MORE! I WANT MORE!"".What really caught me in this game was is epicness, and unlike the norm of the three bees, (Blood, brutality and bombs) the fights really depended on quite the amount of style, it's own kind of style. Though the game is far from even slightly devoid of any form of blood, gore or explosions.Though not the hardest game out there I can attest that this game certanly gives a degree of challenge, atleast when you amp up the difficulty.I'd also reccomend to play this game on a controller, there are keybindings for a keyboard, but as you play it'll quickly show that this game was ment to be played on a controller.Also, despite it being epic, QTE's are still not excused. And this game is littered with 'em.The game lasts for about 20 hours first run if you search every corner of the map for those collectables in the game, sadly I was clearly not talented enough to find them all. You might have better luck though.Despite that I'd call it an enjoyable experienced though, and not something to simply pass out on."

,Recommended,235460,8665849,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,Summer Carnival Rydia,"Please forgive me as I gush about how great Metal Gear Rising is. For background, note that I've also played about 20 hours worth of this game on 360.The game's story revolves around Raiden, a man that seeks to protect the weak to atone for his troubled past. Thrust into war, Raiden's shed his human body and has become a powerful cyborg built for battle. Like the MGS games before it, Raiden's going to find himself in the midst of a conspiracy that involves crazy technology and political intrigue. The story's not terribly strong but, to its credit, it does make an effort to flesh out the characters a bit and give them proper motivations. Rising knows its story isn't going to win any awards, but it tries hard and has some fun while it's telling it.If you have concerns 'cause you've never played Metal Gear before, don't worry: this game's story is pretty self contained (chronologically this game's set in Metal Gear's future, after MGS4). There's call-backs and name-drops, but really all you need to know is that the Patriots were the bad guys and now there's new bad guys in town, that's it.That said, no one's playing this game for the story. Let's talk gameplay:With Rising Platinum (who took over chief development of this game after its schedule began to slip while at KojiPro) has taken elements from its other fantastic games (freedom of movement from Vanquish, a deep combat system from Bayonetta) and polished them until they shine brilliantly. There's a lot of talk about 'flow' in games today and boy howdy does this game have it: ninja running up walls, chaining sword combos and executing zandatsus melt into one another as you blaze across levels leaving cyborg bits in your bloody wake. Though the game isn't super long, the combat system, upgrade capability and level select really lends itself to doing repeat runs.The game's in the same style as games like Bayonetta, God of War and Devil May Cry, if you weren't already aware. As mentioned, you can see a lot of Bayonetta's influence here, though I believe Bayonetta's a bit more technical with its fighting while Rising's faster-paced.This game also has some minimal stealth portions (all of which you can fight through), so if you hate having to sneak around you'll be fine.If you've played MGS before and aren't a fan of dialog you should know that codec calls are almost entirely optional save for some conversations that are used to mask loading (which, once the loading completes, can be fast forward-ed). Also note that, like many other Platinum games, you can skip cutscenes if you so choose.Tip: When you finally buy this game (and you will), do the following:1. BUY OFFENSIVE DEFENSE2. BUY OFFENSIVE DEFENSE3. BUY OFFENSIVE DEFENSE4. Talk to Doktor (he gets lonely)Since you're here on Steam you undoubtedly know that 'console port' is a four-letter word. After playing through the entire campaign I'm really pleased to report thatthis port is fantastic.My machine's specs are actuallybelowthe Minimum they list (Core 2 @ 3Ghz, 8GB, Radeon R9 200) and the game plays beautifully. I've heard some people complain about custom resolutions not being available but whatever, I'm poor, 1080p's fine with me.Huge thanks to Konami, Kojima Productions and Platinum for bringing this game to the PC. I'm really hopeful that the Steam community will make them feel welcome so we can see future titles here (PC Vanquish, Platinum? Wink, nudge?).Also thankyoufor bearing with my rampant fanboyism over this game. ;)"

There are some points that could be improved upon, such as the stealth mechanics or some of the special moves you can upgrade Raiden with, but the gameplay is challenging and fun enough to keep you going to the end.

I don't think that alone should stop anyone from playing this game, because I did have fun throughout some of it. It gets fustrating at points, it's sometimes repetitive, and it's a short campaign - but the slow motion slicing and combat is incredible so it's a good time and have a good graphics card! Also try to grab this when it goes 50% off or even lower if a seasonal sale does so. If you're a fan of action/adventure genre just be cautious for some of it's flaws."

Fortunately the bosses are great fun to play and the soundtrack is perfect for the hectic hack-and-slash action. In case of having some serious trouble, watching some youtube clips is great for tips on how to beat each boss. In my opinion the game has much replay value as you can upgrade your character, like the weapons, special ninja moves and combat gear, all of which remains to the next round. In addition to the main story, the game comes with 50 VR missions that can be collected throughout the story, and two side storys with different characters. So altogether there is a lot of play even if the main story can be completed in 5-10 hours, depending on how much effort you put finding all the collectibles hidden in the game.

Figuring out how to parry was a pain. You can't get past the 2nd boss if you don't. [Hint: push forward and attack at the same time, many times in a row. You must let the control stick recenter every time you want to parry] Its not hard once you figure it out. The game is purely linear, but you can go back and play previous missions. You can upgrade your weapons multiple times, buy new types of attacks, health, etc. I did have to go back to a previous scene to farm for an upgrade a couple times, but it was fun to annialate enemies that were once a serious pain. My only real gripe with this game is during the few times you need to sneak around. Using the Xbox360 controller for Windows, you have to hold a shoulder button in order to stay hidden, but those buttons weren't really designed for that and the slighted release in preasure means you come out of hiding. I really wish they would have made it a toggle instead. The gamepad controls are not customizable either. The shoulders on the black widow xbox controller seem easier to press than the white Xbox360 for controller Windows. So that controller might be better suited for this game."

It also comes with a cool metal soundtrack (not that this is a big surprise for an action game, especially one that has Metal in it's name).If you like slashing anything that moves (or is simply in the way for that matter), this game will surely grab your attention.The battles can be spectacular, with dozens of available combos/skills and different weapons. All these skills and weapons allow you to hack, slash, cut, smite, kick, hit, grab, throw, push, KO etc. your enemies and this can only be a good thing.The game also features an interesting although simplistic story line that makes you wanna find out more and will give you (assuming you still need) more pretexts to kill everything that moves.But the good stuff end here. Now here comes your true enemy.First thing: the game is incredibly short. I have a total 6 hours of actually gameplay (as monitored by the game itself, including parts when I had to restart the checkpoint), the rest of 4 hours recorded by Steam being levels replayed due to all those things I'll mention aboveIn terms of gameplay, the game feels incomplete, unpolished and in most of the times REALLY BROKEN.The game lacks any sign of optimizations and it feels as if the devs didn't even bother with such a ""trivial"" thing. Of course, I'm not saying they didn't try, the patches that followed the game are a sign they did, but it wasn't enough.MGR:R is.supposed to be capped at 60fps, the FPS fluctuates whenever you expect less, making some fights to feel like a bad version of Matrix.This also seems to be the source for many gameplay bugs: fights that won't end, enemies that get stuck in walls or simply freeze, or simply the game crashing in the middle of some cinematic. And for all these problems there is an universal solution: find a way to keep the game on 60FPS or you won't be able to mode on.The camera is simply re%$@#d, and it many times it refuses to stay centered. Although the game features 2 camera modes, both seam to be equally 'well' developed. Not one I found myself turning my back on the bad guys in the middle of the fight or getting my ♥♥♥ kicked because the camera shifts out of the blue. And this wouldn't be such a big problem with the standard bad guys but this happens in the middle of the boss fights, and these are designed as an arena fight: you circle around the enemy to hit him and stay out of his attack range. You can hit him alright, but you cannot stay out of his range since the camera often drags you near him as if it was designed to help anyone but you.Another big issue is that the game feels scripted. You can fight a boss and get him to 0.1% health, without him even touching him but if you cannot press a stupid button during 1 second or if simply the QTE doesn't work, the guy can beat the hell out of you and defeat you. Same thing goes for you. You can have 0.1% health bar but you simply won't die because the game is designed to let you get to the next cutscene once you spend a certain amount of time fighting the same guy.The controls are incredibly clunky and unresponsive. And the same thing can be said for the controller. (I only tried to play with an Xbox 360 controller but something tells me it's the same for all). Of course, this mostly happens during QTE, especially since in MGR:R the QTE usually require more than one key.And it doesn't end here. We have characters walking through or getting stuck into walls, we have RPGs and grenades that do different amount of damage, depending on who is using them (you or them), game crashing out of the blue and as I mentioned before, QTEs that simply won't work.You can also add a huge list of known bugs that remained unfixed and most likely will remain like this, forcing you to use unofficial workarounds.Oh, and let's not forget the incredibly unintuitive game exit option.As for the conclusion...I don't regret buying MGR:R, since I got it on sale but truth be told, I wouldn't have paid more than I did.Should you play this game? Sure you should. But grab it on sale so that you won't regret after.But don't expect much of it.I'll give it an ""YES"" because cyborgs and because swords, a 6.5/10 potatoes and I'll consider that I'm being very generous about it."

,Recommended,235460,15737195,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,Baratus,"MGR:R is a game where you slice giant robot mechs in half with an electric samurai sword. It also has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history that I still listen to months after finishing the game.There is a steep difficulty curve with learning the controls and that god-forsaken parry mechanic, and the game's length does not give you sufficient time to master the mechanics in one playthrough. You'll probably spend that time getting your butt whooped.However, the game invites you to play it multiple times, as there are multiple difficulty settings, challenge missions, a variety of gadgets, weapons and instruments of death and dismemberment at your disposal, allowing for a variety of playstyles and present a number of different solutions for the stealth segments. Yes, there are stealth segments. But when you can dispatch a whole bunch of cyber-mooks and reduce them all to iron filings without taking damage, you will feel like an angel of death.The writing is a little cringe-worthy and cutscenes drag on like you're watching an anime, and in the true anime style, the tone jumps from dark and serious to awkward attempts of being comedic, to over-the-top and dramatic, but I can forgive it, as the storytelling still holds my interest, has a memorable cast of characters and the MGR:R experience as a whole is just really, really fun.In fact it might be the most awesomely ridiculous, nuts-out, explosive fun that has ever come from the AAA industry lately. I'm 200% glad I bought this game."

I played it for a bit and It's essentially the same.  Don't play this game on the hardest difficulty, the final boss is on a whole new level. I'd rather play MK2 or try to complete L4D's no damage challenge than attempt to beat this game on the hardest difficulty again. Go youtube it, seriously. IT'S TRAUMATIZING. Excluding the hardest difficulty there is nothing better than feeling like a samurai. Go cut someone's feet and hands off and you will have so many laughs. The games story is alright, I GUESS but it's the gameplay that wins every time. Get this game, it's worth the money probably. I dunno maybe, depends if you have money you can spend.

People lost their minds when this was announced because everybody had a raging trouser Snake for that other guy (who has a fetish for cardboard boxes) and this has you playing Raiden, and cutting stuff up with a super katana from every anime ever. Regardless it's a fun, over-the-top spectacle fighter in which you'll chop dudes into pieces and steal their spines for health, it's pretty linear but it's a spectacle fighter. There's some light stealth elements but predominantly you'll cutting dudes to bits at incredible speeds, and fighting insane bosses!

,Recommended,235460,15960597,"Posted: 22 May, 2015",all,UberPotatoes,"Personally, I really liked this game the gameplay is visceral and challenging enough to hold your attention and keep you invested enough to learn the proper combos and timing, rather than just mashing buttons. The visuals are intense and over the top, filled to the brim with high octane pulse pounding action, AND I LOVE IT.While I do enjoy games that are subtle and don't need constant in your face action to keep you going, this game does the whole extreme, over the top, super action so well that I can't help but be sucked in. The combat is challenging but fair, and the boss battles add an element of variety that is lacking in most other games. I do have my gripes though.Even though this game was developed by Platinum this time around it's still a Metal Gear game, and the one thing that is consistent in Metal Gear games is horrible writing. The plot is always overwritten, things just get pushed in willy nilly and I'm pretty sure most of the characters aren't quite sure what they're talking about. Another thing is the story is schizophrenic. It flip flops between Raiden's emo phase, where he broods all over the place like batman, as well as child organ harvesting and goofy dialogue with Raiden's ethincally diverse team of coworkers and Raiden dressing up like a mariachi band member. Not to mention the last boss: senator super saiyan. The game just takes itself so seriously when it's so hard to take it seriously that it feels a little uncomfortable.Also, there are points in the game where there are stealth sections, and while you don't technically have to stealth through them, it feels kind of disjointed considering the rest of the game is break-dancing cyborg samurai flip-outs. Also the platforming is kind of awkward at points.However, despite the cons and the story being awful, and the whole reason it's about Raiden is because Kojima wants to convince everyone that ""no really this ♥♥♥♥ boy is cool"" instead of just dropping the character like a brick and moving on, I still think that the game is over the top fun and should be checked out.Nanomachines Son."

The Parry system is a pain, a REAL heavy pain, either you are good with it or have an entire factory of aspirin close to you because it will be a nightmare. Its really difficult to master it, I would have liked better a block button and timing that the LS + Attack. The second concern is In my opinion, the lack of optimization with the requirements to play it. I have a laptop MSI G series with i7 4700MQ + Nvidia 770M GTX + 12GB RAM. Maybe is nothing compared to the desktop ones but still with medium quality it was in very low fps, but extremely low. I had to remove anti-aliasing and reduce shadow details for it to raise up. I would have expected more regarding that. Either way if you PC or laptop has the specs necessary maybe this wont annoy you as much as it did to me.8.5/10"

Not because it was better than anything that came out that year, but because I always put it back into my ps3, and had a blast playing it, either it be going through the story again, fighting the bosses, or making personal challenges for myself. This game had so much replay value and I rarely ever found the gameplay to be boring. Now that the PC version is out and even better than the console release, makes me VERY happy. It looks better, runs better and just feels better while playing it. The only complaint I have about the PC version is why the cutscenes got dropped to 30 frames while the console versions had higher frames for cutscenes.

It takes the term Hack'n'Slash to Slice and Dice into tiny pieces, using a basic action system with a slow-mo rip your foes to shreds into itty bitty pieces and if you cut properly you find collectibles and Zangetsu, which is where you chop the spine of your foe out and crush in your palm as a brutual finisher with a glint violent enjoyment from our hero. From a mention this is a port of a console game its done exceptionally well. Ive only noticed 3 errors in the game so far, Sundowner running off with the President and gets borked in the floor (ignorable doesnt effect the game any, atm:Quickly and nicely fixxed), a quicktime event scene where RAY throws you into the clocktower and you smash into the background and freeze (atm:Fixed along with Sundowner running) and a Framerate issues from resolution and such, my fix was turning off AA and it fixed my frame-delay issues involved with the cutscenes and quicktime events. That said its a Beautiful game with or without any tweaked graphics and really does dress to impress. The PC controls are meh and the acceleration isnt to helpful actually kinda annoying but they are laid out well and comfortably ill give them, i still use my logitech controller but yeah. Overall I say its totally worth while to and MG fan or action fan.

For every awesome part there is a brain meltingly frustrating one to balance it out.Some examples:Quick 'so-far-over-the-top-that-it-catapults-into-space' action is slapped in the face every five minutes with a cringeworthy codec conversation that forces you to walk slowly. Alternatively the game tries to shoehorn in some very shallow stealth segments where my favourite motivation for this so far has been ""you are in such an emotional state that I advise you to avoid combat"", this is why people make fun of you Raiden (that and the high heels).Combat looks awesome and introduces a cutting mechanic that works well. In order to balance this out you have a terrible block mechanic where you must flip the analog stick towards the enemy you wish to defend against. This would work if not for the horrible camera that randomly flips around or is suddenly controlled by certain events.Character design is stylish and varied, enviroments could have been pulled from a dreamcast game. Seriously someone who hates life and who only possesses the skill to use a rectangle tool was put in charge of the stages.Anyway you get the point, usually a game would end up with more good than bad or vice versa but this game feels like it has exactly as many pros as it has cons. In the end the game is cheap and I do want to see more japaense console games end up on the pc platform so I'll give it a thumbs up."

He fights to protect those with similar circumstances to himself and is emotional unstable for the battlefield.Mechanics for this game are top-notch UNTIL i get to two things. The blocking system in this game can go die, i have died so many times because of this dumb style that it took me an hour to kill the last boss. The other thing is the lock on system, sometimes its a wonderful thing to have but at many other times it is a terror, complete terror. If you dont get the block timing correct you will be hitting the air or moving forward and then hitting which is not good especially against Monsoon. The lock-on system also occasionall targets the wrong enemy in confined places forcing your camera in very unoptimal angles for fighting multiple enemies. Both mechanics make the game (especially in hard mode) that much more difficult. Who knows, this may not bug other people but these two mechanics really bug me.The game feels very well paced with the amount of action and story thrown at your way. You have the option to play certain missions with either stealth and sneak past all your enemies or end them in a bloodbath but usually it is the latter. Story is told well with a decent amount of charactrer developement allowing us to get attatched to people such as Raiden and Jetstream.So put down your assassins creeds and your batmans and pick up a sword in metal gear rising.

,Recommended,235460,11414034,"Posted: 25 July, 2014",all,Mutt,"This game, while lacking a complex and involved story, is fantastic. Platinum Games did an excellent job here, as the sword combat in MGR:R is bar-none the best around. Its fast, visceral, and deep. While the standard hack n' slash approach works to a degree, button mashing only gets you so far. Taking time to learn the combos and how to chain them together with your Blade Mode is the most rewarding experience around.Another area this game does great is the boss fights and along with them the soundtrack. The bosses are multi-stage and intense and require different tactics to best in combat. Esspecially on harder difficulties. In addition, every boss has their own theme which matches the fight and is dynamic throughout the fights.While the game can be punishing until you get to know your way around the combat system, once you do you'll find yourself blowing through areas. Even when not getting through areas quickly, the game itself is rather short and can be anywhere from 4 to 6 hours depending on your play style. Off the bat, anyone familiar with action games should start with hard difficulty and go from there. Hard, in my opinion, gives the best just the right amount of difficulty for most people.Overall, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a very solid game and really has me hoping for a sequal in the near future. I'd rate this about an 8.5/10.TL;DR : Great combat, awesome soundtrack, great bosses, worth buying at 30$."
,Recommended,235460,11333926,"Posted: 20 July, 2014",all,LiquidJoy,"I wasn't expecting much from MGS Rising as it is supposedly not a “proper” MGS game but straight away I found myself having a lot of fun and was pleasantly surprised at how the plot of the game unfolded. I can see why people would say that this is not a true MGS game. if all you want is a slow paced sneak em up then MGS Rising will not satisfy this itch. The game play for the most part is relentlessly fast and action orientated and unlike the rest of the metal gear franchise the feel of the game is arcade like and occasionally very cheesy. This is no bad thing and suits the game perfectly as it serves to counter the extremely dark underlying plot of the game and takes the edge off the atrocities played out through the games main characters and set pieces.The 3 big things I took from this game play experience were:1. I have never before felt so awesome while playing the role of a character. It is an incredibly empowering experience to play as Riden the cyborg supa ninja.2. Jack the ripper is a refreshingly dark multi dimensional character to play as with psychotic tendencies, a thirst for violence and plenty of inner demons to confront and is far from your typical heroic do gooder.3. This game has a lot of poniente and frankly very relevant criticisms to state regarding modern society and in particular contemporary american culture. This is embedded within the action of MGS Rising as a meaningful story that is worth telling and taking note of which is something that unfortunately can not be said about very many games of late, particularly action games within the spectacle fighter genre. If nothing else is what ties this game to the Rest of the Metal Gear franchise and is a very worthy addition to the ever deepening MGS Lore.Spectacular"

Nah son, being able to go hands down Solid Snake on those mofos, crawling in boxes and barrels and what not, that's important as hell.Now, back to the soundtrack tag; it grew on me as the killer cyber-metal genre (which is new to me, since I primarily listen to hard rock/metal) started to play at each bossfight.10 hours after playing the game, I'm listening to the whole composition on YouTube.TL;DR: You have to buy this game; you definitely won't regret it."

Do you have a gratuitous desire not to fulfill your needs to enjoy yourself while playing video games, or want to commit self-harm? Then you will not like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, AKA a form of fun condensed into a tangible object. The sword mechanics are solid and full of slicey-dicey quickness, the Blade Mode is cool, fun to use, and provides a great benefit in combat as you slice your enemies into cyborg sashimi. My twin complaints would be these:Parrying is rather poorly explained for an extremely vital mechanic. If you pick up this game (and I recommend you do), learn to use it early and use it often. It's key in the last few boss battles and will save you a lot of headache from having to figure it out later when you really need it. You can bulldoze through the first 5 or so stages without it, but it'll probably be a lot easier just to learn how. A block key might have been nice, but could've also turned the game from requiring skill to babby's first hack-n-slash.The second is one of tone. Now, to be fair, when MGRR decided to funny it did make me laugh, although sometimes I think this may have been unintentional. The main problem is that it's out of place. It's weird to have, in the final fight with the fate of a nation at stake, your enemy football punt you with a cheering crowd sound in the background. It might make me laugh, but that doesn't stop the not-fun part of me saying ""This really doesn't fit here, doesn't it?"" Alternatively, though, the entire tone of the game is over-the-top, 3 parts dark and edgy war drama, 1 part wacky cartoon, so maybe it does fit.Both of these complaints, however, are extremely minor, and don't stop me from giving this game a solid recommendation. As I already said, don't buy this game if you hate fun, or if you really are bothered by that second problem.Also the soundtrack is really good. Don't play this game without sound."

If you're a fan of Platinum Games then you know what you're getting, if not then you need to find out.  Their history with other franchises may help you in terms of the type of gameplay you're getting here (Bayonetta, Vanquish, Wonderful 101....).  Lord, if they would only bring Bayonetta and Vanquish to PC....any way....non-stop action, story that doesn't make sense, unlockable customization, great graphics and gameplay in the Metal Gear universe.The name of the game is action and flash.  Platinum Games knows how to do this in spades.  They are the last high production action studio that I'm aware of.  This focus is normally an issue since other games that try this formula normally fail (in my opinion only) as other studios focus on the repitition and not moving the game/story forward.  Again, the story is secondary and does not make much sense but you're not playing this for the story.  The beauty in Platinum Games is that they are able to make games that look great with much and great control.  That's the key here, control.  One gimmick that I love in this game is the blade mode.  Engage blade mode and time slows to a crawl and you have free reign to slice and dice an enemy any way you want.  Be careful though, some enemies carry items that if you slice them incorrectly you lower the item's usefulness.  Another layer of strategy.  For Metal Gear heads, there is some sneaking and keeping out of sight but not to the degree a Metal Gear game would give you.  Sneak behind an enemy and assassinate them to ensure you don't set off alarms but that's as deep as that goes.  Thankfully as this is an action game.Also, the PC version seems to play much better than console versions, especially in blade mode.  The higher resolutions and AA really make this game look great (it did already look good, but looks even better) with much less slowdown then consoles.  Also, you get all of the DLC as well.Another item worth mentioning is the sound track.  Platinum Games has a knack for pairing the right music with the right situation and with original music.  This is one of the few games I play with the volume turned up.  It's energetic, metal/rock in the right places to increase you're adrenaline.Con:  You need a controller for this.  There is no way that I can think of using a keyboard and mouse for this type of game.  I'm sure some will like it but coming from a console background myself, I need the controller for this one (especially in blade mode)."

Learning the mechanics well is rewarding, so higher difficulties are recommended. The characters and plot are over the top and ridiculous but in a good way. You sort of expect it from a japanese action game. The dialog is as cheesy as one might expect but at times it approaches insightful or even meaningful. Still, as a whole, the game's plot is absurd in way we've come to expect from games like this. The fighting mechanics work well and are satisfying once you get to know them.Some of my major gripes (not show stoppers):- Sometimes the camera gets f-d up in the heat of the battle. I often found myself crying at my monitor ""I cannot f-king see anything! How am I supposed to react?"". This is a problem especially when you get close to walls or you are indoors.- Character dizzy/confused: this is an annoying game mechanic where your character gets dizzy after a big hit and you have to wiggle your left thumbsticks sideways in order to get out of it. It's super annoying and it takes way too long to recover. Perhaps there is a reason for it to exist, but as it is, it's just a big f-u to the player. It's just easier to wait and be hit again so that you can move as you'll almost never recover in time anyway, no matter how you wiggle. And this goes for all the ""wiggle your thumbstick"" QTE BS: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP IT. Shaking your thumbstick sideways fast is not a sensible skill to teach the player. In fact it's moronic.- Grenades: why the hell are there grenades in this game? The enemies throw them mindlessly and then charge after you, stepping on their own grenades moments later. And it's also very frustrating to get thrown to ground by a freaking grenade in a melee combat (why would anyone use them like that?). They feel like they are there just to annoy you - and they do. The simple truth is that the game doesn't need grenades to be had by the enemy at all - they just f-k it up. The RPG usage is the same, the enemies shoot them senselessly, even when they hit three of their own guys. (although I understand and accept the existence of RPG's in this game)- NOTE! On the pc version (yes, this version) there is a bug at the very last boss! The QTE events and blademode events don't work correctly. If you have problems, try runnig the last battle at 720p with medium or low graphical settings. It's somehow related to the fps. And yes, I have a beefy machine so it's not that either. Search online for other people who have this problem."

,Recommended,235460,8639904,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,Bit Bandit ツ,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a 3rd person Action Hack and slash game developed by Platnium games and published by Konami, which was released a year ago on Playstation 3 and Xbox-360 but has been re-released for PC with an increase in graphical specticle and includes all the DLC.The game takes place in the Metal Gear Solid universe in the year 2018, 4 years after the Guns of the Patriots incident and you play as Raiden who is working as a bodyguard to ensure safety of the prime minister of an unknown African location.However as you're with the Prime minister your convoy get's ambushed by a group who calls themselves "" Desperado"", who then cuts off Raiden's arm leaving him down, and killing the prime minister in the process. Days later Raiden's body is rebuilt with more cyber enhancements and then goes on a journey to take revenge and vengeance on those who attacked him, hence the title "" Revengeance"". The story is very well written and has a lot of twists and turns to keep you engaged, and like Metal Gear Solid, it's also full of cutscenes but nowhere near the amount of Metal Gear Solid 4. But just like Metal Gear Solid 4 the cutscenes are very well produced and never made me feel bored.The gameplay has your typical hack and slash features, you got a quick attack, heavy attack, combos all that stuff, but rising also features intense cinematic action as well as a mechanic known as BLADE mode. In Blade mode you can aim your sword to slice enemies or objects allowing you to literally cut your foes into thousands of pieces. While in blade mode you can also grab your enemy's cyber intestines, this process is called the Zandatsu, and it refills all your HP and fuel capacity and has a very cool little animation as well. When an enemy is damaged enough you can slice off body parts to take them out with ease, such as cutting off the mounted gun on their back or removing the leg of a foe. 75% of things can be cut in the world, mainly being gates, trees, some bridges, poles, and other environment objects that won't break the game if you cut them. The game has a varity of enemies, ranging form your typical weak soldiers, to heavy soldies, juggernauts, raptors, wolves, and so on.This gameplay is incredibly fun and simple making it easy for newcomers to the genre to jump in and cut up their foes. As you do all this you earn BP, which is the game's currency. With BP you can purchase upgrades and weapons for Raiden such as more damage with your blade, new skills, boss weapons, more health etc. You can gain more BP by cutting off specific limbs such as the right arm, legs, and gaining a good ranking in combat.Another thing to mention are the boss battles, these are long and are very fun as they provide a nice challenge to the player and have a nice lightshow in them. Some of these fights, especially the fight on level 3, will test your ability to parry and dodge many upcoming attacks. Some of these fights are crazy as well, such as lifting up a giant Metal Gear RAY from it's arm and then throwing it into the air while running on it and cutting it wide open.Lastly to mention for gameplay is the stealth system, it's not as complex as say the Metal Gear Solid series, and is incredibly basic to the point where even the A.I. is dumb, though these sections are few and a bit far between. You can still put on cardboard boxes to sneak around, but it's more effective and more fun just to go out and fight the enemies.Graphically, the game recieved a HD upgrade from it's console counterpart and it really shows with crisp textures, particle effects, character models, animation, etc.Being the first PC port for Platnium games, they've done a good job porting the game and making this version the best option to choose out of the 3 versions, however as of right now there are a few issues surrounding the game not performing well on some people's more than capable set ups. Althought my machine and some of my friends had no problem playing the game and the framerate never dipped bellow 60 frames per second on us.The soundtrack also needs a mention, it's amazing with many tracks and each boss fight having their own theme which makes the battles more intense and more importantly, fun.I only have 3 problems with the game, one being that the camera can sometimes be in a bad angle, even when locked on to an enemy, 2, the game is pretty damn short, taking me about 4-6 hours to finish on my first playthrough, althought in every level there are hidden termnials and collectibles if you're the completionist type, and 3 being the mentioned stealth system of the game.Overall Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an extremely good game that I recommend highly you pick up right now, there is a great pleasure in cutting your foes into millions of pieces and performing all these cinematic moves. I have to warn though, as of right now there are a few technical issues that need ironing out, such as the aforementioned few setups not working with the game.Never the less, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a razor sharp game, and is one title you shouldn't miss.RULES OF NATURE!9.5/10"

Platinum delivers a top notch high-octane game that keeps you pumped through and through. With mechanics like Blade Mode and Zandatsu you will find yourself becoming incredibly engaged in the action of the game, as it looks and feels amazing. As far as difficulty, most of the game presents somewhat of a challenge, but it really shines in the boss battles, which can range from annoying to insanely hard. It is a refreshing thing to see a game where boss battles actually present significant challenge. The combat pool is not as deep as in games like DMC, but it is still incredibly fun and satisfying. There are some small scripted button pressing sequences occasionally but they are always so badass you won't care that they are scripted if you dislike that sort of thing. The soundtrack is amazing and goes perfectly with the game, keeping you that much more excited about the action and adding to the epic feel of the game.

Little did I know, I was in for quite the ride.I loved my time playing DMC games, and luckily combat is similar in this game (if you prefer using your sword, that is). Rather than using guns or explosives, the main choice of weapon in this game is a sword which can be upgraded with Battle Points you obtain throughout the mission. You aquire more weapons to use along the way (again, like DMC), but I have honestly never tried them out. I stuck with the sword the entire way through, but I feel that maybe the game might have been easier if I did try out the others. I got an achievement out of it, though, so that's nice I guess...As for the story, I was expecting to be thrown out of a loop, since this was my first Metal Gear title I've ever played. Despite this, I was able to keep up with the story pretty well. Really, the only thing that needs to be known is covered in the game. My only problem is that the story mode is quite short, only being seven missions long. There are harder difficulties for you to try and replay the game, but honestly I was dying left and right on the boss fights on Normal mode alone.The music for this game is spectacular. Especially the boss fight music. This music gets stuck in your head, but in a good way. ""Rules of Nature"", ""A Stranger I Remain"" and ""It Has To Be This Way"" are a couple examples I've found I couldn't get out of my head.If you want to get the best result playing, I would recommend using a controller to play, because of its ease of use (and actually made the game easier for me in some aspects). A keyboard and mouse is fine, but gave me more difficulty in some areas of the game (such as rapid button presses to regain consciousness rather than rotate an analogue stick around).My final thoughts: I enjoyed my time playing this game, and would recommend anyone who is a fan of the Hack-and-Slash genre, especially DMC, to at least try it out for yourself if you're looking to have fun. It may be a bit difficult at times, but definitely worth your money."

The fighting quick in response and can pull off some combos rather than just a button smashing. The action sequence is really over the top however the one grip I have is that each ""fight"" is broken into rooms where the systems does the points counting and gives you a score. This really slows down the pace of the games as you are forced to wait for the points and rank given before continuing on.Overall this game has its obvious flaws but looking past them, the games is fun."

But when a game incorporates all these single mechanics with a great soundtrack, and a good story you have found a keeper. Metal Gear Rising makes a great game with all these factors working flawlessly with one another. The only area where I found the game was lacking was that the story took some time to ramp up and get excitng. The other problem that comes to mind is that the games story is very short, under ten hours of game play, but this lack of story play time they make up with extras unlocked at the end of the game which allows for several more hours of game play. Once you have completed the extra content you can go back through the story mode to beat your high scores, giving hours of replayability to the game.

Challenging, satisfying gameplay, an absurdly silly plot, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack. Play with a controller if possible. An excellent game, well worth $30.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is not what one would expect from a Metal Gear game. While all of the previous games were centered around stealth and infiltration, Revengeance encourages getting into the middle of the battle and pulling off super hype combos with Raiden's high-frequency sword. Developed by Platinum Games (makers of Bayonetta, Vanquish, and The Wonderful 101), Revengeance delivers a short but sweet action-packed experience, as one would expect from the highly acclaimed development studio.I don't know much about the storyline of Metal Gear (I only played this game and part of MGS1), but I'll do my best to explain Revengeance's plot. You play as Raiden, a cyborg ninja. He is guarding the president of an unnamed African country when they are attacked by hostile cyborgs. The leader, Sundowner, explains that his plan is to instigate a war to boost the economy. Raiden is then attacked by a giant Metal Gear RAY, an unmanned robot. This is the prologue. If this is just the first 10 minutes of the game, you can expect Revengeance to get insanely wacky. Future events include fighting a woman with many arms and a bad French accent, conversing with a future character about politics and economics, then immediately fighting them, and a little girl developing the fastest vehicle in the world.Despite Hideo Kojima's exceptional writing skills, the plot is not the main reason for the game's acclaim. Platinum Games, the Osaka-based action game development studio has been highly praised for their past works. This is because their combat systems have been consistently easy to learn, and hard to master. Fun, yet challenging. Raiden has one weapon, his lightweight sword, with which he can cut through almost anything the player wishes (except cats). The combo list is extensive, consisting of light attacks, heavy attacks, uppercuts, and movement attacks. The unique mechanic in Revengeance is ""Zandatsu"", a slow motion mode in which Raiden can precisely aim his cuts and strike with unparalleled swiftness. All enemies have energy sources in their bodies, and these can only be harvested by entering Zandatsu and cutting a specific place to reach the organ. Doing so will completely refill Raiden's life bar and energy bar.Now, boss battles. It's important for a game such as this to have memorable, exciting, challenging boss fights. Platinum delivers these with masterful execution. You fight a total of 6 bosses throughout the 7 chapters. Each one has their own personality and combat style. Each one also has their own complimentary battle song, complete with vocals that kick in when the fight reaches its climax. I love these songs so much, I listen to them everyday. The second boss' theme ""A Stranger I Remain"" is one of my favourites. The final boss is quite possibly the most ridiculous and most intense fight of them all. First, you fight the boss' personal Metal Gear, then the boss himself. And believe me, it's not as easy as it seems. It's definitely a nice finish to a great game.All in all, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance should not be ignored because Solid Snake and his stealthy methods aren't featured. It's a fantastic Platinum creation, and a solid addition to the Metal Gear franchise. The only disappointment about it is that it takes about 5-6 hours to beat if you watch all the cutscenes and take your time through the levels, and about 3 hours if you rush through. Still a great game, please consider buying. Platinum deserves money."

,Recommended,235460,11098191,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,Envision,"WARNING: This game is very much a console port, but I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game if you can see beyond that.Simply put: This game makes you feel like an ultimate badass cyborg ninja of murderous destruction.Console port'eyness:Right away in from the start, the fact that this was ported by a company that has little experience in the PC market becomes obvious. Splash screens are unskippable, and some of the options just play work better with a controller or via arrow keys. Fortunately, this game is rather sparse on menu options, so there isn't that much to navigate around. Selection panning is at its worst when browsing collections (which I rarely did) or if you are decided to start on a given chapter (which ends up only being 12 or so arrow moves at most.)Contrary to what some may say, this game is ENTIRELY PLAYABLE WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD. Infact, after playing so long this way, I can't stand controller. The main contender here is that the camera still responds like a joystick (think a much more responsive Dark Souls 1 mouse-camera.) Not only that, but the position of the camera is rather important for the parry system. If you decided to play without a controller, I highly recommend avoiding the target lock feature altogether, and just focus on positioning your targets at 90 degree angles from your character. Most of the time I would just pan the camera straight on to what I was fighting, which I would assume many PC players would be very accustomed to anyway, given our PC master race camera functionality. It may be a little sluggish, but I found it more than workable. Target locking would often set the camera so that enemies were at 45 degree angles away, and thus very hard to parry.I found the default keybindings to be a little wonky. Your mileage may vary but I set ""Defensive Offense"" to ""V"" (from Z, its your dodge) and swapped ninja run ""Ctrl"" and Blade mode ""Shift"" (because I used to play counter strike.) Ultimately, its your preference. Contrarily, controllers are limited to a handful a schemes, which ultimately made it hard for me to get used to.Also, this game basically is designed purely around a frame rate of 60 fps. In fact, it will have problems if it deviates more than 20 or from that mark. Do whatever you can to maintain the framerate.Game Mechanics:For the most part, this game is just pure fun. Raiden is generally pretty responsive. It isn't exactly perfect though. In some cases, the game can feel pretty unfair.Attack telegraphs are usually pretty workable, that is, you can sufficiently react to them and parry/dodge them. There are however fringe cases that will leave you a bit frustrated. Telegraphs are mainly represented as either a red glint or a yellow glow on the enemy attacking, both of which become almost impossible to see if the enemy is off screen. This ends up become a small camera war or at least a forced reposition to ensure all enemies are on the screen. Once you understand this though, relocating isn't particularly difficult, as Raiden is very, very fast.Readability wise, most attacks give you a reasonable warning when they are coming; however, I personally had some problems with the ""Raptor"" enemies. Some of the kicks they would do barely seemed to cause a glint. Also, in some cases, the game forces you to just understand certain moves from enemies (particularly bosses.) One of the bosses will actually animate a round-house kick without a red glint, and you just have to watch for it.As I've stated, most attack telegraphs are fair; but sometimes you may feel cheated. I think by far the biggest ""cheating"" enemy is the ""Mastiff."" It's basically a large cyborg ape that loves to grab you. My problem with it in fact revolve around its two grab attacks, which are barely differentiatable for when it matters. It can either telegraph, and do an immediate grab (requiring you to dodge immediately,) or, it can do a slightly longer wind up and then chase after you for up to 3 seconds while emitting a ""grab you"" hit box until it stops. This basically turns Mastiffs into a slot machine when they attempt a grab. One requires a dodge, while the other requires that you stop what you're doing and run or jump over him. Doing the wrong thing on either will probably end up with you getting grabbed, which is very frustrating if you are attempting No Damage runs. The Mastiff also has a horrible move where it jumps away, and then catapults towards you, while ignoring any sort of walls or obstacles. This can be particularly frustrating if they aggro you from a different room, as they will just appear on top of you with almost no warning.General aesthetic:I cannot stress enough how good this game presents itself. The graphics aren't ground breaking by any means, but the the aesthetic is great. Character models are fairly well designed. Animations for non combatants are a little wonky, but in combat the motions are fantastic. As I stated above, you are playing a badass cyborg ninja of murderous destruction, and the animations very much promote that theme.The music fits what is happening on the screen perfectly; which is accomplished by the developers specifically setting up triggers within fights. You can even see the attention to detail in how the changes music to evoke the climaxes of battles from the very first boss fight. I would recommend fighting the boss in game to see it for yourself; but, if you want an example, just search ""mgr first boss"" on youtube, and you'll likely get a good result. The effect is mostly notable in when going into Blade Mode, and well, ""RULES OF NATURE.""One of the gimmicks of this game is the whole ""Blade Mode"" mechanic, which in short just lets you cut things to pieces. Or as others have described, its a game where your sword is actually sharp, and not some blunt object that squirts blood everywhere. Expect to literally cut enemies into tiny pieces. Despite doing it in almost every fight, dicing up your prey never got old.Story:The story at its best can have some rather deep philosophical questions, but for the most part is merely a glue to get from one fantastic fight to the next. The story is definitely a fair bit cheesy, but a bit of empathy can have you relating to some of the deeper topics they stumble over (emphasis on stumble.) I definitely would not call it a strong point to this game though.Despite this games flaws, I still love it. It clearly has quality behind it."

,Recommended,235460,8676311,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,IronDeadpool,"If you've played any of the Metal Gear Solid games, it's safe to say that this one is nothing like the rest. For the most part, stealth elements are cast aside and this one is basically all about the action. This isn't to say that I personally think it's a bad thing, but some fans of the series might think it's unwelcome. You take on the role of Raiden, clearly, as he's the character you see in the title image. You can cut your way through enemies, dicing them to literally hundreds of pieces.MGR stays true to the charming humor of the main series and delivers an excellent, over-the-top experience to play through. I got through it in a little under 8 hours, but I feel the replay value is pretty high if you wanna challenge yourself with the harder difficulty. All in all, I would give this game a 4/5, docking a point for the camera messing up at various points in time and seemingly turning behind Raiden in order to look the opposite direction, revealing nothing. As well as some odd points where he starts attacking different enemies when I'm trying to focus upon one at a time. Other than that, this game is fantastic and I fully recommend it if you enjoy bloody, gory, sword-wielding death cyborgs."

I'm running this with a Core 2 Duo 2.93 ghz processor, 8 gigs of RAM, and a Nvidia GTS 450 at a perfect framerate without any problems. It's a very well done port with plenty of options for scaling down, but it's probably best played on an actual computer with an actual graphics card, or a gaming laptop. Buyer beware. And yes, this is basically a ""Complete Edition"" that includes all the preorder DLC skins, the Gray Fox skin and sword, along with the DLC missions Jetstream, Blade Wolf, and the extra VR Missions. Also, while it's probably playable, having a controller is a good choice, since it was built with a controller in mind. With that out of the way, onto whether or not you should get this.Yes. Yes you should.The combat is lightning fast, buttery smooth, and it's oh-so-satisfying to chopping up your opponents into roughly 200 pieces of meat cubes (hell, the game even tracks how many pieces you cut the enemy into!). The levels themselves are linear, but exploration is rewarded with optional fights and hidden collectibles. The highlights have to be the epic boss fights, which are often multi-part affairs that test your skills at learning the mechanics properly. While the game is shorter than other hack-and-slashers like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, having only 8 missions total in the main story, I dare you to play it more than just once. The need for getting the elusive S ranks is often well worth going back in on a higher difficulty. Graphically, it looks very good even in the standard in-game graphics compared to the pre-rendered cinematics. Sound-wise, the voice acting is top notch, and the script is gloriously over-the-top. The music is also very fitting: lots of heavy/power metal sounds to it, especially during the boss fights, where the vocals will kick in if you're doing especially well.It's not perfect, but what is? I suppose my biggest complaint would be getting all the collectibles is damn near impossible without a guide, as is getting S-ranks. And due to the linear nature, if you miss a collectible, you can't go back to a previous checkpoint to get it. Thankfully, unless you're going for 100% completion, they're not totally necessary.This isn't Metal Gear Solid. This is Metal Gear Rising. While there is stealth, it isn't about sneaking; it's about being the cyborg ninja that we've always wanted to be. And it was damn worth the wait.I think it's time for Jack...to LET 'ER RIP!"

,Recommended,235460,13961206,"Posted: 12 January, 2015",all,2KI,"Really nice hack and slash focused entirely on pure combat with one of the smartest combat techniques I ever seen (blade slashing mode). In this game you slash foes without thinking too much or having to solve useless puzzles to get through the levels.Graphic is awesome and the programmers managed to get a lot of polygons where needed, and almost none where no one cares, totally appreciated that because this game never ever drops fps.Music is nice, you get a lot of electro-ambient music running around and pop-rock music on boss fights (I have to say I don't like that kind of music, but since boss fights are not hours long it doesn't hurt much)Plot is good, of course nothing new: the bad guys against the children + the world, the good guys trying to save them + the world, but it was at least enjoyable.Gameplay is fantastic, you have the classic slashing around, parries (not really a good button combination for those, a guard button was probably better than light attack one) and a blade slashing mode that works slowing time a lot and letting you MANUALLY slash things (having the slashed object cut exactly where you aim). I felt like Goemon with that one.Difficulty seemed quite fair. I have to say I'm not used to the semi-interactive cinematic system (press button X, now button Y, spam button Z, etc) and so I had hard time with bosses for like 5 minutes at 0,1% while failing the semi-automated cinematics instructions...About flaws, I think there are just two quite noticeable: the replenishing mechanic should have been far less than FULL replenishment (this quite often makes things too easy) and the camera movement is awful with a mouse (default keybindings are instead ""acceptable"").So, well, the camera is fine if you have a controller since it's a 100% port from console versions (DLCs included) but controlling the camera with a mouse is just not possible at 100% effectiveness. Your mouse works like an analogic lever (which is not) and thus the erratic camera movement with mice.Anyway it was good overall. So let's say totally recommended if you have a gamepad, not so much if you've not and you're not that much an hack and slash fan."

It's start with big bang and then it's getter better.More details below. Warning: ""epic"" word will be used in epic amounts :).Graphics/aesthetics: Shiny. Lot's of sparks and metallic body parts. Game deals with cyborgs some most of the enemies are in some part robotic. It looks nice, and the effects of using blade mode are cool.Gameplay - I don't have experience with this type of games so I've played on easy mode. And it wasn't very difficult. Most of the fights were simple to figure out but they were enjoyable. This is because the fighting system is simple, smooth and full of visual effects. The one part I didn't like is the ninja run - generic fast run that also allows dodging obstacles.Enemies - lots of cyborgs, robots and military vehicles. Big ones. And it's a Metal Gear game so there is one in the game. Andyou fight it!. All enemies can sliced up into hundreds of parts.Music - this is actually the past of the game. The soundtrack is genius. Most of the battles are accompanied by GEMEM (Generic Epic Metal/Electronic Music) but the boss battles have unique metal/rock/epic tracks...with vocals. They are full of adrenaline and makes the fights feel like an epic Japanese action movie.Summary - Very good game. A bit short, but fun. I didn't used to play spectacle fighters. Now I want to buy Wii U and check other PlatinumGames productions (Bayonetta series)."

Having played the Metal Gear series isn't a requirement, as most of the story and plot can be explained to you by optional communications with your team during the first few missions.What makes Revengance a great game to play is the fast-paced combat paired with a most excellent soundtrack and interesting plot that is more or less contemporary and somewhat interesting. There are very few times throughout the game where the player will end up getting bored, as the game will either throw you into  instant action or give you the chance to pull a Solid Snake and do the level sneaky-beaky like.The main draw to the game is the ""Zandatsu"" mechanic, which allows you to aim your sword blows with a good degree of precision. This mechanic becomes required for later boss fights and makes the game itself extremely satisfying.NegativesA few negatives regarding this game are more or less nuisances. For one, the default camera sensitivity is too low; even at 5, its very sluggish and requires being set to 10 to be useful. Also, with the camera, it will adjust itself automatically at times which makes it really inconvenient. Secondly. the game textures are lower resolution and can stand out at times.VerdictOverall, IHIGHLYrecommend this game. I have never played a Metal Gear game before, but having experienced Metal Gear Rising, I'll definitely look forward to playing the other Metal Gear series games."

,Recommended,235460,13619579,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,ROCKETT Sally,"When Metal Gear Rising was announced, die-hard fans of Metal Gear series turn up their noses at it. The game was a Hack 'n Slash game (which it's totally opposed to the tactical stealth espionage from MGS) and worst, Raiden was the main character once again.Raiden first hit MGS 2 for PS1 and it was hated since then. With time, he changed a lot and, with his spetacular performance on MGS 4 (who would forget that Raiden vs. Vamp fight!) the fans started to like him in some way.With MGR, the purpose wasn't to replace Solid Snake, but to firm the character within the hearts and minds of the fans with a amazing, top-notch game with the ""Kojima Quality Assurance"" game.Metal Gear Rising: Revengence was released on February, 13 of 2013 and the PC version on January of 2014. Developed by Platinum Games (Bayonetta 2) with the supervision of Kojima Productions and Published by Konami Games.PROS:+ ""War never changes, neither does this game"": If you were afraid about the game having nothing to do with MGS, you're wrong. MGR is set 4 years after the ending of MGS 4. Withthe fall of the Patriotson MGS 4, lots of Private Military Corporations (PMCs) shown up and a war for money and power is set between Maverick Security Council (your company) and Desperado's Corporation. The story of the game is great, it has a interesting pace and, different from the other MGSs, it is from a more easy understanding and not so politically deep like them. Still it's touching (or enraging) with what happens and what you do. MGSs fans will easily get it.+ ""I'm just the Ripper!"": Raiden is the main character of the game, and after having a nice impression on MGS4, here he highlights your performance. He has nothing to do with THAT Raiden from MGS 2 and has everything that you would like from MGS 4. He took a more darky tone from Batman and it is extremely powerful and skilled that enters on the list of Badasses Characters of Gaming. He carries out a HF Katana that cuts (almost) everything that goes on his way. During the game, his actions conflicts and he seems to change internally to ""Jack, The Ripper"".+ A real working Katana - Beside from the gameplay factor, the real deal of the game is the Blade Mode. The Blade Mode is a moment where the camera slows down and you can freely cut your opponent or object with your Katana. The way you can cut is tottally free and you can reduce those poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into little 420 parts (my record was 596) and every little part has plenty of details and, of course, violence! Some enemies need to be soften a while before you can use this mode on them. The gameplay of the game also it's amusing. It's simple, yet engaging with fast Light Attacks and Heavy Slashes that really impress by their effects and Speed.+ Bosses and more Bosses - Just like a good Hack 'n Slash game, it must have good bosses. MGR doesn't get away and brings amazing and gigantic bosses to carry out challenging and long fights. MGS as well had a nice list of bosses and this makes MGR more close to the main series (You fight a giant sentry robot codename Metal Gear EXCELSUS, just for the record)+ Woah, so beautiful! - Metal Gear always had top-notch, breathtaking graphics. This game take this PRO along him (and take it very well). The game visual is breathtaking. It's beautiful, compelling and unique, just like MGSs. This game was one of the firsts MGs to be set officially on the PCs and a fear of a bad, buggy port was eminent. Luckily, the port as well is excellent. The game runs nice at 60FPS with everything on max even on not-so tough PCs, the frame-rate of the game is very consistent (it can only drop when on Blade Mode with lots of parts) and not found crashes or control bugs (trully recommended to play on a Xbox Controller).+ Turn up that volume - The soundtrack is UNBELIEVABLE. It really shows what MGR is about with his Electro-Rock fast and hard beats. The bosses musics are even better, when close to the end, vocals are added and you feel really amused by them, surely you will shake your head to one of them while beating one big mot****ker .CONS:- Where am I looking at? - Maybe, the only and biggest issue about the game (which is from other H'nS games) is the camera. You can move it freely or lock into the opponent. The problem is sometimes it will move alone and will fixate at odd angles and, when in Boss fights, can really frustrate. All because of another issue.- PARRY THIS... oh, nevermind - With the problem camera, it comes another one. There is no guard mode on the game. To defend yourself, you must ""counter"" the attacks with a exact parry (which is hitting the attack button to the direction of the enemy). The concept of this is great because it makes the defense a lot more practical. Buuuuut, this method is inconsistent and, with the camera mode, it f**ks you up a lot in the most late battles, where dominating the Parry is really essencial. Playing on Easy difficult will enable a Parry Assist which minimizes this problem, but not eliminate.- Strength in Numbers - The AI of the game is the only thing that will dissapoint MGR's father (MGS). The opponents are dumb, blind and deaf. There will be stealth moments which you carry out the old Snake's box around and you can stealthy kill (and slice) your opponents. The problem is, you damnly cut and slice him right next on another guy he just ignore completely. The way your enemies will outrun you is by brute force and strength in numbers, but tactics? Forget.SCORE: 9.2/10.0RECOMMENDED: YESMUST HAVE?: NOOverall: MGR is a new face to Metal Gear series. It is one memorial game that will be just like Earthbound (in 92's, no one gave a ♥♥♥♥ about it, now there's a high demand for it's cartridges) as a unique gem into this game's era. It's not PERFECT or close to the masterpiece of what MGS is all about. But surely is a very strong game and will strike (non literally) the hearts of the players of the game. This one is the kind of game that will bring new kind of fans to be interested on Metal Gear saga. Now, SLICE THEM OFF!"

,Recommended,235460,13617353,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,AzeraCoffee,"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.It's stance, obviously from the Solid Gear series, is high, very high. Now I don't claim to be a fanboy of many games, and MGS is a series I never got into, but this caught my eye a long while ago (Didn't have chance to buy it until recently) and was excited to play it. So, after said long time of want, I downloaded the whole 24 gigs of game, and fired it up, and boy did I get what I wanted. The game threw itself to me like an arcades machine, which for me personally doesn't get boring at all. Checked the settings, most of them if not all of them were set to max, and I have a medium range card (HD7770) but when I started the campaign, jeez was I given a gorgeous game, the cutscenes set the quality bar and the game delivers for me.The game mechanics are smooth and far from delicate. Breaking from the standard hack n slash that everyone knows, it's gives a parry system, which in some terms can be abused but is very solid and makes up for it with the needle eye precision needed to parry every attack seen by the player, this however can be softened by the lower difficulty assists, which auto directs the parry as long as you're facing the direction of the enemy.The good: Very good graphics, very nice animations (Raiden can walk with such a sass), brilliant voice actors, soul melting soundtrack, very well done gameplay, decent customization and upgrades, and very satisfying boss fights. And I didn't even come across any glitches! Not even on the Sam and Wolf missions!The bad: The dialogue can be ill timed, if Raiden says something in a cutscene, then another character may wait two seconds too long and makes the overall cutscene seem flat.The combat and combos can be demanding in the way, you have to keep your attacks different and flowing, as well as parry and attack other enemies that surround you, but this can be seen as a promising gameplay challenge, which isn't seen much in other games.Overpowered feeling. Once you unlock the Fox Blade, and complete the one upgrade truly needed, there's nothing stopping you but the bosses, but even they can be defeated easily with blade mode and the Fox Blade.The ugly: At the price of £20, the overall quality of the game from a company like Konami is very good, but is an odd egg for the MGS series, but makes the fresh cut. The currency (Battle Points) are evenly given and taken, if a little bit of a grind. The graphics are nice to look at but most of the levels can be rather drab, defaulting to the usual shooter's background. The one thing I have haphazardly not mentioned due to the fact I'd rant about it, is the blade mode, which enables you to make thousands of giblets from a single man, or object. This is the one and true highlight, combined with the graphics, that makes me happy with this game, and Raiden's voice. That too.I would love to see this game revisited or at the very least remade for the next gen, with more giblets.The final score for anyone who reads this, from me, is a 9.5/10The game is a fresh break from most games I've played, and most definitely for the MGS fans, love it or hate it, just play it for giblet cutting, it helps with stress."

,Recommended,235460,8652946,"Posted: 10 January, 2014",all,Kenomica,"A time ago, when Metal Gear Rising was first released for consoles, I mistakenly wrote it off as a “non-metal gear” spin off that had no place in the series. I could not have been more wrong. When it was released for Steam, I saw the Kojima trailer and it really made me curious. So I took the plunge and bought it. Money well spent.Rising has you take on the role of series classic, Raiden, following the events of Metal Gear Solid 4 in a post “Sons of Patriots” world. Despite being developed by Platinum Games, all of the traditional Kojima humour is still there. It has a serious story but it doesn’t take itself too seriously.It may have taken a change from the traditional “tactical espionage action” favouring gameplay similar to spectacle fighters such as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta – but all of those Metal Gear / Kojima tropes that fans have grown to love are still here. You’ll hide in cardboard boxes to (optionally) find a stealthier approach to taking out enemies, find comical easter eggs, fight a group of bosses belonging to an elite group similar to Foxhound or Dead Cell and many more. This still feels like a Metal Gear game.There are still optional codec calls full of information and comedy; though these are fully optional and, unlike older games, you are not forced to listen to an hour conversation before and after every boss fight. The custscenes are still there, but not nearly as long as MGS4 – which some people may prefer. I personally had no issue with the long cutscenes, but that’s personal preference.The gameplay is extremely fluid and incredibly fun. There are combos and parries to master, upgrades to buy and hidden collectables that add to your currency. It is a difficult game, in a sense that it requires skill and precise timing. It’s difficult in the sense that pulling off that aggressive parry flawlessly – provides a huge feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment, as does getting that much wanted S rank. Similarly, making an absolute botch of a fight may leave you wanting to restart it to do a better, more elegant job of it, or maybe that’s just me.The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I know music is a personal taste kind of thing, but this fits perfectly to the gameplay and action. It mixes metal and dubstep for a unique sound that really penetrates and helps really accentuate each blow you deliver.Now, on to the PC port itself; It’s not a perfect PC port but it isn’t a Dark Souls style port either. It’s well optimized, running perfectly at constant 60fps at all times, as long as you disable that second GPU. There may be slow downs if you’re using a weak CPU, but only when you are cutting things in to 500+ chunks. Which apparently the console had issues with during development.There are missing resolutions, such as those with above 1080p displays, but this shouldn’t affect the majority of people. Sadly mouse acceleration issues rear their ugly head, a gamepad is recommended in my opinion, but not required, especially if mouse acceleration doesn’t bother you.I would recommend this to Metal Gear Solid fans and people new to the series."

It indeed is the most spectacular spectacle fighter I have ever played. Cutting through tanks and concrete with your sword, jumping on missiles, parrying bullets, running up the sides of buildings, cutting your enemies to literally hundreds of pieces and ripping out their cybernetic hearts - its all there.You are Raiden – a cyborg mercenary working for a private military company. Such companies are very popular, as regular military and police forces don't employ cyborgs – the public would be against it. In the game you set out to find out why one of the other mercenary companies assasinated the president of one of the troubled African countries.The game is a great spectacle fighter, over the top in almost every way. Raiden uses all his hands and feet to handle his all-cutting blade and mutilate opponents in easy to perform combos. He can also perform the so called ninja run, allowing him to move fast, automatically clear most of the obstacles and deflect incoming gunfire with his blade. It is also sometimes used for quicktime events, like jumping from rocket to roket up to the helicopter that fired them, only to slash it into tiny pieces.The regular dodging mechanic has been replaced with parrying – if a player faces an attacking enemy and holds forward + attack, he can block most of the incoming blows. The timing at normal difficulty isnt very strict, so parrying isnt hard, and it's an important mechanic. The game features a „Blade Mode”, resembling bullet time found in Max Payne games or Enter the Matrix. The difference tho is that while in this mode, we get to directly control the slashes performed by Raiden.  That way we can hit the weakspots of bosses and slash out the fuel cells from our cyborg enemies and use them to restore health. The mechanic is also used to cut through incoming missiles in some bossfights.The game has a very cinematic feel and numerous cut-scenes that sometimes are even more over the top that the gameplay itself. The game looks nice and perfectly fits the over-the-top gameplay. Even tho very flashy, it's perfectly readable and the player knows exactly whats going on, at least most of the time. Only sometimes the camera is a bit of a pain, but that's usual for console game ports. The overall aesthetics is very good, even if the technological aspect of the graphics, like the textures, doesnt force you to your knees. The game pleased my eyes.The story is okay, but didnt leave me breathless. The player can hear out additional dialogues with Raidens friends over the radio, and thats a really nice feature, typical for Metal Gear games. It puts much more detail to the narrative and makes the character more likeable, especially Wolf.The game is very good, and I had even more fun with it due to a relative lack of good spectacle fighters on PC, but I had just one issue with it – the final boss.Even tho the previous bosses indeed made the player use all the available mechanics, none of them prepares the player for the final boss. This boss requires some mastery in the usage of the games mechanics, but that mastery wasnt really needed on normal difficulty, so I didnt acquire it through play alone. Thats a design mistake. Through the whole game I could use Blade Mode to enter a slashing frenzy, and only one of the tenths of slashes had to hit the correct spot to bring me profit. The final boss on the other hand requires you to hit several targets in one swing in Blade Mode, a few times in a row! He is also a lot more demanding in the parry/dodge department.Overall, once you have all the neccesary skills, he is just challenging, not stupidly difficult, but I think that many players wont acquire the necessary skills through regular gameplay and will have to learn them fighting the boss, which is a VERY frustrating experience. Sure, there are training „Virtual Reality” missions available, and I dont like being held by the hand by the game, and I really dont want and expect that from a Metal Gear game, but I think it should have had more bosses/enemies that needed the exact same skills as the last boss to be beat, preparing me for him in a less frustrating manner.Overall, I think the game is money well spent if you like over the top action, some silly jokes („you need to take a D.O.O.M.P!”) great spectacle and challenge."

Japanese games (at least good ones) tend to have this awesome vibe around them. Vibe of complete madness like dude lifting a giant unmanned robot 20 times his size and throwing him around. MGR captures that crazy vibe masterfully and I just love it.Gameplay-wise the game is brilliant. The mix of classic slasher combos, free blade mode and suddenly (!) a decent implentation of QTEs feels and plays great. Controls are very responsive. Enemies are really different and interesting to fight. And the boss-fights are top-notch. They look as badass and awesome as possible while still being really great gameplay-wise.Story-wise game is fine. It does bring up interesting moral dillemas to think on, but nothing too brilliant or unexpected. I would say it's slightly above average.So if you're a fan of japanese slasher games then buy this one without second thoughts. It's absolutely worth it.The only major con of this game is a really short campaing. But it does have a ng+ on higher difficulty and then ng+2 on the highest one (revengeance) as well as two dlcs (one of them is really great, the other one is fine) and a lot of collectibles to find on different playthroughs.I really enjoyed this game and absolutely recommend it!"

,Recommended,235460,12464742,"Posted: 12 October, 2014",all,twitch.tv/clawedburnhard,"Very cinematic and story driven.  The voice acting makes certain scenes really cheesy but if that is ignored a bit there is a really solid plot in this game.  The characters aren't the most memorable (especially considering this is a metal gear game) but most are likable enough and some of the villains are actually quite cool and leave an impression.The way the game actually plays jumps from exciting to absolutely unbearable at times.  The Zandatsu ""slow motion slicing"" feels very underdeveloped in certain places and I feel the game could really have benefited from this specific mechanic having been more fine tuned (as this is probably the most key/unique activity undertaken in the game).  Sometimes the camera angle is way off for the perfect slice and you feel more like you're setting up to film a scene than a rogue cyborg slicing enemies out of the way.  A lot of the rest of the game is a lot of redundant hack and slashing (stealth kills only feel worthwhile, or are even possible, a very small percentage of the time), but the action commands and cinema driven fight scenes often really do feel like they have some pay off.Certain portions of the end of the game feel very rushed and just, plain, aren't fun; though there are definitely some exception (second to last boss specifically).  The early game is extremely good and one of the best boss fights I've ever played in any game happens about halfway through the game and it's definitely worth playing through.I wouldn't give this more then a 7.5/10 because of a lot of things that I think could have been fine tuned but the things that are good in this game really shine and I really appreciate the intention in a lot of things throughout (like the ""leveling"" system).  Play it but don't expect to be playing anything as classic as MGS 1 or 3. Enjoy =D"

The only downside to the boss fights is that they basically consist of repeating the exact same combo over and over again (slide in, attack feet, blade mode when prompted, or parry attacks multiple times in different directions followed by retaliate) and as long as you're able to repeat the same basic set of moves you'll eventually kill them.

If you just feel like letting off some steam, cut anything you want into 300 pieces and more, but don't expect an intricate story (on the other hand you don't have to know the lore to go with this game), and you better be into feminine looking ninjas. Also buy this game if you're into the challenging type of games, the hardest difficulty will probably give you endless replayability, I already struggled at normal.Pros: Very fun for its cost, good graphics, cool moves, different weapons with different upgrades, and the typical unique metal gear flavor, very challenging with quite a bit of different enemies. You can jump on rockets and defeat a boss with a 50 tons heavy piece of metal gear.Cons: Short game (but replayable), my PC starts lagging when I reach 500 pieces of cut parts, SUBOPTIMAL TO PLAY WITHOUT CONTROLLER (important in my opinion: Certain combos are just impossible to achieve while in combat and using a keyboard, which hurts your overall score, and you buy stuff and get your rating with it).And last but not least, the selection of secondary weapons is clunky. On your first playthrough you will likely not ever use a single grenade, or an rpg, when you can just cut them instead of going into a submenu to choose the secondary weapon (that interrupts the flow of the game, although certain secondary items will be mandatory on higher difficulties). Also stealth seems a bit bugged compared to earlier MGS titles. When I use a chaff grenade I expect my enemies to be unable to communicate for the duration, but they still call the reinforcements in when I attack.In summary, you shouldn't miss out on this game as it's unique in its gameplay,and the flaws didn't hurt my good opinion on it."

The story isn't anything new or profound especially if you've ever watched any shonen anime. Also, from what I've heard, if you're a fan of the Metal Gear story this game might upset you in terms of continuity or character development. I had never played a Metal Gear game before this one so that wasn't an issue for me. Furthermore, I highly recommend playing the tutorial and not starting the game until you've mastered the parry and blade mode mechanics as those become crucial towards the middle of the game. That being said this game is FANTASTIC. The combat is extremely responsive, fast paced, and satisfying. I could slice a cyborg into pieces and rip out their cyber-spines for hours, it's one of those mechanics that you expect to get boring after a few times but it NEVER DOES. The boss fights are amazing, each containing at least two stages and a fantastic soundtrack that is a mix of techno, dub step, metal, and J rock. Additionally, the cutscenes and story, although somewhat predictable, are amazing. The villains especially are what make the story so entertaining. Each one fits perfectly with your traditional anime villain stereotypes and I like to believe that was completely intentional. This story is best experienced if you do not take a single second of it seriously."

Then I guarantee you will love this. Just to give you a bit of foresight into the insanity this game holds, One of the bosses in this game has you fighting a giant robot (specifically a Metal Gear Ray, but I'm going off the assumption that you have little to no knowledge of the Metal Gear universe). At one point in the fight it launches missiles at you and you have to jump of of the missiles to get closer to it, then you run up it's arm while slicing off it's armor and then you just cut the whole damn thing off it's body. And it keeps going. Later in the fight the Ray throws you at a clocktower, and you have to run down the side of it while dodging missiles and laser blasts. This is what Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance calls a prologue.If you've read or watched any other reviews of this game you may have heard that it has a great soundtrack, Which it absolutely does. It consists mostly of very high-energy metal that fits the game perfectly, while also doing a great job of sending surges of adrenaline through your body. But what makes it special, however, is the lyrics. Not that they're incredibly profound or something like that, but it's the timing more than anything. The lyrics only kick in during really intense moments, like when you pick up the Ray (which is 4 stories tall, by the way) and you chuck the ♥♥♥♥in' thing 200 feet.So yeah, this game is pretty cool.P.S.

A game in develoment hell over at Konami, handed over to Platinum with a strict time schedule - Something they've never been able to stick to before. Take Raiden, one of the most disappointing video game characters I've ever encountered, and create a game around him. Find some D-tier metal musicians to sing some terribly cheesy songs over boss battles.But it all works flawlessly, but why? I think I know... Hideo Kojima? Totally crazy. Platinum games? Flat out insane. Put them both together, and what do you have? A bloody good time, that's what!There's no company on the planet more suited to projects like this than Platinum, and the further you get into the game, the more you begin to appreciate the nuances of the combat system. The parry system, while woefully explained, is a satisfying mechanic to pull off in a combination, and Blade Mode results in some of the most pleasing kills in any action game to date. While the combat system doesn't have the depth of other P* games, for example, Bayonetta 2, it still gives you plenty to learn, and believe me, you will have to learn. The combat is fast & furious, and a small lapse in concentraction can cause major issues for even the most experienced player, but there's nothing in the game that can't be avoided, so it's all about learning your toolset, and adapting to each situation as it comes along. As far as character action games go, Metal Gear Rising is up there with the best of them, while not competing with any of them. It's doing its own thing, and doing it brilliantly, and that definitely has to be respected.The game itself is very similar to other P* games. Basically, the plot is ignorable, but it's often funny to see the characters interact with each other. The characters & cutscenes are incredibly cheesy, but the Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies kinda cheesy. If you're coming from a MGS game, and expect a more serious tone from a title carrying the MG name, then you might be disappointed, but if you can adjust your narritive expectations, then I'm sure you'll love the charming, crazy nature of it all. The boss fights are some of the most insane I've ever seen, and really do have to be experienced to appreciate. It's pretty amazing to see a little 6ft fella cut up metal war machines the size of skyscrapers - All to the tune of perfectly fitting (albeit still crap) shred metal!It's also quite a short game, and you shouldn't expect your first playthrough to last you more than 5-8 hours (difficulty dependant). However, the more you play the game, the more you keep wanting to play, and thankfully, the missions are very replayable. With unlocks that drastically alter playstyles, and encounter & mission based rankings (S, A, B, C, D), there's plenty to keep you coming back.It's a definite recommendation from me, and here's another one... Go out, grab yourself a Wii U, and buy Bayonetta 2."

I played this with my brother, Him and I took turns on the hardest difficulty and usually got stomped...its a thing we like to do..play games on hard mode and hope for the best. The boss fights are intense..and the soundtrack to this game is extremely good. It really sets the mood. You won't find a super deep story here, but the plot is ok - though nowhere near what other metal gear games have been known to do. This game is more about the action and the feeling of being awesome and fast paced fighting. And it does these things extremely well. The controls can be a bit whonky at first but I got used to them. I did have a fair share of random glitches that were game breaking at times and forced me to restart, Other times...I'd see the glitch and keep going anyways in hopes that a certain NPC would magically just appear later on even if said NPC was stuck running in place for the entirety of a mission...to which I got lucky and said NPC did show up.

,Recommended,235460,8650477,"Posted: 10 January, 2014",all,ANDY,"A lot of eyes were on Platinum Games' entry into the PC marked due to the spotty reputation of Japanese PC ports, luckily, the conversion is mostly a solid one, though not without its flaws.While the game is impressively optimized for even weaker systems,the extra choices for those with stronger rigs are rather limited as, while AA and texture filtering is nicely represented, you cannot change the actual texture quality and resolution beyond what the consoles offer. Moreover, should you wish to play the game at its rather puny maximum resolution of 1080p, the framerate will inexplicably lock itself to 50 unless you modify the game to run in borderless fullscreen (some have also had success with disabling V-sync at the cost of unsightly screen-tearing). Either way, it is a problem that is easily circumvented and doesn't ruin what is otherwise a pretty acceptable port of a great game that is at least equal to its console brothers."

It's got a lot of intense, action packed fights, upgrades to your stats and abilities, and a decent amount of story to go along with it.  A large amount of the story is actually hidden in the background for people who don't care about story and just want to get into the action.  To get the full experience of the story, you really need to talk with everyone in your contact list repeatedly (I unfortunately didn't discover this until well into the game, so I missed out on some of the earlier story).  I liked how that part fleshed out the characters more.  The story does seem to get a bit...weird later into the game with sumo-stomping senators and talk about memes, but it's still good fun.  Even though the main storyline can be finished in 8 hours or less, I didn't feel like there was a lack of content with all of the VR missions you pick up along the way for challenges on the side.  I would definitely have liked for there to be a little more in the main story though.The combat mechanics are largely easy to get into and fairly solid.  Blade Mode is a super cool feature they put in where it slows time down while you slice and dice your enemy based on what direction you move the attack controller.  I would have preferred having an actual block button instead of the thing they worked in with pressing toward the enemy with a timed attack to start blocking, half the time I would end up just doing a regular attack instead of blocking.The missions can be completed either with complete stealth, where you one-hit kill each enemy before they even realize you're there, or you can just hit them head on and duke it out.  There's not really many points where you HAVE to have a specific set of skills or weapons to get by, and the spots you do need a set weapon, they provide it for you right there, which is really nice.  So you never end up being in an unwinable situation.Overall I'd say 8/10."

I had bought Revengeance on a deal, but feeling a little put off by the idea (As Raiden isn't a character I ever liked in MGS and it just felt like someone in Konami was ripping off Bayonetta) I decided to finally install and give it a shot as I felt that maybe, the 'Free Blade' mode they had endlessly harped on about might be worth it.Firstly the game is okay for a hack-and-slash. Pretty gory with a cliché MGS storyline. Everything quickly goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥and it's hardly anything 'surprising' when it comes to storyline. My one major gripe is the very first level.I got to the part where you gotta chase Fatman-with-scissor-Blades down a sewage pipe as he carries the Prime Minister, almost immediately the stupid fat prick became stuck within the ground in an infinite running loop and wouldn't budge an inch, halting the gameplay entirely. I tried restarting from checkpoint and even redoing the mission with no avail. In the 17years I have played Metal Gear I have never, EVER found such a game-breaking bug, never once have I actively been halted from progressing to the point even restarting hasn't fixed it. I feel ripped off really and while I am here;Raiden is just a really badly written character in my opinion. For those who've not delved into MGS 2 (Horrible, but good gaming mechanics) he goes from being an apparent ""Rookie with only VR training"" to suddenly remembering he's a katana-weilding pro who had a childhood in the army with a nickname ""Jack The Ripper"" for how notorious he was. It made 0 sense and made him look ridiculous. I know Hideo likes to character develop really weirdly but this broke the game for me. We now have Raiden trying to look better than Gray Fox, which he isn't. He still has that whiney-ness about him which plagued his character within MGS 2. Gray Fox was a character who. in the first game, was an enigma slowly unravelling and working in the background for most of the game, only majorly appearing at the beginning and the end, he had a backstory which was harsh but it wasn't suddenly rammed down your throat, it naturally came out, not like Jack's sudden ""I was born in an army and yeah"" one. It's like when you tell a 12yr old to make a character up, they see a better character and suddenly theirs is ""Better by all accounts"". The only time I found Raiden barable was his badass ""Raiden means Lightning"" brief monologue during MGS IV, but even then, it was quickly ruined by his foot-katana work (Which personally, make him look ridiculous...).>Rant Over"

This is an offshoot of the Metal Gear Solid franchise, made by a different company, and NOT a stealth game. This is a hack and slash (spectacle fighter) in the vein of games like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta with some interesting sword mechanics. I'll start with everything that I like thus far. The story is completely over-the-top and self-aware. It embraces the insanity of a cybernetic future where the main character is both a soft-hearted ""save the children"" type whilst also being a crazed killer.  His voice changes according to just how insane he feels--which leads to some rather interesting moments. This game has legitimately funny moments in it and the codec conversations add quite a lot to the story. The codec is also great for replay value, since large portions of exposition are completely optional, even on your first playthrough-- however this could also be a bad thing if you don't regularly call in on your friends to get different bits of information/dialogue. As for gameplay, the sword has an interesting mechanic where a number of things can just be cut up into pieces, and it also plays directly into getting higher scores, more upgrade points, finding secrets, and strategically fighting enemies/bosses (as a fight progresses limbs/weapons can be cleanly sliced off your foe). There is no real dodging, though there is a short dash that can be purchased, but it doesn't really come in handy. The main way to stop enemy attacks is to parry, which at first will lead to you getting hit a lot while you get used to the timing. And the parries just get harder as the game progresses, more parries successively, shorter times to react, etc. However, the gameplay isn't perfect. Many necessary/useful mechanics are not taught to the player until later on. For instance, they don't tell you about the lock-on ability or which directional pad button is your heal. A couple of the initial bosses are really difficult and after fighting one or two normal soldier types, you will be thrown into fights with giant robots (the difficulty curve is all over the place). I recommend the tutorial, but it is painfully lacking. I would also suggest the VR training, but those have to be unlocked, which means by the time you get them, they are only there to perfect a skill that would've been helpful to know about from the start. There is a seriously half-baked ""stealth"" aspect, where if you come up on an enemy from behind you can execute them on the spot, but there are no methods of accomplishing this other than just running up on them from behind. The ""stealth,"" as far as I can tell, would only really be useful on higher difficulties though. Also, even though this is on PC, a controller will make your life far easier, as the keyboard controls are manageable at best. Even with these minor complaints, this game is an adrenaline rush and the music during the fights amps the action up in ways that I've rarely seen. Play this game- don't expect to wreck it on your first playthrough unless you're just really good at spectacle fighters, and enjoy cutting up your enemy into tiny pieces while rocking out to some great music."

Combat is fluid, graphics are top-notch, enemies are reactive, and the storyline and sountrack are fantastic. There isn't much that's more satisfying than cutting a ripped politician in half with a polearm literally made of arms. My only complaints are that sometimes the camerawork is shoddy, and this game is ridiculously difficult, even on hard. It really isn't that there's THAT much content, but the fact that you die 30+ times per chapter, even on normal, means you get a lot of playtime. But by all means, this game is still great. AND it comes with all the DLC's. It's better played on a controller, because it can be difficult to freely aim precise slashes with a mouse, but it's still playable without one.TLDR; 12/10 You cut robots and its fun."

You definetely learn how to fight with parrying in hard mode because some monsters can't be taken down without you parrying their attacks. A very challenging game.Pros: 1. Runs smooth on pc at max settings for 1980x1080.2. Nice battle music3. Good fighting scenes and a decent tutorial.4. Bosses aren't too easy to kill in hard mode.Cons: 1. May be too hard to get a grasp of parrying for beginners trying out hard mode.2. Hard to play without a controller. (I feel like my mouse is breaking.)3. A lot of button mashing and if you use ninja dash to dash around the camera angle can get stuck in wierd positions. (My suggestion is to up the sensitivity of the camera)Overall a very nice and challenging game for those who want to try out a sword-slashing game with the only defense being a parry.

The boss fights are each very individually unique.  Even the OST and music match the story based on where you are in the game.

,Recommended,235460,18490262,"Posted: 15 October, 2015",all,RedBeard,"This review has been edited after further play.The game really is great fun to play through, and I had previously given the game a thumbs down, but I can say this is largely due to the VR missions and DLC VR missions which I had been playing frequently between the main story...which are the source of great frustration. Not because of difficulty(I love difficulty), but because the game's camera and control issues are made much more apparent due to the plethora of narrow walkways and strict movement and precision required to get gold rankings on each VR mission. The main problem being the camera will frequently decide to do a 180 near walls, which results in your VR run being ruined(either by parrying in the wrong direction or running in the wrong direction). This still happens in the main game, but is usually less of a problem since the areas are usually more wide open and the main story is much more forgiving for errors like this.Another common gameplay issue is that if you attempt to kill multiple enemies in a row via Blade Mode, the game will stay locked onto a target you've already killed. Which means Raiden will turn back to the enemy you've already sliced up and you will need to waste Fuel meter just turning toward the correct enemy.So if you get the game, I suggest you mostly avoid the VR missions until you complete the game because they gave me the entirely wrong impression of the gameplay. Also stay away from walls in general while you're fighting unless you want to get angry. The game itself really is fun and worth a purchase. It's one of those great games that you can just enjoy playing through without investing too much into it, while also having some depth and challenge available in the VR missions and harder modes. While the storyline is typical Metal Gear Solid stupid sillyness, the soundtrack for the game is amazing and if you want some of the best over-the-top action available, you should check this game out. It's sure to have some boss fights you won't soon forget.+Amazing soundtrack that will get your blood hot+Memorable bosses+Solid gameplay that adds some interesting features to the action genre+Solid controls+Okay story-Absolutely ATROCIOUS camera issues-Some control jankyness-Relatively short game"

Then again, Okami sort of did that for me already, back when those guys were Clover.PORT REPORT:This game has been ported excellently. I have a Geforce 760, and a Quad-core AMD Phenom X4 805, and the game ran at 59 FPS constantly unless I was cutting stuff apart repeatedly (which is to be expected, as it spawns a million models when that happens). Furthermore, the game is very comfortable playing on Keyboard + Mouse, and the game has the correct tooltips whether you're using KB+M or controller. The graphics options are good, and keys are fully rebindable./PORT REPORTIf you aren't familiar with Platnum's modus operandi, MGR: Revengeance is an action game of the ""spectacle fighter"" subgenre. That is, it's focused on fights between you versus various mooks, and larger-than-life boss battles. The game could be compared to a fighting game in the sense that the combat involves 1-on-1 fighting where you have a variety of offensive and defensive moves, and that is more important than the level geometry it takes place around.So what makes this game so great? To start with, the fighting is both easy to learn and incredibly satsifying to do. Simple attacks cause Raiden (the main protagonist) to do attacks full of style and ""punch"", thanks to both very cool animations and good sound design. Even when one is button mashing, the attacks look and feel great.However, just slashing your sword around isn't the only thing you'll be doing. When your meter fills up, you can enter Blade Mode, where you have free control of your swings. The game goes into slow motion while your meter drains, and you can execute a flurry of attacks very quickly in any angle and area you like. If enemies are damaged enough or otherwise in the right situation, you can literally chop them into pieces! This never gets old, and if you chop certain enemies in the right location during this, you are rewarded with a free health + meter restore.The boss fights made me a fan of this game, and they're some of the best boss fights I've played in a long time. These boss battles are full of spectacle and awesome J-Rock music. Not only that, the boss fights test your skills with the game's core mechanics and don't pull any cheap tricks or sudden puzzles that would result in cheap deaths. There are QTEs, but they are very easy, satisfactory to get right, and don't instantly kill the player if you fail them.Although this may be wierd to say, I enjoyed this game's story quite a lot. It had the right ups and downs between tension, drama, and even comedic moments. The characters, despite varying amounts of screentime, come off as believable and sympathetic. The bosses especially come off as tragic and, in some cases, making a scary amount of sense with the arguments they make. The twists the story goes in, while not shocking, nonetheless keep you motivated to see it through to the end.This game is amazing, but no game is without its flaws. I have a few that stood out in mind:+The game can be a bit iffy about explaining its mechanics. I didn't feel the game was clear on how to parry correctly, although I got the hang of it soon enough.SPOILER ABOUT THING YOU SHOULD GET:+ The dodge move ""Defensive Offensive"" is a purchasable item in the customization screen you see at the end of every chapter. It's very easy to get enough credits to buy it, and you should. You will NEED it, especially for later bosses. I'm surprised the game didn't give you the move to start since it's a necessity, but getting it thankfully isn't an issue./END SPOILER+there is a dearth of health items at times, and this can be a frustrating thing near the harder sections of the game. Thankfully you get all your health and meter back when you reload a checkpoint.+It may be a little on the short side for some people, I beat the game in 11 hours, 2 of those due to the huge difficulty spike the game goes in the end. True, this was also due to me being bad at that part, but it's something to keep in mind.Overall, this is one hell of a game. I got this game for $15 on a sale and it was worth more than the money I put into it. I strongly suggest you get this game if you like action games at all."

I inicially thought I'm doing something wrong but gradually got the feeling that this was added deliberately, just to somehow extend the one-dimensional combat experience. Of course this doesn't work at all, the combat system undemanding of any kind of strategy makes Rising a no-brainer and a button masher, but now having to bash on foot soldiers for minutes is not just mind-numbing, it undermines the very experience one is looking for when playing a superhero game. Attacks feel ineffective, enemies feel like they're made of stone, you feel week. Unlocking skills didn't give me any sense of empowerment either. The new techniques are mostly unspectacular, barely effective and uneasy to integrate into the combat flow. As for the visuals, I remember the trailer having made everything look mindblowing, establishing this as kind of the point of the game and I was really surprised to see that the game itself actually isn't near that level. In fact a lot of ugly ""optimization"" appears to have been done and the levels lack some extra work. While occasionally very pretty, a regular lack of detail, primitive phisics and some ugly textures make for a much lower class experience then what has been teased. I won't hack away on the story, it's japanese, we're used to the ridiculousness. Nevertheless, Rising's really not trying to push the envelope in a more sensible direction and some bits are quite inconsequent. Given the standards of the Metal Gear franchise (and having seen the trailer) I've got to say that I was really surprised how large of a disappointment Rising was. Back to DMC then."

It's a really nice game to own especially for the %75 discounted price. I really loved the game and end up finishing it in 2 days. It is a really nice game to play. However I really don't like the fact that the game is not helping you. You basically start the game and you don't have any instructions or guides by the game, you have to figure out everything on your own. Also the some boss fights are super frustrating and difficult especially on higher difficulties. Also the game has various minor bugs. If you want to buy it, i highly suggest it (espcially with discount it is a definate worth game).Another issue I had was (SPOILER ALERT):On the final boss fight against the senator where we had to slice the objects the movement required was pretty difficult to do with a mouse and it really frustrated me. It could've been better than that."

It made me respect Raiden's character a little more. I recommended this game. It is a game worth 50+ hours of play. The additional missions that does not include Raiden are much much more challenging. First play through is challenging but eventually it will be cake. Hard is hardly hard.

Many people will complain that the game is too short but I find that to its benefit. The main focus of this game was the boss battles and the combat. Adding more time to the game will add nothing of value unless it is more bosses.The first fault to the game is that it throws you a bone and then throws you a bullet to your face at the first boss. The first boss will bring you into reality of what this game is all about and what you must learn to master. After that just stay on your toes and don't get sloppy.I honestly did not like metal gear solid 2; was the only metal gear game I played in the past and I hated it. This was just a fun enjoyable ride the entire time. I can only wish for more to come from this new line of metal gear. A metal gear game focusing on gameplay and combat was exacty what I wanted.

Honestly, to those who know the Metal Gear franchise and developer Platinum Games, that's all that needs to be said.Graphically, it's not stunning, but the gameplay is sharp, precise, and eminently satisfying.  Excellently responsive controls combine with superb sound assets and visual feedback make every cut, parry, and dodge feel visceral and powerful.Great boss fights punctuate each chapter, carefully designed to test your mastery of game mechanics as you learn them, and the soundtrack ensures each fight is backed up by an equally memorable song.Be warned that the game doesn't explain itself very well, and to play it effectively, you'll need to look to guides, or go through a long process of trial and error before the maechanics make sense.  Also, though extremely replayable, the game is fairly short, much of its length coming from cutscenes and hours of optional codec calls.The port to PC is technically competent.  I experienced no errors or poor performance on years-old hardware, and though there are several reports of issues from users, the developers have already announced plans to patch and support the game.  It's rare for a Japanese developer to port a game this nicely, and Platinum and Kojima Productions clearly care about producing a quality product.  Besides, good sales for Revengeance may mean similarly competent ports of other Platinum titles, or Metal Gear Solid installments on PC.Er, now that MGSV is out, thia ia probably the truest Metal Gear experience on Steam, too.Recommendedfor action fans and those who appreciate fast precision gameplay."

While not as skeptical as other fans of the franchise were when the retooled and rebooted version of Metal Gear Rising was revealed to the world, I wasn't exactly eager to play the game either. I had never been a player of character action games in the past, so the change in genre intimidated me.However this game acted as a gateway drug to what has now become an addiction. Revengeance introduced me to the wonderful world of Platinum games, a company that makes some of the most responsive, fun to play action games on the market. While the parry based combat system may put some off of the game, those who are willing to keep playing and improving at the game's mechanics will find a lot of depth and fun to be had here.You also get to cut a giant mech in half with cheesy J-rock playing.

Your first goal is to rescue the minister. This task is very heavy, you can not save your body and you too hurt so much that you have to leave to remake virtually the entire body using a ""cybernetic implants.""The game will learn very little you have to suffice ourselves. My personal observation is to first try to focus on blocking shots. Furthermore, the menu selection and the ability to get chaotic. The game will offer more than mindless cutting into enemies or things around you.When you focus a little bit, you go through the levels without receiving a single wound. The game does not force you just mow, but you can also sneak around their enemies, such as camouflage wooden box or barrel.Ways to cut your opponents is a lot, but again, do not think that it's so simple, even a single soldier can beat you if you're not careful.I just praised and bosses are in some cases much easier and contrary to much heavier, between one of them need Monson for those harder and easier ones I rank Sam. Regarding Armstrong, not to mention, because if you decide to go with only one first-aid kit and get ready for the pain. : DNow we focus on minor things.You've got a section called ""VR Missions"", here you can go through the tutorial again or you have to prove that you have learned something new, and complete other parts of the tutorial ... ..But besides the tutorial there is another mission, where you can improve both in melee and at range combat.Furthermore, there are also friendship ""hands"" with whom you improve in stealth.Like other games, it also has a section with a collection of trophies and game developers.The game is classified more as a relief from the other MGS titles, so the authors have done even more fun, sometimes it worked and sometimes did not.But still, it's the last story in MGR MGS.

I actually own this game on a console (pre-ordered the complete package which was cheaper than the DLC's missing from my console version). Besides solid gameplay, this game sports replayability, which is very rare for a modern game. Maybe it's due to the short story, but I had found myself finishing this game over and over, and I could not remember the last time I finished a game more than once. I am emotionally attached to this game because it reminds me of the older games that I grew up with. I can only point out two weaknesses in the game, one of which is not all that bad. The game is abruplty short (made up by the aforementioned replayability), and like some console-to-pc ports, it's buggy (ie console version was better).I would praise this game better but I can't do it without sounding like a fanboy (that I am). This game is something its generation severely lacks, and it's only being supplied by the same developer. To me, this game reminds me of good times from the PS2 era when hack and slash games were still called action/adventure games. Good games and good times. Real good."

I was astonished by the reason the villans were doing this.(I'm not going to spoil the surprise). The soundtracks used in the game are pretty good too. I downloaded 7 of them :D.

,Recommended,235460,25369328,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Scrubsauce,"I grew up in a strict household, and was never allowed a console of my own.  So pre-broadband days I would dive into the previews and reviews and whatever else Electronic Gaming Monthly could throw at me, and I remember being enthralled at all of the deepness and intrigue over MGS2.  When the PSP first launched, I jumped at the idea to get my first Metal Gear game under my belt, the very underwhelming BCG AC!D.  Since then, I haven't touched the franchise for one reason or another (console exclusivity when I was mainly a PC Gamer, Konami politics post-Kojima, etc.), but Revengeance made its way into my backlog in one of those windows where it was something I was interested in.I remember when the game was first announced at an E3 all those years ago, and seemed to become vaporware until Platinum, another famed developer I had not touched before, announced the return of this gave as REVENGEANCE.  Of course, it took a bit longer for the game to hit PC, and even longer for me to get around to playing it, but I finally did!The Steam version of the game grabs you the main campaign, a time trials DLC, and two additional, smaller campaigns starring supporting characters from the main narrative (think Half-Life Blue Shift moreso than Opposing Force).  Considering the price I grabbed this for when it was on sale (in the teens of dollars if I recall), that's more than enough content for the pricetag IMO.The first level into this game and holy crap, its living up to everything childhood me and teenaged me took away from what I thought the MGS series and Platinum games would be like: giant technorganic mechs, augmented humans, ridiculously over the top action and gameplay mechanics, convoluted political conspiracy narratives, and hit-or-miss lip synching performances from the English audio track.The controls feel very fluid throughout the game, some of the most responsive I've felt in a third person game since the Ezio trilogy from Assassin's Creed.  While there's an upgrade system, this game doesn't take the Deus Ex route of making you invest in certain skills, and is generous enough to let you get most of the potential powerups through a single playthrough (though this may scale with difficulty, but I'm not certain).  The main gameplay consists of third person hack-and-slash w/ combo-'em-up attack schemas.  When Raiden, the cyborg ninja mercenary turned superhero you star as in the main storyline, gains enough meter, you enter an over-the-shoulder viewpoint and the attack mode turns into full-on Fruit Ninja insanity, even bosses in certain cases aren't immune from it.  You're able to slice enemies up into as many chunks as you can manage until your meter depletes.  It isn't as satisfying as the gibs in, say, Killing Floor 2, but for what it is I was impressed at the technical feat of turning a ragdoll into dozens of tiny fillets.The story is pure insanity, in classic Kojima fashion, but was suprisingly stomachable for someone like myself with only minimal exposure to the universe.  The two bonus campaigns help flesh out certain back stories that are heavily alluded to in the main story, one being your sidekick, the other being the recurring rival Gary Oak-style character you have to overcome to get to the climax of the base game.  At least one of these expansions introduces some new attack styles and ideas, while the other is just nice filler for fleshing out the lore.If you can get over Konami getting money from your purchase after how they handled the release of MGS5, I vote have at it.  It won't be traditional Metal Gear, but it will be kind of ridiculous.  Okay not kind of, it will be COMPLETELY ridiculous, and it will take itself SO seriously the entire time, but you will probably still have fun."

,Recommended,235460,13446478,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,MrAptronym,"Bottom Line: Metal Gear Rising may not be a stealth game, but it is still a metal Gear game, with the weird plot and over the top writing that entails. The gameplay itself was designed by platinum games, who right now are at the top of the action game world. If you like Metal Gear, or like action games you absolutely should own this game. I cannot recommend enough.PROS:-Cut through anything, watch it fall to pieces-Fast paced action combat-Amazing boss battles-Perfect music-Dog Shaped Robot Buddy-DLC chapters included freeCONS:-Keyboard/Mouse controls are subpar. They tried, it just doesn't work for this kind of game-One section of the game really drags-Prerendered cutscenes limited to 720pOverlong in depth:Metal gear rising is almost certainly not the best action game ever made, but it is my favorite. This game causes me joy in a way no others really have. It is over the top in the best way and cutting through enemies and objects is amazing fun. You do really cut through things too, you can even do precision cuts at whatever angle you want and watch things/people fall to proper looking pieces.The gameplay might not be quite as deep as bayonetta, but it is solid and gives you a plethora of options. There are enough attacks that you always have a couple options open to you, and the variety of weapons lets you experiment even further. I really love that there is a parry instead of a block button, and making dodge into an attack means that you can absolutely always press the offensive if you are good. You can also fully heal after killing an enemy by precision slicing them, ripping out their spine and bathing in the gatoraide inside. This has the effect of actually making encounters easier when chump enemies are added. Raiden can literally just cut a basic cyborg in half anytime your power guage is full for an instant kill, so they become little more than walking health packs. Thats not to say the game is easy, not on higher difficulties anyway, be prepared to fight robot gorillas, full size metal gears and a group of freakish cyborg bosses.Those boss battles are the absolute highlight of the game. The music is intense power-metal that honestly I would never listen to in a million years. It is also perfect and the best in game music of all time. (RULES OF NATURE!!) The bosses have a variety of attacks and require a variety of tactics, like most encounters in the game, they are very well thought out. The combination of music and battle had me literally cheering after a couple fights.There are a few problems. One chapter of the game has you slowly walk around while you supposedly avoid enemies. Its not great. Also, keyboard and mouse controls are subpar. Its not that they are poorly implemented, it just does not work well for this game. The game was built from the ground up for a controller, and some things just do not translate. Another piece of its console legacy is that you cannot swap weapons mid-combo: A menu screen has to be brought up to swap weapons. The game was designed around this, and it works, but it is a bit restrictive. (This had to be done originally due to console limits on RAM.) Additionally, some people do not like the story, but I think if you stop taking it so seriously it is silly and great. And finally, the very first boss battle is probably the most over the top and dramatic for a long while. Although eventually it is topped, it still messes with the build-up a bit."

Once you know to look out for them it's easy to dodge, but it is annoying to see your health drop from 100% to 0% in an instant.The frame-rate can be wonky, and my computer is well over the recommended specs.People who say it's unplayable with M&K are exagerating in my opinion, but I play EVERYTHING with M&K so maybe it's just me.By no means would I call this a must play, but it's worth picking up on a sale if you like hack and slash games.

There is an emphasis on speed and brutality, and parrying is a key action to the game.As usual with a game based on Metal Gear series, there is plenty of background and some philosophy teachings. As usual, the game is about war and people controling war for either personal gain or personal ideals. I somehow remember some topics of the other games, but just slightly, e.g. who the Patriots are, what a PMC is. A huge difference to MGS4 is that this game does not have many videos to show, but it still has a considerable amount of talks through the codecs.Worst thing about the game is the camera. Many times I was not able to see where enemies or items were.

You can take it slow or fast, it all depends upon your playstyle. However, you will need to learn how to parry to beat a few bosses.

Its litCons:- Only thing that I can complain about is the length of the game. Only provides a bit under 10 hours of gameplay (depending on the difficulty ofc). But I bought it for $7.50 during a steam sale so overall it was definitely worth the money. Normal price is $30 though, so i'd personally wait for a steam sale cus its a bit pricey for a shorter game.System Requirements:I played this on a Mac and got a solid 60fps and no lag.

Metal Gear Rising manages to capture what so many games do not. Making you, the player, feel like you could take on the world.

And this is one of those games that opens big, strikes you down, and builds you up bigger and badder than before.You've got upgrades, amazing bosses, great music, a freaking robot dog thing ala Mega Man X's Sigma, and a double-bladed staff made of interlocking arms ripped from the dead hands of one of the bosses.

There are a few times where stealth is an option, in which the most awesome strike animations come forward on your screen, whenever you get up behind an enemy, or watch them from above. Other times, you\'ll have no other choice but to confront the enemies that will come up and try to attack you, as you will merely beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them. In return, you\'ll get one of the most badass \""Metal-Rock\"" asskickin\' music, as you slice up your enemies into hundreds of pieces - especially during the boss fights, gotta love \'em!Probably only one thing that bugs me about this game, is that it isnt that long in the story, and as you probably come  to an end of the boss fights, you will basically become sad over how awesome rock songs in the background will no longer, motivate you to unsheathe your sword and let it rip.However, this wont stop the fun, as I can clearly say that this is a good replayable game, that will never get boring as you upgrade your attacks, weapons and outfits.By the time Im writing this review, the game is currently on a sale with -75% off and is totally worth it.

Anyone not familiar with Platinum and their signature style of character action games should play this game. If you want to try a character action game, you should play this game. If you want to see some of the coolest stuff you will ever see in a video game, you should play this game.Pc players have long been withheld from Platinum's signature style games. Their games under Activision's banner (Transformers, TMNT, and Legend of Korra) are not indicative of their usually high mark of quality. That's what happens when a crappy publisher doesn't give a studio time/budget.Onto the game itself. This is a pretty stellar port which includes a good number of graphical options pc players expect, however, if you love fine tuning every little aspect of visuals, you won't find much here. It's also important to note that due to the blade mode featured in this game, you should use a controller. The game itself runs on any modern machine and at a buttery smooth 60fps which is important for games of this nature. The main conceit of this game is the Zandatsu, or Cut and Take. When enemies are damaged enough, or if you parry their attacks, you are given a chance to activate blade mode (pressing left trigger on your controller) and then use either the face buttons, or the right analog stick to line up a slash on an enemy that will allow you to not only neutralize them in a single slash, but also refill your health and blade mode instantly.One thing that should be noted is that many different types of playstyles are viable, and many tactics can be used against certain enemies. For instance, an enemy my throw something at you and the game may prompt you to enter blade mode. However, if you're smart enough, you can usually dodge the attack by using your ninja run instead.I could go on for hours abotu this game, but honestly, you really should just play it."
