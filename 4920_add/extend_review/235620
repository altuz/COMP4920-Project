,Not Recommended,235620,13472059,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Frostyspooks,"When Small World 2 functions properly, it's a fun and faster incarnation of its tabletop predecessor. The game is arguably easier to play than its tabletop incarnation because it prevents players from making invalid moves and sometimes indicates possible moves. It also makes it easier for players to keep track of numbers like turns and quantities of troops. The game also captures the aesthetic of Small World very well, and actions are played out rather pleasantly. However, the game crashes or bugs-out frequently. The game is locked at one specific resolution, which cannot be changed (except by maximizing the window, which may sometimes result in letterboxing). There are no settings options whatsoever, aside from game volume and music volume. And finding a game online is horrendous because creating and joining games is tedious, and that's if there's even anyone online to play with (which there more often than not, is not). Many of the UI elements can be confusing, especially since the tooltips (when functional) aren't always informative. Parts of the UI, particularly text, will even change the game's cursor to the system or text cursor, making the entire game feel cheap and poorly made. One would expect many of these issues to be solved, or at least addressed, shortly after the game's release, but since at the time I'm typing this the game has been released for over a year, I believe that it's safe to say that these issues will not be addressed any time soon, if at all. The entire game feels like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥money grab, and despite the genuine entertainment it may provide, albeit in small amounts, I cannot recommend this game while these issues continue to exist."

However it's quite expensive for what you get, only took half a year to make and the DLC option is an insult to any other passionate developer that works his♥♥♥♥♥off to go that extra mile who truely deserves it. Back in my day DLC was called an expansion pack and it was worth every penny. Here we have a set of simple and over priced DLC packs on day 1, something alreay made & a number of fans could poop out in an afternoon if they spent that time to support mods. OK, It's understandable that a company seeks to maximize profits but this developer goes a little too far with asking consumers to purchase an aditional andriod version even after they have brought the PC one. Not sure if that also requires purchasing the DLC twice but its deserves critisim because the combined price tage is approaching a tripple A title.As for the quality of the game itself, there are a few bugs with it. The race descriptions don't always render properly, it appears to use flash/html pages for that and suffer from a font issue on my machine. I also caused the game to freeze when attempting to read the rules as the bots were taking their turn. There are limited graphical options for resolution & sound. All said and done, its entertaining for an hour or so but for that price I think you can find something else that will keep you going for far longer.*update* Some parts of the game looks nice, but the quality of developement feels rushed in how it responds, the screen doesn't scale well in places.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203025847The application must also be active at all times to play multiplayer otherwise you get a re authorization message followed by the turn replaying itself from start which means no browsing on your 2nd monitor to pass the time and even reading the in game rules causes this issue to occur. I like the game but the quality could be better."

Also no arguing about the rules; Even more time saved!

My son digitally crushed me twice in a row last night, and it took less time than it would have to play one game with the physical board game. We were pleased that it clarified a couple of rules that were not clear (to us) previously. The art is in keeping with Small World art, although the graphics don't scale well when maximized on a wide screen. Touch functionality is awesome, and using a mouse is not nearly as bad as some other reviewers have suggested. The AI is not 100% there: I've had AI opponents walk all over me, but I've also had an AI opponent play an entire game with their first-turn pick of Hordes of Amazons... Online play, Solo, and Pass 'n' Play all worked like a charm. I've had it crash out of the game twice during solo play, but I expect that will get ironed out in the near future. Overall, I believe it's worth the price for the base game and the DLC. I would really like to see Tales and Legends DLC."

The object of the game is simple, be the player to gain the most coins by the end of the game, through occupying regions of the map and taking over opponent’s regions through conquests.The rules of the game are simple and easy to learn and this digital rendition makes it easy to keep track of everything and prevent mistakes that can easily be made when playing the original board game.Once the basics of the game have been grasped the skill comes in when deciding if it is worth paying coins for choosing a better race/ability combo, choosing which regions to occupy/conquer and when to send your race into decline and choose a new race.The DLC’s add new race/ability cards creating new combinations to master and get used to.  At the moment, there are only a few DLC’s available and not all of the expansions available for the board game version have made it to the digital version as a DLC.There are many ways to play:Solo V’s AI- The AI of the game does seem a little unbalanced with dice rolls frequently failing for the player and constantly succeeding for the AI (way above what the statistical average should be).Online Multiplayer- Unfortunately recently there does not seem to be a lot of players wanting to play online.  I have gone into the Online Waiting Area to find very few or no games at all available to join.  I have also had the game crash or freeze a few times when playing online with a private game between friends.Local Multiplayer- Great for playing against family and friends when all on the same network.Pass & Play- Tedious way to play but means that the game can be played on just one computer and with only one copy of the game.Overall Small World 2 has made a successful port over to a digital version.  It has been sympathetically done, in line with the artwork and lore of the Small World board game.  There are one or two small issues with the game, but generally these do not detract from the convenience and speed that the digital version brings over the original board game.Pros:Quick to play as there is a turn limit on games.Easy to learn.Many ways to play.Prevents miscalculations/mistakes when trying to conquer regions/calculate coins earnt.Cons:Limited ability to play online due to very few games being available to join.No graphics controls meaning that the quality on larger screens suffers.Occasional glitches especially when playing multiplayer.Unbalanced AI/random number generation."

If it is your turn in both, it will take you through all of the other players' moves, even though they already went, and then if you switch to the other game, and back again, you have to watch all of those players' moves yet again before you can go, all the while everyone can't understand why you won't take your turn.

,Not Recommended,235620,23410920,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,jwonn91,"Being a huge fan of the board game, I was a little disappointed by this electronic version. No solo campaign-type mode; only thing you can do solo is play a basic game against a few bots (can't even adjust difficulty) Hardly anyone even plays the multiplayer mode. There's no real variables you can adjust when creating a game except for the number of players. There is only one board to play on. There's none of the races, abilities, or places/relics from the Smallworld Underground board game. The DLC packs are pretty skimpy as well. I just felt like there was not enough content in this game for the ~$15 that it costed with DLC; I've played free and $1-2 games with way more content. However, I do still enjoy the basic game and isn't a bad way to spend 10-15 mins now and then. Overall, I would suggest saving your money until the developers add some meat to this game."
,Recommended,235620,8055011,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,Elgalad,"I'm still of mixed minds about this game.  I've watched let's play on youtube and Wil Wheaton's Table Top review of it, and it looked like a lot of fun.  Thing is, I haven't had time to play this with others yet, and I wanted to really Learn the game first, so I've been playing only solo matches against the AI so far.  I expect when I finally start playing with others, I may like the game even more.Basically this is a conquest board game for 2 to 5 players, any of which may be live opponents or AI.   A typical match shouldn't take even as much as a half hour and that's With the full complement of players.  The game rules and procedure resemble Risk somewhat, though in a fantasy setting rather than the real world.  It's all about conquering the world, though with a twist;  your 'army' only has a short lifespan and will inevitably be replaced by another army that you also control.  The goal is to build up gold units that you earn primarily at the end of your turn for holding territory, but also through special abilities your armies might have.  The armies are very diverse and represent fantasy races, from hobbits to skeletons, giants, and dwarves.  You get to pick which race you want to make 'active' but their abilities are randomized each game.Strong replayability is built right in as no two games will ever play alike.  The graphics are decent, though the game map/board is a little 'busy' with all of the counters, symbols, borders, and artwork vying for space and That can make things a little confusing at times.  The music is fun and matches the light hearted tone set by the art style.I don't have any major complaints, though I'm not fond of the nickle and dime aspect of the DLC.  It'd be nice if the developers had just bundled the dlcs rather than parcelled them out as they did, but I'm guessing it had something to do with rewards for the kickstarter investors.TL:DR?  Bottom line, if you like board games that involve a good portion of luck, you should enjoy this.  It's easy to learn the basics but has enough 'meat' to make you want to invest some time in mastering the strategies."

I would even say it does it too well, because it duplicates the board game’s issues. The map is beautiful but still motley to the point it hurts the eyes. For that reason, while the application can be ran in full screen, I preferred to play it in windowed mode. In some place new tabs open or the table is cut, but it doesn’t really collide with gameplay. Also I didn’t notice any freezes, long loading times or waiting endlessly for any online opponents.Pros:+ High replayability (different races and special powers);+ Dynamic, colorful, with many negative interactions;+ Working smoothly.Cons:- Paradoxically to pros: many negative interactions (not for persons who doesn’t like competitive games);- Even if you really, really like your little friends… sooner or later they have to die;- Pretty map but hard to look at, the eyes get tired, because of too much chaos on the board.Going to the last verdict: as for the visuals, audio and the game mechanics, Days of Wonder give us a fully satisfying product… but I still prefer the shared hours spent with friends at the game board.See full review on my blog:http://iplaywithgreen.pl/2015/10/07/recenzja-aplikacji-1-small-world-2/"

The game isn't without some bugs however, the android version often crashes but works ok when rebooted and the final scores occasionally disappear only to reappear a few days later. This can be quite frustrating when all you want to do is see who won. The DLCs only work on the platform they've been purchased on, so a steam DLC won't work on android or IOS - you can however, continue or join a game started using the DLCs on a platform where you don't own them.

Well, it does, but nowhere near as well as it should. Since this is a direct, very lazy port of the tablet/mobile version, there are no options to really configure anything: you can't even fullscreen the game. Playing online with friends is a possibility, but the horrendous UI makes actually connecting to a game a chore (did I mention this is a direct tablet port yet?), and the ingame chat censors you without mercy no matter who you are playing with. The latter could be acceptable if it didn't then immediately result in the game temporarily muting you in chat. Playing with the AI is not any better, since the AI either doesn't know what it is doing, or freezes all together with indecision, never ending its turn (Heroic Halflings in a 5 player game seems to stump the AI regularly for me if a bot gets it). As the game has no turn timers, if the AI decides to freeze in this manner there is nothing you can do to salvage that particular session."

The fact that you cannot make an illegal move also makes it easy to understand the rules compared to the board game where there are a few ambiguous rules.Unfortunately the game has a few problems too, namely sometimes the multiplayer connection is unstable and at least for some linux players - like me -  one race (the ghouls) is, in some sense, unplayable. (Meaning that going into decline crashes the game. In singleplayer this marks the end of the game while in multiplayer one can reconnect but by that time the AI replacing them could create a less favorable position.)Still, I'd recommend the game for those who loves board games and does not mind said bugs too much -- personally I haven't had any connection problem for several months now and until the issue is fixed, not being able to play with ghouls can be considered as a challenge. :)"

You cannot alter the resolution, enable full screen and as for colour blind options forget about it! There are also numerous other nasty things. Bugs, connection problems on multiplayer and day one DLC if you'd like something in the way of a choice of maps.The game play while well explained with video tutorial and in game rule book, is solid but if you like this sort of thing why not buy the board game instead?

I say this because every single time you tab out of the game, if you are playing live, you need to watch the moves of those who played after your last turn over and over again. Every single time. Even if you tab out for a few seconds. What this boils down to is that if you and 4 friends are playing (as was our case) 80% of the time spent ""playing"" the game translates to watching back previous moves while you laboriously await your turn. This is hopefully something that could be patched/fixed, but as this is a direct port from a tablet variant I don't foresee this happening.Next up, if you don't know how to play Small World, don't in any way expect this game to teach you. Thankfully, we had a seasoned pro of Small World playing with us so we had some idea what was going on, but the shear lack of tooltips, information and tutelage was kind of staggering. I'd say this is the type of game that is a) aimed towards someone who already plays Small World and b) a tablet device or phone.The controls, the feel, and the entirity of the game just scream tablet game. And that's great! On a tablet. Sadly, as a PC title, it falls short.After enduring one hour long game with my friends, I immediately requested a Steam refund for this severely underwhelming game, which was rejected as I'd already used the title, so for everyone else out there: beware.The title has great promise! Small World is a GREAT board game, but this digital port just does not deliver. Maybe the devs will pick this up and adapt it, and if so I'll happily edit my review and re-review the title; after all, Small World itself is a great game! But for now, again, beware.Nilesy"

If they removed the die, and went to a bidding system instead of the coin-drop, the game would be much more strategic.  Hopefully they can add a gamemode for hardcore strategists some day.For 2 players, the game falls apart pretty fast.  Combo selection owns, and some combos are just broken.  At 3 players this abates with the introduction of some classic game theory situations - the ability to gang up on a third player.Overall this is a GREAT and fun game.

And I had to make a lot of really bad pot roasts to finally figure the whole dadgum thing out…and figure it out I did, thank the Lord above. And the verdict? Pot roast, when made according to a few fundamental rules, can be a totally delicious addition to your repertoire. There are lots of different, equally delicious ways to make pot roast. Today’s version is the first of many I’ll be profiling here.The meat you use is important. My favorite roast is the chuck roast; it has wonderful marbling throughout the meat, and when given an ample amount of time to cook, chuck roast winds up being tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To understand the importance of adequate cooking time, you must understand that these tougher pieces of meat have lots of tough connective tissue that will only soften when cooked at a lower temperature for a long period of time. You can’t rush a pot roast; you’ll be disappointed with the result if you try. But if you reach deep down into your soul and find your patience—at least, the patience that was given to you by your Maker to relate to beef-related circumstances in your life—you won’t be disappointed."

But these are minor. There are tons of play options for networked and friend play and even some unusal ones like pass and play (a hang-over from the mobile dev).I have not seen any credit to the original contestant winners for the conceptualisation of the expansion races and powers, but hopefully that was merely an oversight.This is a great casual game and a great example of how modern board games have evolved well beyond the traditional ""roll and move"" paradigm."
