Can be very frustrating till you learn the systems but people willing to plow through and figure it out will be rewarded with a very fun (and cheap) time sink. Despite losing my first two campaign attempts I stuck with it, got an idea for what was going on and suddenly lost 40 hours of the first week. Highly recommended for TBS fans and people who enjoy a challenge."

76561197970759933,Recommended,235660,10060146,"Posted: 9 May, 2014",all,Slayemin,"Alright, what's the deal with this game? It's got crappy graphics and looks like it's from 1998!Let's ignore those facts for a moment. Suspend your disbelief, if you will. What's going on beneath the surface with the game mechanics?As of this review writing, I've got 305 hours spent on this game (I'm a bit ashamed of that). So, there's something being done right here. It certainly scratches a lot of my itches and gives me what I'm looking for.In terms of strategy, there are multiple layers of complexity. You're first introduced to the game in a small starting scenario which introduces the game mechanics to you. Most of the time, you are moving your hero armies around on the campaign map. On occassion, your hero will get into a tactical battle against monsters or other heros. This takes place on a hexagonal grid system and each side takes turns moving all of their creatures.The battles are quite tactical. Your creatures come in 4 different tiers of strength. Each unit comes with certain strengths and weaknesses, and abilities. For example, the thief has a dagger strike which poisons his foes and doesn't let them counter attack. However, the thief doesn't have a lot of HP or armor, so they can easily be killed. Archers can't shoot at adjacent enemies, so they have to move away. Sometimes, your archers can only move away and can't act, so adjacent units can keep following them and killing the archers. So, you certainly want to protect the archers with blocking melee units. The game also has a pretty interesting list of battle spells. If you can't get behind a melee wall to the squishy archers, you could always resurrect one of the dead corpses as a zombie which can do the job. Just as well, the enemy could do that to you! So, to prevent that, you want to move your creatures on top of corpses to prevent their reanimation. That could also cause you to move onto a strategically disadvantageous position. Every army has a hero leading it, so the heros also directly participate in the battles. Heros can become very, very powerful as they level up. I find that an appropriately maxed warrior can pretty much solo every fight, but that strategy won't work forever.Your kingdom consists of your capitol and any conquered provinces. Each province yields a little bit of mana and/or gold per turn. This mana and gold is used for spells and recruiting units or constructing buildings. Some provinces will have strategic resources (such as logs) which will reduce the building costs of a building within your capitol. Each province can be improved to provide more resources. It seems that every turn, there are also a bunch of random events which happen within your kingdom. You have to read each event story and navigate a dialogue tree to respond to the event in some way. Each dialogue choice has a variable chance that it creates a favorable result or a negative result. The game events work on a sort of ""karma"" system, where choosing the ""evil"" choices results in negative karma but a short term gain, and choosing the ""good"" choice results in positive karma but generally incurs a cost. Over time, if your karma becomes really good, your kingdom will be flooded with positive events. If your karma becomes bad, you get flooded with bad events which get progressively more expensive.Meanwhile, you also also contending against one or more AI players who usually play with a slight advantage (cheaters!). You have to play particularly well in order to beat the AI.The game is also a bit unforgiving. You can't really just start a level, save at turn 15, play to turn 25, and then reload turn 15 if things go bad. The save game system only allows you to go back one turn, and if you reload, it also penalizes you by subtracting from your final score. You can restart an entire scenario from the beginning, but that too has a campaign cost (in terms of astral energy). So, you don't want to screw around and experiment. In some scenarios, an enemy wizard will directly attack your home world and you have to fend them off. If you lose, that's it. Game over. You lose. Roll credits. No reloading and trying again.In the campaign mode, you select which ""shards"" you want to conquer. Each shard unlocks two or more buildings for your capitol for each subsequent scenario. Some shards are extremely difficult to conquer if you don't have sufficient tech. So, you have to pick carefully which shards you want to conquer and in which order you want to conquer them based on the buildings they unlock.This game is very fun, very interesting, and very complex. If you can look past the graphics, I highly recommend it for any strategy minded players. There is a newer version of this game out which pretty much is this exact game (in terms of mechanics) but overhauls the graphics and UI (ooh, pretty sparkles!).There is only one significant downside to the game, and that is the drawback of its unforgiving save game system. I encountered a problem midway into one of my campaigns where my save game file got corrupted somehow. Since there wasn't any previous saved games, I lost hours of progress. I almost lost my entire campaign! I had to restart my shard scenario from the beginning.Currently, I haven't been playing this game lately because I am stuck on a particularly difficult invasion. An enemy wizard decided to attack my homeworld and the AI difficulty is set very high. In the three times I've tried, I can't seem to beat him. I must fight him off, and if I lose, the game is completely over. I've given up for now, but maybe in a few months I'll try again."

This definietly is not a game for everyone, people who don't remember and love 90's gaming might not like these graphics and gameplay. But if you do, surely should you try it. Mix HoMM with Age of Wonders, some Civilization and add bonus content and it it Eador: Genesis. Game is very complex and, depending of your skills and terrain available, you might choose plenty of different approaches. Battles seem simplified, but when you dig into them, you discover more and more relevant factors, that can, literally, transform heavy defeat into a glorious victory.

This game is hard, so far as there is almost no documentation that can help you understand every singe battle/challenge/random event.  About the only thing you can do is dive in, play, lose, and do it all over again (I re-ran the tutorial about 3 times).  But once you do learn, and you conquer your first shard, well I for one was hooked.This is not a game that you can ever just bide your time with, building up enough of an army, and a powerful enough hero.  Yes these are the things you must have to win, but the computer opponents are doing exactly the same things, and in many cases, they are much more aggressive.  You can find yourself surrounded, fighting to keep the enemy out of your strongholds, when only rounds earlier you thought you had the game well in hand.  Yes it is somewhat repetative (part of the game getting easier is that you eventually start to know what pattern or solution to a given ""random"" event is best), and there are times that it will feel unfair, but trust me.  When you bull rush an enemy strong hold, kill off 2 of his heroes, siege his castle, then finally banish him, all before HE was able to break away, then you too will know how much fun this game can be!"

Will eat time really easily once you get in the paces of using rituals and managing heroes.Youve always got choices within your castle and you have alot of tech trees to chose. You can train evil/neutral/good units which all have differing stats and usefulness. You can easily have a good necromancer or an evil paladin.Bloody inquisition though. You either let your people get tortured witch trials style or you eternally get damned as a evil by the inquisition and will constantly attempt to ravage your lands.

Eventually you run into enemy AI opponents, and if you've done well enough in the first part of the game you will be able to beat them into submission. Good concept.There are two problems that keep this game from being playable. First, it is a downgraded version of Eador: Broken Worlds. There's not much point in playing this since it became available after the superior polished sucessor.Second, it is -incredibly- slow. The campaign features a tremendous number of individual maps, with no unique mission objectives. When you win one of these, you get a small bonus to resource production and, if you're lucky, one extra building available for contruction. You don't actually build anything on the campaign map, this just unlocks another small option on the main map. The real issue is that every single map takes hours, each map takes more and more time as you progress through the campaign, and there are a really limited number of strategies available to keep this interesting."

The campaign might have it's lengths - but on the other hand, you won't be sitting idly around playing it.The game (especially the campaing) tell a story, you have to conquer shards, to gain in power and influence. Each shard is divided into several provinces, which have inhabitants, quest and resources. There are common (Gold/Crystals) and uncommon resources (also called strategical resources - required for some units and buildings). You can unlock higher levels of buildings, units and equipment through developing your kingdom, your stronghold and of course by solving quest (sometimes there is stuff that ""seems"" to disappear, but in fact those nifty items are used for something else).Every decission you make will have it's repercussions - for example: You have a thieves guild in your province that is causing trouble, you attack them and catch their leaders. They plight to set free again, and offer you a deal (paying tax and a one time benefit to your coffers of 200 gold) or you can kill them instead and burndown their hideout. If you accept their offer the people of the province won't be too happy about it - so you might have to use something else to lighten up their mood. Oh, by the way - if you've been too much of a fool for gold (you'll see what I mean when you see some of the quests and tasks) you'll be getting a lot of uprisings to fight...Building, upgrading, exploring and solving quests is what is most of the time the staple in this game.

This game does not take you by the hand to tell you what to do but will punish slight mistakes hard.The tutorial was very easy and will not prepare you in the slightest to what awaits you later.I stopped after a couple of hours and tries because this game just frustrates me.Graphics and Design: 7/10 (Old but with a nice touch to it. All in all fitting)Music: 7/10 (Oldschool with some nice tunes. Gets boring after a while)Strategic aspect and Depth: 9/10 (Surprisingly deep srategies and tactics.

I was not able to play in a full screen mode despite all the fixes proposed throughout several Web sites. In addition, there is no tutorial and no user manual. I searched the Internet and found out that a user manual exists but is in Russian (a googled translation is available but not the best). This is very frustrating."

You're the Hero, the commander of your army, you go explore the land and you actually fight.You improve your Hero and buy armor and weapons, and customize it to some sub-classes.With all that said, all that fails: The customization is completely random; at every level-up you are given 3 RANDOM ""masteries"" and choose to boost one. They're not useless but you can't choose what you want to become.If none of the masteries is what you want, then you HAVE TO choose the ""passive"" or ""main"" (say Magic Dmg for Wizard, Attack for Warrior, Range plus Attack for Scout).Sorry, but for a RPG feature this is a SHAME. You don't actually know how many masteries are or when are you getting the one you'll like. You don't even know which are the sub-classes or what skills will you need. You can't customize your Hero the way you want knowing NOTHING.Then again, the army recruitment and management system is terrible: You pay many kinds of soldiers to help you in battle. They level up and get some stats, skills and stuff... then in some random not-favorable battle they die and... your time spent in that unit, developement and EVERYTHING is just destroyed and you have to hire a lvl 0 unit again.There's only one ""save slot"" for Campaign Mode, so if you want to try a class, you have to erase your previous game data.If you played lets say... 30 hours the Warrior and you need a rest or you want to try a new Hero, you're gonna LOSE 30 hours of your life just to find you hate the Scout and want your Warrior back.The autosave is also annoying because every time you exit the Campaign, it autosaves. This means you learn the game from your mistakes, but the hardest way possible, and nothing can be undone.Well, if you don't mind some of these features and just like the strategy and empire building... this game is maybe for you.Definetly not for me."

,Recommended,235660,33501870,Posted: 13 July,all,Mitvailer,"Note : this review is based on Eador : Genesis and Eador : Master of the Broken World, which looks to me very alike, but with a new interface, more events and so on. I switched from Genersis to the other to test, after a tens of hours on Genesis, and saw no reason for coming back to Genesis. I think and hope that what I will write here is accurate to Eador : Genesis. I recommend you getting Eador : Master of the Broken World (instead or in addition), may it only be for the user interface.A very nice strategy game.To capture a shard (win a game), you have to defeat all the lords fighting for it. You will build your stronghold, improve your provinces, have their population grow.You can choose heroes between 4 base classes (there are advanced classes on level 10, and maybe others later, didn't reach level 20 in a game yet), use them to explore the lands so more people can settle in and to find dungeons, fight in dungeons to get loot, conquer other provinces and capture the ennemy stronghold. Your hero can lead an army of several units, use magical spells, hold powerful items, all that depending on what you can get (units, spells and items), and what your hero can handle. Some heroes are great fighters, either in melee or range, some have powerful spells, and other are quite useless in the fight, but can have a mighty army to do all the job.Upon level up, your hero will automatically improve one of his trait (health, stamina, attack, etc.), and you can choose between 3 randomly selected skills matching your hero class. Your units can level up too, which will give you the choice between 2 traits or new skills for it, depending of the unit type (they don't get a free trait improvement, contrary to your heroes)There are also nice role play events, with always several choices, that can happen upon exploring a province with a hero or randomly in a province at the end of the turn. The same choice in two same events may lead do different results.Sadly, the AI cheats a lot, which is especially annoying in the early game, where you often develop slowly while the other Lords can expand much faster. It doesn't prevent from getting very nice games, and you will always find a difficulty level that will fit to you :)The campaign has an interesting story, there are also choices to be made, especially what kind of ruler you want to be, and the relationship you want to build with the others. You can also interact diplomatically with other great rulers during a shard conquest. The campaign is about conquering many shards, and capturing even a tiny or small shard will take you several hours, so you can play this game for a very long time, totally worth the investment ^^"
