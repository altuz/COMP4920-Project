,Recommended,235820,7841472,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,awkee,"Platforming games are a thing of incremental progress in how they are built. Players will be dropped into a relatively familiar experience, and be given the basic principles of how the world operates. From that point it is the games responsibility to build upon those foundations and craft a game that continuously teaches you more and more about itself. This is usually in the form of gameplay mechanics or level design but it’s a technique that works, and has stood the test of time. Element4l is something that is trying to accomplish progress in both of those directions at the same time in ways that previous platforming games haven’t touched upon, all set to an affecting and beautiful soundtrack.Let’s start with the basics. You are a bubble. You will not remain a bubble, but you will begin as one. As this bubble, you will soon learn to become an ice cube. This is the transitive path to enlightenment, becoming an ice cube and all. Next you will learn to be as a stone; which is to say you will be a boulder. This will make you heavy as you may imagine, but heaviness is not enlightenment. So you will become a spark from a stone, and be as a flaming comet in the sky. This might be the path to enlightenment, who knows? Really the thing to take stock of here is that you will be four elements throughout this game, and you will have to traverse paths. Are they paths to enlightenment? No, not really, in fact they’re more likely paths to you having a minor heart attack…in a good way. If that sort of thing is possible.Element4l places you in the role of these four elements, and tasks you with moving from the left to the right. There are no enemies to speak of as you move from the left to the right, but the environment can and will kill you. You move from one end of the level to the other using nothing but the momentum that you are able to generate by switching the various elements on the fly, each possessing their own unique properties. As a bubble of air, you are obviously able to float, but you can also “bubble up” and give yourself an upward boost. As a block of ice, you can slide around on surfaces and gain ludicrous amounts of speed that would make a hedgehog jealous, provided you’ve got enough forward momentum going. Turning to a stone will give you some immediate downward force, and turning to a spark will fling you to the right for a brief moment.Each of these elements is controlled by a radial dial of energy that surrounds you at all times. Changing from one element to the other drains a certain amount of energy unless you are changing to an ice cube. In a subtle move of gameplay genius the developers wisely omitted an energy requirement to change to a block of ice, making sure you’ve always got something to fall back on. With all these things in place the game starts simply enough. Spark to the right, turn to a stone over a sloped piece of the level, and then quickly turn to ice. The resulting “wheeeeeeeeeee!” that escapes your mouth is elation. For a time that sense of discovery remains in place as the game continues to peel back layer upon layer of gameplay. Which is to say it gets deep pretty soon, and starts challenging your perception of movement in a general way. It’s a great gameplay device while it’s all about learning these new things. So the first time that you bounce off a lava surface to quickly reverse your direction and fling upside down as an ice cube, your mouth will upturn into a grin.However nothing lasts forever. Once the game is done showing you the operating principles behind the myriad of ways that you can move it takes the kid gloves off. Around the second chapter of the game, Element4l shows you that only through brutal painstaking trial and error will you ever achieve enlightenment. Solutions to movement puzzles become much less obvious and much more esoteric, and the explanations are few and far between. Is this an issue? It depends on how you look at it. On the one hand this game is the very core of what platforming is about. You take a basic mechanic like moving from the left of the level to the right of the level, and then you procedurally add to it. By the end of the experience, you should have challenged the player’s perception of that simple act of moving from one side of the screen to the other. Here’s where that’s going to be disarming for those interested in Element4l; the game is adorable. While you wouldn’t think this an obvious detriment right away, I think it might be. The cutesy graphics and art style suggest a much more casual experience than what really lies in wait here. So while the average player might be expecting something in line with Braid or Limbo, they’ll be surprised or dismayed to find that this game is basically Super Meat Boy with ice cubes."
,Recommended,235820,17916016,"Posted: 6 September, 2015",all,pixtar,"'Element4l'is an atmospheric puzzle platformer with four elements (ice, air, rock and fire).Desc:You will get an introduction into the game which is really needed. First of all you have the element air, as second element you will get ice, next one is rock and at last fire. You will switch through the elements with the arrow keys. Every change will lower your endurance except the change to ice, which doesn't cost any endurance. The endurance will reload automatically over a short periode of time. If your endurance is too low you can't change into another element. You have always to use the environment around you to finish the level.For example: You have to get through two half-pipes in front of you. Therefore you will change to rock to raise your fall speed and just before you hit the entrance of the first half-pipe you will change to ice to slide through it. After you exit the half-pipe you will change to air to fly above the second half-pipe to repeat the actions again. This means that you have to react often very very fast to get the right speed/timing to fly/roll/slide to the next objective.There are calm passages like slowly floating as air over lava or wet passages like sliding as ice through water or rolling down a track in a minecart as rock or bouncing as fire from one lava pit to another.Yeah, that's it.Pros:+ great game concept (like rock-paper-scissors)+ well designed physic engine+ tutorial available+ lovely designed levels (with usage of the rock-paper-scissors principle)+ non-frustrating autosave system+ atmospheric style+ good artwork and nice particle effects+ awesome sound scenery with calm appropriate music+ help system (never used)+ funny text messages with referrals to other games/movies (like 'The Goonies', 'Harry Potter', 'Indiana Jones' or RPGs)+ good chosen quotes (displayed at the beginning of each level)(+ steam achievements)Cons:- some parts of some levels are hard as hell (in one level I needed over 100 respawns -.-)- no story, not even an abstract story(- no demo)Recommended, even if it'snot on sale, because it's an fantastic game concept, which was lovely designed into a really enjoyable calm atmosphere.9/10"

The soundtrack is bloody amazing and goes along really well with the game.It's not really long, then again, it's just got the right length in my opinion ... it doesn't overstay its welcome. You control a character (or rather 4) which can switch between fire, water (ice), earth (stone) and air (bubble). You race the tracks/levels with your character and need to switch quickly between the 4 forms in order to gain speed  (as an ice cube), jump over cliffs (as fire ball), ascend (as an air bubble) and roll down hills or destroy obstacles (as stone). Since some of the tracks are really fast paced you will have some tough passages to overcome. Thankfully the checkpoints are well placed. It's really like TRIALS but in cute, haha. But like in Trials you want to finish the track withouth 'dying' and reach the end in one go.A relaxing piece of gaming entertainment with a great atmosphere. Fair price, especially since you get the OST with the purchase of the game as well. What I liked especially were the comments of the developer which pop up occasionally in the game. Movie references and overall fun comments.10/10 control a cute Super-Skrull to rule the tracksEDIT: I forgot to mention that besides its fluffy cute look, it's beastly hard and quite challenging at times. However, all the whining in certain reviews and therefore negative ratings don't do ELEMENT4L justice - it's very doable and a lot of fun."

There are things about this game that I like, but I found myself getting rather frustrated at certain points that require more or less an exact number of button pushes at the most perfect time to be able to pass them.  In other words, though I appreciate the themery of the game, it doesn't pair up well with the demands of how perfectly timed every single one of your button pushes have to be."

You can switch between rock, fire, ice and wind on the fly while moving through a level. A fun idea, but there are a lot of trial-and-error moments.It frustrated me more than I had fun with it which isn't a good sign. But if you do finish a (part of the) level without messing things up it feels really satisfying.Also, it doesn't look bad, a bit simplistic and minimalistic maybe, but I liked it anyway.

The elements comprise of a heavy boulder (Earth), a speedy spark (Fire), a block of ice (Water), and a bubble of air (Air).The controls are simple but difficult to master. You basically need only four buttons to play - up, right, down, left. Both keyboard and x360 gamepad worked for me, but keyboard seems to be more responsive and lets you time your actions more precisely.Graphics are elementary ;) but cute. There are some cutscenes but they were rendered in lower resolution than the rest of the game; they also didn't bring anything new to the game.Found no bugs, the game played like a charm."

So, so good!To begin with the art, it's striking yet mellow at the same time. The elements are so cute with their little eyes, I feel so bad when I kill them! Which I do a lot. The little text that appears occasionally is always witty and very in-keeping with the game's aesthetics and overall feel. The core mechanic itself is intruiging and new; I'm a big fan of the rare combination of unique idea and good physics engine.The music might not be to everyone's taste, I personally love it, but just play other music. Element4l looks good enough to be played in silence or with alternate music.It's like Bit.Trip Runner but you're not on the same sort of rail. It's as difficult and frustrating at points, but I love that in a game. The levels are huge, and there's quite a few of them to increase the replay value.Please get it to support the great mind(s) behind this!"

Don't get me wrong, the design is great, music is nice, idea is fun. And at the beginning everything is fine with the game, but at some point you die and die and die and die. I love difficult games, I played through Meat boy and They will bleed pixels and died over and over again while having the time of my life. But somehow dying in Element4l is just no fun. You don't learn from death you just try till you beat the hard part. But oh wait, after this part there is another nearly impossible part that kills you 30 times. And so you suffer through the level until you finally reach the end.Perhaps this is just not the game for me, but if you like hart platformers and think about buying this think twice about it."

Seeing as you seamlessly go with the flow of the stage is rewarding. The game will also make you smile at some moments, as Mr.Smooth says some funny things trough the game, which is something I rarely find in games.The game itself can be rushed from the beggining to the credits in 4-6 hours but, where the game really shines is when you try to go for the gold medals and master the stages, this added to me possibly another 6-8 hours of fun. Also if you like collectables there are some in the game.By the way, all the music from the game is good, and there are twelve of them!!!The only bad thing I found in the game is that the one I loved the most (Mother Nature), was the least one played in :(. And also there where like two or three checkpoints that were bad placed as they made it difficult for you to continue trough the stage (Because they put you in a way that you did not have enough momentum for certain action).Beside from that, this is a game that I really remember and will remember with special care."
,Recommended,235820,13189118,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Zane Storm,"I've not played lots of this. But what I have played, has impressed me. I'm not big on puzzle-platformer types, but I adore this game regardless.The Soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. It's so ambient and it REALLY fits the game. It genuinely makes you feel like you're solving a puzzle. There's some interesting, occasionally creepy sound-effects [childrens laughter] that definitely adds to the  very odd atmosphere. There's no real way to decribe the kind of atmosphere it generates. It's simply unique.The Artwork/Aesthetic. It's gorgeous. Vibrant colour themes and pleasant contrasts. It's quite simply an interesting game to look at.The gameplay is, not really for me. The game can get difficult very quickly, which is always an issue with puzzle-platformers. Certainly some levels are more intuitive than others. But it consistently provides a challenge. I imagine, at higher levels, it must feel fantastic to glide through the levels executing each move required perfectly. Sadly, I very rarely - often accidentally - replicate this feeling. It's usually the moment I realize how fluid the game feels that I die! The main issue for me is that when you do die, it really slows the gameplay. What is fluid when executed perfectly feels sluggish when you die, as you often re-spawn stationary, or with little momentum.But I can't stress enough how polished it is, especially for an indie title. There's some lovely written commentary provided in-game as you pass certain obstacles. If you love puzzle-platformers and unique games, you'll like this game. Even if you don't, I'd argue it's worth buying for the soundtrack and aesthetic in-game. It's simply beautiful. Fully recommended."
,Recommended,235820,12927678,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,mrpizzacake,"When I first launched the game, I (as many others) noticed that you don't have direct control. I was a little dissapointed, but I still proceeded. And I'm glad I did. I like puzzles and challenges, and the puzzles in this game can be very hard. They wouldn't be with direct control, so I can see why the developer took away conventional controls, player sees the puzzle, thinks it's hard based on other games' controls, but when he/she tries to solve it, the controls come to play, and that's when it gets difficult. Along with unique controls, the game has cute, semi-realistic art style, and SO beautiful soundtrack. Music in games is under-rated in most AAA and big company games, but not in most indie games. And in this game, the soundtrack is so calming, relaxing, happy... Words cannot describe how wonderful soundtrack in this game is.So, not for people who don't like puzzles, and for some players it may get a little repetitive, but for people like me, it's one of te best games in past few years.97%"

The elements available are air, fire, stone, and ice, with the occasional water.The game eases you into increasingly difficult challenges that require use of all four elements. The catch is, you have a power meter of sorts, so timing and pre-planning are crucial if you need to switch elements in quick succession. The game never throws you into utterly impossible challenges, and if you feel that it has, just try, try again. Eventually, after enough trying, you'll have the ability to see how the obstacle is meant to be tackled, which is extremely helpful.Soundtrack: Each song is superb, and fits the level design perfectlyGraphics: Fun graphics, with an interesting style choice. The happy faces and semi-bright colors of the elements contrast perfectly with the dark shadows and sillouette of the terrain.Controls: Tight controls, with an easy learning curveOverall, Element4l is an extremely fun game, and is a joy to play for even the most casual of video game players. The controls are tight, and the challenges are never hair-pullingly difficult. The music of every level is unique, and works in harmony with the level design. Although, tii\ming and pre-planning are crucial, the game make is a bit easier with the little walkthroughs provided once the player fails enough times.

The concept is that instead of moving left, right, and jumping like in normal platformers you switch between four elements to navigate through levels, whether you need to go forward, fly a bit, or gain a little bit of weight.Not only does it have a nice concept, but the levels and music are butifully designed. The surrounding area adds a nice bit to the game, not very clearly marking where you go next (a good thing, by the way). There is only one soundtrack as far as I've played, but it's so long that I couldn't even tell that it was repeating constantly.Finally, the levels are ordered nicely. It never gives you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out due to previous shenanigans.  It gets harder and harder the farther you go, never dropping in difficulty. If you ever get stuck, you can always consult the 'help' button, and if you DO get stuck there are nice bits of text to lighten your rage levels.Anyone who has played the game can tell you it is a bit linear. There isn't much exploration (although there is still quite a bit if you want to get the lost soul thingies). This is only due to the control scheme, the makers couldn't have it many other ways.All in all, this is a game worth getting. I will admit, I'm not yet sure if it's worth ten dollars, but five bucks is definitley underpriced for this gem."

This game is all about moving forward.The controls seem a bit more fluid with the hidden 'easy mode' enabled, but altogether the main difference from the 4 elements is that they move you in different directions. There's little actual puzzling related to fire/air/ice/rock and it's more about awkward ice sliding around slopes.Occasionally you have to melt your ice on lava to become water to fit through gaps, or use rock to break apart thin walls, or become a bubble to float up updrafts, but the emphasis is more on the game's akward physics.Even with easy mode enabled, prepare to suffer huge setbacks when you just happen to accidentally hit a slope going the other direction, forcing you to backtrack or die so you can restart with fresh velocity, often losing whatever velocity you might've had from the area beforehand.You will find getting stopped by anything will render you useless. If you don't know what combos to use to traverse every next slope, which you won't on your first playthrough of course, you'll find your bubble bursting over and over.The best thing this game has going for it are the superb graphics and audio.Gameplay-wise, if you want to spend countless hours learning the maps to speedrun it or something, well, at least your videos will be enjoyable to me.Imo at the very least, the easy mode should be considered the norm, and what is normal should become a challenge mode.Maybe I was doing something wrong but there were times I'd be respawned next to an area I have to get past, and because of that, it was nearly impossible to build up momentum to get by because I was supposed to already have momentum from an area earlier in the game.Or I was just completely clueless about how to get through with the limited recharging."

The developers seem to have realised this though and have done a number of things to make the game more enjoyable:-extremely generous save points-easy mode energy bar-press H for help which becomes available after you have failed a puzzle a few timesDespite this, these changes cannot make up for the core problem which is the level design in the later levels which rival IWBTG and Eryi's action in annoyance and difficulty. The atmospheric immersion and fun with the unique mechanics of the game is eventually eroded entirely from the game thus demotivating the playing from finishing the game.To the developers: You can make a IWBTG type game that pays tribute to NES difficulty and you can make an atmospheric experimental 2D puzzle platformer.... but you cannot do both at the same time and your ratings shall now suffer for this mistake as an example for other indie developers to learn from."

Can't say that enough-Hard as balls, a real challenge-Pretty style-Quirky and hilarious dialougeDespite this, there's plenty of issues.Some of you might just think ""Oh he's just bad at the game"" and to some degree, you'd be right, but the problem with Element4l is that the very specific button requirements make it sometimes almost impossible to complete. Especially as the landscape often doesn't provide any clues. I honestly can't count the number of times I've clicked the help button, wondering why I'm not hitting a ramp properly only to be shown at I wasn't turning into a bubble for 0.24 seconds which was apparently pivotal to making it. Speaking of the ""help"", when you turn to the ""help"" section, it's usually less than helpful (ironically), and often displays an action that I actually found impossible to replicate, thus leaving me with no choice but to find my own solution. There is also a distinct lack of checkpoints, which I feel was an attempt to make the game ""harder"" although frankly it's just more fustrating to get through the majority of a complicated section only to die at the end have to do it all again, and overall, I honestly think the game would be far more enjoyable if it was much easier and had this really great sense of flow to it. Every time I even vaguely get the feeling that I'm getting into the rythm of the game, it's lost as I have to re-do the same section over and over until I want (and have) to hit my head against the wall in fustration.So as much as I love this game and plan on continuing to play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it, I honestly can't reccomend it....

,Recommended,235820,5579102,"Posted: 21 August, 2013",all,Zangorwarrior,"There's something about me that needs to be expressed to the point of absolution. I do love playing indie games. I have a passion when it comes to playing indie games. It reminds me that I am playing A GAME and why I appreciate gameplay mechanics introduced and developed throughout the progression of the game. It helps me give respect to indie game developers who put their hearts, minds and souls to perfectly creating immersive games that top AAA-budgeted games like Bioshock infinite and Batman: Arkham Asylum. Hell, almost HALF of my library is indie games! That's how much I am dedicated to them. No filler, no long tutorials, no QTE's, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, an indie game that gives you an experience. And this is one of them. Welcome to Elment4l.Element4l is a side-scrolling platformer developed by I-Illusions, their very first game to blend into the indie gaming community. This is a game where you control all 4 elements: air, ice, earth and fire. Your goal is to get all of the soulparts to complete the game. And that's the basis of the game. But with a game that comes with effort, level design is the top priority when it comes to Element4l. As the game progresses, it challenges you with different variaties of traps, obstacles and transports, especially towards the final 2 levels (which are a rage-quitter if you fully-learned the controls). For example, the lava can be used to your advantage if you are ice. You can melt and traverse through impossible crevices along the way. When you're fire, you can bounce off lava, provided you build up some momentum first. The game introduces to you those traps and obstacles not as a hindrance to the level design but in a way of helping you advance. So, quick-thinking is in order.The game has good adrenaline. In this game, you build up to an incredible amount of ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" speed and you can also reach insurmountable heights. Speed boosts help you go fast and steep, curved ramps help you to build some speed and height. The excitement of it is one of the things that I adore that helps keep this game unique and fresh.I do adore the way the game communicates to you while you're playing the game, as if having a conversation with you. most indie games tend to do that subtely with its artistry but no-one tends to notice and gets indelved into the gameplay.There are more things to add to a stunning, short stand-alone game. You can find Lost Dark Sparks, 2 of them hidden in each level and takes skill and patience to get to them. You can beat the levels in a short amount of time and get awarded with either a BRONZE flag, SILVER flag, or a GOLD flag. This game also has a ""Race Mode"", which means you can battle either your own ghosts and against other competitive ghosts at different levels in the Steam community.The only problem I have was the screen filter they decided to use for the game and I see almost EVERY SINGLE INDIE GAME USE IT and this is no exception. The game is forever buried in a crackling film grain effect that you can't turn off, which makes the game almost hard to make out if you're running at a small resolution. It almost ruins the scenery and almost jaunts the experience of the game. But, it's a minor problem, anyways.But apart from all that, there is no story, no exposition, nothing to pester your brain with tons of details or history to remember the game. This game is short in length (2 hours approx.), has simple and solid controls, appreciative level design (reminiscent of NightSky), lush and vibrant atmosphere, background and art design, all backed up by an amazing soundtrack by Mind Tree which makes you feel relaxed for hours, which can get for free by buying the game. A game such as this is hard to come around. Element4l is a world that I forvever get lost in, to appreciate the wonders and fantasy that surrounds me in a blissful and peaceful slumber. It's a one-time experience that won't waste your time, if you're really good at the game. Give this game a shot and you might be touched by what this game has to offer.8/10"

I like the art style, the music is lovely and it's a neat idea for a game. It is a little difficult, but that's intended and it's nowhere near as hard as Super Meat Boy.However for me there seem to be some underlying game logic bugs that frustrated me through out. Collision detection is inconsistent (walls vs energy occur at different distances), momentum is randomly lost on element change and it appears to sometimes suffer from input lag. For a game relying on precision movement, sometimes it isn't slick enough.When the game comes together it's very satisfying, I just wish I could trust it to do so."

You have four forms. Air(a bubble which pops if it touches anything but water) Ice (which melts into water sometimes) Fire (which bounces off lava but explodes if it touches anything else) and earth (the sturdiest but also heaviest). Using these different forms you need to float, bounce, slide, and smash your way through the obstacle course of good old mother nature to reach the lost element and save it. There isn't much of a storyline, but that really doesn't matter. This game doesn't need a storyline. Its simple and brilliant with the vague story it has that lets us, the player, compound it with our struggles as we push through level after level.Pros?It has amazing art that runs very smoothly. Its actually kind of relaxing. A far different experience than ESJ for sure with soothing colors and almost water color-esque landscapes. You won't find any dizzying sickness or seizure warnings here. The graphics are beautifully crafted and friendly and inviting. Perfect for winding down from a long day with.The soundtrack is completely unique and ten kinds of amazing, AND it comes FREE with the game, no extra purchases. The music tracks are all long fully fleshed out pieces and are also very soothing without being sleep inducing. They keep a fast pace while using soothing xylo sounds and fit in with the game completely, pulling you in and making you forget about the world outside for a bit.The gameplay? Fabulous. Its easy enough to get through a level, the question is, can you get through a level without dying, catch all the ""sparks"" and hit the finish line in a short enough time to get a gold medal? Thats the hard part. Even getting just one of those is the hard part to be honest. The game may have soothing graphics but don't take it lightly- it can still definitely be rage inducing at times. It IS a challenge.The game has a ton of replay value while you race through levels trying to beat your best time and find that one spark you missed, as well as a racing mode that is incredibly fun if you ever get bored of the solo levels.Cons?It tends to get a bit demeaning at times. After you die a few times in one place, I think the number may be as little as three, no matter what level you are on it will start prompting you to ask it for help so it can teach you how to do what it wants you to with a little ghost element for you to follow. This can feel particularly like its just mocking you if you are already doing what it suggests and just havn't quite got the right angle yet and are over shooting or under shooting or not gathering enough momentum.The levels are quite long for a platformer of this speed, and the save system unhelpful as if you leave and come back you will have entirely forgotten where you are going or how to get there. This is not something to play for a few minutes at a time.Going to be honest, the level design art is lovely. The cutscene art creeps me out a little bit. It might creep others out as well. Giving cells cute baby faces might not have been the best idea."
