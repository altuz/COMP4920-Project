Fun and easy to use as soon as you learn the basics.HOWEVER before buying it read this.RPG Maker XP is a younger version than the VX. Unlike the VX the XP does not have expensive DLCs.The RPG Maker XP comes with a bunch of sprites and sounds to enjoy as soon as you get it. A bit limited though.That is because the RPG Maker XP is a tool for the creative people, who make their own sprites, sounds etc.If you are a creative person with patience this could be the tool for you!Overall RPG Maker XP is hard to use at first BUT as soon as you get slightly used to the tools you will be greatly rewarded.Took me 2 hours to learn the basics. Note: I'm not the sharpest knife in the shed, so you will probobly et it way before I did.If you are still confused and fustrated there are many guides on the web that tells you how to use RPG Maker XP.Even small things that will be done will feel awesome for you.And BEST of all! You can share the games you make with your friends!As soon as you learn the basics you will be greatly rewarded and feel awesome about it and yourself. Take pride in your games. Tell your stories and let your tales grow far and wide with your friends.I give the RPG Maker XP a 10/10. It is very fun and easy to use. And the creative people have alot of space to challange themselves with.If you are not the creative person, or have creative friends I would recomend you buy the VX and some DLCs."

It's straight foward and has advanced coding for the more knowledgable users (which sadly I'm not one of them.) I have spent 9 hours so far on my game and am ust now getting the first quest arc finished (which is only maybe 15-30 minutes gameplay time depending on how well you play.)

My main example is that I had been working for probably a week and a half on a game and I was really feeling it. The game would be actually good. I booted up my computer, opened up RPG Maker XP, and suddenly I got an error and just lost all my work. That's probably an outlier of a situation.

As well as being simple and strpped back to basics, XP contains many of the features removed from VX and reintroduced into ACE due to user demands such as multiple tileset support.I pesonally find the larger, chunkier sprites used in XP highly preferable to the chibi style ones found in later incarnations, but this is just a personal preferance.Although you may find the user interface somewhat simplistic and less 'stylish' if you are used to that of Ace, its simplicity; as with all the RPG maker series helps it to be incredibly user friendly and useful.Overall anyone looking to make their own RPG should definately give XP a try."

I do reviews and rants and a slew of other things on the website along side a few others. Secondly, I have been playing RPG Maker for years in fact for almost twenty years. I had the first offical release on consoles, and have been playing the PC versions since the RPG Maker 2000 version. While 2003 is actually my faveorite due to the art style being older it doesn't mean I don't like the newer ones or fail to see their potential.On to RPG Maker XP I have to say right here: I recommend this version to anyone. In RPG Maker XP there are some things that have been ""lost"" to the user that where in the 2000/2003 versions but they are minimal and if you never used them you won't know. XP is a bit easier to use and is ultimately more customizable via script editing of which you can find already made online for free (you may need to credit the coders). Which means some of the stuff ""lost"" from the older versions such as the Final Fantasy (and other J-rpg's ) style combat system will be able to be brought back in as well as numerous other features that one can add to customize. In addition to scripting like always you don't have to use their reosurces of characters and chipsets and music you can (since RPM2k) import and use other resources.While Enterbrain/Dedjica has newer version(s) out [ RPG Maker VX, and VX Ace] XP is a version that sits right in a band of popularity coupled with useability. It being popular and easy to use coupled with it's age allows this software to exist and be supported for a long time. Due to its age extra resources such as sprites, and scripting are widely available allowing for a variety of rpg styles. Just ask for the rights and availablity of usage of those extra resources. Some creators/coders allow their work for only non-commercial games others allow for commerical usage so long as they are properly attrbuted.For me most of the things I disliked were the differences between this version, and the older versions of which I had extensively used. Like anything familar and then moving on is diffcult I honestly can't think of anything nesscarily bad about this version especially now when it has been out for so long. It improved upon the standards of the software which have been out for two and a half decades and became more useful by offering even more choice to the maker. If you can't code, well then you can still make a game... I think thats why I have always liked RPG Maker and the software in the series.If you are into RPG's and you wish to try and make one or make a game RPG Maker is a good place to start!If you want more reviews like this and longer or other topics related to gaming, then please Checkout{LINK REMOVED}TheONSGaming.com!"

First of all, most of the engine's Ruby source code is directly editable, meaning your only limit is your coding skills.  Second, and this applies to all RPG Makers, if you provide all original art, your game won't look like an RPG Maker game (especially if you tweak the UI and systems a bit.)  However, while I do think RPG Maker XP stands on it's own, I would recommend everyone starting new projects to use RPG Maker MV instead, since it can target many more platforms and uses Javascript instead of Ruby."

The size of the sprites is directly proportional to the size of the image, so if you want a taller character he'll be taller ingame.This is not a magical game maker, they've done the programming. It's up to you to make the game. Triggers, story, characters, all yours. While plenty of content is provided right of the bat, I prefer to create my own images and music. This can either be done in menu, or simply by moving files into the appropriate folders.If you've used level editors, you should be able to flow comfortably into the interface and you can do almost anything, however this has no option for cutscenes. That being said, reasonable quality images can be imported (640x480 or less) Nothing you make will ever be graphically impressive, but it's really not the point. If I'm correct the amazing title ""To the Moon"" was made using this software.The item/character customization is pretty much complete, I was actually able to create an accessible book using dialogue chains. Heck, you could even write a ""Choose your own adventure"" with the dialogue chains. Every stat is alterable as well, even the amount of experience required to level up. If you want to be in depth enough, fight animations and sounds can be replaced.Just bare in mind, there is nothing casual about this process, it is time consuming, but if it's your thing, it's time well spent."

It is a neat little software that I can really get into but I feel as if the reviews are a little misleading.First off there is a definite learning curve and I'm only just now getting used to how the system works. There are claims of an extensive library of sprites and customize options but in reality it is fairly limited and color change options are based on completely changing the hue of the sprite. I hope to find more sprites to download and incorporate into the game from the community.There are also claims of an intuitive interface...Microsoft Paint is more intuitive than RPG Maker XP. With that said it gives you everything you need (with the exception of buttons like redo etc.) I'm still working on events and transitions but it does seem to require at least basic knowledge of how AI and events work.6/10 Would spend a hour and a half attempting to make a quaint house for the Demon Gunner Giovanni again.

It comes with the BEST runtime pack out of ANY RPG creation software, which you can use for free, which is another thing;You can publish pretty much anything you make with this, on the Workshop or even on Greenlight, and you'll never even have to pay royalties to Degica.Also, the charachters are very nice, but that's just my opinion. I have and use XP, and VX Ace, but I feel as if the characters in XP look much better. VX Ace uses chibi sprites, but XP uses taller, more proportionate ones. You can also import your own sprites, tilesets, scripts, sound effects, music, and just about any other audio or graphic you'd need.If you don't make graphics or music, there's also many free ones just a good search away.It is great for begginers because there isn't much to learn. However, there is some stuff to learn, which is a con;Learning RGSS really is a pain, and mapping can be too if you've never used a different RPG Maker before. That's the only place though where I feel like VX Ace is better.Final Verdict:If you have the desire, will, and patience to make a game, absolutley go for it.

The community for RPG VX is cleary much larger and more experienced, but the one for XP still dcoes the job it needs to and helps a newbie get off their feet in the software.A plus is that this software is much cheaper than many others out there, including VX Ace, so If you're planning on having multiple people work on a project at the same time, this is a much cheaper way to do it.The program already comes with every tileset, character, in game song, and graphic you'll need to make the world you've always wanted. But, its very easy to create and import your own graphics, songs, characters, and every control scheme.I hope if you decide to get this software that you'll enjoy it. To me, it was A LOT easier than Unreal or Unity, and the language the engine is written in is easy to learn even though it may not be the standard.
