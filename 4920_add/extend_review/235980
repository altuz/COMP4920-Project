For those whom played blocks that matter and didn't like the platforming aspect, don't worry, this doesn't have any platforming to speak of. The only related things in the game are the characters and the use of blocks.The game actually controls through point and click mechanics, moving your character from place to place through just clicking there. The games main focus is using a combination of different blocks which interact with eachother in different ways, in orde to solve a puzzle. Placing blocks involves you shooting them out instead of using the tetronimo mechanic from the last one. Each block has specific functions hinted to ingame once you find them. The game constantly throws new block types at you, as well as special new funtions, mixing things up. They continued to throw new mechanics all the way to the end of the game, and all of them felt well implemented.You're main objectives in a level consist of two things; getting to the end, and collecting the memory blocks. You can beat a level without getting all chips, but in order to progress to certain stages, you'll need to obtain the memory blocks. You'll also need to 100% a section to unlock the bonus stage for keys to the small boss puzzle stages (using the term ""boss"" lightly, as it is really a series of puzzles).The game features no way to die, and if you do mess up a puzzle, there is always an undo button to push things back to where you need them in an instant. The game never felt tedious or boring; always throwing new ideas and puzzles types your way. The puzzles, while challenging, never felt too easy, or too hard. The game also never feels the need to hold your hand at any given point.The only flaw that I can think of is that there is a bonus challenge later in the game which requires knowledge of the konami code, but it's not required, and is overall a terribly minor flaw on an otherwise great puzzle game.To me it was worth every single cent. If you are even remotely into puzzle games, I highly reccomend it."

What sets this apart from other games - i.e. why this shouldn't just be left on Kongregate/Newgrounds - is the lack of chaos in the puzzle design. If you know how to do something, then it will work every time, which is the mark of great puzzle design. Couple that with the fact that all the puzzles make sense, make you scratch your head and bang it against the wall, and leave you with the assurance that you *understood* why you did all the things that you did, and this is well worth not just your money, but also your time."
,Recommended,235980,11370374,"Posted: 22 July, 2014",all,Aetoss,"I think that this is a great puzzle game until you're about 60% of the way through when they introduce more timing elements into the solutions.  The timing detracts from the game in my opinion, up until then if you understood how to solve something you could solve it in one or two tries.  Once the timing got involved however the 'undo' button was used a lot.  It's very frustrating understanding how to solve a puzzle and having trouble executing that solution.Another thing to keep in mind which may have an effect of your enjoyment of this game is that if you intend on getting all of the brick pieces (which are the bonus objectives) you may end up undoing a lot of your work in any given level.  The reason behind why you would undo your previous solution is that it may not have been ideal, meaning that you could have saved a block or two which would allow you to get a brick piece.  I'm not sure how I personally feel about it since this is something that has provided me with enjoyment and frustration at different times.  One of my level designer friends really liked this aspect of the game though.That being said, I think that the basic mechanics of how the blocks work in relation to each other is very intriguing and leads to a lot of interesting puzzles.  The art is sleek, the music is charming; it feels cohesive.I recommendTetrobot and Co.to anyone who loves puzzle games.  The first half is definitely worth your time and depending on your preferences you might like the second half too."
,Recommended,235980,33105401,Posted: 1 July,all,TheDContinuum,"This is an extremely fun and challenging puzzle game!You play as an adorable little robot, but don't let the cuteness fool you, because this isn't a kid-level puzzler! There are some extremely challenging puzzles in the game for even the hardcore fan. Your powers allow you to pick up (most) blocks of all different types. Wood blocks can be set on fire, ice blocks can be turned into clouds (which can then be pushed by fans), sand blocks can be turned to glass (which allows lasers to pass through them), sticky blocks, etc. The game is broken into different themes (fire, ice, water, etc), and each theme is broken down into 6 levels, and each level has 3 collectibles that can be found during the level or as side puzzles. If you collect all of these, you get a bonus level at the end, which leads to some bonus content online (game art, mostly). All of the things you learn throughout the game continuously build on themselves for some insane puzzles later on.Pros:+Cute art+Great soundtrack!+Great difficulty curve in puzzles. You can almost always finish a level without finding all the collectibles, for a softcore mode. Ideas build on themselves and new ideas are introduced solo before combining with old tricks for new challenges. There are some REALLY challenging puzzles, but they're further into the game, where you'd expect them to be. A lot of times solutions for previous puzzles you couldn't finish will become trivial after you've learned a new trick later.+Wide variety of puzzles, since there are so many different mechanics to play around with. There's more maze-type puzzles, resource-management puzzles, and a lot of spatial reasoning ones that force you to work in a less-than-ideal area.+Length: I got 26 hours to 100% completion, but I REALLY, REALLY spent a lot of time on some because I was determined to figure them out with cheating, so definitely worth the money.Cons:- I don't consider this a con, but it might be for some people: There are some VERY tough puzzles. I had to look up about 5 hints after spending perhaps an hour banging my head against the wall on my own. There was only one solution that was like, ""What the hell?"" because it involved extremely precise timing and it was hard to do that with a mouse and seemed more geared to a controller. The rest of the puzzles, however, were hard, but when I saw the solution, I said, ""Well, DUH!"" and felt like an idiot for not thinking of it.Overall: 9/10. Money well spent. The puzzles are so intricate and have so many parts to them that I can see myself replaying this in a year when I've forgotten the solutions."

Morusque's soundtrack is great and manages the challenge all puzzle games face, which is to produce tracks that are enjoyable to listen to on a loop, and avoid being tedious or formless.  The puzzles themselves are challenging and require some thought but never rely on obtuse jumps in logic, and game mechanics are introduced gradually and with some fun.As for the gameplay itself, you pilot psychobot, a nano-sized repair bot, through damaged tetrobots in order to restore the larger robots to working order.  Piloting is achieved through pointing & clicking where you'd like psychobot to fly to.  Psychobot can vacuum up blocks of varying sorts in direct line of sight, and fire them as projectiles along the same path (subject to any environmental hazards that might intercept a block).  Blocks themselves are subject to gravity, and stick to like blocks, and it's through these mechanisms that many of the puzzles are crafted."

,Recommended,235980,15298527,"Posted: 10 April, 2015",all,Jonman[GWJ],"Do you like puzzles that look simplistic on the surface but upon closer inspection turn out to be brain-fartingly devilish, but when you finally figure them out, you have no option but to self-facepalm because it took you so long?Well boy howdy, is this a game for you.The simplicity lies in the controls - click the mouse where you want to go. The devilry comes in the form of a progression in puzzle complexity that is both smooth, gradual and fierce. A lot of the fierceness lies in wait for the completionists among us - the real tricksy puzzles only rear their gnarly heads when you're trying to collect all 3 of the ""bonus"" items in each level. While these items are used to unlock further sets of levels, you can get by without collecting them all. At least to begin with.The puzzles themselves mirror the simple/complex nature of the game design. At first, it feels like the only thing you can do will be the solution, but before long, you're looking at a myriad of possibilities, most of which are wrong, many of which will prevent you from being able to collect all three of the bonus items, and one of which is correct.Good news though, the game has a neat ""rewind"" feature, allowing you step back move-by-move, which removes any penalty for experimentation. It's a very smart inclusion, as without it, the game would be a frustrating maelstrom of restarts, but with, allows freeform exploration and an infinite amount of spaghetti for you to throw at the wall.Highly recommended for those that like a game to challenge their brains more than their fingers."

The aim of the game is that you control a tiny robot who can consume blocks and throw them out to trigger switchesmnake tetris pieces and so on. There are a ton of mechanics in the game and each block has different properties the jelly block sticking to walls,the wood block burning and some blocks also are converted with appropriate inputs like lasers an example being ice block converst to cloud. The puzzles becoming increasingly complicated over the levels and you need to collect golden blocks which are hidden in some hard to reach and interesting puzzles. The main problem with this game is that the screen scrolls over and in some puzzles you need to remember what happened in the previous rooms.This is done for the golden blocks in particular and can become tedious as you need to save up previous blocks and you come to know only after you have reached the spot.There is an infinite undo button which is good as well as demarkers which give you an hint of the puzzles areas and which are also cleverly used. I used the walkthrough for about 8-10 golden blocks due to the stage scrolling mechanic but these levels are far and few between and you need not collect all the golden blocks to proceed but there seem to be a set of stages if you collect all.There are some boss fights in between which are simply forming shapes with the blocks using the various block properties.The biggest gripe I had with this game is that there are just too many mechanics and too many block properties which show up suddenly in some puzzles and unless you have a good memory remebering those things and using them becomes difficult. They should have limited the number of blocks and properties. this is point and click game so no platforming at all. The puzzles also involve a bit of trial and error to understand and recollect the blocks properties and interaction with other blocks. This is a game for the patient gamer, when in full flow you will breeze through the level when not you would be road blocked. I played this game over a week as I got stumped after some time and had to rest before trying again. Overall a very nice puzzle game which needs a good amount of patience and redoing once the level is completed so that you can collect all the golden blocks."

Where the original had slippery, floaty platform controls, this game has precise click-based grid movements. While many puzzles in the first game depended on you not only solving the problem at hand but also pulling off difficult platforming maneuvers, this game has gone the pure-puzzle route. Heck, even the story (which doesn't matter much in either game) is better in this one, for what it's worth. Basically, every complaint I ever had about the original Blocks that Matter has been fixed in this sequel.I also have to make special mention of the soundtrack: while I really enjoyed the original game's chippy blippy soundrtrack, this game takes it in a completely different ambient direction, and actually really, really pleasant to listen to. For several days after finishing the game I had the soundtrack on during work.As a final note, I played this game on a Surface Pro 2 (aka a touchscreen computer) and it played very well! There was only one mechanic that was a little awkward on touchscreen, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked out, since I've found that in a lot of games, touchscreen controls do not always work for mouse controls like you'd expect."

It's a puzzle game and has very simple controls (just click the left mouse button) but some of the levels really make you think. You control a little robot, you move by left clicking on a square. Using this robot you travel through various rooms in a given level searching for the end portal. As you explore the level you may find different blocks (wood, sand, stone, sticky jelly) which each have different properties and can react differently in various situations. For example, if you let a laser or fire get near a wood block it will burn and be destroyed, but a sand block turns to glass. In most levels you need to try and conserve as many blocks as you can.Of course getting to the end portal on each level usually isn't very difficult. However there are three gold coloured blocks on each level, and obtaining all three of those and then getting to the end portal can lead you into some fiendishly brain-teasing logistical puzzles to think your way through. If you sit and think long and hard enough, nothing is beyond your grasp to figure out. If you get frustrated enough (or completely stuck) there is a brilliant guide with a video for how to complete every level, but it's very satisfying to solve everything for yourself (and if you look at a video you'll feel like hitting your head against the wall thinking ""it was so obvious, why didn't I see that"").Give your brain some gentle exercise with this charming, fun, and non-violent game."

Very nice level design, some of the puzzles are hard, but overall, the difficulty is not insane. Give it a try,"

There's nothing mindblowing or gimmicky about it, but the puzzles are all pretty satisfying... I felt the difficulty curve was just right (except for a few too easy bits near at the end), so I always felt good about myself when I solved a puzzle, but never got hugely frustrated. There can be a bit of annoying repeating of puzzles, but only if you're a completionist and don't solve them the first time through. I LIKED IT YAY."

You are a small robot travelling in the game world, and you have to use different objects and switches to unlock gates and progress further. Rules are quite simple, but you have to think many steps ahead to solve all puzzles. One mistake - and you may block your further progress. UNDO option is always available, which is nice.Hard, but solvable, took me 22 hours to complete for 100%."

76561198231874740,Recommended,235980,34039089,Posted: 5 August,all,Gatebase,"I bought this game as part of a Steam bundle and didn't expect much. Boy, was I wrong!It's a smart, charming and addictive game of environmental block puzzles. It features a wide array of diverse mechanics with the levels never getting old or stale since almost all of them provide unique challenges. Nothing is explained explicitly, but the learning curve is very managable, even fun, since the game's infinite ""undo"" button encourages experimentation. You can always go back to before you screwed up or got stuck without losing progress. In terms of gameplay I've gotten frustrated only once for an optional achievement (a very hard sequence at the end of a level and each time you only get one shot before having to redo the whole level), which says a lot compared to most other puzzle games.So the puzzling aspect is rock solid. The story felt a bit tacked-on, but is kind of charming. I'm a little less happy about some controls and UI stuff: There are weird hidden cooldowns after movement before you can issue block commands. If you click too quickly the game interprets the input as another movement command which can get a bit frustrating after a while. Admittedly it's a pretty minor gripe. More annoying is that the devs somehow thought it was a good idea to put the robot into a ""sleep"" mode after a few seconds without inputs, which plays an endless loop of a really awful ""snoring"" noise. But usually when I'm not issuing commands I want silence, because I'm deep in thoughts and racking my brain about a difficult puzzle. That noise really ground my gears several times! The menus were rather cumbersome, with seveal clicks and transitions just to get to the level where you last left the game. Not a big fan of the page-flipping design choice for the unlockables as well (especially since it always starts on the first page, not the last unlocked). The game also didn't feel well optimized for my hardware - I could barely browse after minimizing it, which usually isn't a problem with other games.So while I do have a few minor gripes, over-all I'm still very happy with my purchase. There's a lot of fun content (~14 hours for all achievements) with many neat mechanics for a very fair price. And I haven't even checkedout the workshop content!"

Some levels are easy to finish, but not easy at all to get the 100% achievement completion - just like it is supposed to be.Also a great game to play with a friend, since there are plenty of opportunities to get stuck and think for a bit.10/10"
