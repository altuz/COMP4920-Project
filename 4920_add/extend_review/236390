,Not Recommended,236390,29497833,Posted: 26 January,all,Deadly,"An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant.Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating.The game is in a terrible state at the moment, and I don't see Gaijin turning anything around anytime soon. The whopping drop in playerbase over the last year (or even months) says a lot."

How they treat their community contributors however is unforgivable.  Uninstalled, and closed/canceled my account with them.   In doing so I left behind all the planes and tanks I'd earned whether they were bought with lions, eagles, or earned in events.  Any time I think of starting a new account I just look back to when they practically ordered their forum members to put copyright strikes against any contributor who reports and proves that hacking is going on in their games.  Speaking as a player who has been pilot sniped from 7km away and through a mountain, I find what they've done to be reprehensible.  Lying afterwards and saying they didn't mean it like that is just plain hilarious.  Do I recommend this game?  No, I really can't bring my self to do that, if only because of how they treat people who support them."

76561198011736788,Not Recommended,236390,30235604,Posted: 27 February,all,JustTheTip,"619 hours as of this review.... I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to play as the Americans. If you want to munch on American tanks and planes, then by all means give it a try.Pros- graphics- realistic tank/plane models- solid maps- good gameplay mechanics- free (kinda)Cons- absolutely no balance between nations (Germans and Russians are clearly superior in almost every way)- the grind for new vehicles is insane once you reach mid tiers- People who pay for premium vehicles have a massive advantage over the people who actually do the grinding- Can make you want to break your keyboard in halfAt first, War Thunder is an extremely fun game, looks great, plays great. I play primarily as the Americans (both Air and Ground), although i have spent a good bit of time playing as British planes, and German tanks. After spending a lot of time on this game, and getting past the first couple tiers of vehicles, you start realizing that Russian aircraft are performing physic defying manuevers, and German and Russian tanks are massively superior to their American and British counterparts. I had a load of fun with this game at first, but after putting a lot of time and effort (and a little of my money, because the grind was way too difficult without it) I have to say that I am deeply dissapointed with where this game led me.Basically, if you want to play as German or Soviet's, you will have a blast munching on the squishy American and British tanks, and sluggish American planes. I would love to give this a Thumbs up, because I have put so many hours into it and had a some fun for awhile, but due to the imbalance of the rosters, I cannot say that I am currently happy with this game."
76561197986186489,Not Recommended,236390,29924492,Posted: 14 February,all,Chuck Finley,"Bottom Line Up Front: The only reasons to play this game are A) Because it's the only one of its kind (slightly more realistic than World of Tanks) and B) You suffer from crippling deppresion.In either case the grind will make you wish for the sweet release of death. I can't properly explain how bad the grind is because no matter what I say you'll fly through the first few tiers thinking I'm a liar. By the time you've realized your mistake you'll have invested so much time into the game that you'll continue on regardless. Once you reach the King Tiger/M26/IS-2 it will take approximately 90 games to research a fire extinguisher. I don't know how many it would take to research spare parts (to repair a thrown track/damaged gun etc.) though it will be significantly less. The grind gets worse than that but I haven't made it any farther.Anyone who's already played this game will be thinking about the fact that I haven't mentioned aircraft in War Thunder, which is significantly kinder on the grind portion of things. The reason for this is because of rudder wobble, and issue that exsists only with joysticks (google warthunder rudder wobble and take note of the age/frequency of posts). For reference imagine pushing the nose to the right, releasing pressure and having the nose go to the left in an equal and opposite fashion. Note that from an input point of view I've effectively gone from +100 to 0. The supposed solution to this is to reduce your sensitvity to as near 0 as possible and to reiterate this isn't an issue mouse/keyboard users suffer from.In closing I'll desperately ask you, the reader to avoid this game for the safety of your mind. Regardless, as I mentioned this is the only game on the market to reward so heavily careful and well through out aim via it's damage model. Even so it's attempt at realism is hampered by terrible hit registration and lack of important concepts such as spalling/smoke/overmatching.P.S. It was found once that (at a coding level) Russian shells were better than any other nation at the same caliber. Shocker."

So i decided to give some of the games compeitiors a go (wows, wot ect). I played alot of that before returning to warthunder to try again and was greeted with a new line of tanks. I gave these a go but i couldnt shake that nagging feeling of discontent with the game. It was mostly small things such as the really buggy tank physics which havent changed at all in the 5-6 months i was away, the fact that players with lower settings were at an advantage ect. I would recomed staying away, especially the tank side of things.TL/DR; took a break from game to come back and remember why i took a break."

First of all, ive been playing the game for a couple of years now, and it was amazing, the vehicles, the physics, the maps, everything, but suddenly, the game become a ""pay to win"" game, since premium vehicles are SO op. The vehicles research is ridiculous, because it takes really a long time to be able to get a new plane or tank, and now, you can face a 50's or 60's tank with SABOT rounds, while you're driving a 40's tank (c'on guys), i wont even get to the ""Russian Bias"" part, cause seems that gaijin still haven't overcome the cold war. But the WORST part in this once great game, is that you will get uptiered EVERY SINGLE GAME, no kidding, i've got uptiered at every game for the past 2 days, my top tank is 5.7, still im facing 6.7 tanks or higer.... So i won't recomend the game, untill gaijin stops thinking only about money, and starts to think a little about the many issues that the game have.... Thanks for reading it."

As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.The matchmaking system depends on two things.1 - Tier of the plane2 - Battle Ranking of the planeIf you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.TL;DRThe Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking."

No matter which tier of tanks I'm in,  at least half of the tanks are the next tier which a majority of them my tanks barely damage while they can 1 hit mine and destroy them. I was in tier 2 with 5 tanks to choose from. I was fighting tier 3 tanks the majority of the time. Finally I managed to get 3 tier 3 tanks and when I go to battle I'm fighting tier 4 tanks. There has been many times where I've hit the other tank 7 or 8 times and not crippling it. If you cant get kills you cant advance your tanks hardly at all."

Even though sometimes the so called ""Russian Bias"" kinda appeared, it doesn't really matter because every nation got their own ""Biased"" vehicles such as Americans with the T95's super armor and T29's super gun, Germans with the Tiger II and Panther II's gun, Soviets with almost everything, British with their Centurion and Chieftain high penetration gun, and also the new japanese Type 60's super gun and Ho-Ro massive shell-No health bars, just actual damage model so as long you got at least 2 crew members alive, you can still fight-1 Shot kills, in air battles this can be done with rockets, high caliber cannons or shooting the pilot and in tank battles this can be done just by simply shot the ammo racks or fuel tanks of the tanks or even killing the whole crew with the explosion of the shell or shrapnel-Constant updates, every update fixes the bugs in the game and always include improving the stability of the client. Major updates are full of new vehicles, system improvement, new sound effects and many more-Tons of vehicle to choose from 5 nations (+500 aircraft, +300 ground vehicles, and the new boats which is currently in closed beta)-Very large map especially for air battles-Nothing is impossible, you can get everything in the game by just playing because everything is unlockable except for premium stuffs, but you can still get them from warbonds and events.-You can earn Golden Eagles from participating in an event such as monthly skin, art, and screenshot contest in the forum or simply use your Golden Eagles wager that can give you up to 1500 GE if you're lucky enough to finish the mission (kill 3 or 5 enemies) and won the battle.CONS:-Sometimes there are trolls who will teamkill you or other person in the game for no reason (mostly in air AB)-The grind is kinda harsh but for a free game this doesn't really matter-Bugs still exist but the War Thunder team are constantly fixing this issuesI guess that's all I can say about this game, I give this game 9/10"

While most people complain about Gaijins seemingly 'infinite' wisdom, I will skip past it like the last time you skipped class and get to the point. The game is well done. The physics are pretty damn good. The models are well done. We seem to ask simple things of them, but guys, you have to remember, keeping a game like this running is neither cheap nor quick, it is very slow and very expensive. But Gaijin does their best, in my opinion.Part two is about the in game experiences.IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW YOU PLAY. If you are a guy who likes heavy tanks, of course you gonna think Japanese, British and American tanks are bad. If you a guy who just like to go balls deep mode and pray for the best, America all the way. As stated its all in how you play.

My main thing I'd say now is - I feel like it was more predictable back then than it is now. Don't get me wrong I love the game, but jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ there are times I wish another genocide would occur. The lack of team play this game holds makes you wish you had autism just so you could have an excuse to be helped. You can call out all you want but the ♥♥♥♥s will just sit there and only pay attention to their RP gain. That's another thing, especially if you want to play tanks: RP, without a premium vehicle and premium account, you are gonna spend days to months working on one (high tier) tank. The AF RP gain is said to be the same as GF RP gain, but it isn't. You can get 15 kills in GF and come home with 3.7k RP if you have a prem vehicle and account, with some considerable amount of luck as well. In AF you can get 3 kills, with prem plane and account, get 20k RP. Which is damn nice when you do! Also, if you want historical accuracy, maybe not the game for you, you don't face things on the same year or time they fought, but on a BR system, which, over the years has been compressed more than enough times. Hell, we used to have 20 tiers, down to 5, with more and more folders coming up along with BR adjustments that make somethings just stupid to face. I'd still call the MM better than WoT's as well as overall feel, more realistic, even in arcade.Also, there is no ♥♥♥♥ing Russian Bias, it's a joke made back in the day, and half brain players who couldn't play for♥♥♥♥♥♥made it their excuse. The way people call something ""OP"" is overused and saturated to the point you'd be better off living a sunken wooden titanic, than anything those ♥♥♥♥♥ say. It's just an excuse to lay blame for their bad play.Over all - 7/10 at the current version, 8.5/10 back in closed beta, good times then, now it's saturated in what seems to be a overtried attempt at pleasing all parties of the game. Also, feedback from Gaijin seems pretty good, and don't get me wrong, it has improved extremely, but it's far from perfect."

76561198008126350,Recommended,236390,29707076,Posted: 4 February,all,normycameron,"I am speaking only for the ground forces combat here, as I have less experience in the air combat modes. I started playing a few months ago. The game is insanely addictive and very fun to play. Yes, it takes time and effort to unlock the higher tier tanks (Don't be expecting to get the Tiger on the first day), but the grind to unlock new tanks is both fun and rewarding. Every kill on this game feels like a real achievement, made all the sweeter by an x-ray vision animation of your round penetrating the enemy tank, showing the damage that you cause to the enemy tank.The tank models themselves are beautiful and extremely well detailed. The armour is modeled to be as realistic as possible, meaning that armour thickness and sloping provide realistic protection from different types of shells. This means that certain shells may not even be able to do any damage to a tank (eg. A stuart tanks 37mm gun cannot penetrate the frontal armour of a Tiger I, even at point blank range). Armour can also be angled to increase its effectiveness, but this method varies on the model of the tank.From my experience I have played mainly as the British, Germans and Soviets. Every nation has its advantages and disadvantages over others allowing for different tactics to be used.For example, at tier 3:Russian tanks make heavy use of sloped armour and have a wide range of powerful ammunition to choose from, but most of their tanks suffer from poor gun depression, which means that firing down from a hill can be difficult. The T34s are also extremely mobile, meaning they will usually be the first tank you face in a battle. They are also backed up by heavy KV-1s and 2s and a variety of powerful self propelled guns making the Russians an extremely aggressive country to play.German tanks generally have very good gun depression and excellent mobility. The Tiger tank provides long range firepower and excellent armour alongside very high mobility and good speed. Meanwhile, you have an excellent selection of self propelled guns, such as the Panzer IV/70 or the Dicker Max. I have found the armour on German tanks at this tier to be less reliable than the Russians, but the power of the guns more than make up for it, especially at longer range. Their tanks are great in offensive and defensive situations.The British are much more of a challenge to play. Their tanks range from extremely fast medium tanks such as the Cromwell I, which can flank enemies and hit their vulnerable sides, to the slow and cumbersome Chruchhill, which boasts very heavy armour. The biggest weakness of the British tanks is the lack of explosive filler in the shells, which means that damage after you penetrate an enemy tank is poor. You may penetrate the armour, but you might only do minor damage to the tanks. It requires you to know exactly where to hit enemy tanks to cause maximum damage. Also, the widely used cromwell chassis, though extremely fast, as very poor reverse speed, meaning that getting out of a sticky situation can be difficult. I have found that the British become very fustrating to play as you progress in the game, though I hear the tanks get more powerful after tier 3.There is so much flesh to this game, with each team requiring different tactics and adaptations. I am seriously enjoying it, and no, it's not pay to win. Anyone who thinks so is either impatient and just not very good at the game. There are micro transactions that help, but you can happily play this game without spending a penny."

,Recommended,236390,29486409,Posted: 25 January,all,Captain Jules,"I firstly want to mention that I'm only going to be talking about the aerial combat of the game, as I didn't play as tanks, nor would I ever want to.STUFF I LIKE:- The whole gameplay in general. Primarily, I like that when I get shot down, I can still save my plane. It doesn't really provide any insentive to do that, but it's still good fun nonetheless.- I know this is kinda little and stupid, but I feel like it needs to be said anyway. When someone gets shot down, their marker turns a kind of darker color, to symbolize that you shot the guy down, and no matter what, you got the ponts for it. However, some people (jerks), will chase after you, even after you are defeated, blowing your plane to pieces, just to be mean. The thing I like is that most people recognize that as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to do, and go after people who do that. It sort of makes you feel like the people who play the game have a sort of sense of honor, which is rare in most multiplayer games.- My last point brings me to this, which is a bigger point. Things like that last thing I mentioned show a good form of multiplayer teamwork. Saving a friend's life (or plane), and being saved later by them really make you feel like a part of a team. Mostly, people dont even talk to each other in War Thunder, but you still feel a genuine companionship with the people you play alongside because there are a lot of opportuinites to save other people, as well as to be saved.- I really like the community (for the most part). Nobody uses the chat, which makes it harder for people to be jerks, but it seems like pretty few people just play like jerks.- The matchmaking system is really good. I very rarely feel wildly outmatched or stacked against.- I really like the fact that you can actually see the enemies' names in game, so you can specifically target whoever shot you down. That's always good fun.STUFF I DON'T LIKE:- No game is perfect, and most of War Thunder's flaws lie in the funcitons of the game outside of actual gameplay.- I don't like the fact that in the realistic (competitive) game mode, you can't use more than one of your planes. I have like five planes active, I had to actually purchase a crew for each plane (which I assume included a living pilot), so why is it that I can only use one per match? After my first plane gets shot down, shouldn't I be able to use one of my other four planes and crews in the same match so that I didn't just take off, get to altitude, find someone to kill, and get shot down all for ♥♥♥♥ing nothing? Shouldn't I be given a chance to learn from my mistakes instead of being forced to leave the game and just go back to casual because competitive doesn't offer a worthwhile reward, nor does it offer any fun at all? This is a HUGE problem, as it basically insentivizes you to NOT play the competitive multiplayer mode because I only get to play it for like 30 seconds before I have to leave the game because I died and didn't get another chance. Also, it takes all the strategy out of choosing what order to use your planes in. In the casual mode, you get to choose what planes and what order to use them in, which truly does have a strategic aspect, but this giant design flaw totally takes that all away.- I feel like the concept of landing the plane after getting shot down should be a little more complicated. Like maybe, if you get shot down, but your plane is not destroyed, maybe it gets fixed a little quicker. I don't know, it just seems like there's not enough to it, and there's a lot of missed opportunity to have more cool features there.That's about it. Well, that's it as far as aerial combat, but I feel like that's the main function of the game. It's all good fun, and in spite of my complaints, you just can't argue with the fact that at the end of the day, it's just a good time to play War Thunder."

,Not Recommended,236390,30069586,Posted: 20 February,all,TheFamousChrisA,"Don't let my total hours played feel you, before this came to Steam I played a ridiculous amount of this game, profile is Hrethgir if you want to add me, sometimes I need friends to enjoy this game more.  There are some days you'll play the game and jump in to either tank or plane arcade battles and get shot once and die instantly anywhere you go.  Other days you'll do a lot better.  This game does a horrible job explaining anything that you really need to know when it comes to being a good fighter pilot or a tank commander and sometimes it's a fun fun ride.  Others it's just really frusterating.The main problem with this game and I see other people still complaining about it is the ridiculous grind that Gaijin implemented.  I figure they changed things to be this way because of how greedy they secretly are but back in the early early days of this game you could play a few hours or less and unlock a low tier plane (or even tank when they first came out).  I remember this is how I unlocked the majority of my planes back in early Beta years ago.  The game was very fun then and I can't exactly put my finger on why.  The planes just flew better and it was easier to shoot other people down and dodge their shots, now everything feels frusterating.  That's what this game can be summed up in in one word, Frusterating.  Now you must spend what feels like years of your life to unlock maybe half of the planes and tanks that are unlocked?  If you don't want to spend a ton of money that is.  Too bad this game doesn't make the Free to Play model more viable because I'd play way more if that were still the case.  Gaijin basically changed things so if you are serious about playing more than a few planes or ships you really need to give them money, and I'm sorry but with all the things they've done over the years I'm not giving them any money whatsoever.I used to really love Arcade or Realistic or even Simulator battles in using Planes until they made some fundamental changes to everything flies and feels and then I stopped for the most part because using a mouse and keyboard to fly and aim just became too frusterating when it used to be so much fun.  I don't know why things changed over time because they don't do a good enough job of explaining hey this is how you fly well and dogfight against other people if you want to win with this countries planes or this country.  I usually jump into tank mode in either Arcade or Realistic because it's way more enjoyable than World of Tanks for me, the graphics are pretty nice and the way the shells either bounce off armor or go straight through and hit the crew is a lot of fun.  What isn't fun is every once in a while every time you spawn and immediately see an enemy you'll get one shot and die instantly because there's either some kind of aimbot going around or some people just literally spend all day playing this game because it's Free 2 Play/Pay 2 Play (in a way).If you plan to not spend any money then be prepared to put a ridiculous amount of hours into this game.  I've been playing since early beta what seems like many years ago (all off of Steam so my hours played is very small on here) and after hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game I've still barely unlocked Tier 4 of both planes and tanks.It's unfortunate that the game used to be so much better back in the early days when the matchmaking and tier system was completely different but now it's based on a newer tier system with battle rankings for the vehicles that just don't make sense and it's made the game unfair and unfun to play most of the time.  Back when this game first came out it was incredibly fun but most of the time I just play a few games then realize why I stopped and delete it from my hard drive to save space for a different game.Granted I still enjoy this more than World of Tanks or any other plane fighter game but still, I wish Gaijin actually listened to their community instead of being one of the most frusterating game developers on the planet to deal with.  They really do try to add awesome new stuff into War Thunder but they do the stupidest things without asking what we the player wants just so I'm sure they can try and make more money.  Also if you want to have an unfair advantage always play as the Russians since they're just overall better in most respects.  That's because the developers are Russian and they have this obsession with Russia being better!  I guess that's kind of like us Americans being like AMERICA, ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!  But I find any kind of blind patriotism obnoxious as hell."

It's an endless grind and the different factions are absolutely unbalanced. I have even attempted the ""pay to win"" theory, spending hundreds of dollars to purchace golden eagles for premium account, raising crew skills, camo for tanks, premium tanks  but it was all a complete waste of money. If you like a game with balance between teams and fair play, this is NOT the one for you. Unless you pick one of two factions to play, Germany or Russia, you are going to lose and lose constantly. America and Britian are utterly worthless and that is due to the battle rating system. For example, everything in the game can and does one-shot kill you and it takes multiple shots for you to kill them, if you can live that long and know exactly where to shoot. It's purely dumb luck and chance - there's no such thing as tactical advantage. The graphics are what kept me playing for as long as I did, but the immense frustration after the majority of matches I finally decided to give it up. As for the ""single player content"", I tried that as well and it was horrible. You have to unlock the right vehicles to even attempt them and to unlock vehicles/planes you have to grind. Lastly, the ""mostly positive"" and ""very positive"" user reviews is very questionable. If this post even makes it to the review forum, I'll be astonished as it's my 2nd attempt.

76561198073761708,Recommended,236390,30129689,Posted: 23 February,all,j.m.armstrng,"*This is a tank centric review because that’s what I play most of the time.As WWII vehicle combat games go, this is really my only experience. Haven't played Word of Tanks, Warships, or whatever the airplane version is, so take that for what it's worth. That said, I haven't felt the need to look anywhere else, this game definitely scratches that itch for me. That said, it’s not perfect. My biggest gripe is matchmaking. It’s quite♥♥♥♥♥♥IMO. I believe the early matchmaking was set up when there weren’t as many vehicles in the game, and they were worried that there wouldn’t be enough people online to make games. The response was to set a rather wide spread of vehicle “Battle Rating” that would be able to fight together. The result is that you can often be in a game against enemies with armor you can’t punch through or whose guns can one-shot-kill you. Personally, I believe there are enough vehicles in the game and enough people playing currently that the matching making could be constrained a bit. Some other minor annoyances: it can a bit of a grind later on in the game to get the high-level vehicles, there could be a little more variety in game modes, or being able to choose the game modes/maps you want to play, and some countries’ vehicle trees aren’t as flushed out as others. Overall I think it’s a great game. For one, it’s free. Even if you don’t get hours of entertainment out of it like me, you won’t be out anything so it’s a safe bet. I’ll say that I do not have a premium account, nor do I buy any of the in-game extras for cash, but I don’t really feel like I’m missing any part of the main game. It’s not pay-to-win IMO, with camouflage being a possible exception, as it can give you an advantage in Realistic Battles (but I play arcade so it’s whatever). Using cash can help alleviate that grind, but again, that’s not pay-to-win. Realism is top notch with vehicles and weapons acting exactly like you’d expect. I don’t think you could find anything better out there that doesn’t sacrifice the fun factor. More stuff gets added all the time to keep things fresh, with Naval Vessels on the horizon. So yeah, solid recommend from me. I would buy this game if it cost $60 if included more of the premium stuff."
76561198098780753,Recommended,236390,29934650,Posted: 14 February,all,LFMG300,"Unfortunately Gajin has slowly turned this game from one of the best casual, realistic and free aircraft and tank games at release albeit with a slight Russian bias into a sneaky money grab and a blatant chance to bolster up the U.S and Russia's military. At first, planes and tanks were matched fairly so there were never strongly one sided fights but after many updates and purchase packs, allied vehicles and aircraft had become extremely over powered. More often than not updates would include very good U.S and Russian tanks or planes but would either fail to provide any German equivalent all together or would give some useless POS. On top of this, the unlock system for allied trees gives you much better vehicles and planes early on and therefore provide faster rewards to players. Most players end up defaulting to the Russian airforce or army strictly because they do not have to go through the time it takes to be rewarded in the German and Japanese airforce and army. Unless you are very good, you will have difficulty playing in arcade aircrat games in that over powered Russian planes will have even better performance due to the lack of physics. I suggest sticking to Realism mode for land and air because it is more of a test of skill rather than plane. Over all, I suggest the casual ww2 air and tank battle fan to try it out because its free but anyone more interested in realism should look towards a more simulation type game."

Once again, not sure if there was something wrong with my computer, but it made me hate the game even more.Finally, I think the game should have a campaign mode or something. All you do is play multiplayer with a bunch of people with way higher levels than you. I think that problem was with the game, putting me in a game with people that have higher levels than me.Those are just my thoughts on the game of my personal experience, you don't necessarily need to not install the game based on my experiences.

,Not Recommended,236390,29942582,Posted: 15 February,all,Mute,"War Thunder offers a great multiplayer experience of WW2/CW aerial and tank warfare. It has to be mentioned that visuals, gameplay and optimization are top notch. This game also features the best damage model I´ve encountered in a game of this sort. Hits and casualties are visualized with a unique picture-in-picture feedback which is very satisfying. Realistic and simulator mode are offered for people that look for the realistic fun which is a big pro.But if you want to experience the great fidelity WT offers but aren´t willing to tone down your graphics to Playstation 1 90s standard in order to stay ""competitive"" then expect to have a big spotting disadvantage and also prepare to get blasted trough foliage, smoke and even solid objects. I don´t like to shout ""hax!"" and I don´t know how bad or good really the cheating situation is in War Thunder but take a look at the very low vs high graphic comparsion screenshots or get a impression for yourself and you´ll understand how people are able to pull of those shots. It is great that Gaijin also gives the low spec players the ability to participate but low graphic settings should never give you an advantage. I really hope Gayjin will fix that.Also tank simulator fans may be disappointed that the tank warfare has not much to do with real tank operations. Many maps and objective placement force you to fight in tight places where everyone tries to ambush each other which unfortunately relies on heavy use of the 3p camera and gamey map marking. While this is of course fun I find the lack of big wide battlegrounds and real tank battles very frustrating. There are some maps that offer this experience but the community tend to avoid or dislike them because it takes too much time and patience for spotting and calculating a proper fire solution. Time that people want to spent with the grinding.Which bringes me to a big problem. This game suffers from horrible research points and silver lions grind from Tier 4 upwards even with premium account and boosting Talisman or premium vehicles. To all normal people that aren´t willing to spent their whole live on one game, that have careers, activites, sports, and social life to attend, be ready to wait a long time or to invest really big sums of money in order to see your favorite high tier tank in your garage.I´m okay with F2P games that ask you for some cash in order to save you time but this game has a absurd and greedy pricing. Monetization all over the place. Yeah die hard fans will tell you the grind isn´t that bad and paying money is not needed. Strangely most top tier players I´ve met have spent 200 - 300 dollars on average on this game for talismans, ingame currency, premium accounts, and vehicles.The described cons sadly leaves a very bad impression and is the reason why I´m not getting in love with this game and have to give a negative rating.To be fair it has to mentioned that there is at least no real pay to win in this game. You can purchase backup vehicles or buy camouflage objects but this has not much of an impact. More important is the fact that you can´t equip your vehicles with some premium boosters or powerful ammunitions for real money like in other games.I´ll recommend you to aim for your favourite Tier 2/3 vehicles which are unlocked in a reasonable amount of time. Stay with this tiers, they´re really fun - gameplay and tank-mix wise - and stop worrying about the grind and the tier 5 but play the objective and for fun."

So it seems you have to spend money on it to progress in the game otherwise it is a slow frustrating grind to progress to the higher tier vehicles.
76561197997960819,Not Recommended,236390,29556258,Posted: 28 January,all,Taggerinc,"Quick review:The good -it's free.graphics.vehicle variety.tank gameplay (in the lowest ranks)easy flight controls make basic flying accessible to anyone.The bad -Layer after layer of grinding.Seriously unbalanced vehicles in each tier.Poorly balanced match making that makes the game harder than it should be.Multiple ranking systems that affect gameplay difficulty that aren't explained in the game.No real explanation of how the huge number of  menus and options affect actual gameplay.Some minor and a few major game mechanics that break or ruin various portion of the game.You must learn important features of the game by trial and error or go to an external community encyclopedia.Long review:.....I have more than the 65 hrs play time indicated. (I had an external, non-steam, account as well.) I did not enjoy the game enough to continue playing after unlocking tier 2 equipment in either the tanks or planes. So my review is focused on the early game experience.Basic gameplay: Choose aviation or tanks, choose a country. Each country has five vehicle trees to choose from. The previous vehicle in that tree must be researched and purchased before you can move on the next vehicle in that tree. Each vehicle you wish to actually use has multiple components that must be leveled. Each country has multiple crews that must be leveled and trained in each vehicle you want them to operate. Aviation and tank crews are trained separately. Join random public battles to earn xp and level the above......If you choose one or two countries and select your vehicles wisely you can minimize the grind and still be effective. But the in-game statistics are misleading. You must go to the warthunder wiki to get accurate information about which vehicles are actually effective.Specific issues:ONE.....Air combat. ""Your pilot has been knocked out"" If you want to fly, get used to the idea that your pilot is the size of the kool-aid man and he's knocked out every time a random bullet comes anywhere near him......During air combat your plane may take no damage but your pilot is suddenly out. Sometimes you actually hear bullets whiz by or see tracers. But your plane is usually not taking any damage.......This wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen so often. You only get three planes per air battle and this happens once or twice every other battle. Imagine waiting in a queue to join a fight, choosing your best plane, and getting knocked out a few seconds into the fight by a random bullet. Then imagine that happening to two of your three planes in a single match. Sound like fun?.....I know you can kill a pilot. But this is arcade combat, it should take a measurable amount of damage to the plane to kill the pilot. The game suggests that you invest crew xp in vitality to reduce the frequency of this event. But crew xp points are hard to get when they die every other time they fly. The xp cost of each vitality boost is ridiculously high for the tiny benefit it bestows......This happened so often it ruined the entire aerial combat experience for me.TWO.....Getting pushed into higher tier matches with low tier vehicles. There are multiple ranking systems that affect what level of opponents the random battle will pit you against. The system is overly complicated and biased towards pitting you against higher ranked opponents......In the early tiers everyone is basically on the same level. But serious vehicle imbalances immediately arise as soon as you start unlocking the next steps. Put one slightly higher tier vehicle in your hanger and you'll be forced into matches with vehicles well above your single step up. Further, since you have only one vehicle in that higher tier, your other vehicles are now cannon fodder for everything else in the arena......The game claims that if you remove the higher tier unit from your hanger you will be re-balanced to fight with vehicles equal to the lower rank of your older vehicles. But this does not happen. Once you have been moved up you cannot go back.THREE.....Serious vehicle imbalances varying by tier. I recommended choosing one or two countries and vehicle types to reduce the amount of grinding. However, except for the Russian bias, every country has a level where it outshines the others. At some point, you will be the weakest link and it will become very difficult to level your way to the next step. Xp requirements grow exponentially, so the higher the tier at which this occurs, the longer it will take to grind your way out......In tier one tanks, the British tanks are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ they have no armor and they can't kill anything. The American and Russian tanks are super fast and can kill most enemies with ease. As you move up, that changes and another nation rises to the top. Planes suffer from similar balance problems. The entry level German planes are killing machines while several other factions may as well be blowing kisses at you.Other items you may want to know about:.....The arcade/mouse flight controls are easy to learn. But you'll have to set some custom controls to perform more complex maneuvers that you will need to master to win in air combat......Many of the options in the menu's use unknown terminology and are not explained in the game's UI. You either have to go to the wiki or learn by trial and error......There is too much grinding in the air vehicles. There are easily three or four times as many planes as tanks. Which sounds great until you realize that most of them are just minor variants of the previous plane and don't perform any better than their earlier counterparts. But you are forced to unlock multiple useless variants to get to the next step in that class......Air combat is more frustration than fun. The beginner planes are ridiculously non-lethal. Air combat takes much longer than tank combat and you earn fewer points and xp for time invested......You spawn in the air a considerable distance from your enemy. As dogfights drop toward lower altitudes, enemies respawn at the default altitude, giving whoever died most recently an immediate advantage. You rarely engage enemies one or two at a time. Most engagements are against multiple opponents, usually with newly respawned enemies coming in from above or behind you......Attempting to use a joystick is horrifically overcomplicated. The number of settings you have to test, modify, and retest to achieve a minimum of control is ridiculous. You're better off using the mouse. Games released in the late 90's had full analog support. The lack of properly implemented joystick support in an aerial combat game is simply mystifying......The beginner tanks are a lot of fun. The maps are small, the combat is close range with obstacles to maneuver around and use for cover. There is still a lot of leveling but not as much as the planes. Tank battles take less time and it's easier to earn xp so your items level much faster......There are significantly fewer tanks than planes. This is good. It allows you to unlock better tanks without having to unlock lots of junk to get to them......However there are gaps in tank performance between one rank and another. Once you're finally competitive in your early tier one tanks you will be pushed into the next step where you will be cannon fodder for those with more hours in-game than you......The tier two maps change the entire game experience. They have large open areas with little or no cover, or large gaps between cover. Everyone becomes a camping tank sniper and the fun level drops to zero......Pay to win. The paid items are expensive and significantly more powerful than their ftp counterparts. Because the game pushes you into higher difficulty levels against higher tier vehicles, I suggest saving any investment for the end game......I put this at the bottom because you can play for free and be effective. The graphics, engine, and basic mechanics are good."

76561198029836448,Not Recommended,236390,29754451,Posted: 6 February,all,Senkawa,"WARNING!!. I am only interesting in the Simulator part of this game, so this review is only for that part of the game. For those looking for the Arcadey or middle ground part of the games, this one is not for you. With the amount of hours I have in this game I feel like I can have an opinion. When I first started this game I forget how many years ago a little bit before 1.35, so I cannot comment on what the grind was like in the 1.2x's. I started off in Arcade mode like most people do.I did not spend long in Arcade mode however and quickly moved on to Realistic Mode, back when it was still called Historical Battles. I spent a lot of time in that mode using a joystick. But after quite a bit of battles in Historical Battles(now RB), I realized that I was completely outclassed by mouseaimers in everything except for manouvering. Sure, you could a majority of the time outfly mouseaimers in your plane, but you would never hit anything because everything was so wobbly even with good settings.All that work on par with someone with a keyboard and mouse was just not cutting it for me, so I moved to Simulator battles. And I loved it. It was my favorite mode of pretty much any non-racing game I had ever played. All of the minor issues, to me at least, like flight models and and small tier differences were balanced out by the fact that it was so fun to completely outfly someone when you were both in cockpit view and shoot them down with many different types of planes. The sudden death aspect of the old Sim Battles were some of the most heart racing 30-45 minutes per-match that I have played. The feeling of fighting off a 1v3 with tracers flying all around you and shooting down at least 1 and forcing the other 2 to break off while you limped your smoking plane home were unmatched. You knew that by getting one of their planes and returing yours to base brought your team that much closer to victory. And then that's when it happened. Enduring Confrontation.When it came out the Sim community was somewhat small, but the ability to get in queue with literally any plane you wanted and at least fly a game with bots on your team gave you something to do. But Enduring confrontation split the community between regular que and EC. This was not horrible as I could just play regular SB. Eventually they completely scrapped regualy SB for EC and that's when I started playing less. My first and main issue with the current iteration of SB is the requirement before you even join a game to have a plane of a specific Battle Rating  in your line up. This would not be a problem with me if it wasn't for the fact that it was perfectly fine before when you didn't need a specific BR to queue. The second issue I have with EC is that you have to pay silver lion (currency used to by planes and crew and things) just to fly your plane. This would be like paying a repair bill for a car just to drive it out of your driveway. For a lot of the higher tier planes, you need multiple plane kills just to go even. What is even better is that everytime you crash or get shot down you have to pay to take it up again. I would be fine with this if it costed nothing to fly the first time. I would play Sim tanks, but that in itself is not very sim like either, with the commander view being 3 feet over the turret, and no actual interior views. I refuse to play RB in any sense because I refuse to resort to using a mosue just to be competitive, plus it's just not as fun compared to how SB used to be to me. I see ships are coming, but I do not see them letting players use anything larger than maybe Destroyer Escorts, so that has no interest for me. I could overlook the grind if the Sim gameplay was fun for me, but it is not anymore. The Sim queues are pretty much empty and there is nothing else left for me to do besides look at the pretty war planes and fly the ones I have unlocked vs AI and solo in the test-flights. I would unlock more, but I would need to play to do that, and I do not see me doing that anytime soon.SUMMARY: If you are looking for a game where you can immerse yourself in all sorts of aircraft from pre-war to the Korean War from 1st person look elsewhere. This is just how I feel about the game now, and I realize reviews are completely subjective and other people may have other opinions and maybe even the opposite of mine. But I have put many hours into the game and speed a bit of money on it, so it is sad to see Gaijin neglect the Sim aspect of their game so much. Sure, bomber cockpits are nice for immersion sake, but it's a 1 step forward, 4 steps back kind of deal.Just my 2 cents."

However, once I had made sufficient progress through Rank I the game suddenly threw me into an series of new maps; this would've been quite welcome, if I wasn't also suddenly surrounded by advanced vehicles driven by players who had obviously put a great deal of time and disposable income into the game. It became quite evident that I'd been unceremoniously thrown into the deep end, and found myself feeling like cannon fodder amidst far more experienced players. Consequently any progress I was making in unlocking new vehicles ground to a halt, and after a few vain attempts to struggle through I eventually decided that there was no further point to playing a game that no longer provided any enjoyment or satisfaction. It's a shame too, as the tanks are very detailed and the physics require a fair deal of forethought . Nevertheless, when your first Rank II vehicles are being pitted against tanks much higher up in the tech tree than you, the gameplay becomes an almost insurmountable slope that I'm no longer going to try and climb."

The que for joining a realistic tank battle is usually a good 5 to 10 minutes long; and if you're lucky you'll get about the same amount of game time. Mostly you won't though, because the slightest mistake is punished harshly and the first team to make a couple of mistakes gets steamrolled. So it's more like waiting 10 minutes for a game, then enjoying about 30 to 60 seconds of actual play; maybe a couple more minutes if you spend some time driving around looking at scenery.Arcade tank battles are total crapshoots. There is no teamwork, and barely any way to coordinate with your team; *if* anyone outside of your max 4-player squadron bothers to pay attention to the map pings. Maps have no real rhyme or reason to them; objectives seem to be placed in the middle of nowhere, and the current reward system actively discourages players from going after them. Expect to lose a *lot*, and suffer in massive frustration as your tank gets shot to pieces because arcade mode reveals enemies nearby and provides aim-assistance.Air battles are not much better; with the same random match-making, lack of teamwork, and objectives discouraging strategic or cooperative gameplay.On top of this, Gaijin's business model actively tries to make you spend money on useless crap. Players are provided with mediocre rewards from just playing, some of which are actually unusable without paying money to use them in what is the least cost-effective aspect of the game. And of course, Gaijin installs a seperate program that manages updates; without clearly asking for permission. Wouldn't be so bad except this program cannot be uninstalled by accessing the computer's programs control panel nor through itself, and must be manually deleted.Save yourself the time and money (because F2P is a misnomer here), pass over this game and find something that won't install malware on your computer and is fun to play instead."

If you google for a list or number of players banned from cheating. I could only find 17 accounts ban for whole of 2016.If you don’t belive me I have linked to one of the biggest war thunder YouTube at that time saying the same as me (just better)https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/4lp197/the_mighty_jingles_will_never_feature_war_thunder/The system for penetration tanks are at best random if not broken. And doesn’t make any sense. (since it doesn’t work) and feels like winning or losing in CS GO LOTTO.Ghost shell. If you are in a fast tank and fire at the move or move the turret fast to a target the changes is that the shell will miss or disappear to the fact the server doesn’t register that you hit the target. 90 % changes that you are dead since you now have a 10 to 30 second reload.Battle ratting is at best broken.

And you need a premium account to grind to all of the tanks/plains etc.A good example of this was when they introduce Bushes on the tanks. (Yes you read right) as camuflation for the tanks. They were expansive as hell. (gold eagles,) and they only worked on one tanks.The game isn’t fun anymore, it feels like a choir.

Annoying and absolutely meaningless.Accuracy mechanics. Coming from WOT, this game feels like a stupid arcade. Every tank shoots straight in the reticle, even when moving, there are no proper accuracy mechanics. You can snipe tanks from 300 metres using a KV2.Glitchy as hell. Game begins, teammates spawn, we proceed to cross the river that divides us from the rest of the map and from the objective through a bridge. Well guess what, nobody can cross the bridge, everytime you get close to the bridge a ownerless tank appears out of nowhere in the middle of the bridge and is blocking the way.

I don't know why, so please don't ask me.Please ignore my steam hours, as I played through the launcher downloaded directly from the official website, and only downloaded the steam version to review it. Now that that is all out of the way, I'll dive back in.War Thunder is a very unusual case. It is a well made and fun game, with quite a lot of realism, especially compared to its competitor, World of Tanks (and far better than World of Warplanes). I would say that in most areas gameplay wise War Thunder is considerably better than WOT (and WOWP), and less frustrating (unless someone in a heavy bomber starts carpet bombing the tank spawn). However, There is a reason that I would recommend WOT over War Thunder, and that is the companies running the two games. Wargaming, who run WOT/WOWP, are not a particularly nice company, but Gaijin is an awful company that makes EA look consumer-friendly in comparison. Gaijin sells premium vehicles that are in some cases flat out better than their regular versions (Calliope) or just come with stupid annoying strengths (SU-100Y, because oneshotting everything from 2km away is fun and engaging), and this is just the beginning. They cannot take criticism at all, and their moderators close down any forum threads or videos on the community video site that complain, for reasons of varying degrees of silliness (some poor guy was banned for complaining about the matchmaker for ""Supporting ISIS"")Along with that, there are ""incidents"" that occur every once in a while when someone complains on a non-gaijin regulated site, such as youtube, and I will show the two most prominent examples:In 2015, a Latvian by the name of Kirill ""alconafter"" Fyodorov, who runs a Youtube channel, had his channel taken down with multiple DMCA copyright strikes. He was contacted by Gaijin, who refused to give him his channel back unless he signed a contract that they sent him.""I hereby undertake to release at least four video reviews about the game War Thunder per week, and I also guarantee that the content will not contain insults and materials discrediting the reputation of the game War Thunder and that may cause direct or indirect damage to the right holder of the game. ...If the channel owner breaches the terms and conditions of this agreement Gaijin Network Ltd. may at its sole discretion (a) unilaterally terminate this agreement and/or (d) require the channel owner to pay a fine of $10,000 for each case of breach.""""This agreement is confidential and its terms may not be disclosed to any 3rd-parties without the prior permission of Gaijin Network Ltd.""For those who don't understand what this means, he would have to upload 4 videos of War Thunder per week, and not criticise the game in any way, or tell anyone about the terms of the contract. Every time he broke these rules, he could be fined $10,000, more that his entire yearly income from Youtube.Obviously, he refused, and sent his story to Russian websites, who published it. It was then translated by a blog called ""Status Report"", which released the story to the english community, and caused outrage. Gaijin then went full damage control, firing the person in charge of the operation, Pavel Kulikov, branding him as a rogue employee. While this might have been believeable then, a similar incident happened some months later:A different YouTuber, and American this time, known a ""PhlyDaly"", uploaded a video regarding a marker cheat. Gaijin, more cautious this time, messaged him and asked him to take the video down, claiming that it had increased the use of the cheat. He refused to go as far as to take the video down, but made it private instead. The next day, on the offical forums, a poll popped up, created by the company CEO. He explained what had happened, and gave the players a choice:either add the markers for all players, or revoke the licence of Phly and copyright strike the video to have it taken down. This caused outrage, and he had to back down. However, this suggests to me that the first incident was authorised by the CEO and Pavel was simply a scapegoat for their damage control plan.On these grounds, I cannot recommend this game under any circumstances, which is a shame, because it is very fun to play."

But once you go up a tank tier you get stuck in battles with people with way higher tank levels, and way higher experience making it a steep challange. Before i was getting an easy 5 kills a battle, now barely getting one or two shot out (which all riccochet because i cant upgrade my amunition without experience). It went from a fun challange to very poor. Not impressed. Keep the high levels in their own area or you will drive us new players out.Good game needs alot of work."

The Graphics are phantastic to look at, the detail on every vehicle in this game is just amazing and with this I mean the attention to detail relaied onto the original vehicels.You have severel game modes which allow you to get used to the game and the vehicletype (beginner middle expert). A turtorial for every vehicle type is available:too.So you find yourselve in fourios battles in no time.The only thing I could think of which is a bad thing might be the possebility to buy certain tanks,ships and aircrafts. Those machinery is normaly a littlebit stronger and better in every way. So if you're a player like me that has it's very intense times playing it, just to leav it alone the next months you wind up with some decent armor and weaponary but if your paths cross one of this buying badboys...you should be hit reverse or getaway in the clouds. :DFinally it is still a wonderful game to play and I'm sure it does even more fun, playing it against friends in a good old fashion LAN-Party :D"

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy"

Now to do some more explaining:Tier 1 planes vs tier 1 planes was THE most fun i have had playing a game in a long time, because everything is ballanced well, you can use the reserve vehicles and kick♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can use BR 2 vehicles and kick♥♥♥♥♥♥ basically you can kick♥♥♥♥♥♥and not kick♥♥♥♥♥♥ It was fun and fair, you knew whoever you were going up against had the same amount of chance they would kill you as you have a chance of killing them, and it would take skill to get the upper hand. This is the same with tier 2 vs tier 2, infact same tier vs the same tier.HOWEVERThe matchmaking can put you and your tier 1 planes up against tier 2s, this is not fun. For instance, a player can have a plane that has weapons that will one-shot any tier 1 plane, and said tier 1 planes cannot even keep up with it or even turn enough to damage it. Now you can use your 1 tier 2 plane, and it will kick♥♥♥♥♥♥if used well, and kick♥♥♥♥♥♥it does, however because it will get shot down within 2 minutes you are left with some tier 1 planes. in some game modes this is not a problem, such as ground strike, basically any plane can damage any ground vehicle...apart from medium and heavy tanks, you need a bomber for those. But tier 2 games are hardly ever just ground strike, they are a mixture of cool game modes and stuff that are really fun, but you cant enjoy them because your tier 2 plane was already shot down by a lucky shot to the cockpit by a spitfire mk4, or you get flown into by an♥♥♥♥♥♥being an♥♥♥♥♥♥It has gotten to a point that I cannot earn research to get a new tier 2 plane (I am sad that I might never get a spitfire...damn I love those planes :( ) and because I cannot get a new tier 2 plane I have now gotten used to the spectator mode, because a nimrod cannot keep up with a MIG.And now less explaining because it might be easier for me to sum up this game like this:Early game, it will be some if not THE most fun you will have in a plane or tank, however once you start going up against anything near mid tier, that fun is no longer part of the game and you considder spending your money you were saving up for some bass strings on some in-game currency so you can get a new tier 2 plane so you might have a chance at progressing.Basically, to progress in this game you will need to spend money if you want to still want to play this game, or if you want to play this game for more than 30 minutes.Also if you run out of lions you will need to buy more because you cant earn them without any planes, also you cant earn them with the reserve vehicles because if you have ran out of lions, you are fighting at least tier 2, and reserve vehicles cannot do enough to damage enemies or survive more than 1 stray bullet hitting you.TL;DR Fun game, would have recommended if it wasnt for the terrible matchmaking and progression."

Expect rage, gamer gunk, smashed keyboards and a lot of ""How the ♥♥♥♥ even?"". Once you get over that, learn tactics & techniques and you'll be fine.

I would reccomend to all WW2 enthusiasts."
,Recommended,236390,29531736,Posted: 27 January,all,Nerd Stak,"Very graphically pretty with impressive vehicle models. Great sense of control over tanks and planes.However, it is NOT a simulator and does not replicate real-life combat in any way. If you like tank-to-tank combat, aerial dogfights or a mix of those two, you might very well like this game, though.Because of its very design and core gameplay concepts since its early days, it suffers balance issues. It always has, and always will. This means it's not made for very competitive-driven players, who should try WoT instead. War Thunder is about pretty graphics and a ""realistic feeling"". It's about the excitement of control over war machines mainly from WW2. As you progress in it you might get more and more frustrated as you spot the flaws of the game, but it definitely has things going for it that no other game really has.Last thing: be prepared to be very, very patient if your goal is to unlock high-tiered vehicles without spending any money. I have never experienced a grind worse than that in War Thunder. After roughly 1800 hours and a couple hundred euros spent in it I'd say I unlocked about a fifth of all the vehicles there are to unlock, and I might be too confident in that estimate."

Free play means progressing with such slowness that ever getting into the top 5 in any battle is simply a pipe-dream. Your maximum points will be in the 1000 range whilst some are getting 6000+.Your progress with aeroplanes as a free-player is hampered on purpose by the ""lack of convertible RPs"" bug which has persisted to the point of making it obvious that it is, in fact, a feature. If you get beyond the first 3-4 ranks of planes then you show a dedication that I (at some 70-80 hours) do not have.All that said, despite some jarring modelling issues (Spitfire turning not as good as Messerschmitt for example) the game itself is pretty good. Physics is OK and the one-on-one battles are fun. Bombing is a tedious chore that is required to win in many of the random battles.Some tips:Do not bother bombing anything as the points gained from this are stupidly low compared to killing a plane, let others do this.Hang back and let the newbies get into the scrum-o-death that happens in every game, pick off stragglers.Choose your targets from the ordered points list, don't bother going after the pay-for players as they will kill you in one shot - not sure how much real fun that is for them.Get a squadron and make a plan, God knows no-one else will have one."

,Recommended,236390,30230110,Posted: 27 February,all,xx_The_DankesT_xx,"I would have given the game a thumbs down due to mistakes by the development team in the past year to two years, however I think the game is starting to improve with new changes in battle ratings (how they match vehicles against each other) and I hope they continue to improve the balance of the game. War Thunder is a great game if you play it for a long time and take advantage of sales when you can because putting some money into the game will help with the grind, which gets horrible at the higher end vehicles, especially without a premium (paid) account or premium vehicles to earn extra RP (or experience). You need to play this game for a long time to enjoy it. I usually play a lot for a few months then take a break from the game till a new update is soon to come, which is usually 3-4 months, maybe more. I would recommend looking at the top vehicles in each nation and choose one to grind out and just keep going until you get bored. Then take a break from the game so you can get back into it at a later date. I wouldn't say it's pay2win, but buying a priemium account or vehicle will make it much easier to grind out planes, and if you plan to buy a vehicle make sure it is something you like, do a little research and choose a higher tier vehicle so you can use it to grind out any vehicle effectively. I think the game will improve and playing with friends makes the game much better. I would recommend joining a group/clan to play with, if you're social enough. Hopefully Gaijin will make the grind easier as they add more vehicles, but at the moment it is a bit tasking to get high tier vehicles which is a turn off. So if you have the time and are willing to improve your skills and not complain about bias like a lot of other people this is a great game for you!"

,Recommended,236390,30146224,Posted: 24 February,all,FrighteningSpoon,"Please keep in mind that I just felt like reviewing this game. I'm not a pro at reviewing games, I just want to say what I think of it.Much better than your average F2P games, It's somewhat hard (I'm not very good! xd) but it's if I were to give it a rating, I'd say 8/10.It's a good game to play with friends.There's Arcade & Realistic modes.You can choose to either fight in a tank battle or a plane battle.The recently added Tank battles aren't as big as the Plane battles, but both can stand on their own and are worth playing if you're only interesting in playing either Tanks or Planes.Arcade Mode is just what you would expect. Simple, most advanced mechanics are automated in this mode. Move around, use your teammate as meatshield, point & shoot and repeat.Realistic Mode:In -Tank Battles-, controls remain the same, a few changes affect your speed, acceleration rate and... well... I'ma just call it your Survivability. Mainly affects your ability to see ennemy indicators on your hud / map.In -Plane Battles- however, Aerodynamics change a bit, they'll be harder to maneuver in and the hits you take are more important to consider when making a decision. Controls CAN change a lot in this. Most players won't approach this mode, but I personaly find it very underated (Forgive my bad english, please ;-;). If you have a joystick you never had a chance to try, now's the time, this game's perfect for it.I can't help but say that I wish for more tanks (which'll eventually come) because it's somewhat hard to get a good feel for a certain Faction (probably not the right term to use, but hey, it's all I could think of). In this game, if you don't have a specific goal, you won't have fun. Know what you want to go for wether it's a tank or a plane, it doesn't matter, as long as you know what you want your next Tank/Plane to be, it'll be fun to play.Hope it helps!"

At times this game could get a bit repetitive with it's large amout of vehicles that you must grind through. Some even seeming the same as the last with no real diffrance. Then there are those moments long time players like to refer to as ""Sparks"" or ""Bounces"". These ""Sparks"" are what ruineds the game for some, ""Sparks"" Occur when a shot is fired at an enemy plane and it just ""Sparks"" Not damaging or hindering the enemy plane performance at all. With the cost of you losing ammo. It's a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Then there are ""Bounces"". In tank combat a bunce is pretty self explanatory. You fire a shot into an enemy tank AT their weakspot and the game decides its a ""Bounce"". Meaning the shot didn't go through the armor and the crew of said tank is perfectly fine. Putting you in a reload and making you vunrabale to a counter attack. With that said this is all the is wrong with the game, the commuity is something diffrent and requires a whole lot more then just a single paragraph to explain.Every thing else is perfect. The Dagor Engine hold up very well and at times it seems photorealistic at times. The gameplay is pefetcly mapped the mouse and keybord and fully editable. WIth its 3 gamemodes it offers a play style for all kinds of gamers.ArcadeThis gamemode is for players just looking to burn time or players with a more fast paced playstyle. With its leading pip with gamemode is for new players or like said before. Time burnners.Air RealisticThis gamemode is for players who have a lot more patience and skill, no leading pip in this one.

But it doesn't overpower basic planes. For example: a non-upgrade plane can still suffice against a maxed out plane. I didn't have as much fun with the tanks as I did with the planes. I feel that's partly to do with the fact that there are alot of other tank games. But there are very few good multiplayer airplane fighting games out right now. Although (at times) there is a heavy emphasis on buying into the ""membership"". It's not required to have a good time playing. While I seem to be shying away from War Thunder, while I played it frequently it was a fun experience. I recommend giving this one a shot even if your not the biggest videogame airplane junkie like myself :D"

76561197980978682,Recommended,236390,30226369,Posted: 27 February,all,miribus,"Some of these very things may end being the 'bad' points for others, but I'll really simply state why I continue to play this game despite not being very good at it, or even being a fan of combat sims, or competitive anything.To put it another way,  I don't play CoD, CS, Overwatch, WoT, etc, I don't even PvP in MMORPGS, so bear in mind this is the first game like this that I have really played since Battlefield 2.What I like:The game is free, and within reason you can eventually grind your way to just about any vehicle except for some of the super premium ones.  I don't play every day so I don't mind the grind.  To me, I need to get better at playing this games with the planes/tanks I have, more powerful ones (like my Fw190, for example) I'm just not ready for.  Other planes and players at that teir are way too good.*The game runs very, very, well on just about any hardware that has a 3d accelerator in it, and acceptably on even more.  Consider my i5 laptop, a 4300U @ 15Watts (Dell 2n1).  At lowest settings, @ 720p (which still look on par to at least a mobile game) you'll get 30fps+ while flying.  Tanks however, cut your framerate in half.  (Unplayable).   On the other side, my little RX 460 4GB (Sapphire Nitro) and my old sandy bridge can do 4K (3840x2160)  at 'high' preset (though I untick FXAA) in the 50-60 flying and about 30-60 tanks.  I've never observed any frame issues but the game's built-in fps meter never seems to go below the 30s at the worst case.  I do get an occaisional random chop, but it isn't the video card.  In the most furious of fighting it seems completely fine.  1440p I can pretty much do whatever I want besides Anti-alias and 1080p is even better.The bottom line here is you most likely have the hardware to run this if you even have Steam installed at this point.I can't speak for the community, I don't play with a headset, just an anonymous drone.  What little is actually said on the in-game chat is usually civil, the worst might be someone grumbling about getting rammed, it is usually eerily silent.The mouse-key controls are very simple, planes are very simple to fly. Tanks are simple as well but I hope your eyes are really good :).The matches aren't always balanced super-well but that's warfare, I get wiped out fast some games, I do well in others, it is just how it is.  I've never felt  'cheated', though often confused,  when I'm certain I should be burning someone down.  It's on me though, my ping is fine ;)    I generally only play Arcade against people with some 'Realistic' training with AI.  The matches are very short so you can rip through several.  I don't play a lot, I'm not very good, but even I can manage to do some damage.Other than time this game requires no real investment. The interface can seem overwhelming at first, but it shakes all out very straightforward in the end.Graphically, I think it looks great and as I mentioned before doesn't require a great deal to push it.  (I ran it on a Bay Trail atom quad core..., it got 7-15fps in the air :P)   When you're in a really good dogfight, or artillery is falling around you and you're holding a position outnumbered as time is ticking down it really all just clicks and it is why I keep coming back.There are ways to play against bots in some fairly fun missions if you don't want to play online at all, but you have to grind your way through some planes to get them and the easiest way to do that is to grit your teeth and work out some strategies on how to stay alive :)  In other words, if you can't hit a soaring plane, bomb the crap out of what you can.The only other game advice I could give is:  Stick with your team, lone-wolfing gets you killed, and be patient.  Don't take things like lead indicator reticles and green crosshairs as a given.The final point, for a casual fan, is the microtransactions.  I have been playing for about 120 hours since October, I have never paid a dollar.  Some of the items you can purchase feel fairly reasonable once you understand what you are paying for, but I don't see the need myself.  The game has a currency system, the most important one being silver lions.  You need them for everything including re-arming your vehicles.  Generally, you have to be pretty terrible to not earn silver lions to keep yourself afloat and have enough to buy upgrades.  You can get yourself into a situation though where you've run out.  You can either buy some for a few dollars that would tide me over a few months.  Or, what I actually do is just try a different country or switch to the free-to-repair teir 1 planes and remember how much I enjoyed biplanes.  I'm a much better tanker so I'll also just get more eagles that way.  You'll get buffs literally every day that also increase how many lions you can earn in a match.The bottom line here is, if you're good, you'll never have to worry about it.  If you're OK, you'll probably never have to worry about it.  If you're not very good, you'll probably have to get a bit better, or grind a little longer.For some of you this might also matter.  If you have a mouse with thumb/pinky buttons, you can fly entirely 1-handed.  If it has enough buttons probably drive a tank as well.  The mouse aim (some purists hate this) is extremely friendly and trust me the most novice of you will work it out.  Flying isn't very hard but precise shooting is going to need practice.I've paid absolutely nothing for nearly 120hrs that I've really enjoyed because of how accessible and attractive this game is.  The grinding is definitely grinding, the places do get repetitive, but the players don't.  Every tense 10 minutes or so is very different.  I recommend anyone even vaguely interested give it a look.  I haven't had this much fun with a flight sim since Tie Fighter or with a tank since Battlezone and I could never get into the heavy sim stuff and I can't do 360-headshots."
