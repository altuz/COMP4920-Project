I love this game.But, if you buy this game now, you are only buying it to play a less complete version of the game four months early. In four months this game is going to receive a rerelease on PC that is differentiated as the ""DX11"" version. This version will match the next-gen console rerelease and will have new features that are introduced with those versions.Please wait. Your time (and money) is better spent building memories with a polished version of this game. Rather than a version that reeks of being thrown out the door in time for the end of the previous console generation."

The game was limited on PC due to console restrictions. Now they will be charging for the game again with graphics that many PC's could handle all along and on top of that, both PC versions wont be compatible therefore splitting the online community.﻿ Yes you heard that right;Its not only the ones who will stick with the old version that will be prejudiced, those who will bought the DX 11 version will too. Why? Because basically this stupid decision will split up the DS2 PC community/players in half, perhaps even making the ""better online matchmaking improvements"" useless since there will be way less players now anyway.Both versions of this game (this one and the future ""improved"" one) will be separated and if you own one of them, you wont be able to play with people that owns another version.Not to mention that, just for minor tweaks, if you already own this game you will have to buy it AGAIN. The same game, AGAIN, in order to be able to perhaps enjoy the multiplayer.If they released the new ""version"" as some sort of DLC, with a lower price, then fine, probably the majority of people would upgrade. But no, and the game is essencially the same.﻿Whatever if you own DSII or DS or even none of them by now, please denounce these developer/publisher practises.There are some links, as some suggested, explaining the matter.YouTube explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiDa9Yf2xhISteam thread confirming differences in ""old"" and ""new"" versions:http://steamcommunity.com/app/236430/discussions/0/624076027426323183/Famitsu Interview:http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/2nqqjm/famitsu_interview_tanimura_refers_to_ability_to/"

,Recommended,236430,10807644,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Thorn Falconeye,"4/5: A good game that mechanically is better than DS1, but design/lore wise is much weaker. If you like the genre just buy it.It is kind of like L4D1 vs L4D2 for me.L4D1 had a very clear focus on the coop campaigns, you could tell because of the finely tuned levels balanced around slowly moving forwards at all times- and the weird multiplayer scoring mechanics. Much like Dark Souls 1 and its clear focus on a coherent world and strong NPCs, with some odd balance in gameplay(pyromancy/dark).L4D2 had an almost singular focus on versus mode: the scoring system was much better, the new infected types were focused on making sure that there was no slow movement, but movement was done in fast bursts. The levels and events were also designed around this new focus, and it left the coop campaign section lacking(except hard rain-note how it forces you to stop and hole up more often, as well as pick movement paths much more carefully). But versus was much more interesting than l4d1 and I was fine playing that for a long long time.Dark Souls 2: it seems to be built around consensual pvp and coop. It is so incredibly easy to do consensual pvp in DS2- beat 1/3 of the game and you can do it all you want, in a few different settings(I do count the rat covenant as consensual pvp, probably doors of pharros as well because they are small optional areas). With the rings for helping summon your friends, along with the soul memory mechanic and no infinite invasion items, you can summon friends for anything anytime with nearly no reprecussions(especially once you learn how to abuse the life rings). One of the biggest plusses for me was the relative balance of most of the mechanics: no longer is mage an unstoppable juggernaut from halfway through the game, or pyromancy a nearly costless source of power. Everything had a price and many of the weapons were pretty cool to use in pvp and pve, as well as reworked poison and a distinct lack of high end shields from early game.I was amazed that they replaced the backstab-centric combat correctly, where now I could whittle down the opponent without having to resort to only having 2 hits matter.What has suffered in dark souls 2? World design- its been talked about before. Coupling their desire to gate out power(when do you get the primary seller for magic/cleric/dark?) with the super linear and non optional design- they have made it so that I never want to do the optional areas because they don't contain any lore I really feel like uncovering(ash lake), any interesting areas I feel like going to(ash lake!) or even any items I want to have(great ash lake barrier!). Add to this their desire to take out those nasty low level invaders(most of which people wanted gone were just straight up hackers) by again cutting non consensual invasion pvp.------I think DS2 is a mechanically superior game that lacked the amazing invasion pvp and world building that made DS1 great. I should be having more fun in pvp due to the plethora of weapons and builds and whatnot- except my character build does not seem unique or even a trade off, because when everyone is level 170 you can have 4 stats at 40. So unless you want some sort of hex dual wield falchion build, you can always have high weight capacity and hp.I am a huge fan of the non consensual invasions- it was the price of going human in DS1 and while it might be weird this time around(so how about that there blue protection covenant, thats probably a good price for blocking invasions) it is a sorely missed feature that has really cut down on replay value for me.------"

,Recommended,236430,19584919,"Posted: 9 December, 2015",all,Vixus,"Short version :Dark Souls 2is truly a worthy successor of the originalDark Soulsin all aspects except visual style. - 9.5/10Long version :I'm a hardcore fan of the series (unfortunately never got around to playDemon Souls).Setting: A lot of people may argue about the fact thatDark Souls 2lacks good story, characters, areas, and bosses.I will agree with the latter as the bosses were indeed dissapointing, I finished NG+ and NG+2 all under 10 hours, the area enemies and obstacles provide more of a challenge than bosses do.ButDark Souls 2has a strong narrative and lore, setting up an even darker plot forDark Souls 3to continue. In order to understand the story completely, you need to play the originalDark Soulsas well, because a lot of the characters and plot is vaguely mentioned throughoutDark Souls 2.Gameplay: When it comes to gameplay,Dark Souls 2excels at it compared to it's predecessors and even it's successorBloodborne.Dark Souls 2is fluid in every way, including movement, attacking, defending, casting spells, and especially dodging.People say that playing the Souls series requires a controller, I am proof that it doesn't. Played bothDark Soulsgames using mouse and keyboard, my PVP win rate inDark Souls 2is around 80%. That includes normal PVP and arena. So if you're one of those people who doesn't have a controller like me, don't be afraid to play this game, you'll be just as good as the players with a controller.Visuals and optimization: Visuals are fantastic, and the game is perfectly optimized for the PC, runs smoother than my operating system does. But in terms of art style, it's not that grand compared to it's predecessor. But you'll certainly be fascinated by most environments.Online: WhereDark Souls 2lacks, it CERTAINLY makes up for it's online system, you'll connect with people online very easily, as long as people keeps playing the game, you'll be able to PVP, co-op or troll / gank people.We all remember how poor the originalDark Souls'connectivity system was, and originallyDark Souls 2had a lot of issues with it's online system, but the devs fixed it with patches that added certain rings that makes matchmaking easier and removed some restrictions.Expansions: The additional content released for the game are worth playing, the price tag is pretty big, but  considering the amount of new content it adds, including new gear, new characters, more insight on the story, new areas and ofcourse, new bosses, it's worth a buy if you're a fan of the series.Controversies: A lot of the fans including myself got backstabbed byFrom Softwarefor their cheap tricks at money making, with how they released a new and much better version of the game but something that you have to purchase even if you own the original base game. But it isn't fair if you rate the game poorly or not recommend it, just because the developers went for a dirty marketing system doesn't mean the game is bad, it's still superb!All in all,Dark Souls 2is a RPG masterpiece, players old and new to the series shouldn't miss out on this gem."

On paper Dark Souls 2 improves on many problems in the first two games. But at the same time it fails to capture the most important aspects that made everyone love the other games.Everyone gets hung up on the difficulty of the Souls games. As if that’s the only thing that makes them good. They’re more than that. There’s plenty of bone hard games out there, but none have the same devoted fanbase as the Souls games. There’s more going on here than the marketing or even the fans would want you to think. And that’s where Dark Souls 2 goes wrong. On the surface this is the same as the other two. But when you dig deep you notice there’s nothing there. Dark Souls and Demon’s Souls were rich. This isn’t.Here’s a comprehensive list of what the sequel gets right. The multiplayer is reliable. In Dark Souls 1 it’s a borderline unusable mess. You can now run the game at any resolution, and the performance is good. That’s the end of the list.It’s clear that the developers of Dark Souls 2 aimed too high. They tried to outdo the original game, with a team that was unqualified to even dream of doing so. They made a new engine with an improved lighting engine. In trailers it almost looked like a next-gen game! Unfortunately it was so slow they scrapped it before release. What you’re left with is a game that looks worse than its predecessors. There’s almost no contrast, the lighting is mostly flat, the art direction confusing. Words you wouldn’t use to describe the other Souls games.More importantly though there’s no cohesion to the world. The transitions between environments is nonsensical. There’s far too many locations, and they’re all too small. There’s no way anyone could live in this world. In the other Souls games the worlds were plausible. You saw the remnants of great civilizations, and you could believe in them. There’s maybe a couple exceptions to the rule in Dark Souls 2, but they’re in the minority. Almost every environment you pass through you reach the end and think “oh, that’s it? Ok..”.The DLC packs do their best to redeem the game. They’re an admirable effort, easily outdoing anything the main game did. There’s hope yet for this team. But after finishing the DLCs and returning to the normal areas one last time I’m not wistful or nostalgic for anything that happened during my journey. I look at the world and all I see is meaningless maps. This isn’t a world with history, where I connected with characters and went on a journey that I’ll remember. It’s just a game. A Souls game should be more than that.I’m split. Dark Souls 2 isn’t “bad” by any regular metric. But the more I play it the more disappointed I am in it. At some point I’ll replay Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls. I never want to play Dark Souls 2 again."

I know we all love the souls series, so lets make sure to let Fromsoft know that we wont sit by and pay them to screw it up.The upcoming re-release is a paid fix for only a fraction of the things that are wrong with this game. Not only that, but every single ""new feature"" in the upcoming version could easily be patched into the current. This will also deal a huge blow to the games community. They will now be split bewteen to versions. Considering the community is already so small, this will make online play virtually non-existant for one or both versions. Good luck filling those 6 multiplayer slots with a total of 2000 people online at PEAK hours. All these issues could be avoided. Instead Fromsoftware feels they deserve to be paid again for doing little to no work fixing the mistakes they made in the first place. This is nothing more then an unprofessional money-grab by a developer who has clearly become full of themselves. They need to focus on fixing the version they just sold before moving on to a new one.The scam of the re-release is not the only problem with this game. The PvP is just in a flat out awful state. Peer2Peer lag ruins most matches, and Hackers run wild and free with no fear of punishment. In fact you are more likely to get banned for modding the game visually than you are for hacking to win PvP. Hackers aren't even afraid to gloat about their hacks. They know they will not be punished. In just the last week, I have run into 5 hardcore hackers. Had to completely abandon my favorite invasion locations because I didnt want to keep throwing away hours of cracked orb farming on these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. No sign of them being stopped. To put it simply, Fromsoft does not care. They got paid. They are about to get paid again. Why put in extra work fixing their game when they can just release a new version full of empty promises and the same problems? The fans will buy it.I can promise you this. The lag, the hackers, all of it will carry over to the new version as well. You will basically just be buying better looking graphics for a game the Devs have condemned.TL;DR?Fromsoft is about to launch a re-release of this game that will destroy the online PC community. It is a great deal for those who own a PS4 and XboxOne, but awful for the PC Playerbase. If you buy this version, you are buying a soon-to-be-dead game. If you buy the re-release, you might as well bend over and ask Scamco to screw you some more. We deserve a free conversion to Dx11. Its well within their power to do. They have made it very clear that they do not care about the state of the game, just how much money they can get out of it. It's full of hackers with no punishments in sight. You would do well to save your money and invest in a game developed by experienced professionals."

However this game lacks the core elements that made the first game so immersive and engaging.The combat in Dark Souls 2 misses the core ideals that the first Dark Souls created. The developers seem to have just made attributes of the bosses and the enemies more annoying in order to increase the ""difficulty"" of the game itself. The mobs tracking system is one example of this. Mobs will track the player until the very last moment that they attack even if they are wielding a large heavy great sword or mace. This defies one of the principles that the first dark souls created which was to create a weighty and realistic combat structure that focused on precise movements and smart defensive gameplay. The combat in dark souls 2 doesn’t really feel very weighty when fighting mobs because they do a 360 degree turn to hit you when they are using a heavy cumbersome item. I find this kind of lazy design in my own opinion.The story feels disjointed and pointless which i suppose goes with the apparent theme of melancholy and anomie that the game tries to push. I can understand the ambiguity of the direction in the game but it does nothing for me as the player. In the first game the story was equally ambiguous but at least there was some end goal, which was to fulfill the prophecy told to you at the beginning of the game. This simple request and then the subsequent requests to find the two bells of awakening and eventually succeed Gwinn were purpose enough to continue to explore the game world. In dark souls 2 you have to search for four powerful souls for some reason to get to the kings palace for some reason and etc. there is no motivation no dying man’s request to fulfill a prophecy. I felt as though my character was a pointless nobody just wreaking havoc for no apparent reason except to advance through the game.Overall this game lacks what I loved about the first dark souls and while this is its own game I still can’t feel a sense of annoyance and frustration for what this game could have been when I play it."

I can't get enough of it.Edit:  I read some of the negative reviews on here and they basically read like this: ""I put SO many hours into DS1 and know it like the back of my hand.  DS2 sucks because it's not an exact clone of DS1.  I don't want to attempt to learn anything new I want an exact clone of DS1 with new areas to explore.""So yea, if you want DS1, sorry this isn't it.  It's DS2...  there's differences.  I can say that with 300+ hours into DS2 and DS1 that I like DS2 better.  I'm in NG+5, got all the achievements and still enjoying the game.  As for the ""this game is too easy"" comments (complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t btw) it's got its easier areas and hard ones and each individual is probably going to find different areas easier or harder than other people depending on what type of character they build and what their play style is.  So IMO, that's subjective.  I beat DS1 on NG+6 and by that time it's not a hard game either.All the people that wanna talk about how hard DS1 is compared to DS2 either didn't play it as much as they claim they did or they're just blindly biased against DS2 for whatever reason.  DS1 has a final boss you can parry/riposte to death easily on any difficulty and you can pretty much back stab your way through the entire game with ease (and lets not forget Manus, the final boss in the expansion who you can kill before you even zone into the fight with a ring of the hawk and a decent bow.  He'll just stand there and die, too easy).  There are plenty of enemies in DS1 that you can shoot with a black bow of pharis who won't move at all and just stand there and let you kill them.  As for bosses, Seathe was a joke, so was Nito and Quelaag and Iron Golem and Gwyn after you realized you could parry him.  Not to mention, if you had a crap load of hours put into DS1 then you knew what to expect going into DS2.  You knew the style of the game and what was coming so of course it's not going to be as challenging as experiencing that style of game for the first time.DS1 was a great game, don't get me wrong but DS2 is a great game in it's own right too.  Don't pretend that most of the flaws that exist in Dark Souls 2 were non-existent in Dark Souls 1 cause most of them were there.  Nothing is perfect.  It doesn't mean they aren't awesome games."

,Recommended,236430,10023513,"Posted: 4 May, 2014",all,Massicot,"Alright, everyone I know is playing this and knows what it is and how it is different from Dark and Demon's Souls so I'm not going to retread old ground. Just wanted to post some specific impressions in more of a list form. There will be mild spoilers but nothing explicit:The game is definitely easier than Dark Souls 1 or Demon's. There's no O&S or Four Kings, bosses that you just dread facing. Espcially on NG+. The closest is a mini-boss in the Iron keep that gives a lot of people problems, but summoning an NPC makes the fight a joke. Yeah, summoning is always the easy way out, but in Dark Souls 2 it feels like an ""I Win"" button, where summoning an NPC in the DS1 bosses mentioned above definitely does not guarantee victory. DS2 does have a really hard optional boss, supposedly, but I was given a small hint that effectively breaks the fight. Yeah, again I would have struggled if I went in totally blind, but the hint I was given really isn't anything cheese-worthy or glitchy. I was just told to ""Attack the back foot"" and ""Run to the tail when he flies."". These 2 things alone allowed me to take on the hardest boss while taking very little damage. I didn't have to spec into anything specific for the boss or otherwise prepare for him. There's no such hint for any of the series' bosses in the other games, to my knowledge. No such strategy for Four Kings, to my knowledge.Not being on GFWL is awesome. I had an easy time summoning and being summoned. Never waited for too long for either. Had a couple server disconnection issues though. I loved writing messages and going back to them in NG+ to remind myself which were rated where to see which were more helpful to more people. I made sure to rate messages that helped me to return the favor. Having not played the other games in co-op to any extent, it was awesome to have a friendly phantom show me a secret bonfire, or watch him for a a little bit during a fight to see a response to a boss tell. Summoning typically makes the game very easy, but the ""jolly cooperation"" is still very enjoyable and well implemented.The game is massive. There are a lot of areas and a lot of different bosses. There is some re-use but less than I was led to believe. Going through on NG+ showed me the extent to which some areas were optional, either explicitly out of the way (Belfries) or simply something not required if you go another path (Bastille boss, No Man's Wharf area). I do agree with the complaint that the areas aren't really interconnected to the extent as they were in DS1. They feel more like different roads that intersect at Majula (the hub). There's no real moment where you end up back at where you were and surprise yourself by learning how various shortcuts connect previously separate areas. I don't really see this as an enitrely bad thing, though. Obviously, Demon's Souls was a series of disconnected levels and this just seems a little more like that. It would have been nice to see a greater degree of connectedness, though.The last part of the game was a bit obfusicated about what you had to do to wrap things up. I had to use a guide to learn what to do to take on the last boss. Though this isn't necessarily bad, it just felt a little bit like an unneeded step, or something that could have been done differently.Lastly, I didn't find the areas as memorable, and my reason why might be a little specific but listen to me here and see if you agree. A lot of the enemies and bosses are very ""humanoid"" Very few of the bosses are interesting monsters or creatures, or at least it felt that way to me. There were a lot of enemies that just felt like zombies in different varients of armor. And if they weren't humanoid, they were something uncreative like dogs. No manta rays or leeches or slimes or golems. Yeah, humanoid enemies being the most common isn't anything new, but it felt even more exaggerated here. Tied to this thought, a lot of the areas felt like different variants of ""Fortress"" or ""Keep"" or ""Woods"". This game doesn't have a ""Blighttown"" or ""Lost Izalith"" or ""Painted World"" or the last part of ""Tower of Latria"" or ""Valley of Defilement"" There's something resembling Blighttown, but it's very short, almost throw away, and plagued with a questionable design choice. It is one of the few areas with entirely un-humanoid enemies, though, which is cool.All in all, it's a very meaty game that I enjoyed a lot. It just feels a little luster-less compared to the other two games in the ""series""."

,Not Recommended,236430,10176355,"Posted: 19 May, 2014",all,Cubetwok,"Honestly, I wish I could personally recommend this game. In fact, I’ll start off by saying that if all you care about in a Souls game is the PvE, then this game is alright. It’s not as great as Dark Souls 1 in terms of the world building and how the areas are connected (and also not having an NPC that you must talk to enough times to unlock the rest of the game), but if you want additional challenge and more of the unique Souls combat, then this game will provide that. I also give FROM credit for making the PC port run silky smooth on my moderately-powerful computer – there are still ways to improve (like adding in keyboard prompts instead of Xbox controller prompts for those using the K+M), but it is a step in the right direction from the disastrous Dark Souls 1 port.However, my biggest gripe with this game and the reason that I do not recommend this game right now is that gimmick builds for co-op and/or PvP (which I enjoyed very much in the last game) are a thing of the past. Why?It is all because of Soul Memory. While it is a solution to a problem that existed in the previous Souls games, it creates a whole bunch of new problems that really bog down the experience of either smashing bosses for other players or just smashing other players with a giant club.The problem soul memory was intended to fix was the issue of twinking. To be fair, I can understand why this issue needed to be fixed. In Dark Souls 1, people could legitimately get the red eye orb at a low soul level, equip maxed-out weapons, and face stomp new players who happened to be human in the starting areas. This was an issue that needed to be addressed, especially since in THIS game you can no longer hide from invaders as a hollow.As such, instead of co-op/pvp summon ranges being based off of a percentage of your current soul level, the amount of souls that you have collected over the entire game is used to determine what tier you belong to. By the way, when I say “collected”, I mean that whenever the soul counter increases, so does your Soul Memory, so if you die and drop 100k souls and then go pickup said 100k souls, you have an additional 100k souls added to your soul memory. As your soul memory increases, so does the tier that you belong to. The last tier is at 15 million souls, so once you reach this tier, soul memory no longer plays any factor. You can be invaded by people with 30 million, 100 million, or even 999 million soul memory, and they probably spent most of those souls leveling up to do everything and anything on a single character!This is why Soul Memory is such a terrible solution to the twink problem: it destroys the idea of creating unique characters that are designed around a specific level, a set of gear and maybe a selection of spells. You can't even create gimmick characters for specific areas at specific soul levels since once you gain enough soul memory, the chances of getting summoned in that particular area plummets. Do you want to create a silly gimmick character that helps newbies out by punching things for them? Well too bad, because you’ll eventually be forced to move on from the newbie areas.Do you want to create a low level character to fight in the arena, to invade other low-level players in their worlds, or to protect these low-level players as a blue bro? WELL TOO BAD!In the arenas, you’ll be matched against higher level players that are much better equipped than you. One time, my SL 35 character got crushed by someone who was SL 110! Great matchmaking, FROM…Invading players is limited to cracked eye orbs, which require farming said orbs from the arena (home to high-level players) or monsters (who give out souls whenever you kill one, so enjoy screwing up your soul memory). Sure in new game plus, you can buy the cracked eye orbs, but they cost 10k souls a piece, meaning that you will have to greatly inflate your soul memory if you want to keep a stack of cracked eye orbs on hand.Protecting players requires the invader’s target to be in a specific covenant and that you must wear a ring to be potentially picked as the blue bro who will assist. Adding in the fact that invasions are a rare sight early on and you are really lucky if you even get the opportunity to assist someone…hopefully they don’t die before the level loads for you!I could go on about a lot of other issues (stone ring & poise, weird hitboxes) – those I hope will get fixed or balanced out sometime down the line.

Some of these areas are very scenic and draw you in. However, they don't seem to have the same lasting pull as the first game. But to be fair some areas do leave a strong lasting impression. It feels very hit or miss. The game is pretty long though, like the original. Maybe a bit longer.The combat is the same as Dark Souls 1, so you will feel at home here if you are coming from the original. Most of the old weapons make a return, with quite a few new ones. If you are all about stat crunching, they did change them around a bit. At the time of this review the jury is still out on some of the math.PVP is pretty good. In a PC sense... Way better than the original. It's easier to connect to players. It just sucks when you end up fighting a 3v1 sometimes. But overall it holds true to its roots. Not much has changed.Difficulty. Probably what most people are eyeballing. Is this harder than Dark Souls 1? Personally... Yes and No. Some locations are insanely frustrating, wheras other areas are a walk in the park. If you liked the way the original played out, you'll probably like this one. If anything the game feels very much the same, just a new world with the same engine. Which is nice and refreshing. If anything, I want more.One thing I would like to bring up is the Soul Memory system. Instead of gauging multiplayer on soul level, it is now done off of something called soul memory (Which is akin to the total souls you have gathered). It can make things a bit annoying at times, especially if you are a sunbro and want to help newbies out.I feel the game is pretty good. Especially if you like the atmosphere and playstyle of Dark Souls. I feel I got my time and money out of it, and I still am playing it. I've always had fun rerolling characters and trying to make a perfectly statted character for a certain weapon or playstyle.TLDR: It's Dark Souls, and if you like the original. You should give this one a chance. It's pretty fun."

A great example of when developers misunderstand what it was about their game that made it so popular, this game seems so focused to let you know that it is ""hard"" and ""not for casuals"" that it misses the allure of the previous souls games. First off, is that this game is rarely ""hard."" What you have to do is generally obvious and simple, the only difficulty comes more from the realm of cheap, than hard. Hidden enemies inside of walls that blow up with know way of you knowing they are there, rooms filled with too many enemies to realistically fight yet they are easily skippable as you merely run past them, and a whole mess of over tracked attacks. You are more rewarded for just running and skipping enemies than fighting them, as levels make such an insignificant difference to the power of your character and there are no items worth finding, that you just chain bosses from start to finish.The bosses are all incredibly bland in design. They are, for the most part, merely tall humanoids with 3-4 hit combos which you merely circle as they do them and attack them in the back until they die. Should you actually try rolling out of danger the attacks will nine times out of ten turn into your character as you are rolling. Blocking is often not a great option as many boss attacks will pierce straight through your shield, though that was not absent from prior games either.Just as bland, are many of the areas through which the game takes place. The ease of the fast travel system and how early, the begining of the game, you get it. Makes each zone feel seperate and completely eliminates the interconnected feeling that Dark Souls gave the player. That interconnectedness gave the feel that it was a real area, that these places were in many spots connected and interacted with each other. Dark Souls 2 instead gives a closer feeling to a Mario game of each bonfire being merely 2-4 of a completely self contained area. Thus despite Dark Souls 2 being a larger game, it's world feels much smaller.All in all this game is not really a bad game and as a result whether or not to recommend the game is difficult to classify as a yes or no. The main issue is that it's just so wholly disappointing that it leaves one with a bad taste in their mouths. This rendered the game incompletable for myself as the whole time I just wished I could be playing Dark Souls, a game with interesting characters, a deep and well thought out plot, and an impressive world. Not a bland action role playing game where my only objective is forward and my only reason for forward is because forward.Overall rating: 3/10"

Its believable atmosphere of a ruined and decrepit land is coupled neatly with the grueling combat, constantly pushing players to the skin of their teeth, forcing them to learn from every mistake as they venture through the seamless world of Drangleic.The low amount of NPC interactions in this game is one of the game's noticable traits, but it does little to detract from its quality. With the hallowing journey the players have to go through, they tend to treasure every moment spent with tranquility, justifying the previous design choice.Drangleic is a sprawling world filled with secrets and loot, but not everyone can reach their prizes safely without effort, for the combat system forces you to strategize with every move you make - one false attack can cause a chain reaction that results in your death, and Undeads revive with a steep cost."

The base product is well done, it would be better if they didn't cut out what eventually became the three overpriced DLCs, but the base game is still entertaining. The lore is not as deep, nor as relatable as the first game, but it's still there. If that's what you're into.It's intersting, the first game started linnear and then let you loose as they rushed to meet the release date deadline right after Anor Londo. In this game, it does the exact opposite. Completely letting you off the leash straight from the start. This does well in the beginning, seeing how it's near impossible you won't find a path way to go.Though this system is not without fault, since there are multiple directions, when you finally exhausted mostly every path, it's easy to get lost, forcing me to look on the internet how to get to the next part of the game. An act of which I heavily try to avoid in any RPG related game.Another issue, the game is easy as hell. The only boss I had problems with was ""The Ancient dragon,""  the only reason he was hard was because he killed you in one hit. I saw this to give a false, cheap sense of difficulty when the only reason a boss is hard is not because of their multiple attack patterns, but the amount of damage they dish out. The game also seems to treat you like a child at times when bosses eventually become average mobs. I'm talking about the Rat boss, and the Pursuer.The last issue I have with this game is that the world isn't held together like it was in the first game. In Dark Souls 1, the world constantly had backgounds of where you once were, and new pathways which allowed you to make your way back to that area. In the end, the whole world was connected, which added heavily to the realism of the game, and it's ability to suck me into it's dark and dangrous world. This game is held together by loading screens, and next to no reminder as to where you were. If I looked at an overhead map of the game, I would have no idea where anything was because none of it fits together in a way I could recognize.The Graphics were quite acceptional, the frame rate barely slowed, though there were times where it did. Light reflects off the armor you wear, and sometimes even your weapons, and the cloth areas of your outfit flow in the wind in a very believable fashion.Now comes the treatment of the consumer. B team treated fans of the Dark Souls series like♥♥♥♥♥♥with the release of it's long awaited sequel. Making PC consumers wait one month for its release, (which seems to also be being done with the third game.) lying about the ""there will be no DLCs"" part, and openly admiting that the day one release version of the game was the ""beta version."" Makes me quite sick to the stomach that I even bought this game.The only good things about the game is the combat, which felt very good and well paced with the enemies, it's ability to entertain, and sometimes even surprise. As this games ability to hold its own against the first game, it doesn't even come close.Also, the story is nonexistant. People will argue there's lots of it. That's a lie though, no one truly knows the story except the creator himself.Gameplay: 8/10Story: 2/10graphics: 8/10Consumer treatment: 4/10Overall score: 7/10 ""Not a true sequel, but entertaining"""

This time it's not a rushed console port, at least.I can't find any reasons to consider it better or worse than its predecessor on anything but gameplay/technical aspects, which have been greatly improved. Considering it bad because it's not from the same director is just dumb.There's some small annoyances, like just how much time and effort you'd have to waste trying to rank up on two specific covenants. I had enough with maxing out my devotion on the company of champions after an entire afternoon of farming, but 500 victories each on brotherhood of blood and blue sentinels for rank 3? no thank you. I can also understand why some people are upset about the whole stunlocking thing (no more ""poise tanking""), but oh well, it's just a matter of knowing how to play, it's not like you'll always be stunlocked to death.The combat is pretty fun, I still haven't quite got the hang on this ""PvP"" thing, but I've been in some pretty entertaining fights (didn't care about losing some of them). Coop is also very fun. (I hope you don't hate the word ""fun""). I'm aware that quite a lot of people are on some sort of crusade against the introduction of soul memory, but to be honest, I don't find it so bad, in fact it makes online play at higher levels not feel ""dead"" unless you restrict yourself to a very specific level.I got into Dark Souls not very long ago, hated it at first until I actually stopped being a whiny kid and got good. I'd say it's one of my favorite series now, it has kinda inspired me as a developer sometimes, and I think I might just do a cute little fangame one of these days.Of course, I recommend both games to everyone.PS: The ENB idiots can just kindly GTFO back to their waifu simulators.

That is when I started playing this series and have fond memories of the story, world setting, armor designs, and weapons. The entire package had me drawn in. The feeling of exploration and fantasy, victory and defeat, hanging out with the blacksmith when he fixes my sword, and meeting fellow explorers during difficult times. It was also one of the first games that crossed my fingertips where it could start all over in what was known as a new game mode.Years have passed since then, and I almost wonder if my memories have faded. With no longer any access to a gaming console I thought the ability to play a Souls game would remain only a memory. Then I ran into Dark Souls 2, for PC. From a technical perspective the game runs fine. So far no crashes and the performance seems okay. Lost connection to the online component here and there, and the game is really made for a controller but this should not be a surprise given its roots.As it stands however, this iteration of the game has not left any fond memories. The more I play it, the less I want to continue, not to mention revisit in another timeframe or as NG. The game deserves credit for getting me to take care of some items and chores long overdue on my todo list, as it was more appealing to do work then to play the game, oddly. This is not fun. And the thought of new game mode has me remembering that most of what I played was off, in a wrong kind of way. Not enjoyable at all, to put it simply. The line, whether it is believed to be a fine one or not, has been crossed in a big way.Every step you take in this game has to be checked and then re-checked. You will learn to peek around every corner, and look down at every floor tile. You will learn to keep a stack of 999 arrows in your backpack when you reach the next writing on the floor that reads sniper spot/ranged attack. Then you will spend the next ten minutes chipping pixels of health off a few of the many enemies that exist in the next encounter. All of which can stunlock your character until you fall over. You will find archers/mages with homing arrows/spells placed all over the game world specifically to make melee based encounters massively frustrating. Often times these are in place in narrow areas with fall-to-your-death opportunites right at your side.You will discover that you have a favorite weapon, and then a pile of non-favorites to use when yours breaks on the third enemy away from the bonfire. You will discover that you can be staggered very easily by enemies, and that you can take most of their health away while they do not stagger once. You will discover that enemies do not follow the same game world rules as you do. While your weapon bounces wildly off objects and walls, they can melee through objects and through entire corner sections of walls after you run around for cover. As a result, you'll learn that sipping estus flasks around corners is a massively bad idea. You will discover you have nearly no stamina, and that enemies appear to have unlimited stamina. You will find that no matter how far across the display your health bar reaches, two or three hits always seems to defeat you. The point has been made, I think.These things I know by heart now, due to all the hours spent in this game world. For some reason, continuing on the hopeless journey to find fun. Maybe that was the entire point the game was trying to convey? What I remember to be fun in Demon's Souls does not exist here at all. Entire map sections are created specifically to be the most tedious and boring experiences I've spent in any game to date. You learn to solve every encounter based on 1s and 0s rather than by being immersed in the world and using strategy. My fault for not spending time reading reviews and instead being blinded by a previous experience. I'll try not to make the same mistake next time. Not recommended."

From software very cleverly hid all of the problems in the game in the later parts so as to avoid them being reviewed (as reviews are usually based on a few hours of play).Firstly: They literally false advertised the matchmaking features of the game, ""Soul memory will match players based on a lot of complex factors including character level, areas visited, and gear being used."" This is a blataint lie, the soul memory system merely counts the total number of souls you have obtained in the game and places players into extremely wide brackets based on this total. They completely ignore character level, gear, and everything else they stated but very cleverly made it so the lower brackets (the ones you spend the first 10-20 hours in) are so narrow you can't be matched with a player massively overleveld on you. after you break through the roughly 30 hour barrier tho you are guaranteed to be paired with players who massively outlevel you (200-300 levels higher than you if you are lucky.)Secondly: The netcode is atrocious in this game. google ""dark souls 2 phantom hits"" and have your self a laugh. Certain weapons are particularly poorly coded. Players like to say ""if you swing a katana in new york, you'll hit everyone in california"".I understand lag is an issue but these hitbox problems occur duirng SINGLE PLAYER and OFFLINE. Even if it were unique to multiplayer it would still be no excuse. The infinately superior dark souls had virtually no problems with hit detection or even lag.There are a lot of other issues having to do with balance but those are minor gripes and could easily be overlooked if the core of the game was even half as solid as it's predecessor.If you're on the fence about buying this game you can get off now. If you own it do everyone a favor and don't buy the dlc, do however continue to play it (it costs from money to run the servers and it seems to be the only thing they care about). I love steam but this is one time i wish i had bought a box copy so I could have returned it. I do still recomend the orginal dark souls."

You're here to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by it, not to fall in love with drangleics history. Just understand that everything that isnt you needs killing, so kill everything and you'll progress quite comfortably. No really. Just kill everything that comes at you, get boss souls, kill great bosses to get great souls, then progress to new areas with said great souls. Then spend souls to get new weapons which will assist you in getting souls, not to mention upgrading weapons to improve their soul reaping capabilities. Just assume the storyline is get souls buy stuff get more souls with new stuff, wash rinse repeat.Character Builds- Heavily customisable.No character build significantly overpowers another, and are very flexible. If you want to be a cleric (healer, man o' god sorta bloke) sporting two ultra greatswords you're more than welcome. It's very lenient towards how you want to play. For newcomers its recommended to have some competence with a form of ranged attack, just so fighting multiple enemies at once is slightly easier. Be careful with levelling up though, as you cannot respec until much later on.PvE- Good, but can be rather predictable.You'll initially be met with reasonably slow enemies, and its quite good for new players to get settled in. In order to make the game much easier for you later on, get used to dodging these enemies rather than using shields. Shields seem appealing, but the first boss isn't far in, and if you haven't got used to dodging you can have a real hard time with him. For most players the games difficulty will scale in tune with your own skill at it, and in most areas you're able to get two players to assist you should you need them.Bosses- Not too tough if you're competent with dodging.Though their size may be intimidating at first, all bosses have a set list of moves they can make, with occasional add ons to some of them. The lack in complexity to kill some of them them is often off-set by the massive damage they can deal in a single hit, so dodging skills are crucial. Its worth trying to kill them alone first, as even if you die multiple times you know you'll have improved when you finally succeed. Having phantoms do everything for you will not help you improve.PvP- Will become the bane of your existance.You'll learn to hate this when you first start, but it'll slowly settle to the point where you'll just accept it as a mechanic. Once you're through a sizable chunk of the game, you'll occasionally be invaded by another player, and he's there to kill you. Most players will refer to an ""honor"" system whilst invasions occur, and is generally the following :-1) No healing items. ""buffs"" that do this are fine.2) No running away.3) No phantom summons.4) No hiding.5) Do any of the above and you are subject to the humiliation of a sassy no-no taunt.Plot twist - do whatever the hellyou want. This code only applies when the offending party is winning. Soon as you land a crushing blow on them, they'll run behind an npc and heal. Very few phantoms abide by this code of honor. The games not exactly renowned for being fair - why should you be?DLC CONTENT- And you thought the stock game was hardComplete the main game before you even think of entering these areas. Dark souls doesnt give any warning about the difficulty of these areas, but they really aren't easy areas to solo, experienced or not.The most important part of this review- No really.Keyboard users-TO JUMP, RUN FORWARD AND PRESS C. THAT INFORMATION ALONE WILL SAVE YOU A F***** HOUR TRYING TO REBIND IT.Speaking of which... DON'T TRY TO REBIND. ITS MORE PAINFUL THAN THE GAME ITSELF.Solid 9/10.

,Recommended,236430,10090126,"Posted: 11 May, 2014",all,ichik,"The first summarized feeling that I can express is that it seems to be bigger and a bit longer than original; but to my suprise Steam's statistic shown nearly exact same number of 66 and 62 hours for sequel and first installment respectively.Before we go further I must warn you, that this comes from PVE-carebear who finished this game once and has no intention to do all those crazy NG+ stuff like many hard-core fans seemingly would. I died… well I can't really say a lot, but that's mostly because I summoned two phantoms for every boss and high-faith-lightning-spears-throwing build seems to be incredibly overpowered for beating AI. And I switched to it immediately after things got a bit tough.Before that I approached the same leveling as I did in first game: lots of strength and relying on heavy two-handed weapon (I bouth Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword). That was halfway through the game if you're wondering. I already killed Old Iron King, did both Belfrys, and made it through the Warf, Forest and Bastille. I even finished Grave of Saints. Anyway, it was a pure-melee character. And I encountered those flaming lizards, you know them, if you finished the game. It doesn't matter if you know them, if you didn't. They were hard for me. Like really hard. I did little to none damage to them, but a few tries and that rolling around did the trick: I killed the first one, and then the second one. Third one stomped me. The narrow passage, the death-bringing fire spits, the horros, the wrong time to drink Estus. You know how this happens. The whole way back from the bonfire I hoped that they are treated like mini-bosses, and don't respawn. They did. I realized that either I can spend another hour trying to beat what seems like the hardest challenge I met in the game or I can visit them later. Some poison-arrows, some ranged stuff, which I was lucking. And that's where things got interesting. Rather than finishing later there is third option in sequel, one which original lacked. You can just redistribute your spents souls. And my inventory was crawling with all kind of stuff suitable for caster. And in a thirty minutes I was newly-born battle-cleric.That sweet feeling of smartly overcoming the problem is good enough for me. It may be not as challenging in terms of perfect reaction, precise directional control and ability to automate sequences of same movements, but it doesn't matter for me. What I like in metroidvanias is that little hidden secrets left by developers. And in that sense Dark Souls is a proud member of the genre. Hidden walls, locked doors, smart usage of enemy attacks for opening new passageway, vulnerabilities of certain enemys — and most of those things not only present you with another glimpse of actually rich lore but make you more powerful or capable with dealing with some problem. And that's it, you just have to think and look for clues.Second game's world became a bit more widespread, more star-shaped like with a central hub, that's it. It feels slightly more sensible or easier to decipher, but and in a many ways sequel actually is. Ability to change character build was already mentioned. And then there's less-restrictive weapon upgrading, and special rings that increase your chance to be summoned by your friend rather than stranger. It never goes as far as forcing you to navigate through complete dark area with deadly cliffs all around. That was what first game did. And while I admire this non-compomising approach of the developers, it was not fun. Yes, you could actually find a source of light before heading there, but that was so obscure, that I didn't. And I seriously doubt anyone on first playthrough without a guide would. So Dark Souls II changed a lot of stuff, that wasn't fun. It still sometimes isn't, but at least it doesn't irritate, and that's good.It's steal hard to the limit, that I felt satisfaction beating it. It required time, dedication and work of thought. And it was worth it. It still is in a lot of ways beautiful. With that oblique beaty, that you won't find on the first look. This style develops with progressing in the game, rather than trying to blaze all guns at you at the first second. Of course it's technically crappy, and some locations look even horrible, but the overall design atones it all. It comes a long way from minimalism to grotesque staying true to itself and game atmosphere. And despite all transformations it never looks like an eclectic mess.This post-apocalyptic fantasy world is still deep, depressing and has a lot of history it doesn't really want to share. Or at least it won't if you won't work for it. But that's okay. That's how metroidvanias work."

Not necessarily a bad game, but seriously, just play the first one again and pretend you're playing for the first time.In a nutshell, Dark Souls 2 is what happens when you try to develop a game to be hard rather than develop a game that happens to be hard. In addition, they took feedback and swung way too far in the other direction. O&S was one of the most memorable boss fights, so they made half of bosses in the form of multiple enemies. Parrying was easy once you got the hang of it, so now each enemy and each attack has a specific and particular time to parry given wind-up time, meaning that unless you're playing with a guide/spreadsheet you're not gonna parry. Backstab baiting NPCs was also a viable strategy thanks to invincibility frames, so From made enemies that can spin right round like a record to avoid it. Which wouldn't be a problem if they hadn't arbitrarily broken rolling because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why, now dump precious souls into ADP to make up for us gimping you. Speaking of being gimped, stamina drains ridiculously quickly especially compared to the original. You want to block those magnetic attacks? I bet you do. Damn shame, eh? Now go enjoy getting Beybladed by 2 ruin sentinnels simultaneously so you can't block it all and you sure can't roll under it all. But hey, roll a caster and be OP as hell so there's no problem taking them on. Then get a batstaff and dark fog and be prepared to be overpowered in PvP. Which is just as well, since PvP really barely exists anymore. You have a covenant for ganking, a covenant for grinding for enough items until the map can do your job for you, a covenant that summons in case you get invaded (you won't), a covenant that invades after spending a ridiculous amount of time grinding for orbs (and don't even bother trying to rank up in that covenant), a covenant that invades those who invade (meaning you do absolutely nothing), and a few others that are so inconsequential that I can't even think of them at the moment.Edit: Soul Memory needs no critiquing. Everyone else in the reviews has done so sufficiently, really nothing I can add in that regard. However, what I disliked the most was the finite upgrade items, and in fact the finite items in general. In DaS, you were never once forced into using a weapon you didn't like. You could grind souls anywhere, buy infinite upgrade materials from blacksmits, and change your entire combat technique with relative ease (short of converting to casting). In DaS2, you'd better be damn sure of what weapon you want to use, because one you use the materials you happen to find lying around, you're pretty much boned until the end of your playthrough. Just as well (you'll notice a recurring theme here), since you can't reliably grind on enemies anymore due to despawning after somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 kills and your only other options consist of getting summoned or getting ganked by the bellends (and that ain't happening either if your SM is too high).So to summarize: just play the original. If you've already played the original, play it again. DaS2 may be worth 20 dollars, maybe even 30, but don't you dare even give those incompetent morons 50 full dollars for this thing.Edit: Please disregard my previous notion that it would be worth purchasing for 20 dollars, as it has recently been revealed that the real version is not coming out until spring on consoles and who knows when for PC."

This game only displays the title, but it isn't a sequel to Dark Souls.A sequel, in my opinion, is supposed to be a game that improves and expands upon the original, while still retaining the original's basic feel. New mechanics may be introduced, but they have to be interesting and also fit into the game's world and design for them to work.This game doesn't do any of that.What it does, is put a bunch of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls references in a world that feels more like a (bad) attempt at recreating TESV: Skyrim, rather than being its own, original idea.Honestly, the level design in this is pretty forgettable. The bosses have multiple similarities between them, to the point where you have a hard time distinguishing between them (giant guy with giant weapon, unformed disgusting blob, random decomposing monster, etc.), and are really easy to beat even solo, except of course for THOSE bosses where, just for the sake of making them hard, there are a bunch of enemies together with the boss, constantly running towards you, that you have to deal with in addition to the main enemy.About the multiplayer. The PvP is bad, there's just no other way to describe it. Those far away hits that in Dark Souls only happen while playing against distant people with unstable internet connection? Here happened all the time, every single time. Those sudden teleportations, once every year in Dark Souls? Here it's been one out of three matches.You have to wonder how the netcode got worse, three years later...Now for the funny part.The store page for Dark Souls warns you that it is strongly recommended to be played with a controller, yet it's perfectly playable even with mouse&keyboard, after rebinding some keys to your liking.This game, which ironically doesn't warn you of anything, is exhausting to play with m&k, first because of the natural (intended?) unresponsiveness of the controls, but mainly due to massive input lag generated by the (completely useless) double-click setting. Even though that can be disabled in the in-game options, the setting doesn't actually save between playing sessions and needs to be reset everytime the game is launched. I'm not kidding.At the end of the day, this is a pretty bad game. It destroyed what makes Dark Souls an interesting game, it didn't improve upon the things Dark Souls lacks.I think the reason nobody plays this anymore is because only someone who is new to the series (and to the genre) would actually like this and keep playing after the first time. Or maybe it's because the Scholar of the First Sin remaster killed the playerbase by splitting the community... yeah, that might be it. Lol."

It's easier than 1 and 3, less inspired, the bosses are usually disappointing. I suppose that's all somewhat true, it really is. The bosses ARE mostly easy and uninspired, many taken straight from tried fantasy tropes (a woman with a scorpion for a body -- a woman with a snake for a body). On top of that, some of the earlier bosses are absolute jokes as far as difficulty is concerned. Some of the later ones too. And yes, a lot of the rooms you'll be exploring are pretty unadorned, just stark cubes with enemies in them. Uninspired environments.So that's all true, so why am I recommending it? Well honestly, the most major way in which the game didn't disappoint was in the massive choice it gave you over the path you take through it. From the starting city there are multiple paths you can take through the game at any point, and this only grows as you continue to explore. If you're stuck on or bored with an area or a boss, you can take a break and explore someplace else. Not only that, but the different areas of the game are, in my perspective, very well differentiated. They're mostly very visually unique, each with its own feeling and challenges and secrets to figure out. They also all fit together nicely, lending a very cohesive feeling to the game.So yes, as I said, there are disappointments, but when I think about games that have stayed interesting playthrough after playthrough, this is near the top of the list."

The rest of the series has so far felt way more punishing, harsh, complex... you name it. I jokingly call this one the ""babby's first souls game"" among my friends. Not that it'd be easy, but at least I'm pretty decent in it, which is something I... really can't say regarding the other Souls games.I don't want to talk too much about the other games, but Dark Souls 2 is definitely one of the more, if not the most, straightforward and simple games in the series. Not once did I feel overwhelmed by the bosses, the lore, nor the areas. There were moments when I felt frustrated, but that was a rather refreshing kind of frustration, rather than being annoyed and wanting to ragequit. The AI definitely was dumb at times, but that didn't really make the game any less enjoyable — especially as a dumb AI is sometimes actually harder to predict and plan for.The atmosphere of the game is incredible. Not all the characters were all that interesting, but the areas looked beautiful, or scary, or calming... some really giving a strong impact. The first time I enteredthe gutter, I was legitimately scared. That thumping sound, the all-consuming darkness... I swear it took me a few minutes just to take my first step into the area.In the end, I went ahead and got all the achievements (which, too, was rather easy compared to the other games in the series) as I wanted to keep playing even after defeating the final boss and playing the NG+ for a while. NG+ definitely had a lot of replayability, as even the small changes gave the second run a fresh feeling to it. This game really ended up sucking me in, and now I'm stuck playing both Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, and about to start Bloodborne. Yet I don't feel like playing any of them all that much, as I'm afraid they'll make me feel bad in games. Woe is me.On another note, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the Sin is a thing, too. It's somewhat more difficult, but nothing special. I'm, of course, playing that one too, as Dark Souls II became more or less my favorite Souls game, as it's the one that introduced me to the series. Now, I know that it's not even considered to be a part of the series, especially the lore, but I don't mind. I already know this, I just like the game, and I like the other games, too. It's just, the first one is always the first one, and you can't change that."

,Not Recommended,236430,12031550,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,Raer,"To begin with, i've tried beating this game to write a proper review, but the problems with this game just pile up to the point where it's not worth finishing. To begin with, this game is leagues worse than the first one from game design to reusing enemies to overall terrible feel. The games art and atmosphere is fantastic. Top notch, but that doesn't substitute for gameplay. This game takes 10 steps back for every graphic they improved. The combat is sloppy. Bosses that used to relay tactics are gone, its just luck of the draw, and hope that there's a phantom to help you absorb these arbitrary attacks, no hit detection. PVP is botched beyond belief. Countering is really useless now. Shields don't even have a purpose, other than to look cool. Attacks mostly pierce your shield and do damage to you and your stamina. Dark Souls usually complimented its tone with a decent story, yes it's about killing things, and dying (clearly) but a response or feedback of what you're doing is a MUST. The story makes absolutley no sense. You have no sense on what your purpose is, why things are the way they are or what you're gonna do to make it better or why you're doing things. The design of ""worlds"" makes a massive dissconnect from the rest of the game, it's not about feeling as everything is connected and lead to a single focal point as in Dark Souls 1 with the Firelink Shrine. You just go from here to there, teleport there, die, teleport here to farm things and hope you can kill them. It just defeats the purpose of having a world. Why not just have a level select? As stated the graphics are phenomenal. But Dark Souls could do so much better. I consider myself a hardcore gamer, but the Dark Souls that made it your fault that you died, doesn't exist anymore, this game is literally botched PVP, reused enemies that don't give a sense of what their attacks are going to be. The game. For graphics alone I would give this point a 4/10. For gameplay and story and feeling: 1/10 Would not recommend.*Edit* After beating the game and finishing one DLC, I still stand by my review as this game being botched. Nothing has changed, and no signs of From Software trying to fix any issues."

Well no, but it's far from a terrible game.This time arround the PC port is much improved, Keyboard and Mouse actually work, no modding required this time, same with the graphics. Still plently of room to prove but this port is defenantly much improved over Dark Souls port, and since this is only the second PC port From has done, I'm ok with letting the few minor issues slide. Rome wasn't built in a day after all, and one can not expect a develuper to suddenly turn out 'the best PC ports ever' after one game.So what all is diffrent with this port. The menus are all mouse driven, the keyboard controls are all set up in a manner a normal human would use, for the most part. There's still no slotting items and spells to the number keys for quick use, probably never will be ether due to balancing reasons, and theres just a lot more options for settings and such then before. all in all not the best port, but again, a good couple sets above Dark Souls.Now, what about the game it self?Well, it's kind of a mixed bag.Combat remains largely unchanged, all the skills and habbits you picked up in Dark Souls will translate, for the most part, unmolested, to Dark Souls II. For the most part, charging in and trying to face tank things with get you dropped in a hurry, and a good shield is still your best friend as is being slightly paranoid while playing. One thing they changed is what enemys spawn in groups. In Dark Souls, the much tougher enemys spawned alone  and far enough away from every thing else there was little to no chance of drawing in more enemys. In Dark Souls II this has been changed so that those tougher enemys, like the Mastadons and Everything in the Dragon Shrine spawn two or three deep. This applys to the bosses as well, as there are FAR more boss fights that involve more then one boss monster at a time, or bosses that spawn more enemys in general. The problem is, the Combat system is still only designed for one on one combat, which makes these bosses and enemys more harder then they needed to be. That said though, the game is actually easyer then Dark Souls.This has to do with all the healing Items avaible to you, as there are ten diffrent items that restore HP in Dark Souls II, as a frame of refrence, there are only two in Dark Souls, three if you count the item that gives a temperary HP boost. No only are there a lot of diffrent healing items, most of them are in abundence, some being buyable in infinute amounts after certain points, same applys to the ores needed to upgrade equpiment, though to a far lesser degree. another thing that makes the game easyer is the 'genocide' mechanic, as I've taken to calling it. What it does is put a respawn limit on enemys, meaning if your farming souls to level up or what have you, you WILL run out of enemys to kill, after around twelve times or so. There is an Item you can use to get another twelve respawns but that also puts that area in NG+ mode, so care needs to be used lest you screw your selfAnother area which is mixed is the area designs. While the all look good and carry a good atmosphere befitting a Souls game,  some of them feel ... generic, and worse then that, they have no flow to them. Most noteable is the transition from Earthen Peak to the Old Iron Keep. (you take an ELEVATOR, from the top of a broken tower/windmill with nothing around or above it, into an active volcano.) or Aldia's Keep to Dragon's Aerie/Dragon Shrine, which also makes no geographical sence. mInd you, the areas all look nice, but that lack of geographical continuity took a lot away from the game for me, however I belive this issue is the direct result of two choices. 1) Dark Souls II isn't an open world like Dark Souls, its a hub world like Demons Souls (minus the teleporting to the areas to get into them intitally) 2) You can warp via the Bonfires right from the start, unlike in Dark Souls where you where most the way into the game before that unlocked.Enemy designs are  lack luster, with WAY to many of them being some veriant of 'guy in armor', normal enemys, the tougher mods, even bosses, are, for the most part are just 'a guy in armor', granted, some of them, like the Black Dragon Knights, look awesome, but if your like me you'd be tired of seeing some guy in armor long before the end of the game, and the lore of the game does little to improve things. It has it's bright spots to be sure, and like Dark Souls it is fertal grounds for debate, it's just not up to the bar set with the first game.Another misstep is PvP, while it 'works' better mechanically, it's actually a worse system. First of all, if your not into PvP, tough,  ether deal with the invasions, or go offline, those are your only options. This is because you can now be invaded as a Hallow as well as human now which can be something of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Another issue is the match making. while I'll freely admit I don't understand how it works, I know it's got to do with your Soul Memory and not your Soul Level, like in Dark Souls and I know a lot of people where complaining about having issues finding some one in PvP because of it, I don't think its been corrected yet ether so just be aware if PvP is your thing. A more personal issue that is likely to REALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥new players off is how easy it is to stumble into two PvP zones. The Saints Grave and Doors of Pharos are both set in such away that if you don't know those are optional zones, your very likely to wander in and then you'll have to deal with the PvP 'fun' of the Rat Coven, again, if PvP isn't your thing, be aware.Speaking of the Covens, if your not into PvP, most of them will be worthless to you, if you are, well, only some of them will be if only due to the rewards not being worth the effort (unless your talking about the Blue Sentinals, in which case your better off killing the Coven leader because he drops the armor you get for metting the rediculous requirments to max it out), and even then, there no penalty for abbandoning one for another which kinda makes only being allowed to be in one Coven at a time silly.Over all, as a Successor to Dark Souls, it fails to live up to the standard set. That said. As a video game devoriced from Dark Souls. It is still a very good, well built game that most every one seeking a challenge and a game that doesn't hold your hand can enjoy if they have the right mind set for it."

,Recommended,236430,13018316,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,David Sid,"This is the best action role-playing game sinceDark Souls.What I LikedEasy to learn, hard to master: Weapons can attack one-handed or two-handed, right-handed or left-handed, quickly or forcefully, and they have special attacks after running or rolling. Attack combos are never more than two button presses. Shields, bows, and catalysts work like weapons, but block, shoot, or cast instead of attacking. Regardless of what you wield, you can run, jump, roll, and use items. That's pretty much it;Dark Souls 2's actions are simple and intuitive. However, using them effectively requires much more attention than is needed in far more complicated games. For example, inTekken 6, once a long combo is started, muscle memory can do all the work for a good five seconds. InDark Souls 2, every single action must be carefully chosen, timed, and placed.Ernest Hemingway: ""If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them.""Dark Souls 2applies this idea to its story and setting, and the result is quite compelling. Even the significance of the final boss is something you probably won't immediately understand—but there is at least one good explanation for that and for just about everything else in the narrative. You can find that explanation if you take the time to find all the clues and put them together. (And if you don't care to do so, there are plenty of good lore videos on YouTube to do it for you.)Massive replay value: There are countless possible variations for player characters, both aesthetic and mechanical. The eight classes are each tailored to a different combat style, yet even they don't represent every viable style (e.g. pyromancy and hexing don't have dedicated classes). It may be illustrative to note that of the 650 hours I've spent on this game so far, themostI've spent on one character has been 150 hours.Originality: Feel free to design your character as the typical JRPG protagonist (long-haired, pale-skinned, improbably young)... You will spend much of your first playthrough as the hideous green walking corpse of that character.Dark Souls 2defies many tropes of both Western and Japanese RPGs (perhaps because it's a Japanese take on Western fantasy). It's not entirely aDarker and EdgierDeconstructor Fleet, though; rather, it intermixes strongly contrasting elements—beauty and ugliness, light and dark, benevolence and malice—in a way that makes these extremes more striking when encountered.Well-balanced items: There are heated discussions in theSoulscommunity about this or that overpowered weapon, armor, ring, or spell. What I've noticed, however, is that in my encounters with other players, there's plenty of variety in equipped items—which suggests that there are very few truly dominant items.What I DislikedSome assembly required for KB&M: Keyboard and mouse are quite usable (unlike the unmodded first game), but onscreen button prompts display Xbox 360 buttons instead of your key bindings. The default bindings are also not very good, so if you're a KB&M enthusiast, expect to spend your first hour setting up bindings, and expect to spend your first few hours getting used to them.Important: In order to detect double-clicking, the game waits a half-second after each mouse click before executing the associated action. You can use the ""Disable double clicking"" option to remove this delay, but as of Version 1.07, this only works until you quit. Each time you restart the program, you must turn ""Disable double clicking"" off and then on again for it to take effect.What I RecommendConsider playing the first game: You don't need to playDark Soulsto understandDark Souls 2, but the former is an equally great game. Each has strengths and weaknesses, relative to the other, but the only real reason toright nowplayDark Souls 2instead of its predecessor is that the online community is somewhat more active in the newer game (as of November 2014). If you do playDark Souls, and if you use the keyboard and mouse,DSfixandDSMfixwill helpa lot.Don't read walkthroughs during your first playthrough: Many of the challenges inDark Souls 2are greatly diminished if you read online about the ideal tactics. It's much more satisfying to win a fight through your own wits than to apply someone else's methods for an easy win. You can get some hints from the in-game messages left on the ground by other players, but these are limited, so that they rarely give you the whole solution to a problem.Other CommentaryHonor in PvP: By design, most PvP is asymmetric: In an invasion, the host can heal and summon help, but the invader can hide behind monsters. In Rat King Covenant PvP, the summoner can use the entire level against the victim, but the summoner is also the only one with anything to lose. Because PvP is so rarely fair, honor is rarely appropriate. If you really want an honor duel inDark Souls 2, here's the best way to go about it:Go to Iron Keep and use a dragon sign (or place your own).When the opponent appears (or when you're summoned), move to just inside lock-on range and bow.If the opponent bows in return, start drinking your Estus and see if they do the same.Once you both have used up your Estus (as signified by the ""no more Estus"" animation), an honor duel can begin.It precludes an honor duel if someone uses a buff or moves to an advantageous position before the duel begins.Soul Memory: Nothing is more intensely criticized by theSoulscommunity than Soul Memory—the quantity of souls your character has ever possessed, which is used for online matchmaking. There are two common criticisms.Souls can be permanently lost but still contribute to Soul Memory, so that two characters of vastly different power levels could be matched, because one has permanently lost far more souls than the other.One cannot maintain characters optimized for multiplayer against a specific boss or in a specific area, since one's Soul Memory will eventually surpass the range of most other characters fighting that boss or in that area.I tend to think both criticisms are blown out of proportion.Dark Souls 2's logarithmic power curve makes it so even someone who's permanently lost half their souls is only at a small disadvantage against someone who's permanently lost none. Also, if characters could stop their Soul Memory from increasing—even if it meant making their saved games essentially read-only—this would allow too much optimization for specific circumstances, making these ""locked"" characters far more effective than those moving normally through the game. Soul Memory is not a perfect system, but early-game invasions are much more manageable inDark Souls 2than in its predecessor, and I'm pretty sure that's because of Soul Memory."

I agree with many of the criticisms that have been thrown at this sequel, such as boss design that can't even compare to the first game (with a few exceptions), the world that seems rushed and nonsensical, and the enemy encounters that are trivialized by simply baiting them one by one.Despite these flaws, I'd be hard pressed to call Dark Souls 2 a bad game. From my time with it totalling around 300 hours on console and pc combined, I've thoroughly enjoyed most of it. I love the gameplay that presented more viable options for builds than the first, I love the lore that the minimalistic story is built around, I love many of the individual environments (especially in the DLC), and I love the feelings of futility and hopelessness that permeate the entire experience.While my favourite in the series remains the first Dark Souls by a considerably large margin, I still love the second entry in the franchise and I highly recommend you check it out and form your own opinion on it.Also, if you do care about PvP and/or slightly better graphical fidelity, go with Scholar of the First Sin. Otherwise, I'd recommend this edition. The new enemy placements don't do much for the experience except artifically inflate the difficulty."

I think they don't really care about the game itself as the artistic product, but merely as a medium for their metagaming experience. Convenience is all about metagame and DS2 is definitely more convenient.For the first group DS is all about the game experience and the immersion. And from this point of view DS2 is absolutely abysmal. Every single design decision of the DS2 is simply not working in favor of game. What's worse, every bad design decision triggers a cascade of other problems and they snowball.* Levels are poorly connected, and often make no sense thematically.* NPC are completely uninteresting and too verbose.* The lore and story are virtually non existing.* Bosses are repetitive, often use the same movesets and are mostly recycled versions of other enemies.* Soul memory is not really working in favor of local coop.* Closely placed bonfires break immersion.* You have to go back to hub to level up which breaks immersion even more.* If you are using rings of protection you are completely deprived of any sense of challenge.* If you are not using ring of protection, you are faced with extremely limited human effigies and inability to farm them (as monsters are limited in this game).I can go on and on about it, but I guess you can get my point."

The story and the enemies are sure great, but it just doesn't feel like Dark Souls anymore.The best comparrison is the fight against the boss Old Dragonslayer, who's clearly based on a boss in Dark Souls I. There he was a real challenge, fast, agile and powerful, while in DS II he is slow and predictable.I don't want to say that you shouldn't play DS II at all, but the 32-bit version isn't worth your money, especially as you have to buy the DLC's seperatly from the game.

I am going to indulge into Dark Souls 1's problems so you understand exactly what From has done to ""fix"" them.From Software made Dark Souls 1, and even patched and balanced a few things in it that were a major issue, though this took a long, long time. The fixes made me happy. The PvP imbalances at the time were put to rest, but there were still issues. ""Twinks"" (Players upgrading their weapons and gear without levelling up, resulting in them invading lower-leveled, unskilled players and destroying them) were an issue, though they were few and far between. The invasion covenant, though difficult (in my opinion) to get to, allowed players an easy way to absolutely wreck other players, whilst the lawful covenant saw little action. There were also things such as grinding that people dealt with. All in all, Dark Souls had its problems, but it was such a beautiful and great game with great combat (ignoring infamous ""backstab fishers"" and ""lagstabs""), a good PvP scene with an even more amazing PvE environment that truly felt connected as you walked through the land.Dark Souls 2 does not contain this.From has tried to correct many issues by making them the exact opposite of what they were. In essence, they've made previous problems worse in completely new and exciting ways.1. Poise, the system of how-many-hits-you-take-until-you-flinch, was nerfed into the ground. It is no longer viable as you can get stunlocked by daggers wearing heavy armor. Daggers.2. Twinking has been ""fixed"" by the horrid hellspawn, Soul Memory. Soul Memory is the new way you connect to others, not Soul Level like the previous game. Basically, when you kill an enemy or a boss, whether you spend those souls or simply possess them, you have increased your Soul Memory. The higher your Soul Memory, the higher the tier of players you will be matched with.    You cannot help someone on a boss forever like Dark Souls 1. Neither can you invade the same area. You are leveling up whether you choose to or not.3. The invasion covenant requires you to rank up points in an arena where your losses make you lose points if you want to get the item to invade other players. However, you are going up against min/max genius SmelterHavels or Havelyns because the arena doesn't care about whether you're NG or NG+ like normal. You can be stuck in a permanent limbo unless you upgrade the difficulty of the bonfire area and buy the orbs for obscene prices, and even then, if you get too many souls, you are forced to level up and move on instead of stay in an area and act as an obstacle for a player. Because making the game difficult is From's job, not yours, kids. Except it's not difficult.4. Grinding and Difficulty has been dampened. If you kill an enemy X amount of times, they will stop spawning unless you upgrade the difficulty of the bonfire. This would make grinding a terrible inconvenience, but sometimes it doesn't even make the enemies too much harder, removing any actual NEED of putting a kill-limit on enemies! It also allows any old fool capable of killing at least a single enemy a certain amount of times the ability to pass and join the ranks of actually decent players.5. Fast Travel right off the bat. I had an issue with Dark Souls, I admit it. The land was damn huge. You had to walk to every here and there, miles upon miles, until you got the item required to Fast-Travel. I have enjoyed Dark Souls 2's Fast-Travel, but I now realize how terrible it is to implement it so early. You do not appreciate your environment. In Dark Souls 1, you walked through the entire land, looking at surroundings, understanding the key points, where enemies were, how to surpass them, all the way up until you got the Fast-Travel item. Even then, it didn't warp you EVERYWHERE. But in Dark Souls 2, the world becomes a series of Bus Stops. You're no longer looking around you and enjoying the sights, but travelling from A to B as if hurrying to work. It becomes mundane, and any flair in the world surrounding you becomes futile as you can simply pass it by through the simple act of lighting one of the millions of Bonfires scattered around everywhere.There are many more problems involving bugs and glitches that are yet unfixed that allow people to pass certain blockades without the requirements, as well as cheaters that either cheat to troll or simply cheat so they can surpass the utter nonsense of Soul Memory's constant oppression.Buying this game was a terrible choice, for I feel it may never be fixed, yet I wish I could play it. Please reconsider your decision of buying this game unless you can live with a dampened PvP scene, a dampened PvE scene, and a disappointing sequel. I am honestly sorry I have to type this, because I really, really want to play and love this game, but at this point, I just can't."

First Souls game with native HD and beyond resolutions for PC. Also the 60 FPS was a very important ""must"". The plot and lore are not that great as Dark Souls PTDE but it has his own good moments.This new entry is full of new items and some other little interesting mechanics like the coffin of Things Betwixt, the life gems and some new covenants. It was fun to discover them through the game.The humanity thing remains but this time is easier to handle. In general Dark Souls II has a lot of things to make the difficulty of newcomers easier (wich I recommend you don't abuse if you played a Souls before).About Souls and leveling this time you do it between Emerald Gerald in Majula. Similar to the Maiden in Black from Demon's Souls Nexus.About visual and sound...mmm... Visually is not mind blowing but is an step forward from PC Dark Souls with DS Fix. The art looks fantastic in lighting terms. Maybe is different in it's style in terms of environments and enemies design. A lot more cliche but enjoyable. Oh! rag doll is off in this game...and the lighting and assets from it's first gameplay shown to the world ¬¬The sound design (foley etc) is good. But the music score is something I recommend you didn't expect to be better than previous games. But is good!...Take listen to Demon's Souls for instance. It has some interesting flutes and leitmotifs wich are missing on the next game. I find the Intro, Phalanx or the adjudicator one the most memorable ones. In Dark Souls there's a great variety of styles and there's even more memorable songs. And unfortunate for those who love the music of this games Dark Souls II is kind of flat...epic but flat. That doesn't mean i doesn't have it's moments ;)About the important thing...Gameplay. It's almost the same but more responsive and smooth. The kick was replaced for the shoulder push. But there's a lot more weapon styles even bare hands styles. I find my self on PvP with players with very strange setups xD and of course two hackers in a few months (I'm not very expect on the PvP thing). The only downside here is that ""Soul Memory System"" wich is not optional.The co-op. Now you can summon two players the NPC of the area you're (if it's available) and an internet player. This can make the game much easier. I don't recommend this much. I find myself solving some bosses with this method and then feeling horrible haha. But never again!Mmmm Boss Fights...they're not that interesting as the areas they're on. But there are some of this friends wich you'll hate at the same level as before.I think Dark Souls II is not a bad entry at all (BTW Hidetaka Miyazaki just supervised it but it wasn't it's director). We can't say is a bad game. Maybe a transition. I think it's better than have a hole until Bloodborne is released and of course it deserves it's price ;)"

There's nothing quite like it anymore either. Games have become far too easy. Far too ""casual"" to use the vernacular.This game is the counter to that. It starts hard and you can increase the difficult as much as you like either by starting New Game Plus (NG+) over and over, getting harder each time, or you can use items at the game's bonfire's that will increase the difficulty in that specific area permenantly. There are advantages to doing this, however, and many items / spells etc will only drop / become available on harder NG+.The community is also one of the more helpful that i've found. It being a mainly single player experience, but with the opportunity to do some ""jolly co-op"" by summoning allies to help fight difficult areas or tough bosses you feel you want a hand with. You can also go help others in order to gain various benefits. There is also the option to be a dickbag and invade other players with the sole purpose of killing them and stealing their humanity. Either way it's all tied together with the fantastic combat system.The gameplay is brutal but fair. Even fairly ""basic"" enemies can still kill you far into the game if you mess up your block or dodge or parry. But equally you can read their patterns and learn how to deal with them without taking any hits once you're practiced.There is so much to explore, so many side quests to uncover, secrets to puzzle out, hidden walls and illusions to find. You can play as a high strength / dex blademaster build then change your mind and respec to a full on fire throwing lightning slinging magic user when you feel like it using a (somewhat) rare consumable.On the topic of magic.... spells in Dark Souls are JUST as punishing as weapons. If not MORE so. There are some insanely powerful spells in the game and the limited uses per spell before you need to rest at a bonfire allows for them to be balanced. The sheer insane variety of ways to play and different builds available makes it a game i'm STILL not bored of, and STILL discovering more and more about. I've not even started the DLC's yet and i'm over 150 hours in on my main character.Sadly bows are somewhat lacklustre in the Souls universe which i attribute to balance reasons. They tend to require a lot of stamina to shoot compared to similar weight melee weapons, and their damage is pretty limited for the most part. There are some greatbows that launch treetrunks at people and can do heavy damage, but are so slow to fire and in pvp will leave you an easy target. I've always loved archery and all things bow related in my games, but even with the limited power of bows in Dark Souls II i'm happy with my Hunter's Blackbow +10's damage output. It's the fastest firing bow and takes less stamina than most. I combo it with poison arrows and can poison 90% of enemies in 1 volley (how many arrows i can fire before out of stamina) which is extremely useful in certain areas. Even with my love of bows, and normal preference for ranged classes, i don't find myself caring in DSII. The melee weapons are so varied and satisfying to use that i'm perfectly satisfied to use a mix of ranged bow shots to pick off tougher enemies / thin the pack, before taking out the rest with my swordplay.The whole game just feels so incredibly satisfying when you get good, and even when you ""think"" you're good, there's always the other player invaders to show you how wrong you are :P"

Apart from a few points of light in the distance and the orange glow that comes from the bonfire behind you, you can't see anything. You decide to light your torch, which casts its light over a small area around you. You don`t have much oil left to keep it burning, but it will have to do. Cautiously, you start moving.After scouting the location a little, you realize you are at the top of a big rock overlooking a dock. In the far distance, an immense ghost ship lies floating in the water. Somehow you feel that's where you are supposed to go.The path from the rock to the docks leads you through an abandoned village, now inhabited only by the undead. Creeping from every corner, they lunge at you from the darkness. Street after street and house after house you make battle with them, getting each time closer to the docks. The voyage takes more time than you previously expected though, and soon your weapon begins to degrade from beating against the metal your enemies were wearing at the time of their deaths.Soon, you find yourself with just an almost broken sword, no more healing items and a torch whose light is about to fade away. You are, however, much closer to the ship. You can see it more clearly now, its ragged sails wavering in the wind, calling you. Taking a deep breath, you go for the final stretch of the journey, hoping your now depleted inventory will be able to get you there in one piece.You find the bell that calls the ship to port just as the light of your torch finally dies. This is it, you`ve made it. Now all you must do is board the ship and hopefully a bonfire will be waiting for you at the deck. What you find inside though, is disappointing: more enemies. They are dispatched quickly but that doesn't do any good to your already worn off sword.You find the stairs leading to the ship`s quarters. That has to be it. By the end of these steps you hope only to find the long awaited bonfire, a place where you can rest, recover your healing items and fix your gear. Step after step you descend anxiously, turning the camera at the end to explore the room at which you arrive.The room is empty, except for a table, some chairs and... a fog door, which indicates a boss fight is imminent.  That's all you didn't need right now. Without any means to recover your health and carrying only a dull blade, the terrifying prospect of having to walk through that entire dark place all over again starts to creep up on you. Without any other choice, you buckle up and cross the damned gate.The vision that greets you is terrifying. A pair of giant skeletons, bound to each other like siamese twins, each armed with a pair of blades are already walking towards you, their feet chirping in the water that covers the floor of the flooded room. Without any items to recover your health, you know you can't afford to take even a single hit. So you raise your shield and keep your distance, studying the movements of the beast. After avoiding a few of its attacks you start feeling confident and are able to deliver them a few hits when their guard is down.The fight progresses slowly, as you only attack when you are sure it's safe to. The boss' movements are easy to predict and it starts to feel that victory will be yours, so long as you keep your strategy going.The skeletons' health drops to its half. Again they move to deliver the same pattern of attacks they've been doing since the beginning of the fight. You know how to react: just roll to the right, wait for them to raise their blades again, roll again to the right... and unexpectedly get hit in the face by a blow that totally shouldn't have gotten you. What happened? You were able to dodge all of their attacks so far, but this last one hit you despite you having done exactly the same movements as before.As you try to gain some distance from the creature, you notice you are moving slower. Why is this happening? The fight that was almost a sure victory has become a real nightmare. As the monster lifts his blades in the air for yet another blow, you realize in terror what has been going on: the water level in the room has been steadily rising since you entered the area.Welcome to Dark Souls."

The world doesn't feel as interconnected as it did in the original however and this is disappointing to me.As a PC port, this is far more polished. It still has issues and requires some workarounds and outside mods to play perfectly on mouse/keyboard but it is a damn bit better than the original."
,Recommended,236430,10138331,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,Arkham,"So i've recently been asked to write a full review of this game while completely ignoring that its a part of the souls series. As such i'm going to do just that.While the game is not a bad game it is flawed in many ways. Allow me to explain why.1 - Being hardNow, i say that its hard, but I'm not complaining about it being hard in the traditional sense. I'm not asking for an easier game either since in my opinion that'd be 20 kinds of dumb.I'm complaining about this because, while i enjoy a good challenging game, this game is hard just for the sake of being hard.Allow me to exemplify. There is an optional area in the game where the boss consists of 4 minions and the boss itself. The boss is untargetable until you attack one of the 4 minions, meaning you can't weaken him before commencing the fight. As for the minions, the second you attack one of them the remaining 3 immediately become agressive and attack you giving you around 5 seconds or so to dispatch them before the boss drops into the area and begins attacking you as well. This would be fine if the minions didn't inflict a status effect that deals a large ammount of damage over time with a mere 2 hits. This means you have to deal with the 4 minions, as quickly as possible, without getting hit twice and possibly have to deal with the boss itself should you fail to dispatch the critters in time.This is not what i'd call challenging, but as a gigantic pain the the neck instead. This isn't the only fight where this happens, but i'd rather not delve too much into it.2 - CombatWhile combat itself is pretty okay, i have some problems with it. Call it nitpicking if you will but there are just some things that don't really feel right.The hitboxes feel off sometimes, there's no other way to describe it, while playing i'll sometimes  see the effect caused by a weapon clearly hitting my opponent without it actually happening, and it makes me wonder if something is actually wrong with either my game or my computer.Another interesting little thing is that enemies never grow tired. The game itself has a stamina mechanic that forces you to think before you act, but enemies can dish out a flurry of attacks even though (from the story's/game perspective), they're in the same pseudo-zombified state as the player, the same can be said for their attack tracking ability, by this i mean there are certain enemies that will literally turn 180 degrees while in the middle of an attack just so they can attempt to hit you (in fact this was so bad in one specific enemy, that the developers actually had to reduce the tracking capabilities on said enemy's projectiles).This feels a bit off, and dare I say, makes the game harder, just for the sake of being harder.3 - Covenants.This'll be a short one. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. That's it. when you interact with someone or something that allows you to join a covenant, you get no information about what you're getting yourself into. In fact this occurred to a good friend of mine. While he was playing he found an object that allowed him to join a covenant, simply asking him if he's ready to face a bigger challenge. He then found out that by entering this covenant his damage was reduced and that he was unable to summon any NPCs or players into his world for help.I may be mistaken, but there are several several possible outcomes when one decides do say that something will result in a bigger challenge. Usually people who decide to face a bigger challenge know what sort of mess they're getting themselves into.This isn't the case.4 - NPCsInteraction with NPCs isn't really anything to write home about in most games, but some things in Dark Souls 2 annoy me.Allow me to exemplify. In this game you are only allowed to level up by speaking with one specific NPC. Now instead of opening the menu and letting said NPC talk while you're navigating through the menu you are forced to skip 4 dialogue segments before you are finally allowed to level up.Now, in this game you'll be interacting with this NPC quite a few times, seeing as this is the NPC that allows you to increase the number of innate healing items you possess in your inventory along with allowing you to level up. The result is that these ""interactions"" become extremely annoying extremely early in the game. Truth be told this is not something that should happen when you're dealing with an ""important"" NPC, or any other NPC for that matter.5 - PvPLast but not least, we have PvP. An addition to the game that should be fun filled, challenging and overall allow the player to enjoy him/herself even more.If it was actually balanced that is.Now in PvP (or Invasions) your goal is to either defeat the invader or the invaded (depending on whether you're invading or being invaded), but lets talk about accessing PvP first. there are 3 main PvP covenants within the game. One of them grants you a ring that automatically summons you into one of two areas in the game where you must face off against the player that set foot within that area. As a reward for this you get titanite chunks, which are relatively hard to come by and allow you to reinforce your weapons and armor.The remaining two covenants make mostly use of cracked eye orbs (although one of these covenants gives you a ring that allows you to aid players from another covenant while said players are being invaded). The thing is, in your first playthrough, you are only given access to a limited number of orbs, making invasions during your first (and possibly even last) playthrough limited as well. Please note that these covenants require an immense ammount of invasions for the player to rank up (requiring a total of 500 victories for the player to achieve the third and final rank).As for a way of replenishing eye orbs the player is given two options. Duel against players from the same covenant or buy them for a ridiculous ammount of souls in New Game +. Dueling on its own is a pain because you have to consume a different token for each covenant (these are obtained by either using eye orbs and defeating an invaded player, or by aiding another player as a phantom).As a result, invasions during a player's first playthrough are extremely rare should you decide not to venture into the area protected by the 1st mentioned PvP covenant.That aside there is also the case of extreme unbalance. The game features spells that can easily instantly kill a player for a measly soul cost or buff already hard hitting weapons along with weapons with a ridiculous attack speed or maybe even phantom reach (meaning that their reach is longer than it actually appears to be).My main issue with this is that some of the builds that focus on using these spells/weapons, are relatively easy to make, and as a result my PvP experience went downhill at an astonishing speed.Weaponry aside, invaders are unable to recover HP without resorting to spells. Making it so that even if the invading is actually fighting well, and in a fair way, nothing is stopping the invaded player from running away/hiding so that he/she may recover HP and then rush back into the fight without almost any form of punishment whatsoever. This just helps make PvP even more unbalanced (not to mention the fact that a player may summon 2 other players to their aid, turning the fight into a 3 vs 1 where the opposing trio has the ability to regenerate health).6 - ConclusionPlease note that these are my opinions and that people are free to disagree with me, its also likely that its just me who's just bad at the game in which case i've been trying to git gud for a very long time, but the game as a whole has several blatant design flaws once you take a very good look at it, and while it is good on its own, it could have been a much better game in the end. So while i do recommend this game, i'd wait for a discount."

I love Dark Souls 2 (and I think I'm one of the few that like it better than Dark Souls 1). But......If you are new to the Souls series, or don't yet own Dark Souls 2 for the PC, don't buy this game. Wait until Scholar of the First Sin comes out in 2015 (currently slated to be released in April). It is purported to be a vastly improved experience, with new enemies, NPCs, and quests - along with improved graphics. It will run in DX11, so make sure your computer will be able to handle it.I DON'T like the fact that they will make the people who already own Dark Souls 2 re-purchase a game that is essentially an updated/patched version. It would be one thing if it were a DLC patch. But buying the entire game again and (most likely) losing all game progress? Not to mention the two games will be on differnt servers and thus unable to play with one another, thus splitting the already-limited community. What the hell, From Software? That's an incredibly unethical business practice if I've ever seen one. It makes EA, Ubisoft, and Activision look goddamned consumer-concious by comparison.Sigh. Not sure if I'm actually going to buy the new game or not. I want the better version, but I don't want to support a blatant cash-grab that is clearly just aiming to milk our wallets.

It provides nerve racking experiences aslong with a side of endless frustration, and rage inducing anger. But without that, it wouldn't be a Souls game. The strongest points of the game are its story, which is never really fully explained in the game itself, and how unique the game is and the experiences it gives you. From seeing the character you have worked along side for hours and hours, finally take his place on the Throne of Want. And seeing the once been towering ex-king of Drangleic walking slowly in repeated patterns in the god forsaken Undead Crpyt. From the struggle to beat the last giant, to finding that set of armour you want, to taking your place on the throne. This is a game that you build your own story with, and have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. I am in love with every nook and cranny of this game. 10/10 extremely recommend it."

A new player will have a bit more difficulty then the experienced player,but even the experienced player messes up and can die. The PvP in this game is my one quarrel with this game,it is very unbalanced and needs work especially the arena,I promise you that most of the time it takes me forever to find someone to play with,and even when you do connect to someone it is usually a very cheap build that doesn't take very long to make while someone else tries to make a fun build that takes forever that will only be shot down online.

Bad controls on keyboard and mouse, and missing alot of the lightning and features I wished was included which was talked about in videos. Also hackers are annoying and yeah they still exist when ya kill them and get  millions souls outta nowhere as a new char and that can really screw up YOUR game because of soul memory system.. I had to go through some trouble on getting my  controller to work well. Vac bans is useful but still useless at the same time,The game starts you off in the middle of nowhere just to venture into the hut of the witches to understand your path, the game feels very branched out in the beginning where you can go and have to go and what you can explore then it gets very limited on what you can do once you reach close to the end it just starts being limited in where you have to go. There are however many things you can find and discover, weapons to upgrade, souls to fight, people to kill.Once you beat the game new game + changes the challenge up again by adding new foes and new enemies thus getting harder. This time around if you run outta enemies you can summon them using bonfire aesthetics.Other than that,  the game this time is a huge improvement over   the original due to what is being offered which is  more content, more covenants, weapons , and very much of the very similar gameplay that you are used to. The soul memory systemt his time stops the twinks from happening so you won't encounter players that are OP and twinked out that will completely rip you apart.This is a fun game for those with the acquired taste, You'll die, have your ego crushed on by a steamroller while being axed by a gnome but you will still press on. however the story is still weak and the at least there was an attempt at it, Also there were videos of the game looking great with lighting and the graphics that was shown from the beta version which was taken out of this game making it look uglier than it's supposed to be, there are tons of videos about it online and its very upsetting this was done but at the end of the day dark souls II is what it is, a challenging game that is focused on pvping other players down and having fun.+ Game is harder, but only because they throw alot of enemies at you otherwise...+ New content, LOTS of new content+ Combat feels more fun+ New game plus after beating the game actually includes more unexpected mobs, and becomes harder, its actually a ng+!+ covenants that are useful and categorized well, Pve/pvp/pve invasion/pve helping/pvp evil etc.+ Good larger open areas gorgeous views in certain areas.+ Fps is smooth game runs smooth doesn't look the best but smooth is good+ Finally runs well on the pc due to the support. Especially the display+ Pvping/combat is so much fun. I love to gank and fight legit players+ Using Steam vac bans, not the best way to ban people but better than nothing.+ Good variety of weapons to mess with, upgrade and stat up.+ Mod it up! but you'll have to play offline just in case because of vac just in case.- Story still weak- Its hard to know if playing online will get you banned or not due to modding, so do it offline- Expected better quality graphics and shadings, things that was shown beta phase didn't make it they took it out, Alot were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. You've been gearboxed.- Having some connection problems, this is due to soul memory matchups- Some fight mechanic needs rebalancing- Bosses are not as memorable as dark souls- Game need to be made by pc for once so we can experience true quality, I shouldn't have to mod my game to make it look amazing- Even though keyboard and mouse is cutomizable I cannot find it likeable for this game best to use controller, its still horrible!- Enemies AI are still stupid, bosses are unmemorable- Cheaters really ruin the pvp experienceOverall - I still recommend this game for what it is and what it offers, I looked past the incredible amount of negativity i've experienced because I really do love this series.

The PvE is okay but nowhere near as good as in DaS1 or DeS: bosses are forgettable, most NPCs are there only for the purpose of buying items and nothing more, the OST is lacking, the ending was terrible and so was the final boss.The PvP is outright broken, ""great"" mechanics such as Soul Memory allow SL838s and SL150s to fight each other just because they have gained enough souls to be in the same SM range. It ends up with everyone using the same build since holding back on leveling up will leave yourself in disadvantage. Full Havel's/Santier's/Avelyns/hexes/monastery. Where's the fun in fighting that and just that? Not to mention that full Havel's makes your damage a joke. The PvP in the Souls series was always all about creating new imaginative builds and learning how to handle them with skill. In DaS1 or DeS your armor didn't really matter as much as it does here. An SL1 could beat an SL500 with a certain amount of skill. Not here, because the new engine makes controlling your character nowhere as good.I finished DS1 in 80 hours and the rest were put in PvP because there was always fun in making and fighting different builds. I don't have the motivation to continue playing this game. It's not possible to have fun while soul memory is a thing.

To explain these subtleties would be to ruin what makes the discovery process so fun, but I will respond to anyone who wishes to know what I think in a personal Steam message.As a story telling experience, it lacks the reason to be it's own story (The DLC sort of corrects this problem.) As a combat experience, it lacks the tight mechanics that made the first one fair and engaging. The hitboxes are not as the appear at all, there is input lag on movement, and a well-designed mechanic -- rolling -- is hidden behind a stat called ""Adaptation."" Its level design is good, but lacks the metroid-vania style *world* design that makes it replayable. The game feels nearly as linear as a game like Darksiders does. Forgettable bosses that are just 2/3rds big armoured people with formulaic attack patterns. Dark Souls II is a pretty good Souls-*like* but pales in comparison to its predecessor. I couldn't, with good concsious, reccomend anyone looking to understand what souls is *about* by reccomending this game.As a personal aside to establish what my opinion might, or might not, mean to a review reader, I purchased the original Dark Souls four times. Once on console, twice more for friends looking to get into the game, and once on PC. I pre-purchased the deluxe edition of Dark Souls II on console and afterwards the PC version. With collectively 700+ hours into the souls series (1, 2, 3 and Bloodbourne) I still don't reccomend Dark Souls II.

,Not Recommended,236430,10468225,"Posted: 14 June, 2014",all,SG,"Dark Souls 2 is a decent game, but it is inferior to Dark Souls.Dark Souls 2 has managed to become a reptitive game to play, in comparison to Dark Souls. In Dark Souls 2, areas are smaller and more densely packed with enemies. In some cases, there are far too many enemies to take on without backpedaling and turtling, making getting through an area a slow process. There's many more respawn points put throughout the game, so you won't have to backtrack far if you die, but the sheer volume and tankiness of enemies makes short distances seem much longer. There's also less alternate routes to take while progressing through the game; many more of the areas are unskippable, which exacerbates the problem of enemy-saturated areas. Unlike Dark Souls, starting a new game with a character that has finished the game (called new game+, or NG+) will spawn new enemies and surprises for you to deal with. This is a nice addition, and it keeps the game fresh for a bit longer. However, many of the new enemies the game will throw at you are just very tanky and further repeats of those areas just take longer than they did before.Multiplayer in Dark Souls 2 is a straight downgrade from Dark Soul's multiplayer. In the Dark Souls series, you level up using the game's currency, ""souls"". You get souls from killing creatures in the game world, and it is inevitable you will get souls by progressing through the game. Previously, the level of your character determined what other players you could be matched with in Dark Souls. You could go through the game at a low level and still be able to connect to players near the beginning of the game; this allowed for overpowered co-op partners who could take out bosses very quickly, or overpowered enemy PvPers who could one-shot you. Late game, players stopped leveling at a community-decided level cap that allowed players to continue connecting to one another. The level cap encouraged players to optimize their character builds within these constraints for maximum specialization toward whatever role they wanted.Because of the imbalanced early-game PvP in Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 has adopted a new system for matchmaking. Players are now matched according to the total number of souls they have collected, not their character level. This has a few effects, some desired, some not. Early game, players do not know how to initiate PvP, or they have little motivation to because their character builds are not complete; this makes early game PvP a rarity. As the player progresses through the game, they will have more PvP opportunities and encounters, and PvP is relatively balanced because players haven't progressed much further than each other. Late game, the total number of souls a player as collected is no longer representative of their character's ability; a character may have stopped leveling up at some point, or a character may have never stopped leveling up, and some characters may have lost a great amount of collected souls by dying. The only available option for players who wish to stay competitive in PvP is to continue leveling their character, which takes away any need to optimize or specialize one's character build. Though this new matchmaking formula fixes unfair early game PvP, it ruins the fairness and depth of late game PvP.Due to the repetitive PvE and unfair late game PvP, the game's longevity is hurt badly. There are a few other glaring issues with Dark Souls 2 that I won't go into, but despite it all, it's still a game that is above average in quality. I can't fully recommend Dark Souls 2. As a fan of Dark Souls, I've been able to keep myself interested in Dark Souls 2 for a while, but a person with more discerning taste would not tolerate Dark Souls 2 for long.Play Dark Souls before you touch this game; Dark Souls is much better game."

76561198041975210,Recommended,236430,10561466,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,daniel.close,"This game is truly wonderful, there's a lot of hard practice within the game and you can't just always rely on one tactic to win. Every enemy has been balanced along with the weapons and armour to always give that feeling of struggle, no matter how high in strength you are. PVP however is where this game is let down, mainly because the players who play this game like to make use of the cheapest tactics they can manage in order to win. Here's just a list of what to expect if you try doing Dark Souls 2 PVP:Channeler's trident with any magic buff and poison infusion while spamming heavy attack to drill hit you and just stack poison? Check.Infinite HP hacks? Check. (I've encountered at least 46 different players doing this so far)Poison/Bleed estoc to bypass shields? Check.Infinite stagger caestus build? Check.Prebuffing and then using poison fog/toxic mist/dark fog/acid surge as you are summoning in so you get poisoned/have your armour and rings broken before you can even act? Check. (watch out would be dragons, this happens to you a LOT)Prebuffing and then trying to backstab you as you are summoning in? Check (Dragons again...)Waiting right by where you appear and spamming fire tempest or other AoE spells so you have no time to act when you summon in? Check. (dragons especially)Abusing rolls to ensure no form of magic will ever hit them? Check. (Oh yeah, if you roll? You can't get hit by most magic unless it's a flat out hit. Not a fun thing if you get forced into PVP and you're a caster of any form).That's just a short list of the cheap tactics I've seen being put to use while I have played Dark Souls 2. Players will not try to play fair and as a result, it ruins the experience for the people who are trying to play the game fairly. Most even take PRIDE in this factor and you can find tons of builds to accompany these tactics so as to 'pwn maximum number of noobs' as one person put it.I will complement Dark Souls 2 however as it has made co-operative play (especially with friends) much, MUCH better than Dark Souls 1. You get a name engraved ring you can buy that allows you to connect to players using the same 'god' that you choose using the ring. There's a large selection of gods and goddesses so you have little risk of being summoned by someone who you don't want to be summoned by. There's also two forms of aid you can do: Shades (which last a certain time and vanish when they've either killed so many enemies or have been there long enough, you can tell if a shade's about to vanish because they start turning black) and phantoms (Just like Dark Souls 1, they vanish when you beat a boss usually). A nice thing they've made sure to note is while there are areas where phantoms can't be summoned, shades can still be summoned in some of them, allowing for you to still recieve aid from your friends if you need it (and some areas you really DO need it.For those travelling alone, From Software hasn't forgotten about you. Almost every single boss has a NPC phantom or two somewhere nearby that can aid you if you are unfortunate enough to have the dark souls 2 server lose connection or if you lose connection to steam. What's more, some of them have storylines that grant you their equipment if you accomplish them.Overall, there's plenty of nice things in Dark Souls 2 that I would really want to praise. There's a vast array of weapons, armours and items to help you on your journey and it's possible to make all kinds of playthroughs (I've even seen someone playing a run as a character named after and tooled up exactly like Simon Belmont from castlevania. That was funny to play along with!).If anything, it's Dark Souls 2's PVP that lets it down in the long run and a lot of the covenants make use of PVP to rank up so you are kind of forced to face it at some point if you want the most out of covenants... though thankfully you can switch covenants freely in Dark Souls 2, which is a god send.There was one other thing that disappointed me though (and this is more a personal nitpick than anything else)... the weapons while vast and arrayed... well, it doesn't exactly have the same kind of fantastic variety that Dark Souls 1 had. I thought it was neat when I could get a sword made out of crystal or the dark sword from the darkwraiths (I was pleased the armour was back but COME ON FROM SOFT, why no sword to go with!?) which all had really unique designs and stood out. Granted, there are a few nice and unique weapons but I just feel it's lacking there. Who knows? Maybe the DLC coming out will provide us with some more really neat tools of destruction? I sure hope so!Would I recommend Dark Souls 2? Yes, VERY MUCH YES I would recommend this game. But there are things that you need to be aware of when you pick this game up and I hope this review will help those who are considering this game for various reasons to consider before picking it up. From Software is making constant balance checks with this game so maybe they might see some of the problems and deal with them but in the meantime, thank you for reading my review and I hope it gave you all information about Dark Souls 2 that will help you decide to buy the game.Good luck, and hope you're prepared to die all over again.

A lot of the new features are good, whilst some are a bit... eh, but they're not terrible changes.Some of the changes are actually necessary for this game to be good, like the bonfire teleportation. Since you can't level up at bonfires, you have to go back to the main hub. In some areas of the game, this is impossible since you have to take a route that makes sure you can't walk back.The bosses in Dark Souls 2 are a tad bit stale when in comparison to Dark Souls 1, but they're not terrible bosses. Yes, a lot of them are ""Dudes in heavy armour"" but if you actually read through the story of Dark Souls 2, you'd know why. There are a fair share of tough bosses, along with simple ones but all of them are unique in some way (excluding boss duplicates.)The main gripe I have with this game, however, is the level design. In Dark Souls 1, it didn't feel like a chore getting to each boss because you memorized enemy spawning patterns, traps and room layouts. However, in Dark Souls 2, I mostly just ran through entire sections of the game because they were tedious as ♥♥♥♥. Heaps of enemies just before the boss area does NOT mean it's good level design. Yes, I know Dark Souls 2 is supposed to be hard, but when you're faced against a plethora of enemies just before you enter a boss room, that's a bit unfair. Yes, I know that enemies can de-spawn, but you have to kill them 12 times. That's twelve long trips to the boss area that I can just sprint to and ignore everything.The PvP in Dark Souls 2 is vastly superior to Dark Souls 1. Less lag, better connectivity and you can talk to players that you're helping. A lot of people dislike the voice feature, but I think it's great, because you can warn the host of traps coming their way before they kill themselves and boot you out of their world.Is Dark Souls 2 worth your time? Yes.Is it better than Dark Souls 1? No, but it's not terrible in comparison."

,Not Recommended,236430,14108414,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,Yazzy,"A disappointing regression in level design and mechanics, salvaged by having the best pvp and widest build viability of the series. Almost every argument regarding DS2's quality I've witnessed seems to come down to PVP and non-PVP players talking past each other on these two pillars. Supposedly the keyboard controls are hugely improved from the original, but I'm not crazy enough to try.The interconnected nature of DS1's world up until acquiring the Lordvessel has given way to a more distinct and discrete method in this game. There's the Lava Level™, the Forest Level™, the Castle Level™, and so on. Combined with the bosses being Large Humanoid Wielding A Sword far more often in the previous game, there's a palpable lack of originality to be had here. From what I recall of playing SotFS on PS3, none of these concerns were addressed.My biggest gripe with this game mechanically is that invincibility frames are now tied to a new stat (ADP) and your base i-frames are a fraction of what they were in DS1. Perhaps it was the case that dodging was too forgiving in DS1 (or at least, I always felt that long breaks from DS1 didn't hurt my timing as much as they should), but only in DS2 have I seen myself take damage from an attack that clearly did not even graze my character model. The wealth of gifs, webms, and youtube montages of this happening to people managed to hit a temporary meme-status and shouldn't be hard to find. Add in the fact that now almost every enemy has infinite stamina and can perpetually turn on a dime, and I found myself cheesing my way through the game in a way that rewarded patience for tedious playing rather than skill.My review reads like a lot of other people's, particularly those who don't dabble in PVP, but where I diverge is that I won't even tack on a ""it's still pretty good though"". I didn't like Dark Souls 2 and I don't recommend playing it. I will reach for another playthrough of the first game fifty more times before giving this one another look."

We all know those passages in games, where you just play and play and die and die all the time. In Dark Souls 2 you will experience like 100 times more. The good thing is, you get even punished for that. The game will reduce your health points for every death you encounter. At some point you will only have half of your health points left. You can only change that if you becoe human again and the items for that are rare and costy. So you have to choose wisely.The enemies are strong and unforgiving. A lot of traps and huge bosses who punish one wrong move with insta killing you are awaiting you. Every time you die the enemies respawn. Other than in Dark Souls 1 they won't respawn forever. After 10 times they are gone forever. So no Souls farming.Aprospos souls. The soul mechanic are still llike in Dark Souls 1. You kill enemies and get souls. It is basically the currency for everything. You want to increase your strength? Spend souls on it. You want to buy a weapon or ring? Souls! You need to repair? Souls.If you die. You lose your souls. It is up to you to go and collect your souls where you last died. If you die on the way. You lose them forever. So you better be careful :)The combat is kinda simple. You can lock on to enemies and then it you can choose from 4 different attacks. one hard and one fast hit for each hand. If you wear a shield you can either block or bash. All the different weapons (there are a ton of them and all upgradable) have a different move set. You should experiment with that. Not always the weapon with the most damage is the best choice.The load is important as well. You can be the tank that wears big armor and big weapons, but that makes you slow. YOu can be also be the rogue or something in between. You can dodge then instead of block. You can also be a mage. A lot of possibilites there.The story... *sigh* I admit i'm not the best in English, but i guess even if i were better i would never really got it. Maybe i'm just stupid- Don't know. It is a mystery to me tho.The NPC's are decently voiced and well written. The dialogue is very good most of the time. The sound overall is pretty simple but it feels right this way. Loud music would have destroyed the dark atmoshpere.The Bosses are impressive. A large variety lies ahead of you. Each needs a different strategy and all have dirty tricks in their sleeves :)The graphics... yea. They are old. If you are a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ you should look for mods. The game doesn't look that bad, but you can clearly see that it isn't the newest nowadays.The Multiplayer. The fact that you can stop the invasions of other players in Dark Souls 2 is a great feature. Invasion means, that other players can invade you and you have to fight them. But that is not all. Friends can always help you or sometimes strangers over their help. This is a good part. It is up to you personally if you like to fight other palyers or if you completely concentrate to explore the world. There are also PvP arenas. Overall the MP isn't a must anymore, but if you have friends who need help or who could help you or if you like to show you are the strongest it is a nice option.Can't really criticize anything on this game. Had no crashed or other bugs while playing. The lack of Journal makes the traveling or the quests a bit confusing, but nothing you can't handle. You just need to pay attention to what your NPC friends say :)So if you like a real challenge and you can handle frustrating moments. You should buy it."

And you're right. There are so many things wrong with this game that it wouldn't even be worth identifying them. You can find everything elsewhere. I'll mention a few, but this isn't a slag-fest.As a stand-alone game itself, DS2 is actually quite fun. The game controls have been improved since DS1 and the game runs much more smoothly. The stats etc have been streamlined and over-all it feels more coherent than it's counter-part. Gameplay in DS2 is superior, as is the online match-play. No more will you have to wait around for an hour+ to find your friend's summon sign and invading other players is a much more common occurance. Weirdly, of all the 3 Dark Souls games, DS2 is the game I return to the most. It's easier to pick up and play than it's other 2 titles, perhaps due to the level design? DS1 was a game you really had to concentrate on and be very wary of your surroundings. It had an atmosphere which couldn't be ignored, and you felt in constant danger. DS2 doesn't have that unfortunately, and instead encourages the quick run-through style of play.The inclusion of Soul memory baffles us all, and as a gameplay mechanic doesn't work whatsoever. Invasions and co-op should just have been left with regards to your over-all soul-level. It's much simpler. Plus, for some reason, From Software don't ever seem to be able to do covenants right. None of the covenants in DS2 are particularly worth joining (with exception to the Sunbros), and the way in which the game forces the player into PvP arenas to rank up in a some of them is just aggrovating.The biggest downfall of this game however is level design. The levels are too short, too easy, and aren't coherent with an open-world game. Levels also feel very linear. The story is almost non-existent, though this is conclusive with other games of the franchise, and it jumps around all over the place, hoping to cover it with the often repeated line ""...without ever knowing why"".Despite all these pit-falls, and there are many more things that weren't mentioned here, I would still recommend this game."

Also understand this review is for Dark Souls II, and none of the DLC is being reviewed. That being said, Dark Souls II is a fresh look at the Dark Souls series brought to us by the sadistic FromSoft for their pleasure mostly I'm sure. Even though I feel DSII is not as brutally difficult as DSI, it does have its moments of pain, struggle, and as souls fans know, death. The visuals are very pleasing to the eyes, with a smooth feel throughout the entire game. It is not perfect, as mobs and bosses can get glitchy and that alone can cause for some frustrating moments. As great as the game truly is, there are times when it feels they just copy pasted the same boss again and again. However, there are many unique mobs and bosses to be found. I just feel they were not as unique and exciting as DSI. I enjoyed the storyline, and though I'm not big into PVP, I felt the bit of PVP I did play was fun and exciting. Overall DSII is a wonderful game, with hours of content to give you your money's worth, but I have a special place in my heart for the original and always will.I give the game 9/10 pants."

If you already own Dark Souls II on Steam, you can upgrade to the DirectX11 edition of Scholar (since the current version is DX9) for $30; if you own Dark Souls II and all the DLC, you can upgrade to the DX11 version for $20.Got it? I hope so, because we're not done yet. The DX9 and DX11 versions will have separate pages in the Steam store, so you'll want to be careful about which one you buy to ensure that you don't either shortchange yourself, or end up with a version you can't run. Furthermore, the two versions of the game are not compatible for multiplayer action: If you upgrade to the DX11 version and all your friends stick with the original DX9 release, you'll be playing without themJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

Gameplay that doesn't worry about caterring to a casual crowd but instead changes the way you look at and play games makes this series unique among others in the action rpg genre. That being said, Dark Souls 2 is a farcry from what it was in Demon's souls and Dark souls in terms of care and attention to detail. While the core of Dark Souls 2 is the same, it feels largely more artificial and self aware. Difficulty was always present in the series, but not as a marketing gimmick, rather a tool to immerse and amuse the players in ways not done before. These games never hold your hand, but make you adapt and increase in skill through trial and error. Dark Souls 2 feels too much like an attempt to feel difficult, to the point where some bosses and areas are just ridiculous. Approximately half of the bosses are just ""let's throw as many enemies into one room as possible"" and have multiple copies or enemies pot shotting you. While the older games did this, it was in small doses. That is not to say its a bad game, in fact its very good. Graphics are quite nice and some enviornments are very well done. Weapons are still as fun to use and unique to eachother that allow every player to tackle the game differently. Nobody wants to feel like all challenge and reward are pointless and absent. DS 2 definitely delievers a quality challenge and rewards patience and skill. Just be warned, Dark Souls 2 is not the defining chapter in the Souls Series. Give it a try, and then experience the older titles to get the full experience."

The brutal, punishing nature forces one to hone their skills and become better players, learning from every mistake they make, overcoming insurmountable obstacles and all done in such a way that it's fair. It's not crippling rage that grips you when you make a mistake, but a sense of enlightenment, as you now know what that particular scenario will do to you. You overcome and adapt anything the game throws at you in due time and looking back you will find yourself wondering why the start of this adventure was so harsh.

Dark Souls is now one of my favorite games of all time, and is one of the best RPGs out there right now. I poured hour after hour into that game. What makes Dark Souls so good? The world is beautiful, the atmosphere is incredible, the combat is smooth and challenging, the bosses are intimidating, the lore is amazing, but overall, it's rewarding. When you finally defeat a boss, you get an incredible sense of accomplishment. Every boss is incredible. The story-telling is amazing, in that there IS not story-telling. You don't get 10 minute cutscenes stuffing the story in your face. You get the story from your surroundings, from item descriptions, from lines that the NPC's say. The community pieces it all together and you get a beautiful story with lots of detail. The world felt connected; there were more than just one way to get to a location, and the game forced you to travel on your feet. Later in the game you get the ability to fast travel between bonfires which is awesome because by the time you learn the ability to do so, the world is huge and it would take forever to walk the whole way from A to B, but before you learn the ability there is no need for it. Also bonfires were few, so getting to one gave you this incredible sense of accomplishment. The world mattered.Now enough about Dark Souls, let's talk about Dark Souls II, and why it was a disappointment. I'll just list all of my complaints I had with the game. I'll start with who made Dark Souls II. The director for Demon Souls and Dark Souls is NOT the same director for Dark Souls II. It's a different person, which explains a lot of things.Let's talk about the bosses. They were a HUGE disappointment. They were easier than typical mobs in the first Dark Souls... For almost all the bosses, the typical strategy for killing the boss was: strafe, hit legs a couple times, dodge, repeat. A lot of the bosses were just copy and paste of bosses from the first Dark Souls. One was a literal copy and paste of Ornstein, and the rat boss you fight is just Sif in rat form. The final boss was a joke; it was one of the easiest bosses in the entire game. The final boss of the first Dark Souls was incredible! The beautiful music gave me such a chill during the fight. Dark Souls gave me an incredible feeling of accomplishment when YOU DEFEATED a boss (dark souls joke lol), and I got a different incredible feeling with Dark Souls II bosses; boredom.Bonfires are EVERYWHERE, and I... mean... everywhere... They are scattered all over the damn game it's rediculous, and you can teleport between bonfires right from the start! There's a section of the game where you walk out of a dungeon and appear in what looks like a fallen city, filled with giant warriors. You walk accross the bridge, and you see a bonfire to your right. Awesome! Checkpoint! moving on. You kill about 5 of the giants, and you walk down some stairs and see a fog gate. You pass through, and a bossfight happens. Defeat the boss, and there's a bonfire up above. Another bonfire? That was quick. backtrack a bit, go up a drawbridge, defeat another boss, and there's a third bonfire down some stairs... This is all within 2 minutes of eachother. You can literally see one of the bonfires from another bonfire...The NPCs are next. This will contain spoilers for the NPC's in Dark Souls I and II, so if you don't wanna know what happens to them, don't read...... ok moving on. The NPCs in DS had personality. Each one of them was different, and each one of them did something. The lore in DS was incredible, and each NPC was tied to it in some way, and each one had an interesting back story to them. There is a location in DS where most of the NPCs go when you find/save them, but as you progress through the game, they leave, and eventually, you find them... hollowed. and they turn on you. and try to kill you. Your friend who has been with you from the beginning, or your trainer who has taught you spells, or just a clumsy friend you found on your journey, they all die, and you are forced to kill them or you may die as well. 1 or 2 live, but only with your help. This adds to the feel of the game that nothing and nowhere is safe, and you will miss each NPC that dies, because you liked those guys, they were your friends. In DSII, NPCs have no personality, and I didn't care about any of them. If you find one on your journey, and you exhaust their dialogue, they will end up in the central hub area, where they NEVER LEAVE. They sit in that ONE area, never moving, and using the same 2 or 3 lines of dialogue whenever you talk to them... OH I HAD GIVEN YOU UP FOR DEAD gets old after the 2nd time I hear it, let alone after the 300th... they have 0 personality... One or two give you a sob story about how their life is hard, but it was hard to care about them at all.Also, the mob placement... the mob placement is just randomized nonsense. Dark Souls at least put thought into where they placed enemies. The placement of enemines in II makes no sense, they're just kind of thrown into the game with zero thought.The combat suuuuucks. At least for PVP, the combat is disgusting, and is in no way fun at all. The dodge roll is broken in this game. Rolling will save you from literally anything in this game, but only if you've thrown a ton of points into ADP. Don't have ADP? Have fun dying every two seconds. If you DO have lots of it, you're essentially a god. A lighting bolt coming at your face? roll! a sword about to cut you in half? roll! Being enveloped in a poisonous cloud? ROLL! I was challening a lighting spear and was prepairing to throw it at an enemy, and the enemy ran at me. At the last second, he rolled, but he rolled towards me. But by the time he rolled, he was already right in front of me, so he basically just rolled in place. The lighting bolt passed RIGHT THROUGH HIM! It pierced his torso and went right through him. Rolling should NOT make you invulnerable to everything, but IT DOOOOES, which is rediculously stupid. I'm not kidding when I say, if you are about to take damage from any source, press the roll button and you'll be k. Even if you don't include rolling among the problems with the combat, there are still lots more. Back stabbing is so weak in this game and just doen't work half the time, parrying feels horrible and unresponsive, and sometimes weapons will forget how long they are, and you will get stabbed from 20 feet away or you WONT get stabbed from 2 inches. The combat is clunky at best. Magic is broken. Not overpowered broken, but literally broken. You can be killed in one shot by magic, and there are so many stupid spells that have odd or nonexistant hitboxes (Lighting spears sometimes hit when they were fired in the opposite direction, or just no where near you) that you would THINK that it is overpowered. but it is also underpowered as well, because you just have to press the roll button as a soul spear pierces your heart and you'll be juuuust fine.The atmosphere is nonexistant. you have the ability to warp from the beginning of the game, which takes away from the feel of the game. Also, there are places in the game that, once you pass through it, you may never come back to it again. Even in the late game of Dark Souls I would find myself going back to the beginning places, but in this game there is no need.The problem I have with Dark Souls II is that... basically it's just not a real Souls game. If you don't compare it to any of the other Souls games, than Dark Souls II would be an mediocre game with a few problems. But if you DO compare it to any of the other Souls games, then Dark Souls II would be a horrible game with a lot of problems.Every time I open this game up, thinking I was a bit too harsh, thinking that maybe there is a good game somewhere in this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I become disappointed.

The game is squarely aimed at a younger demographic with cuddly Undead that inhabit the land and cartoonish character-style and voices. Yet, the game design hits at something that can't be outgrown: the joy of discovery. That is, perhaps, the best way to describe From Softwares new gem.Dark Souls 2 also culls from so many different ideas that it is hard to succfinctly explain what the point of the game is. The Chink developer's elaborately woven and complex endeavor brings great depth to the normally pallid kid genre, and that's part of what makes Dark Souls 2 such a great game. Despite ample room for improvement, this is easily one of the best titles, if not the best, From Software game since The Adventures of Cookie & Cream.Part The Sims, part Animal Crossing and part Skyrim Difficulty AND part Rocko's Quest, Dark Souls 2 stands alone as a deep and engaging title on PC, fully accessible to people of all ages.

Another one from a tower at sea level goes to an underground port at sea level too.  When you remember that all areas in Dark Souls blended perfectly into each other, it hurts a little.-I don't remember some areas. or how to access them.-Bonfires every steps.-Only low level areas are acessible at the beginning, when the one of the features of Demon/Dark Souls was access to a large choice of areas, letting the player choose his path and get better loot at low level.-Only low quality loot available at the beginning. Forcing players to use and upgrade equipments he doesn't want to use.-Limited upgrading until late-game. Upgrade materials are really rare and expensive and a certain item necessary to upgrade one of the blacksmith is only available near the late-game.-Quantity over quality : too many ennemies in a single area, too many bosses (some being copy or having the same moveset) in the game, adding minions in bosses fight (I'm looking at you Royal rat authority), too many bosses in the same fight (An early boss fight have 3 bosses, each one being difficult to deal with -Long range hard to dodge halberd sweeps-)-Story.

One is Gank in two small areas. Another is protecting some peoples against invaders. Invaders are farming duels so they can get limited-use items to invade.

Character is now locked and 140 hours of play wasted. THE FACT THIS IS A THING REALLY TICKS ME OFF.I just can't recommend this game. I am a fan of Souls, I even played DeS until I got three characters to 712, a third to 650, and a fourth to 475, without using an exploit. I didn't get a whole out of DaS1, but it was still a very fun game and even felt innovative with what it was doing with DeS's foundation.DaS2 is pretty broken. it feels a lot like it's♥♥♥♥♥♥riding Demon's while not quite understanding what made Demon's good. If I had to guess, I would say that From is just obligated to make hard games. DaS2 is very easy to cheese every enemy, while if you are brave enough to play normally; you'd quickly find that (at least on the PC version), enemies can do some realbullcrapthings.On top of enemies being rather broken, this game uses frames as a timer for how things work. For example, more frames your weapon is in an enemy, the more durability damage it takes. Since DaS2 isn't moving faster in real time while at 60fps, your weapon takes twice as much durability damage potentially, when compared to 30fps. Also your rolls will have a tendancy to not work properly (Jumping can work pretty reliably though), and just simple button inputs can be buggy when at 60fps. Like.. I have a huge delay before I start sprinting, but locking to 30fps fixes that and it is really annoying.Bad port issues aside; Is the game good on its own merits? Well... I had some fun, but spells don't feel particularly well balanced post mid-game, the +10 mundane dagger is rather overpowered for backstabs, and a lot of the gear people use seems to constantly be hit and miss.Enviroments feel uninspired and very classic high-fantasy. They are not much different in idea in comparison to Demon and DaS1, but the issue is that the other two games were consistant with the paths. In Demon, you go to a storm temple, you finish at a storm temple (with a rather awesome air based boss). In DaS2, you start at a mountain side at night, end up at a mountain full of poison at day, then a windmill tower filled with poison, then you finish in a volcano. I suppose you can make the arguement that volcanos are toxic, but the lead-up to going into a volcano was non-existant and was really confusing.Have I mentioned that the AI is dumb as rocks? I think I have but I will reitterate:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=262325070Also areas have weird clipping:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261770108And seriously, this game has weird clipping:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261770107tl;dr : 6/10, better than Revelations 2012 but still makes me mad in a bad way.Edit: This is a game you want to have a recording program ready for at all times.

My main gripe with it is that the enemy placement feels very lazy. Instead of crafting a level with enemies placed to create memorable fights and interesting challenges, the devs often throw far too many enemies (all of the same or similar type) into a long hallway just before a boss in attempt to seemingly make that section of the game ""harder"". It's tedious, frustrating, and just not very much fun. I also think the world itself feels like it's lacking a lot of the polish and depth that previous games had. The way areas are connected together often doesn't make any sense at all. There are some very beautiful looking areas, however, so I guess it's forgivable to some extent.One other problem I have with the game is that the boss fights are just... brutally unfair at times, just for the sake, again, of feeling ""hard"". Demon Souls had two boss fights that incorporated multiple enemies (three if you want to count the Storm King I guess). Dark Souls had five (if I remember correctly). Dark Souls II has like... twelve multiple enemy boss fights. It's freaking ridiculous. All it does is drive players to do more co-op rather than grind it out and learn how to take the bosses out themselves. If there is any word I could use to describe Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 it would be ""Fair"". Despite being challenging those games were, for the most part, very balanced and fair. If you died it was on you. Dark Souls II feels very unfair a lot of the time.I'm not much of a PVP player, but to those who play the Souls games for the PVP I would warn you about Soul Memory. It is a system meant to stop experienced players from grabbing late game weapons with a low level build, spending all the souls on leveling up the weapons, and invading new players to kill them over and over again. I guess it works for that purpose, but once you reach Soul Memory 1,000,000 you're basically free game to be invaded by anyone of any level. This means if you want to stick to a SL150 build and play with others who adhere to that SL limit, you can still be invaded by a SL450 player. This can make match making really unfair and frustrating.Aside from those problems though, which are admittedly big flaws, the game is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it for the most part. Also, the first DLC showcases some of the best level design in the whole series. Definitely grab the DLC if you can, it's awesome... even if the boss fights are still brutally unfair.3.5/5"

The ramping up of difficulty of enemies means it is easier to play by venturing into the first part of areas, stopping when enemies level make it nightmarish, going into another area and coming back to progress in other areas after that. I am only 10 hours in but I am enjoying it a lot so far, and I am far from being good at it.The unforgiving nature of the game means that minor occasional flaws like hits not registering can be a bit infuriating, especially when it leads to losing a bunch of souls. But overall it works very well. Beating a boss after having died to it several times to figure its full range of moves and how to approach the combat (and also, to manage to execute the proper series of actions and reactions during the whole combat) gives a great feeling of achievement.Do not let the stories about the difficulty turn you away from this game. It is well worth a try if you like medieval action RPGs. It is tough but not impossible."

And it feels like a fresh break from the more casual games that are coming out these days, and a throwback to the challenging old school games, like Ninja Gaiden, where you learned from death and victory wasn't assured.Many people were worried that Dark Souls II would be a lot more casual than its predecessor, and I can assure you, it's not. It manages to be just as challenging, while still being more accessible for beginners. There are changes that make the game more convenient, such as bonfire teleportation from the beginning of game. Combat in the game is improved, and is as fun as ever. One thing I wasn't a fan of was the large enemy mob encounters. Encountering groups of large enemies is more irritating than challenging, causing the player to go out of their way to use tactics they normally wouldn't. The boss fights are unique, and are some of the coolest parts of the game.Unlike the first, I played through the entire game with keyboard + mouse, definitely and accomplishment for a Souls game, the graphics are also massively improved.The story is great, although it doesn't pop out at you, but that doesn't matter in a game that is based so strongly on gameplay. The story lies in the lore of the world. While it definitely isn't as good as in the original, the world connects in interesting and cool ways.Covenants are expanded in such great ways and make the multiplayer a strong point of the game. PvP is very, very fun, although the hitboxes and connection keep it from being perfect. With the improvement of online play also comes the improvement of co-op (Sunbros rejoice!)While better than and worse than the first game in certain aspects, it is a highly rewarding blast of a game that will challenge you, and give you hours of fun. 10/10 from me."

,Recommended,236430,9992985,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,Fuego Johnson,"Returning for the third iteration of the series, and the successor to my personal favorite game of all time, Dark Souls, is the epic  new adventure, Dark Souls II. I've played for about 20 hours so far and I must say, fromSoft has delivered yet another masterpiece in their notoriously difficult Action RPG saga.I've been a souls player from the very beginning of the series, which started with Demon's Souls on the PS3. I was instantly addicted to the polished, action oriented gameplay and the plethora of great fantasy lore. The story of the souls series has improved substantially with each new title, and Dark Souls II is by far the most comprehensive in the series to date.The environments, as usual, provide plenty of spectacular things to see and inspect. Even the still backgrounds include a ridiculous amount of detail, which adds to the overall sensation that you are indeed a part of this twisted, dark world. I will say that  the environments don't mesh quite as seemlessly as the original Dark Souls did, but this is a very minor complaint considering the fidelity and detail that each section of the new game provides. No two places look the same for the most part, which certainly adds a new layer of excitement every time you move on to a new area.The difficulty, which the souls series is probably most notorious for, returns with a vengeance in Dark Souls II. In some ways the game is much harder than either of the two previous games, but there is certainly some give and take in that regard(i've always stood by my statement that the game is hard, but NEVER unfair. Learn from your mistakes, and Souls will reward you in kind). You are punished more than ever for dying which is something that will inevitably happen a 100 times + per playthrough, but there has been some balancing features added as well to somewhat counteract this new gameplay element. The world is less crytpic and vague than previous iterations of the series, meaning players are more informed on what needs to be accomplished for them to achieve their ultimate goal of defeating all the bosses and moving on. This was a potentially vaunting addition for many souls players, but in my opinion, it made the world come alive more than it ever has in previous titles. Descriptions of items(for the most part) are more detailed, NPC characters are more helpful, and the beloved messaging system for online play has been improved dramatically. This is just one of the many new changes Dark Souls II implements, and segues nicely into my next topic; Dark Souls II and the new multiplayer format.In previous games, the multiplayer system was far less fleshed out than it is in Dark Souls II. You couldn't directly play with your friends in the original Dark Souls due to the splitting of servers(ironically this wasn't the case in the original game, Demon's Souls), and some covenants you could join had very little to offer the player in terms of reward and dedication. This has(for the most part) changed in Dark Souls II. The summoning system in Dark Souls II has changed dramatically, but the most important feature in my humble opinion is the ability to play with your friends online. The Souls games at heart have always been a single player game first and foremost, with the online system and it's benefits being ""secondary"" to the player's individual experience. While this is still the case, the benefits of playing online have increased a tremendous amount. You can once again summon your friends, rating messages has become infinitely easier and the connection issues and long load times when summoning a player to ""your"" world have decreased dramatically. Many people who played the Souls game's in the past can attest to the multitude of connection issues that occured when trying to summon another player to help you fight a boss or clear an area. Many times, one would sit and wait for almost 2 full minutes before the annoying ""summoning failed"" banner flashed across the screen. In Dark Souls II, no longer do you have to wait to find out if someone is being summoned to your world. You are notified immediately if someone cannot be summoned, allowing you to move on and attempt to summon somebody else instead of waiting for several minutes, only to find out that the player you tried to summon isn't coming to your aid. Rating messages has also become infinitely easier, no longer requiring the player to use their orange soapstone sign to rate a message left by another player. You can simply select ""rate message"" from the message read screen, and this is a marked improvement over the previous titles. Messages are an important feature in Souls games, allowing you to leave a note on the ground for other players to read. Messages pertain to things such as traps, tough enemies, or hidden treasures throughout the world. Messages can also be used as a ""griefing"" tool for the more sinister players, leaving fake advice in the form of a message to confuse or kill other players playing in that area. However you decide to use messages though, the system has been improved by an incredible margin.Covenants also make a return in Dark Souls II, which are esentially game altering ""clubs"" that you can join throughout your adventure to alter how the world responds to you. PVP has always been a popular feature in the Souls series, and the covenants in Dark Souls II add to the format first introduced in Dark Souls by a great deal. Covenants aren't exclusive to PVP alone however; many convenants are available to assist in CO-OP as well as PVE. Unlike the previous game, however, the rewards for ""ranking up"" in Dark Souls II are far more beneficial than before. Aside from the obvious gameplay changes a convenant provides, they also give the player rewards for their dedication to the current covenant they belong to.The only complaint I have with the game so far is how you spend your souls to ""level"". In the previous game, you could collect your souls from killing monsters and level up at any bonfire in the game. This idea has been scratched in Dark Souls II for a more conventional ""home base"", meaning the player must travel back to the home area if they wish to spend their souls. Also, many features of the game that involve bonfire's require the user to go back to the hub world and use that specific bonfire. This was the one ""step back"" so to speak that fromSoft did, but since I play on PC, load times are hardly an issue(there was far more complaining about this for console players since the load times were significantly longer). While a minor inconvenience to say the least, it certainly doesn't ruin the game by any stretch of the imagination.In short, Dark Souls II delivers another epic experience, from monsterous boss battles to intense PVP fights with players around the globe. fromSoft didn't try to reinvent the wheel here, but instead added and improved on an already fantastic gaming platform. If you haven't played a Souls game yet, this would be a fantastic place to start. While Dark Souls and Dark Souls II take place in the same relative ""universe"", they are indeed stand-alone titles that require no previous knowledge of either Dark Souls or Demon's Souls to understand. If you haven't played either of those games, though, you are missing out on two of the best games ever made. Dark Souls II improves on everything that Dark Souls couldn't(or didn't) achieve, and does it with the same flash and excitement of the previous games. Despite the one flaw I mentioned, this game will more than likely go down as one of my favorites ever, and will demand my attention for years to come(Or until the next Souls game!!). Be prepared to die, but also know that every time you do perish, it won't be for naught. This is a game about memory as much as it is about skill, and for those who wish to put forth the effort, they will be greatly rewareded with one of the most polished and exciting games ever made."

Yes, the world is massive; yes, there are far more bosses than the last game; yes, I've spent dozens of hours playing, and I'm sure I still haven't seen close to everything. But where other open world RPGs use that overwhelming size as an invitation to lose yourself in their world, with Dark Souls 2 it's a threat.From Software has embraced the challenge they're known for while simultaneously cutting away a lot of the fat — bits of previous games that were more annoying than they were difficult.

For ex: some enemies seemingly have no weakness, but if you are aware of your surroundings and use your knowledge of the game you WILL figure out how to defeat every enemy you come across. While this game is ""difficult"" it is extremely rewarding, you notice your improvement and after every playthrough you will notice you can deafeat enemies which origionally took you hours to kill now take you minutes.Like i said before this game is based on the combat, not necisarily the story. the story, while interesting and overall ok, isnt easy to find as it hides in npc dialouge and item descriptions, if you play games soley for the story do not buy this game. If you dont like RPGs do not buy this game (unless you really want to challenge yourself). and if you are a casual gamer who plays games every once and a while for fun, and dont really want to try that hard, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Recap: Dark souls 2 is a unique RPG with combat unlike most others and if you are willing to perservere over the mountain that is the learning curve in this game you will be heavily rewarded.

Stats are leveled up with the same curency that weapons are bought and repaired with : souls dropped from monsters.The skill needed in combat and in navigating the terrain is one reason the game is regarded as a difficult one. The other is the punishing loss of all souls after an unsuccessful retrieval attempt.While enemies are usually tough and the world is at times tricky to navigate, the game does a good job of connecting you with hints and warnings of dangerous zones left by players who experience the same challenges in their parallel world. One can also stumble upon signs offering help for tough fights when certain conditions are met. The player who offered his help is then loaded into the host's world and can assist in the difficult boss fight.The game world is beautifully designed. Enemies and friendly characters are numerous and varied. They are believeable. The challenges are great. This is clearly an atmospheric game.There is also different player-vs-player features in the game. Fun challenges as they may be, these challenges can be alleviated with in-game choices."

Here is a little explenation why it is.Dark Souls II is like Dark Souls a pretty hard game and I wouldn't recommend it for people who get easily frustrated because there will be a lot of moments when you just want to throw your controller through the screen and yes! a controller is highly recommended for a good reason! Other then that, the gameplay mechanics are solid and most of them are really fun. It's not like in regular RPGs that you level certain moves or abilities, in Dark Souls you get a ton of weapons and each of them have a unique moveset. So there are many ways to play the game.Now for the overall design of the game. It's clear that the game doesn't have the newest graphics but it looks beatiful with it's level- and envoirementdesign. There is a lot to explore and the awards for exploring are quite high. Speaking of exploring: the game has a really unique way to tell it's story. You not only want to explore the areas by yourself, you are also exploring the story. Even though I played this game for a very long time and have seen many videos about the lore, I'm far from knowing the complete story of the game because you have to interpretate and connect many things, mostly descriptions of items.All in all I can say that this game is one of the best titles ever made and defenetly worth spending the money on but be warned: this is my opinion and you might be have a different stlye of playing games. This will take a lot of patience and overcoming the frustration but when you get into it it's a unique and beatiful experience. Have fun!"

I'm also a noob to the series and skipped the first game, so this is my first go at the series. I'm also basing my review on specific things that peaked my interest throughout my time with the game. More sections will be added and edited as I further my progression through the game. **Overall Score: 9 out of 10Story: The game opens with an interesting set of cutscenes which draws the player in right away. The story as a whole seems simple, but interesting enough to hold the attention of the player. It's good enough to peak my further interest into what becomes of my newly created hollow.**UPDATE** 3/9/15 - I recently completed the story, and I was a bit disappointed by the way the game ended, but I felt as though there was still plenty of incentive to go into NG+ or even make another character.Gameplay: You MUST use a controller to play the PC version of this game. I spent the first hour or so using my mouse and keyboard and man was it frustratingly hard. The game is very difficult, so prepare for ""rinse and repeat repitition."" You will die ALOT. The gameplay as a whole is very satisfying, and it feels good to kill an enemy. The game especially rewards you for beating bosses.*Update* for Gameplay: Now that I have a better idea of how to play the game, the gameplay is highly addicting and very fun. It takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it is really fun!Soundtrack: It is very good, and creates a very eerie atmosphere in the game. Because of the eeriness it adds to the amazing experience.Graphics: The graphics aren't anything mind-blowing, but they help add on to the environment and the overall experience. I run the game on my 4 year old laptop, and it runs at a steady 40-60 fps. The game appears to be intended for consoles, but the PC version is a good port. This game is a gameplay over graphics game, yet it still retains a nice pretty atmosphere.Noob Awareness: The developers of this game not once took in the idea of helping out players who are new to the game. No tutorial, no game tips (Although player tips are found everywhere), there's no babying involved in this game.*UPDATE* for noob awareness: It turns out that in the starting area of the game, there is boards with the controls on them and other tips."

It is the pure, harsh fun we have come to love about the Souls series.I am mostly writing this to tell people not to worry too much about the ""HD remake"" that is coming out. Sure, if slightly better visuals are important to you, and playing with 1 or 2 more people online is a must, then there is nothing I can say really. Go ahead and wait for the remake to come out. However, I do believe that this business model is vile, and shouldn't be promoted. As such, I bought this version knowing there would be the remake in april, and I don't regret it for a second (also, there was a sale, weee!)Now, the game looks great already, there are a lot of people playing online, and we WILL get a patch that includes much of the new content and improvements. I can't recomend this game enough, and I can't advise to stay away from the remake enough either. Please, boycott the disgusting choice From has made here with releasing the same game again, and making it basicly separate from the original game. But again, if the features in the remake that we won't get in the original version are too appealing for you, then go ahead.

The core gameplay hook remains fantastic, and the combat is deep and varied, but compared to Dark Souls 1 it's pretty much garbage. The level design is about one tenth as good, the enemies are bland and make no sense in terms of story, the bosses are either dissappointingly easy or pointlessly difficult because the room is swarmed with lesser enemies. The entire game seems to focus on ganking the player so they die, because, you know, this is Dark Souls.For veterans of the series, this can be a tedious, yet mercifully easy game. I managed to finish the main game in about 20 hours, but I'm now plodding through the overly difficult and lenghty DLC packs. I love some of the vistas this game gives you - it CAN be beautiful at times. But I find the whole thing to be very poorly animated and contructed compared to the first game. I don't really care about any of the NPCs, I don't really ever want to do any PVP, unlike in Dark Souls 1, and overall I only really played it so I could say I had.Great fun, but if you played Dark Souls 1 first and loved it, you might hate this game."

Dark Souls II is the latest addition to the ""Souls"" series of RPGs that involve you choosing a playstyle and going against enemies that might take you five or more strikes to defeat while you may be just one or two hits from being destroyed yourself. Dark Souls II is no different. I am willing to say this wonderful addition to the series may be the hardest yet. I actually regretted my purchase for the first couple of days after playing this. Then, like all the games in the series, I found a Halberd and my life turned around.I highly suggest you purchase Dark Souls II if you like to create a character that is then placed in a world with no hope. If you enjoy playing games that will make your heart race and your hands shake even when you know what's going to happen.

This game has a fun co-op system and a terrifying invasion system. But what more could you want in a fun RPG that is full of death and fear?

,Recommended,236430,10042679,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,fly me to the moon,"Gameplay - The gameplay takes all the great things from the original and makes them more refined and balanced, for the most part anyway. Rolling now actually requires skill rather than just rolling past everything, and it is assumed that you learn it to get far in the game at all, as the some of the most powerful attacks in the game can only be countered by doing so (Dark Magic, Great Hammers/Swords just to name a few). Where this game fails in some respects is the boss and enemy design. In the original there would be a few tough enemies in one area with heavy swings and low mobility, and the object of play was controlling their attacks and anticipating their next move, Dark Souls 2 seems to forget that this is where the combat system shines the brightest a lot of the time though, placing many enemies in one room just so they can stunlock you to death. And Bosses like the Royal Rat Vanguard and Belfry Gargoyles are just great bosses from the last game with a tonne more enemies shoved in for more artificial difficulty. This is my main gripe with the game, most of it isn't skill, it is just waiting until a set of enemies have completed their attack animations and taking a few safe hits in the downtime between the next (An example of this would be the set of three knight enemies in Heides Tower of Flame). This doesn't play to the strengths of the combat system and makes the game less fun overall. Speaking of boss designs, most bosses are predictable, humanoid Strafe/Roll fests with little to no substance, the ones that aren't are usually filled to the brim with enemies. Usually. There is one boss encounter that is true genius, and he is optional and out of the way for no particular reason, Darklurker. This boss is brilliant, seemingly easy at first, he has slow, easily dodgable attacks with long windups, but then, he suddenly splits into two. And usually this would be a problem like a said before, having you wait out his attacks and such but not this time around, it turns into a beautiful almost dance-like pattern that takes much more skill than most bosses to complete. This is how the whole game should have been structured, but it seems to have fallen off mark. That said, it was still thoroughly enjoyable and i would recommend an all-bosses run to anyone with the time, you get this game for the gameplay. Thank god it is good. Score: A-Story - The story is an abstract piece to many people. Instead of the game just outright telling you the legends of people and places, you are meant to piece together it's tale using a plethora of techniques, in-game descriptions for items, talking to people and the environment being just a few of the ways you can go about it. The game begins with a short cutscene of your player being told that you are cursed, that your timelines and sense of self will have no meaning, that you will become a wretched hollow come time past, and that you will ""stand before it's decrepit gate without really knowing why"". These things are left as speculation for the player for the most part. And are never answered directly, adding to the nature of the game. While it isn't the best story for your main character it is passable, but the legends and stories of people scattered across the land are really where the brilliance is at. Score: BControls - Ahh controls. The first game was a horrible port to PC, suffering disgusting mouse issues, keyboard mapping not working most of the time, and just being a disgusting experience without a gamepad. Dark Souls 2 addresses the most major problems, but still leaves a few glaring issues. The mouse is actually amazing this time around, working like you would expect. The movement can be done fully with WASD and sprinting by pressing X. The only problem with playing with the mouse is that there is major lag when attacking, being as the two attacks for each hand are mapped to the same mouse button. Thankfully, all of these problems can be fixed with a script you can find on the PC Gaming Wiki, you can even edit the prompts to show PC buttons in place of Xbox buttons. While it isn't as easy to setup a M+KB with this game, it is definitely not a disadvantage once you set up the scripts. Gamepad controls are the same for the most part, with a few minor changes to make movement easier. You can now sprint up ladders by holding B, slide down ladders with the same button, and if you really want to, completely let go of the ladder and fall by double tapping B. Jumping has been changed to L3, and this is for the better, as in the last game triple tapping B was extremely unwieldy, and lead to many a death. All in all, great controls, but could have done a little better with Keyboard and Mouse bindings. Score: B+Sound - The game was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, the man behind games like Braverly Default, Golden Sun and Kid Icarus: Uprising, and it shows. The game is filled to the brim with memorable themes and soft tunes while on your journey, making for a truly brilliant game to listen to. Themes to look out for are Majula main theme, Flexile Sentry boss theme and Tower Knight theme. Nothing much else to say really, brilliant sound design all around. Score: B+Multiplayer - I felt this needed it's own segment because it is extremely important, for PVE, you summon phantoms to help you on your journey, this can make many bosses trivial by splitting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s up, I recommend playing through the game once without summoning anyone, as it ruins the difficulty. But it is overall fine and has no massive issues. PVP on the other hand.. It honestly depends on the time of day or the weather or how the game feels most of the time. Getting lagstabbed is extremely common and is not fun to fight against. There is a region setting, but it is literally 'Japan' and 'Not Japan', making many of your fights a battle of who can lag the hardest and backstab the other first. If you want this game for the PVP, get it on consoles. Because the matchmaking for PC is atrocious, FROM should be ashamed that they shipped the game like this for PC. Not to mention a cancer that plagues everyone, Soul Memory. Soul Memory means that builds become complete meaningless, where in the original many people would limit themself to Soul Level 125 to keep challenge in the PVP, that doesn't matter anymore. If you have a high enough soul memory you will get people wearing the best armor, best weapons and people that have to ability to use every spell in the game. This needs to be fixed with the new DLC or something, because right now going into areas such as the Bell Tower are bound to get you killed by lag. Score: DOverall, it is a great game with amazing gameplay, but if you have to choose between this or the first one, get the first one. Dark Souls 2 just doesn't live up to it's name. If you play DaS1 and want some more action do get this though, as it is still a brilliant game.Final Score: B-"
,Recommended,236430,10020496,"Posted: 4 May, 2014",all,intox. Requiesta de Silencia,"This game is basically dark souls with a few things taken and a few things added, so it's still dark souls and thus still good. Now here's what I don't like.They made it so that the monsters will eventually go away forever if you kill them enough times (which in some cases is a plus). But in trade you can't farm monsters effectively anymore (which is a big minus). They also made it so that you lose max health every time you die and humanity giving items are limited. Now I hope I'm not alone in this, but part of the reason I liked dark souls is because it was hard, but it was also effectively consequence-free when you consider things long-term.Sure you lost all your souls and humanity when you died but you could always go out and farm them back which gave the game a nice pace. I never felt like I shouldn't go explore there or try jumping off a cliff here, though in hindsight the second was probably pretty dangerous. However in Dark Souls 2 I feel like I'm being restricted. ""Better not explore there or jump off a cliff here, I have 24,000 souls and if I die I may lose them forever because I can only grind in a limited capacity"".I do recommend buying this but I recommend making two characters. Your first character should be an all-holds-bared adventurer who jumps off every cliff and explores every crevice ignoring the danger and consequences. When you're done with that go in with your serious combat character once you know what's where. Oh but don't be a swordsman cause one thing they didn't fix from dark souls in this sequel is that dual wielding still sucks."

On a techincal feat, the game has been a much improved port from the first, has new combat additions that are a nice touch (shield breaking / dark magic being hexes instead / poise balancing / weapon balance / improved network code) but lacks some of the charm, such as more meaningful covenants (no dire consequences for leaving covenants), casualization of the game (dying is a joke with the new rings that are repairable instead of outright destroyed, flasks can heal much faster with the new stat ADP, gems are abundant), poor enemy variety/placement (majority of enemies have absurd amounts of ambush locations in unreasonable places, some enemies are outright unfair or not fun to fight [those fire breathing frogs spamming Forbidden Sun fireballs in particular], and Shrine of Armana pre-nerf), and level design is a huge step back in the series (Demon's Souls was linear but pleasing and very atmospheric, Dark Souls had a interweaven world connected individually by several linked locations, and Dark Souls 2 has some of this but in absurd design ideas, the biggest offender being the Iron Keep being reached by an elevator to the sky above a harvest field).  I won't be discussing the PvP, but I can say the Soul Memory concept is a travesty by preventing twinking in exchange for no incentive to not over-level and steam roll other players with the best of everything or maxed stats, as well as separating with many complications friends that would like to simply co-op or play with other people reasonably around their Soul Level.To be fair, Dark Souls has it's own fair share of flaws, yet many are because of the rushed publishing date and the terrible port that required mods to be enjoyable, whereas Dark Souls 2 had a much larger budget, development team, and more production time, so there is really no excuse for the drop in quality.Having played hundreds of hours of it's predecessors and only around 120 or so of the console version of Dark Souls 2, I cannot say I can feel like dragging myself once more through the game.Is it an awful game? Not at all.Is it a bad Souls game? Somewhat.I think I've said my share, and that is all."

I'd honestly consider this more of a sequel to DeS in some ways but I don't really mean to denigrate that game by saying that. When Dark Souls 2 isn't taking the bad stuff from DeS that was removed or improved in DaS1 it's trying and failing to emulate some of the good elements too.It's really difficult to say how many of the issues this game has just come down to it being the third in the series and not really doing enough to distinguish itself as its own thing. Maybe the formula is starting to wear thin and this game doesn't have enough of its own identity or vision to really capture peoples attention and imagination. Playing the game for a while you will certainly get the impression that for all the elements this game copies from the previous two the new team hasn't really played them much, or at all.Dark Souls 2 is the most flawed game in the series for a multitude of reasons but it is still worth playing and miles better than most other games released nowadays. I can only hope though that they don't make a Dark Souls 3"

I've died more from ambushes and being outnumbered 10 to 1 than anything else.-Speaking of bosses, their not memorable and I've not had a epic boss battle like I did with Smough and Ornstein the first time around.-Enemies no longer infinitely spawn which in the long run makes the game easier but makes farmer harder.-The way it's set up now for PvP with invasions, ganking and the like is much easier to accomplish, invaders now are at a disadvantage because of it when you have 3 armored havels with hexes and dual alveyns attacking all at once in succession makes it almost impossible for a invader to kill his or her target. This has happened to me 5/6 of the time.-Also invaders can't heal themselves unless they have a spell that does so, in DS 1 if you farmed humanity it was a perfect way to counter people that pop every health item known to man-Characters most of the time are bland, no one sparks me interest like Solaire and Siegmeyer did in DS 1. Emerald Herald for example... to bland. She's pretty the only thing really going for her but a boring character.-Story and lore is not as apparent like it was in DS 1 sure you had to read item descriptions and fish around for it. The lore that is there, damn near interesting at times but over all not as original and deep as DS 1's.-Soul Memory this is a problem when your trying to build a PvP character, it's uncontrollable for the most part and you can't cut it down. Soul Level was better in DS 1, it forced people to make a certain build and didn't allow everyone to become a level 400 Hexer, Pyromancer, Dual Wielding Greatsword, Knight thingy mc jigg♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sure you can back up saves to secure a PvP character but your going to have to back up your save multiple times and putting it back in order to keep PvPing at a certain soul memory range.-Steam makes it hard to receive hate/rage mail now, I've gotten none. That's the only thing I miss about GFWL.Nutshell con-Game over all is easier (fairly hard at times hence at times), but cheap a good chunk of the time.

It is not as fast paced as Batman or Shadow of Mordor, but instead relies on isolating your enemies and carefully timing your counters, dodges and attacks.To beat this game, you must err and err and err again but less and less and less."

There is barely 3 seconds of load time between zones the invasions and matchmaking is incredibly fast, so far from what ive seen pc version has alot less lag problems and graphics/lighting are really good altough some locations in the game look so bad you would think your are in an mmo from the year 2000 and yet other sections of the game are totally breathtaking.However...The good:-Great gameplay-Way more accesible-Some gorgeous locations-levels can be Run trough in under a minute if you know how.-The game this time around feels like it has been optimized for gameplay, once you actually try different kind of runs like lvl 1 runs no death no bonfire runs, magic/pyromancy/etc runs that the game has been optimized so that everything you need would be layed out before you if you know the game well enough and even in some cases when you don't, same thing can be said with the level design it has been totally optimised to offer different kind of challenges.-Lots of sexual inuendo.-Still discovering new things even after all this time.-Cool new animations.-Feels like alot more weapons are viable now.-Again some of the level design is really amazing gameplay wise.-Shrine of amana, best level in the game by far both in gameplay and ambiance/lore.-New game + really adds ALOT.-You can praise the sun as much as you want.-White ring.-Jester Thomas-Jolly life drain patch cooperation.-They brought back being summoned in by a boss to fight other players trying to kill it.-Bat staff + dark fog...go on, try it out for yourself.-Lazers everywhere.-Attack/spell cancels.The BAD:-Mouse lag :(-HORRIBLE name cencorship...really....really?(Yes this would be cencored if this was a character name)-Steam not having messaging system, I really miss laughing at stupid rage mails sent to me on psn. :)-In some cases some really bad animation synch-A lack of creativity, its ok to reuse and remold old ideas like you did with demon souls to dark souls but doing it again like this just makes the game way too predictable.-A lack of innovation. Where is the heavy casting attacks? Where is the ground rolling? Where is the weapon locking? where is independant left right ""spell"" selection? Where is the dual hand mixing attacks? Armor abilities, move sets?-NO FREAKING basic climbing mechanics, it's incredibly infuriating not being able to hop over a knee high ledge, some thing a fat legless basilisc could do, In some parts, you could skip out on a whole level if you could just hop over a ledge. Really gimping players on something so simple so you can make the players go trough your level design is just bad game design either give players a way to climb small ledges or hide them better because there is nothing challenging, hard or rewarding for the player it's simply annoying.-BOSS BATTLES: biggest let down in the game :(  Not a single boss battle of epic scale and those that come close are just  boring or easy with a limited move set and/or repetitive patterns, Altough the fun of discovery is there for each new boss you encounter, There was not a single one that made me sit at the edge of my seat and fight for my life or even want to  refight in co op just for the fun of it like previous titles did.-Really lacking in atmosphere. (except in a few places)-Some levels are way too short and nonsensical.-Npcs are no fun.-Some really dodgy hit detection at times.-No flails.-No meaning in death, it just feel slightly annoying (I wish they would make a perma death scenario where if you go completely hollow you get perma death and an AI black phantom version of you character appears in another player's world where if it gets killed your chararacter is gone forever but if the hollowed out version of your phantom beats a player then you get the character back.

While the camera feels better it still feels like no progress was made towards making it more keyboard and mouse friendly. I know plenty of people would object to this review because it's just assumed to play Dark Souls with a gamepad, but they sold this on a PC platform for PCs. I made the mistake of assuming it would therefore cater to the usual control format for said platform.The game looks to be as good as the previous installation as far as story/gameplay/ect but the difficult controls are a huge turn off for me.Cons:Camera sensitivty is set in increments with my preferred sensitivity between two incrementsAll menu options are worded as if using a gamepad (Push A to continue) and I still don't know what the A button is on a keyboard (it's neither A or left click).The entire tutorial was also in gamepad lingo with no indication of what it was on my mouse/keyboard bindingsIt wouldn't let me type in my name for awhile (alt tabbing seemed to fix)Any mouse keys beyond left/right/middle are not usableIf you change dash to Shift you can not perform any actions while dashing (Shift is used as a modifier key even if not bound to be used as such).The Use Item bind can be the same as Select Item for the inventory but Interact and Select Item can not.Pros:Camera seems to lock on behind my character better for the mouse.Camera has a feature to move itself when it begins clipping into walls (this can be annoying at times but is vastly preferable than not having it on).What would I liked to have seen?Menu/Tutorial in mouse/keyboard format.Additional mouse button functionality.Less rule based bindings.Camera hard locked behind my character and to my mouse.More fine sensitivity adjustment."

The haunting shadows, the sense of isolation, the fear mixed with wonder as I set out to explore.  If you allow yourself to get drawn into this world you will never forget it.Dark Souls 2 is quite simply one of the greatest games of all time. The game may have its faults, but I cannot see how any rational sane lover of games could give this masterpiece a bad review. You will notice that nearly all the negative are written by people that are either unfairly comparing this to Dark Souls 1 [arguably THE greatest game of all time], or by people that don’t enjoy a challenge in their video games.  Yes, these days most games are designed to be so effortlessly easy to appeal to as large an audience as possible, and to all ages.For those who are intimidated by the games difficult reputation… yes the game is difficult. [I found it to be far harder than DS3]. But it isn’t difficult for the sake of masochistic punishment. This is not a bullet hell or super meat boy type of difficultly. You can’t beat the game through boring memorisation. You will need skills to beat this game. And when you first start the game… you will suck. But over time you will hone and improve your skills. They will naturally develop, and you will have so much fun as that happens. Its like… Super Mario brothers 3. When you first picked up the controller, did you have any chance of beating Pipe Land on your first day? Hell no. But one day you  where uber pro and had the skills to walk through it. Ah… I really can’t do the game justice. Just buy it. Its wonderful.  Its exactly how games should be.[But you should probably by the scholar of the first sin edition ]"

The NPC AI works perfectly, NG+ difficulty scaling does not just increase the enemies hp pool and damage, but also adds new movesets / variations. The boss fights are rather challenging, mainly in NG+ (I'm a DS:PTDE veteran, about 300h playtime and I still had a tough time beating some of them.).The PvP aspects of the game are rather gimmicky, mainly because of some people playing cross-region, which makes them lag, but in a good match-up it's very entertaining.The cooperation is beyond amazing in comparison to DS:PTDE, because you no longer have to mess around with DSFix/DSCFix and other sorts of .dll chains and the soapstone signs work almost instantly. (I had issues being summoned by a friend during the week of the release, because there were tons of people trying to summon others.

This is a good game, but not a good sequel. And before the excuse of different directors is brought up, it still could've been better. In this game, they decided to try and make it harder, because, naturally, a sequel to a game bent on being difficult should be harder. I agree with that, but in turn of making it as rewarding as the first game, they decided to make it harder in an unfair way, ESPECIALLY the closer you get to the endgame. There are enemies that are harder to beat than the bosses they protect, on top of the enemies being put in situations that make death nearly inevitable until they stop respawning (I'm talking to you, Shrine of Amana...). Some people complained about the spike in difficulty at Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls 1, but the difficulty from there on was smoothly rising. In Dark Souls 2, however, the difficulty is EVERYWHERE! For some people, it was the build they were trying to make, but that was on top of the enemies that could insta-kill you anyway. All that aside, I'll be blunt, the ending sucked♥♥♥♥♥cheeks. I mean, really? In Dark Souls 1 *(SPOILER)* you could become the new Lord of Cinder, or become a Lord of Darkness. THAT WAS AWESOME!!! In the new game, you just become the new king and sit in a sealed chamber until the door closes... *(END SPOILER)* That sucks in comparison. It's just not worth it. Not to mention, the final boss is SO EASY. If you run around the room, hit (blank) a couple of times along the way, they die easily! It isn't a good ending at all. With a lack of luster for ideas on top of a new harder difficulty with your payoff being another runthrough of the game at a HIGHER difficulty, it's not necessarily the best game in comparison to the last two Souls games being better. However, it is still a little fun and is worth your time. Play this game first, then play the other two to see how it pales in comparison."

It's atmosphere and unique style separate it from other of the same genre. As most people already know, if you are sensitive to a tough game it can get a little hard to get into it, but for those who find these kinds of challenges satisfying, DS2 will be very rewarding. A much better port when compared to dark souls 1, FromSoftware has done a great job with the latest entry to the souls series.Pros:- Tough, but rewarding game play- Fantastic visual design- Remains true to the series- Unique and original blend of multiplayer into single playerCons:- Can be too tough for some- ""Soul Memory"" mechanic seems unbalanced"

Personally, i was promised better connectivity and smoother visuals with the PC release of the game, and so far all i have gotten access to a vast world where co-op play was laughable, poor in game services by steam, no means to contact players i'd previously engaged, I WAS DISSAPOINT. I truely never thought i'd miss GFWL's services SO MUCH. i encourage you to check youtube for info on project beast, miyazaki's next project, and hopefully turn a blind eye to this games very existance."

Everything about it is amazing. Dark Souls 2, though...completely different beast. I'll outline:Pros:-Combat is similar to Dark Souls 1.-Great atmosphere-Good length storyline-Fan-f**king-tastic PVP (also a con to this, explained later)Cons:-Health system. This was my first big turnoff for DKS2. It's just awful. Every time you die, you lose a small amount of your max health, all the way down to 50%. I know Demon's Souls did something similar, but here, it just felt wrong. It doesn't belong in dark souls. That♥♥♥♥♥♥should stay in Demon's Souls. Demon's souls still had more redeeming qualities, so that's that.-Soul Memory. What the ♥♥♥♥ was the team thinking with this?? Seriously?? It's the most ridiculous thing I think I could have imagined in a Souls game. It completely ♥♥♥♥s PVP. Oh hey, you want to pvp with people your level? NOPE. Instead. deal with griefers who intentionally give you a ♥♥♥♥load of souls, and while this seems great at first, it's not. It makes it that much harder to find a PVP match.-Difficulty. The difficulty in DKS2 compared to DKS1 is all bad. It's so manufactured. Fake. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. Sure, some bosses are great. Fantastic. But a lot of them are far from it. I won't spoil anything, so I'll leave it at that.I'd have to say that I wouldn't recommend it. Most people would and that's cool, but IMO it's not worth the money. I was heavily disappointed with this game, and I really wish I couldn't say that, but it's the truth."

(Or, see the 64-bit remaster of this, if your friends have that instead... Trust me, you may want to get the remake if your friends don't own this version.) The game starts off with you awakening in a strange land called Drangleic, after being branded with the ""Darksign"" - an emblem that turns you into an ""Undead"", a being who cannot die, and eventually will lose all hope and go hollow - no memories, no feelings, no emotion - just suffering. You're told by a mysterious figure known only as the Emerald Herald that the only way to stop it is to seek out the King, Vendrick. Who is this mysterious king? And does he have the power to stop one from going hollow? Find the answers yourself in the second installment of the Dark Souls series, Dark Souls II!Pros:- Good gameplay- Great customization- Many playstyles- No levelcap (There is one, but trust me, you'll never reach it. It's insanely high. I'm talking 1000+ hours of farming for that. You would have to farm for hours every day.)- Hard difficulty- PvP and co-op is great!- Hackers get softbanned to a different server, so regular players won't be destroyed (generally) by a hacker.- Long story, great replayability.- New Game Plus.Cons:- Steep learning curve- Sometimes hackers don't get softbanned- You have to place summon signs to get placed into your friends' game, and anyone can summon you.- You can get ganged up on (Regulars call it a gank, winning a gank is called a gank spank) when invading others' worlds.TL;DR - Great game, if you want difficulty this game is full of it!"

No, buy Scholar of the First Sin, insteadWARNING: BUY SCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN, NOT THIS VERSIONThe new version of this game came out that uses DX11 graphics is bundled with all of the DLC. Saves from this version of the game do NOT carry over. Do NOT buy this version unless you want to spend more money and waste time.Now that that's out of the way, here's for the real review.Dark Souls II, more challenging than the first, still is very enjoyable. The game still retains difficult enough combat to be considered a souls game, and if you've played the first game, you will for sure enjoy this one.For those of you new to the series, I would recommend you pick up a copy of the first game while you wait for Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin to be released. It will be a good gauge of whether or not you will like this game, and it is only $20 instead of $40.Gameplay wise, the game is much smoother. 60fps and 1080p is a HUGE improvement. Movement feels much more fluid and controls more responsive.Creativity wise, the game is OKAY. It is not as bad as many claim it to be; that said I still think the first game holds much more value in creative boss/enemy design and lore, as far as the story goes. The majority of bosses in this game are some variant of ""humanoid in armor,"" and with a friend, can be easily conquered.There are many more weapons and armor in this game than in the first, which I also consider a nice touch. It's fun being able to swap looks whenever you decide to change things up.In PVP/Coop, the game is somewhat unbalanced. Rather than basing matchmaking on soul level (the level of your character based on the attributes you choose to upgrade), the game bases matchmaking on soul MEMORY, the total number of souls collected. This makes for fights where your opponent may have much, much higher/lower stats than you, depending on how they spent their souls collected overtime.That said, I haven't seen nearly as many hackers/cheaters/glitchers as in the first game. Many players have a finite amount of health and can be beaten if fought correctly.Conclusion:I recommend this game to others as a good entry in the souls series. However, for the love of all that is good in this world, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THE GAME. Go grab the remastered edition, Scholar of the First Sin, instead."

I still have exactly 38 videos of Dark Souls challenges I'm waiting to upload that some of which have never been done before, at least on video on YT.  But I've been asked what I thought about Dark Souls 2 and why I've only completed it twice on PS3 and lost interest in the PC version a couple hours into my SL1 Deprived run.  And why I basically stay away from any discussion whatsoever about it.Well, the reason is I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in almost every aspect of the game except mass Soul crushing in the menu.  All skill/knowledge based-balance has been striped out in stronger favor of stat allotments, and the primacy of ""player skill and knowledge"" to play the game all the way through in a types of various styles and challenge is basically gone, this speaks strongest in relation to the challenge running scene and PvP scene on DkS1 vs. DkS2.  So rather than me ranting and raving, and in the end frothing at the mouth about this game, I'll let these three videos say what I would say in much better ways and without all the anger I'd inject into it.  The loss/lack of Miyazaki basically destroyed this game completely vs. previous entries, period.This video by Matt here I 100% agree with, other than the fact I would argue (from a challenge running and PvP perspective, it's a far greater step backwards than he describes here)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UScsme8didIThis is furthering my thoughts on the gigantic steps back taken in movement calibration, animations and just skill-based play in general.  All from my bro Martyrs who I attribute to be one of the best PvP players out there and was the main guy who helped me be competitive in PvP at ANY base-Starting Level vs. any SL char I fought in PvP.  And keep in mind he got everything spot-on in his analysis of the Beta.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ6SqmwXx2oAnd finally, the reason why I don't talk much about Dark Souls 2, as I share Martyrs' thoughts on this issue here as well.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHGgPdXi4k4In closing, if you watched all that.  I will say that IF they fix nearly everything mechanically atrocious about this game vs. the previous game's I might give it another real go.  And I'm hoping and praying the ""not supposed to happen DLC"" brings with it just that and better content overall to echo the quality of the formers.  Which is the reason I bought it still.So, Souls fan forever, signing out of DkS2 and saying my peace (sort of) until issues are fixed or I wait for the next ""Miyazaki-Souls game"" or just BloodBorne and wave goodbye to it forever if it stays this way.*Note that this is just my personal preference and opinion, I'd be more than happy to hear objections, arguments or criticisms to it.  But to each his own, and to my mind in retrospect this sequel, like Batman: Arkham Origins, should have never happened.  It was a cash-in while the real ""next-gen game"" was being made."

Death is still a constant and small mistakes cost you dearly as you venture through Drangelic, a land filled with undead, monsters and even more viscious kinda of foes ready to make you lose your souls.This game features bonfire teleportation right from the start, so getting back and forth to the town and where you are adventuring takes no time at all. A rather dissapointing downside to this is the seemingly overabundance of bonfires. Some are quite literaly less than a minutes jog through trash mobs. The game does allow different viable builds than previous incarnations (double greatshields is a thing) and the areas are gorgeous, if not a bit out of place (i.e. from a large windmill a lift takes you up to a volcano). The astetics seem a bit off and the challange does not quite measure up to what Dark Souls was, and therefore no where close to the near insanity of Demon Souls. Of course the game gives you many options to make the game harder if the initial challange is not up to your speed.The qualms I have with this game are easily overlooked with how well the world works and the fluid combat. Of course there are still some builds that seem much stronger than others, but learning how to play the build you choose well can more than make up for the perceived lack of damage output. As always, PvP is a large part of the series, but in this one it seems even more part of the game and in many instances it is rather forced, which might make some new players a bit uneasy. This only really becomes an issue after the first playthrough when you are opened up to having not just NG people invade you and as you are able to accrue sin.Overall, Dark Souls II is a soild game and worth playing through multiple times. Even if the layout of the areas is mostly linear, there are still plenty of secrets and interesting builds to toy around with until you find your sweet spot. Grab your sword and start hoarding those souls. You will need every last one you can find to regain what humanity you will have left after playing this monsterous game."

Every boss can be overcome by analyzing their moves and each has a tell that you can learn to become better at that particular foe.  With the online capabilities, you don't even have to solo bosses.  Bring a stranger in to help you take down that tricky boss and then return the favor for someone else down the road.  The PC port is an excellent one (vs the original Dark Souls which was horrible) and this is indeed the definitive version of the game.  I highly recommend it."

The most notable improvements I've noticed are in the online play. The ability to connect to players is easier than ever, and the PvP is actually worth playing now. One thing that does bother me are some of the  stringent requirements for some of the factions in order receive awards (Blue Sentinels awards Bountiful Sunlight after 500 victories online), which is in some cases is a little bit ridiculous considering there's no telling how your character's stats are going to stack up against randoms. I personally get players that are too low-leveled, or either too high.Pros:1. Online is significantly better2. Well realized world with gorgeous visuals3. Rewards player through trial and error.4. The addition of Hexes and Boss spells/miracles/hexes (like Demon's Souls :D)5. More stylish armors than previous games6. A more useful bonfire system.7. Lots to discover and non-linear8.

I will not mention any specific enemies, weapons, bosses, anything.So I have quite a few nit-picks about this game, but before I go anywhere let me say that this is still a fantastic game with fun experiences to be had by anyone willing to challenge themselves, or hate themselves, or both.So nit picks:-This game likes to interchange ""hard but fair"" with ""hard"", a lot of this can be seen with how many enemies you are forced to fight at once. In DS1 the player had a lot of options on how to handle mob groups, and in this game you will often be forced to encounter 3-4 guys at once.-Certain bosses feel like they just took old ones from 1 and added very little just to make it ""hard""-Boss variance is sadly not really there. There are a TON more since 1, but they do like to use a similar approach for a good chunk of them.-Certain secrets seem to be impossible to find without someone putting  a message saying ""HEY THERE'S A SECRET HERE"", this also applies to certain key elements that drastically change areas in the game.-Soul memory, great on paper, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in execution.-Some enemies go absolutely nuts with how much and how fast they attack. Remember how Artorias had that triple flip that SOMETIMES was only once? Or maybe twice? Oh wait no, it was three times this time and you died. Yeah well that happens with these guys and I died a few times more than I really should of because I thought their attack string ended.-There are like, 5 covenant that all act like the forest covenant, which is completely unneeded to me. One of which isn't even fun for 1 person who unwillingly gets forced to fight people (and no I'm not talking about regular old invasions, those are fine).So again, fantastic game and I love it, but I don't rate it higher than 1 or even Demon's Souls. It has a TON of stuff to see and do but it feels a little more quantity over quality in comparism to it's predicessors."
,Recommended,236430,9967638,"Posted: 28 April, 2014",all,♛ SwishUhhhh? ♛,"After 130~ hours i think i am now qualified to give a decent review.First of all Dark Souls 2 is an amazing game, but like any game it has its problems.First let me talk about PVP, currently the pvp is pretty good, aside from a few hiccups here and there such as phantom range due to lag.Of course some things are better than others and people will always shout about something being OP until metas shift, standard stuff. The only real issue is parryrolling/backstepping, this really seems like it should not be doable, animation cancelling is fine, but the parry frames should stop when you roll/backstep. Soul memory is... interesting to say the least, the system from DS1 was fine and i dont know why they changed it, it makes arranging fair pvp harder and currently gives people too many options for 'builds' because you have so many extra points in the current meta level. Regardless, PVP at the minute is pretty fun at least for me it is, especially when you join a covenant such as Bell Keepers and get regular fights. 'Get off my bell!'Secondly PVE, honestly if this was a standalone game then i would say that its amazing, but unfortunately you have to compare it to at the very least DS1 and its just worse, the enviroments are pretty lazy, there are some unique areas but nearly everywhere in this game feels small, for instance Aldia's Keep is a huge castle, and if you look at your progress through it, its literally in through the front, straight line, then out the back. Why? Such an amazing chance for a huge multi level area such as Sen's Fortress from DS1, Same again with Drangleic Castle, This area is a little bit better and looks amazing especially with the rain effects but i still feel like it could of been greater.Just think about DS1 and Anor Londo for a moment, genuinely a well designed and memorable place, i dont think any areas in DS2 are as well designed/memorable as Anor LondoDon't get me wrong there are good areas too, Lost Bastille, Forest of the Fallen Giants and Iron Keep are the first that spring to mind as well designed areas in DS2, but the problem is that the other areas leave a bitter taste, Why is there two bonfires in the gulch for instance? ugh.The world doesnt seem to connect properly either, Dragon Aerie is set upon MASSIVE mountain pillars, which you'd assume would be visible from nearly anywhere in Drangleic, nope. You can see certain bits of levels in the distance just missing or chopped off such as Belfry Sol from iron keep. Again, it just seems lazy. DS1 did an amazing job of making everything feel intertwined and connected, here though some things just done make sense.However, The story and lore is presented a lot better, Dark/Demons Souls fans love to speculate and love talking about various theories and ideas people come up with, this game continues that trend for sure.There has been a lot of people saying its worse than Dark Souls 1 and i would probably agree.But this doesnt mean its a bad game, its an amazing game and i cant get enough of it, but it just seems a little off...Heres hoping the DLC makes this a game FULLY worthy of its namesake."

The first time I died was because I accidentally tapped the controller the other way just a little too much and ended up walking off a cliff. The last time I died before making this video...I walked backwards off a cliff while fighting giant guardians...note to self keep an eye on cliffs.Regardless the story is as deep and as vague as it was in dark souls, but it's better explained through visual means more then outright telling you what the hell is going on nor what your overall goal is. The only goal you know of thus far is to prevent yourself becoming a hollow and meet the king, or this is what I understood so far, I'm still playing through the game and I really don't want to spoil anything for new players, finding out the story is half of these games anyway.Combat is more fluid then it was in the predecessors like said it's easier to get in to, but just like it's predecessors it's hard to master and more often then not bad timing in fights or biting too much you can't chew will end up killing you rather efficiently.The hollow/Undead versus humanity aspect is also more different then it was in dark souls. As I've understood (I could be wrong) there are things called Human Effigies that can be used to turn yourself back to human and negating all the health loss you've gained while dying in Hollow form and you can use this same item and burn it in bonfires to disable online interactions preventing people from invading your world. Now I have not been invaded yet which could be due to the game being released a few hours ago, but not sure if being hollow stops people from invading like it was in dark souls, just in case I usually play as a hollow, unless I die enough times.Like I mentioned before I'm still playing through the game and I'm enjoying it majorly and anyone who is a fan of the demon souls and dark souls games, I would say this is a good buy, it might not be as unforgiving as dark souls, but it's still enjoyable none the less.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XsjHOqmcus"

This game is not so friendly. If you love a challenge, then this game may or may not be for you. Why do I say that? Well, it's not a normal challenge, it's devotion. If you are new to games, RPGS or anything that you can attach the word 'new' to, then this game may not be for you. It brings its own meaning to the word death and I must say that, it is quite frequent, even to the most hardcore players.The graphics are quite good. It draws you into the world of the game as if were like a dream. Only the dream is a nightmare if you make the slightest mistake. The designs on the enemies and bosses are unlike most games and I admire the unique qualities they show.The story line will be quite confusing for most. There are very few NPCs to talk to in the game and each time you talk to them, you want to exhaust their lore. By doing that, they will either reward you or travel to the next location to continue the story line.There is no map, so you are exploring with your eyes. Be sure to observe with caution as well. There could be an illusionary wall, enemies from any direction, secret paths, hazardous environment, more enemies, certain areas or items that could have been missed and of course, more enemies.When fighting a boss, it's always best to keep your distance and learn the patterns. Always keep your shield up and dodge at the proper moments. If you are going with something different, like projectiles, then make sure you always keep your distance. You will be squishy and one hit may certainly kill you.When fighting PvP, projectiles are always the most favored. Why? Because some of them have lock ons and can break through shields. A good strategy is to keep your distance and guard up. Wait for the right moment to strike, because a simple mistake can and will get you killed quickly. Give them a reason to get close to you, if they are throwing projectiles at you, but make sure you are at decent to full health for it.Another tip, always keep an eye on your stats, weapons, armor, flasks, gems and other useful items.If you have any questions about the game, stuck on a part and need a way out or even more strategies, please feel free to ask and I'll help you the best I can.After completing the game and feeling accomplished, I would have to give this game (8 out of 10). This game requires lots of patience and as little rage as possible, which is hard to do. Surprisingly enough, I only had 1 controller fall victim from this game."

In my opinion, it's selection of music is a little lackluster compared to it's predecessor, but varied opponent types keep the game entertaining as well as the variability of ways to approach these enemies.If you're familiar with Dark Saul, it should take you just a little bit to get into the groove of it's sequel. Dark Souls 2 changes up the rhythm mechanics of the game by removing backstab invincibility and good rolls, so returning players may need some time to get used to this change. If you haven't played Dark Suol, the main objective of the game is this: you are presented with sets of enemies that you have to lock in your rhythm by dodging at the right times and rhythmicly attacking so that you get counter-hit bonuses. There are many bosses in Dark Souls 2, many of whom have unique attacks such as autotracking overheads and AOE splashes. But, if you find the rhythm of the boss, you can catch it and eventually outdo their damage output.9/10, not as good as Dark Sqal, but still a damn good rhythm game"

I cannot help but feel betrayed by FROMSOFT. The game was bland, inspiration was nonexistent, and now they have broken their promise on the game not having DLC, stating that the game would be a full experience upon release. The game is still good, I can't change my score based on the developers actions. But as a long time Souls fan, I can't help but feel angry and betrayed by the developers over this game and the more I think about it the worse it gets. This betrayal makes me wish I never bought the game, hence not recommending Dark Souls 2.I just beat the game and I got to say this has been one the most fun games I've played, combat wise. The only things that really get under my skin is the story, monsters, bosses and environment. The story just gives me a bad vibe. It just doesn’t feel right. To avoid spoilers I won’t post my interpretation of the story, but to say the least I was very disappointed. The monsters are boring and none of the bosses are all that memorable or really have any inspiration to them, compared to the first one. They all seem familiar and at times it is almost a copy paste boss from the last game (there’s a lore reason for that). Also the “difficulty” in this game was horribly executed. Getting your health lowered every time you die is great! I love the mechanic. But throwing more enemies on the screen just for the sake of difficulty is not acceptable. It turns a fight from difficult to annoying, and that’s not how a Souls game should play out. Lastly the scenery in Dark Souls II was a disappointment to me. The updated graphics and lighting is great but it felt generic other than that. The scenery from the first Dark Souls was dark and depressing. it was so heavy and I loved it! While playing you fought yourself, internally, to find the light, a light that was never there, a light that never existed - you fought to find it no matter the cost. You fought to keep it in your mind and that hope always lingered. That feeling was amazing! While Dark Souls II focuses too much on the light that everything is light and there’s hope everywhere. You go from the light to find the darkness and to me that’s dull and boring. I really cannot stress how disappointed I was from this sequel, the only thing that saved me was the fun from the combat. The combat in this game is amazing! The tweaks were just perfect and now, to me at least, pvp is actually playable! The combat is fast, fluid and balanced (balanced in the sense that whatever build you create it will work)."

I missed out on Demon Souls entirely, and only had 2 hours logged into the first Dark Souls. So this review is coming from the perspective of someone who is new to the series!In short, I love it. It's a fantastic, deep RPG with solid systems and good controls. The art is awesome, and really creates a mood. There is a lot of lore buried into the environments and characters you meet, in fact I feel that most of the storytelling is done through visuals as you experience the game. There are little to no cutscenes, and dialogue options are more banter than exposition, which lets you piece together the lore as you experience it.The gameplay is very difficult as you are learning, but as you learn tricks, overcome areas, and grow in power there is a fantastic sense of growth and accomplishment. There are literally no training wheels. You need to figure out what order you want to explore areas in, you have to simply try out combinations of spells and items until you find a setup that works for you, and almost every mob in the game will be a trial and error experience to overcome.You die. A lot. However I haven't yet grown frustrated with this because I make fairly consistent progress before each setback, adn each setback simply has a learning curve of it's own. Once you realise a trick to beat an encounter, that encounter becomes more trivial and you can move forward to the next encounter. The game gets easier because you grew as a player, and adapted, planned, and excecuted better each time.I could go on and on. I'll just stop for now and say I highly reccomend this game to any action-rpg fans out there who want a super emmersive and totally rewarding experience.11/10 would die again."

The game wasnt necessarily even more difficult than the first, in fact it may have even easier but the times i ever got stuck on a part were insanely tedious and annoying and did not feel nearly as rewarding as getting through tough parts in the first. On top of it none of the locations were memorable at all, maybe its just me but i couldn't tell you the names of places in this one but the first i could tell you where every enemy is before you even get there.

Let's put an emphasis on ""for now"" part.Even though I can spot some translation errors on my Korean version, the experience is hardly affected by it. DS2 has better mouse and keyboard controls compared to DS1, but I'll just stick to my faithful gamepad to transcend from death.Graphic wise... actually I'm disappointed. Only difference of PC and console version is textures and framerates. No dynamic lighting, awesome area effects, or w/e we were able to see and get excited about were added for PC version. If only going 1080p and 60fps was Fromsoft's idea of graphical improvement for PC port, then they should give themselves a backstab. This should've been achieved back in when DS1 was ported to PC for the first time and not for DS2. Fromsoft should've known that players already expected 1080p and 60fps to be on PC port of DS2 since DS1 and were expecting more. To be honest, I didn't give a single ""thing"" about texture of console versionof DS2 since I've already knew that last gen consoles cannot achieve much with graphics. But we are talking about a PC version, a medium that can be pushed to the limit. If DS2 wasn't going to have a PC port, then I would've not even bothered with this BS. But DS2 has pc version and I already have expectations of having better experience of DS2 on PC than console ""overall"".Combat wise... PC version still have those gawd awful delays of running, perrying, and using items. May be later two would've been my personal issue with the game, however, delays on the character to shift to running mode? Why backstab is not a backstab but rather a stab in the back of the side of the back???? Yea I understand backstab hitbox is smaller and requires more precise hit, but why not activated when my character is too obviously and directly standing at the back of the enemy? But then why can I get a backstab activated when i'm like on the side of the back of the enemy? I dunno what Fromsoft did to these mechanics. (BTW I'm not criticizing the new perrying mode or shield bashing. I rather like them more than the old way)Environment wise... I don't know why but PC version seems more lighter than console version. Overall environment hasn't changed but I just don't know why. May be 'cause dynamic lighting's back? No? No...Gameplay performance wise... I like it. I'm using the laptop with slowarse 5600rpm HDD but I still get 3 second loading screen time. Character customization screen updates the character faster than console version. No more 10~15 sec wait after you moved a tick of slider to the side to see what's changed. My character's motion is butter smooth (mostly because of 60fps part I assume), Don't see much of random frame drops, (though I still experience them due to my outdated hardware...), and better lighting effects (I said better...)Interface wise... Same deal as the console. Simply awful. Where's my DS1 and DeS interface that actually worked for me...?"

Only reason it isn't up with the others is the game seems like they were focusing too much on the hard aspect of the game rather than making a game that happens to be hard.  The PvP is mostly either greatswords or get out.  I will commend the mechanics making early game classes feel like different games at times.  Besides that I will always prefer Dark Souls 1 and/or Demon's Souls.  The game is good standalone but I will always cherish the others.

The amount of weapons and spells that you can use are just amazing; the ability to power stance and guard break just makes things more interesting. This game would have receieved a 10/10 just for its gameplay alone, if magic wasn't completely unbalanaced, Monistary Scimitar's wouldn't parry instantly and if poise wasn't completely ruined. The story isn't as good as the last game, and the NPC's weren't as good as before seeing as From Software made you repeatedly talk to an NPC just to get something important from them. Though, co-op was properly fixed, which made this game a lot more tolerable and probably easier. Dark Souls 2 gets a 7/10, a fair score simply because it managed to keep me entertained for 2-3 weeks straight."

If you are new to the Soul's series, expect to swear and curse a lot. You can also expect to find engaging combat, amazing graphics, a living world brimming with danger, excitement, and challenges like no other. The character customization is so in-depth and versatile, you can basically play any way you want. The combat is engaging as you thrust, parry, reposte, and magic spell your way to victory. Every new areas is filled with amazing sights and secrets, and the VICTORY ACHIEVED message keeps you coming back for more.The primary criticism I have of the game is the needless platforming. For some reason, From Software includes pointless gaps and holes in the ground that are very hard to avoid with the combat-oriented movements of your character. If you could at least grab ledges, it would be excusable, but expect to die a lot from sliding off cliffs, full sprinting off cliffs ( I SWEAR I PRESSED JUMP, I HEARD IT CLICK!), falling short distances to your death in the beginning, or barely coming up short trying to jump the simplest of gaps. Don't get me started on the Pit/Grave of Saints. I'm not saying they should do away with cliffs and ledges, but if I wanted to play Tomb Raider, I would have bought Tomb Raider.That rant aside, the multiplayer is fun to an extent. I enjoyed many hours of jolly-coop, but didn't participate much in the min/max, flavor-of-the-month pvp that is far too prevalent in modern RPGs. But, hey, if that's your thing go for it.----===Graphics:10/10Absolutely gorgeous game. The textures and modeling on the PC version are amazing, and the graphics of the sea are the best I've seen to date. The bosses are HUGE and great to look at while they bash your skull in.Sound:8/10The sounds get the job done. The music is unobtrusive and tends to fit the mood well. Lots of slashing and clanking off walls. Who doesn't love that riposte sound?Story:7/10I didn't get that engaged in it honestly. Something about flames and a king and somehow everything is ancient as well. On top of that you are undead and have a curse where you can't be human, but you are... or something. I recognized recurring characters as I went along, but I didn't get how everything tied to together at the end.Gameplay:9/10I would say this has the most entertaining combat I've seen in a long while. The last game I remember having this much with was Bushido Blade back on the PSX (old fart alert)! Every death at the hands of a monster or boss felt like ""yeah I messed that up"". On top of that, multiplayer co-op can make some of the harder bosses a cinch. That being said, I can't give it a 10 because of the platforming though.Replay:9/10I got my fill in one run. I tried a second one, but I kinda get the gist so I don't think I need to see any more. If you want to see every build out there, by all means go for those  NG++++ playthroughs. You won't be disappointed.Total:43/50 (86%)===----I highly recommend this game; it's definitely worth the money and if you can put up with a challenge, you will be rewarded with that next bonfire."

Hmm that is a tough anwswer but lets dive into it!Controls are easy to learn and feel right at home on a xbox controller. So if you are good at the first one you'll feel right at home here, if not you'll have no problems!Tons of weapons and armor, magic's and the whole lot! Only wish there were more, also the female stuff seems a bit bulky?!All that stuff above that was the good stuff! Time to bash on this game a bit...well not really but you must be aware!~There are 2 main problems that I see with this game. I'll keep brief and straight to the point.First, Game is liner and doesn't feel connected. First game you could feel like everything made sense around you. In thisthe world it seems like your just selecting different boss levels for mega man!Second, The difficulty is the main draw for this game. Demon's and Dark souls were a good balanced mix to the mobsand bosses. This games main difficulty curve is more or less taking those same idea's and adding in lots moremobs. And that would be fine if the player was balanced to match that!One final thing to mention is the story, like the first game you have to hunt for it. Which with the help of YouTube makes it easier. Watch this guy's lore series for more in depth story stuff...https://www.youtube.com/user/VaatiVidyaAfter those you reallly will understand and enjoy the lore!So it messes up a bit...or maybe more than it should have but, its a great game and you'll feel good if you can even beat the F***ing game!Horrible review from a deranged gamer!_jenniphurr!~"

Nah, that is just Dark Souls for ya.And now for the review:In short, if you have $50 and are looking for an exhilarating, unique experience, look no further- buy this game.Of course, it is challenging, and sometimes you feel that the game is downright mean to players. But I reassure you, when you die, if you think about it, it will be nobody's fault but yours. So far, in my current playthrough, I have died at least 20 times. And I can say that each time I died, I learned from my mistake.This review will be based on three main points- graphics, control, and gameplay. I will not go into detail on the story, due to the fact that I'm new to the series.I haven't played the original Dark Souls, and the only platform I have played Dark Souls 2 on is PC. The graphics are nice, and on my GTX 760 Superclocked I have no problem running the game maxed out. The result? Well, the cut scenes look movie quality! Graphics: 9/10Now for control. After playing around with the custom controls, the game is playable on a keyboard, although for the best experience, playing on an Xbox 360 controller is my recommendation. The menus all have Xbox buttons, so sometimes it can be a little tricky to use a keyboard. But playable, definitely. Control: 8.75/10And gameplay. Oh, the gameplay! It is glorious, enjoyable, and keeps you craving more. As stated early, the difficulty is high, but once you learn how the game operates and what works, you will see less You Died! screens. I need to stop myself before this turns into an essay, so here: Gameplay: 9.5/10With awesome, action packed gameplay, epic graphics, and good control, you will be on your quest to seek souls, lest this land swallow you whole, as it has done to many others...Overall rating: 9.2, go buy this game now!"
,Recommended,236430,9923556,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,Slang,"Controls were a nightmare at first with Keyboard and Mouse, but if you simply unbind all mouse keybinds except Left/Right click then you can bind the rest of the buttons to any key you wish and it becomes easy to use. My only problem is that you can't bind Left click + Double left click to the same button, causing you to need to click the mouse button slowly to be able to attack, as any fast clicking causes the attack to be a heavy attack which then throws you off timing and gets you killed etc. (Or in my case, any fast clicking causes nothing to happen, as I have unbound double click, this makes the game even more unplayable than it already was.) The game is completely playable apart from that one problem, if you can get over it. But, I find the basic attack button not working correctly to be a fatal flaw that costs the entire game everything and until I work out a way to fix this, I can't play and am unsatisfied with this game.Edit: Once I got past this flaw i've spent a lot of time on it, it's fun to play, but it doesn't live up to Dark Souls.

If you're like me and think that well-designed and interesting boss fights and levels are the best part of the Souls series... well, this is not the game for you.Demon's Souls was a literal masterpiece, and it's spiritual sequel Dark Souls was quite a game in its own right. While it never reached the peaks of quality boss design like Maneaters or False King; the interesting fights like Old Hero or Fool's Idol; the all-important educational fights like Phalanx or Tower Knight; or the emotionally charged encounter with Maiden Astraea... it still blows Dark Souls 2 out of the water.I can count the well-crafted/interesting/emotional/memorable fights on one hand (it's 2, and both are ONLY interesting). Level design is acceptable but lacks consitency, the world is a scattered and poorly connected mess (Majula->Tower of Flame->No Man's Wharf/Earthen Peak->Iron Keep), enemy variety is lacking and their placement is haphazard at best, and the game is much easier than the predecessors.It lacks the interesting lore of Demon's Souls (and Dark Souls) and the in-depth character stories of Dark Souls. The lore is... alright. There are some neat little tidbits but it relies too much on ""mysterious"" (The true nature of this sword is unknown, even to theLost Sinnerherself.) descriptions and references to Dark Souls to actually stand out. The characters, while at least somewhat engaging have no closure in their storylines whatsoever. All vendor-style NPCs end up in Majula and then just... stay there, never changing. The summonable NPCs just... stop being summonable with no real culmination of their story arc and the only character story with a real ending(Creighton and Pate)is kind of a letdown, and a clear reference to the previous games.HOWEVER! It is still a Souls game. Discovering each new area, beating the bosses, no matter how lame they may be, and admiring the cool environments is still a lot of fun. No matter how much I wish it were more like Demon's Souls and Dark Souls and no matter how much I complain about how bad it is... it's still a a pretty sweet ride and a wicked adventure.So take this as you will. I was let down and underwhelmed when I looked back at the game, but still had a pretty good time (despite a few glaring issues with the bosses) during my first playthrough.7.5/10"

Enemies are now better designed, and place better, now enemies that can kill you in two or three hits can also be killed in a few hits instead of thirty.

You already know if you want this game.If you're genuinely unsure if you want this game, then you probably don't have the context in which to appreciate it anyway, so I might not bother. This sounds like the sort of fedora-tipping elitism you'd hear on yonchan or reddit, but frankly, it's true.See, Dark Souls is a series built on the remains of its forebears, classic role-playing games like Wizardry and From Software's own King's Field series. It's unintuitive, bordering on downright cryptic, mercilessly unforgiving to the point of being abusive, and at times seemingly totally random and inexplicable. However, it IS a modern game, and as such, a combination of quick reflexes and thorough consideration will lead you to victory.With easily 40 hours of content (or more, if you're a new player -- my first character was over 100 hours, as I learned the ins and outs of the game), and with some of the best gameplay and theming in gaming today, it's not obvious why I may not recommend Dark Souls II to the casual player -- it goes way beyond ""it's really hard"". Still, if you're any kind of hardcore gamer, you really can't afford to miss this game.(One postscript I will add is that this game *basically doesn't work* without online play. It can be played offline, but the mechanics of the game are crafted such that you really, really need to be online to enjoy it properly.)"

From Soft. definitely refined the pain formula from Dark Souls 1 into something even more sadistic. However, despite the increase in challenge the game still remains largely fair, but that doesn't mean it is any less forgiving. Every single action and button press counts, and that is hardly an understatement. Also, hope for the best as your death count will hardly be anything less than six digit numbers."

Compared to Dark Souls 1 it surely isn't superior, but I still found it more enjoyable since it was actually a very good port compared to the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Dark Souls: Prepare to die edition was. Overall the gameplay is the same difficult but rewarding experience, like Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1. There are some very cool characters, Bosses and interesting areas to explore, sadly this is a bit dumbed down by some honest to god terrible area design ideas. The graphics are quite good and the game runs smoothly, plus you can always use mods to make the game look better. Gameplay is the real deal of the game, as it is very well designed, except for some weird hitboxes on some enemies. The story is mysterious, and heavily tailored by yourself and the fanbase in general, and consists of a lot of speculation. There is a lot of weapons and armor sets to make yourself look cool and unique. The multiplayer works very well, and the PvP is quite fun. When it comes to the DLC:s out of the 2/3 that have come out, I'd say it is worth it to buy the season pass, both of the DLC:s are quite hard and interesting, and they consist of some throwbacks to the previous game and the main game itself. Most of the bosses are great, with an exception of 1 (Per DLC) and they are all quite difficult too. I would definetly recommend to buy this game, if you have even the slightest intrest on it. If you do not like difficult games, then do not buy it. But as you can see from my total playtime, at least I have had some very good times with this game.(I hope the last DLC is good too, from what I have seen in the trailer, it does look promising)I recommend to buy this game. 9/10"

It's a series that pretty much exclaims that you're in for some serious challenge and difficulty right from the get-go. So be prepared to die. A lot.DS2 (and the previous title, I might add) is one of those rare games that provides the feeling of sheer accomplishment from pretty much everything you do. And it achieves this by making the game absolutely brutal and relentless in terms of difficulty.But it's actually pretty fair, meaning you shall be rewarded justly, providing you understand the mechanics, the enemies, the world, the items, and your character. Failure to effectively understand the elements of the game will quickly lead to your demise over and over again, and it only gets more difficult the more you progress. The amount of times you will die only serve as a blunt reminder that you're not learning or using what you've learned well enough.I definitely recommend playing this only if you are dedicated gamer with a penchant for constantly wanting to improve themselves.

Its world feels kind of ""patched together"" - there are four paths from the hub, each with three linear sections before reaching the end. Not very immersive.

From Software really stepped it up with Dark Souls II. Not only are we able to utilize all the 60 fps glory, but we now have support for 1080p! Gameplay wise, I feel is a much more solid mechanic from the first.

So here is my opinion: DS1 levels had entire environments ridden with more traps, hidden ambushes and generally, they gave you that sensation, that the ENTIRE world was against you, which also gave off the feeling that the game was more difficult and the environments more complex (which at some points of the game I agree that they were)......................................................................HOWEVER.....................................................................I disagree with the opinion that DS1 is more difficult a game that DS2 since: DS2 has WAY more difficult bosses, many of which are virtually impossible to defeat without help like The Smelter Demon or Duke's Dear Freja, while in DS1 I personally as a gamer defeateed all the bosses (some more difficult that the others) alone, because back then i used to play on the xbox and i didn't have an xbox live membership. Also concerning the many traps of DS1, in DS2 they have simply been REPLACED with more NPCs not because of poor level design, but rather due to the lore. Also  let's not forget that NPCs in DS1 after NG+ -while still becoming stronger- they were not anywhere near as strong as how strong the player would become later in the game, effectively making them a LOT easier to deal with, something that is not true at all with DS2 since the enemies become gradually more and more powerful, not only individually, but in numbers as well since every NG+ in DS2 comes with more enemy NPCs, on top of which they are red phantoms as well, which are even stronger than their already stronger (due to the NG+) normal counterparts.I don't think DS2 is in any way inferior to DS1, especially with the new DLC which were absolutely amazing imo. There are many more features of DS2, that i personally find superior compared to those of DS1 like: 1) a greater variety of weapons, shields, spells, armor etc etc 2) better graphics (which was expected as a newer game ofc but it's still worth mentioning imo) and 3) better pvp (once again, in my opinion) which for me was the most important aspect as a mainly pvp player.I am not going to emphasize any more on the topic, as I believe everyone  has understood by now  what i'm trying to say so all I'm going to do is compliment this game on how great it is, and finally advise the people that don't like it to simply play something else, since obviously they don't like this one.Never forget.

But never think that I on every battle even though at this time I have over 2k health and so I can take a lot of damage magic resistances with my gear even the elements, I have found my own balance in my build and taken advantage of the unique system. This game beats out any MMORPG where you can do coop in certain areas and you fight and coop with different levels of characters.In the Drangleic Castle I was with two people I summoned not trying to take a chance with going in with only 3 Human Effegy's and not quite as strong as I am now but I have Dark Souls PTDE so I was an experienced player and played dark souls 2 on the xbox 360 when it first came about before getting it on PC. You got stone guards and♥♥♥♥♥♥going from everywhere as soon as we hit one room and i have the Zweihander which is another greatsword and so were dancing around them but were all taking some damage and im healing myself so we dont all die. Someone INVADES me while in the middle of the fight and we have to hurry and kill the guards. One of the people I summoned died and so me and the other had to kill the invader and we did. Finally we got throughh to more fights through the parts of the castle that was huge and very intense if you get stuck fighting bigger enemies on the steps.Dark Souls 2 was my favorite game release of the year simply because it challenges you, Ive died probably a hundred thousand times and then I was able to get better through loss. It's one of the hardest games that is worth playing because its fun, realistic in terms of combat, and the graphics are flawless, the areas are all different, vast and there are a number of places and chests you'll encounter. It gives the feeling of an MMORPG without a grindy feel and that's why I retired pretty much from them. Even if you play it casually, it has interesting single player experiences but honestly the multiplayer part is what MAKES the game because being invaded shows that youre not the only one. There are a number of us out there that are skilled and can dance circles around newbies on the game. Even with a new character because builds can all be different once you get the combat system you still have an advantage over players at a higher level if they aren't as skilled this game requires that and its the most beautiful gaming experience because of that."

Now, before I make this into a book, I'll describe your first possible experience in one phrase that this series of awesomeness is very well known for: Prepare to Die!"

In my opinion DS2 has improvements on the original, and is a shining example of thoughtful game design and direction. Full of character and harshness, the world comes alive with clever environment design. The DLCs are a must have if you enjoyed the game, especially the Crown of the Ivory King which shows some of the best environment design and character.

I have not had that feeling in a long time, there were some games that had my interest but never stayed long.When I first started playing Dark Souls, I had been so desensitized to easy games that are more just for storyline than actual gameplay (Mass Effect, Assassins Creed, Bioshock, etc). Not taking anyway from those games but you could easily recover from any mistake and typically move on to beat the game with ease.Not Dark Souls, one mistep and your face will get clobbered in like a bucket of chicken. This game lets you know right away that mistakes are not forgiven. It can be infuriating and disgusting at times to die in the game, but when you finally beat the boss or level that has given you such a hard time, the feeling is amazing. In the end, no matter how frustrated you are, you always enjoy the moments where you succeed and keep on moving to find that feeling.The community is also A+, they typically always bow before a duel or show some respect upon defeating, or losing to you."

Bandai told us we would receive a great lighting system which we didn't, and many more promises. We did not receive these promises in the finished version. The story line as well is much worse than it is in Dark Souls. So, I was a little bit irked, but I could live through it. After a hundred plus hours of gameplay, I realized that this game was fine, nothing spectcular. When I heard about the Scholar of the First Sin update to Dark Souls II, my heart skiped a beat. A new nex-gen version to the game that has better lighting, better story and finally becomes a great sequel to my favorite game? As I researched this though, my excitment turned into horror. It wasn't a fix, it was another way to milk this game, forces players who have already bought this game to buy it again? Are you kidding me? Not just that it will include all of the DLC, so Bandai is telling us ""Hey loyal customers who love our game, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and buy it again!"" I never thought Bandai could go this low, and expecially since I have loved all of the souls games. I feel personally screwed by Bandai. We, as an informed community, cannot, CANNOT, purchase this, we must use the power of our money to force Bandai to give this to us for free.

I have enjoyed my time with it, Fromsoft have stuck with the same formula. Nothing much has changed really, in a way its become a bit more accessible to people who had a hard time with either Demon's or Dark Souls. But that said its not made that accessible in the way of dumbing it down and striping it of its core values.The major difference for me was getting used to the new walking speed and controls. The rest of the controls feel 100% the same as the previous games. And that's not really a drawback its just a matter of playing the game and it will all feel natural. And if you never played a Souls game before, you won't even notice.Co-Op is viable with friends now, which comes in the form of a ring that you can buy pretty much straight off the bat. Making the game even easier for new comers who feel the odds are stacked too much against them.Souls fans should get this game.

76561198077801335,Recommended,236430,30650205,Posted: 21 March,all,Kn1VeS,"The soulsborne series of games is known to harbor some of the most innovative and exciting action-rpg games of the past decade. Whilst Dark Souls 2 (DS2) is part of this illustrious collection, it is the weakest of the Souls games, but this does not make it a bad game…not by a long shot. DS2 builds on many of the strengths of the first Souls game; it has strong combat, challenging encounters, the most diverse array of spells in a Souls game, an enthralling musical score, and for me, oh so important, it is rich in lore.Yet, it stumbles in places such as the many lackluster boss fights and uninteresting locations to explore. In general, the game’s design suffers from repetition and reskinning. Many boss fights feel as if they are the same boss just reskinned to look different; and the same applies to the locations you will spend approximately 30+ hours exploring. Also, it is by far the most conservatively designed outing in the Souls series, never really hitting that “OMG…what the ♥♥♥♥ is that?” factor that the first and third games do so well. However, a major redeeming factor are the dlc expansions that add much variety in terms of enemies, locations, and expanding the story and lore vaguely explained in the initial release. 8/10"

,Recommended,236430,9971321,"Posted: 29 April, 2014",all,Dust,"Pros:- Very challenging combat, rewards persistence and tactical thinking.- Lots of content; game encourages character variation and allows for creative builds.- Breathtakingly-beautiful levels that are interesting in design and encourage exploration.- Much more solid port than its predecessor. Engine-wise the game runs very well. Some technical issues were reported by other players, I have not experienced this myself so I can't complain there.Personally, however, I am disappointed with DS2. How disappointed, you ask? It doesn't come close to the masterpiece that is Dark Souls 1. Why, you ask? Soul Memory... 'nuff said.""Wait a minute! What is this 'Soul Memory' thing you speak of?""Dark Souls 1 used a player's SL (soul level) to determine matchmaking with others online. To connect with a player, whether for co-op or PvP, you needed to be roughly within 15% of their SL. This system had its own flaws, but it worked fine. DS2 innovated by negating that SL requirement, and replacing it with a similar ""roughly 15%"" calculation of SM or 'soul memory', which is the total number of souls ever collected by a character (be it from enemies, PvP, consuming soul-items... you name it).""So what is the big deal with SM? Why is that so bad?""You can't stay in a given ""strength level"". Let's say you're like me, and you LOVE co-op. You just keep placing your summon sign and helping people along with a boss, again and again. You can't do that now, since after a while you gain enough souls as a phantom that you are now ""outside the SM range"" for most players in the area, so they stop seeing your sign. So you move to the next area, rinse and repeat. Eventually you have collected so many souls that you are not valid for matchmakinganywhere.""Well then, don't focus on co-op! There's more to the game than that.""1. That's how I roll, and it worked well with SL as the matchmaking mechanic.2. It goes the same way with invading - you get souls by destroying your targets, and eventually won't get invasions anymore. Love making a character for specific-area invasion? Too bad, gonna have to re-make it from scratch every once in a while to keep playing the same style.""Well that sounds reasonable! You got so many souls, so you must really be overpowered for all those lower-SM players.""False. SM counts souls ever COLLECTED, not souls ever SPENT. You can also get screwed over the other way around: Remember the core death mechanic of the Souls series? When you die, you drop all your souls and you need to go retrieve them. If you die before retrieval is possible, “bye-bye souls”... only except in DS2 those lost souls still count toward your SM, since at some point you DID collect them, even though you never used them. So a player that is doing poorly is going to have an even harder time with the game: technically his SM count will be very high while his character is pretty much garbage-on-legs. Then, every invasion will be against stronger opponents, and fewer co-ops will be possible since players in that poor guy's area are all technically at a lower SM count than he is, and he won't see their signs.This last part leads me tothe main problem with SM.Seems like it was implemented to deter twinking; that is, to stop players from using overpowered gear against people who are valid for matchmaking. But it doesn't work. A good, experienced player in DS2 has a much, MUCH easier time clearing areas and getting specific items than a new player. So it is still very possible to get superb gear at low SM counts, and use that gear to grief the f♥ck out of other players with low SM counts (since they arewaybehind you in terms of power).Arguably, the twinking problem is evenworsenow than it ever was.There are certainother gameplay changes that I dislike in comparison to the first game, but I don't think they are of similar importance as this issue. They are also VERY subjective and hence I don't give them much weight. Some of those are:- Limited number of respawns per enemy. GG, people who actually like to farm. Say 'bonfire ascetic' one more time. I dare you. I double dare you, m♥therf♥cker.- New menu system is very much meh. Why fix that which is not broken? [edit: I got over it, really]- Poise is now complete b♥llsh♥t. A crippled hedgehog can stunlock an enemy in DS2. Why, why, why?- Leveling up actually requires talking to an NPC, who can only be found in one area.- Controls are... ""tighter""? What the hell? Let me pull off a guard-break or a leap-attack without feeling like it deserves a Steam achievement.- ""You require additionalpylonsdurability!""- Want to use a new weapon and need more titanite? Too bad you ran out materials at the blacksmith, eh buddy? Yes, you can get more later. But again, what if you're trying to enjoy the early areas? That's poor design.So, in summary... I would generally recommend the game for playersnewto the Souls series, since they would have an easier time accepting the new mechanics. And yes, Iamtorn about the final ""not recommended"" verdict that I give DS2, since it still is a very fun game (only it also gives a huge middle-finger to my favorite styles of play: co-op, invading with a build, and farming).My recommendation is to see if a friend can lend you their copy of the game and spend a few hours playing. See how you like the new mechanics; see if the combat feels interesting and rewarding to you. Other than that, probably don't buy until SM is ""fixed"" in some way.Update after more time spent playing:May 31th, 2014. It's been about a month since I posted the original review and I have played quite a bit since [from ~30 hours played to ~110 hours]. I still think SM is a broken mechanic, and my complaint about availability of upgrade materials is even more prominent now. However I still enjoy the game and I still encourage you to try and borrow it from a friend (Steam has sharing now, you know). Give it a try and see how you feel about it, then decide if it's worth your time.I have also changed my final verdict to ""Recommended Game"" since I really do encourage you to try and pick this game up. Just keep what I mentioned earlier in mind.That said, have fun playing. KTHXBYE~"

I don't understand what all the fuss is about over awful graphics and the mouse and keyboard game play. Now some things cannot be over looked and this is the lack of online functionability right now. It is highly recommended that you do use xbox360 controller while playing this game, it is an advantage to people who like simple controls (dont take that in the wrong way) but i am doing just fine with a key board and mouse i just had to re-assign  a few keys here and there and then it felt natural although i will be picking up a wired xbox360 controller here soon just so i dont have to deal with akward camera angles which i beleive to be the only downside to using a mouse and keyboard. Overall game play matches up with console although it is extremely amazing to have a smooth 60fps at all times compared to 30-20fps i got on PS3 sometimes( i have the old PS3 i dont know if the newer ones preform better or not). I would recommed this game to someone who is a vetern to the souls series with a decent PC and i would recommed to this to someone who is new to the souls series, i feel anyone at any age could play this game because the learning curve is great, the game never really helps you but holds you to a high standard where the player has to be alert at all times. I would say that i have enjoyed this game more than I did Dark Souls, the game play just seems more polished with combat very much improved and it again kept the open world aspect, with it being open world they have implimented fast travel from the very start of the game instead of making the player walk everywhere where loading screens(at least for me) take no less than 3 seconds as where the consoles can take more than 35 seconds at times. Overall I give this game a 9.5/10 the slightly rough launch of the PC version where people experinced crashes also affected me and is why im not giving a 10/10."

76561197972752383,Recommended,236430,11000355,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,Boogerwood,"So much has already been said about Dark Souls II that I'll direct you to the ""formal"" reviews of IGN, PC Gamer, etc.  I will say, at the end of the day, it's a solid game worth every penny to buy.  I will agree that it's ""easier"" than previous Souls games in several ways, but it is also still a rewarding and enjoyable gaming experience.  If you are spoiler free and going in completely blind, you will find it an incredible challenge.Personally, I feel the weightiness of combat is actually improved.  The reduction in iFrames is, for me, a welcomed changed; you need to more legitamately avoid being hit versus rolling magically through a sword (note I said ""more"" because there is still some of this). The addition of 4 ring slots is a welcome customization change.  While they were not able to deliver fully on the lighting and details they had hoped for (and shown us), it is still a visually stunning game that makes you pause frequently to appreciate the artistry.I do not want to spoil the story, but suffice it to say, it is not as epic as its predecessor.  In its own way, however, it stands up and delivers a tale that rewards the patient listener and reader as souls games have in the past.  Still, it left me wishing for more.The only comment I will say about PvP is that I feel it was improved.  There was so much gimmickry with Dark Souls 1 that fighting became more about who knew the tricks or who could create a trolling low SL build to ruin the experience for people legitamately playing through the game.  In DS2, however, I felt I was prepared and capable of fighing anyone who invaded me: it just requred patience and attention which are combat skills that SHOULD be an advantage and not made irrelevant because someone was able to easily make a ninja flipping Havel who was the master of lag stabs and lag parries.In summary, if you enjoy the Souls experience, buy this.  If you're new and intrigued by the Souls experience, buy this.  Personally, I felt they DID make it more accessible while still showing this veteran a good time.  And that was and continues to be well worth my $60."

It doesn't have a brick wall learning curve like the first did and it didn't even skimp on difficulty in order to achieve this.If you're like me and couldn't stand the way Healing items / Kindling / Transient Curse / Divine weapons / Curse / Every other useless mechanic used to pad out one area with an annoying gimmick worked, then this game is a breath of fresh air.The bloody thing works, for a start. Runs smoothly in 1080p. Admittedly you're still going to want to use a controller but you could probably use a keyboard if you're insane / superhuman.Builds & weight system seem a bit more balanced this time around. PvP doesn't seem to be 'Katana / Dark Magic in light armour or GTFO' anymore and you actually get a bit more choice in what you want to wear, though PvP does feel slower. Judge that how you will, it's not always a downside.One gripe many people might have is the lack of creativity when it comes to boss design. Let's be honest, it's an array of guys wearing heavy armour and then the odd dragon and demon. In fact, I think about half of the bosses boil down to 'guy in armour.' Arguably makes the game easier since 'Hold up your shield and rub against him' is a viable tactic for half the boss fights in the game, but to be fair there are a few curveballs thrown in there that completely decimate people who sit behind shields.Probably a biased review considering I had little love for Dark Souls due to many of the mechanics listed in the beginning of the review, but I definitely think that from a mechanical and gameplay standpoint, this is a superior game. It's still as difficult while being less frustrating due to the simplification of mechanics and better bonfire placement.TL;DR Got rid of all the bad bits of Dark Souls but unfortunately dropped a lot of the world, enemies + exposition in the bin with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics. Better gameplay experience, mechanics better designed, would recommend to anyone who doesn't get stressed too easily."

The PvP system seems a little broken to most with the addition of soul memory, which is used to pair individuals for PvP instead of soul level. But PvE wise it is the same old dark souls on a much granger scale. The addition of an hp penalty on death, more difficult to land back stabs/parries, and the added difficulty of finding a shield that blocks 100% physical makes the game feel more challenging.

People will join your game and make your life Hell. Bosses will toss you around like a ragdoll. Normal enemies will roam up and slit your throat. It's that kind of game.That's not a bad thing, though. It makes each goal you reach in the game that much more rewarding.This is the funnest game I have played in a while.The combat is very clunky without a controller. I am a diehard Keyboard and mouse guy, so I had to use a third party macro program so that I could bind my keys to my liking, since the default PC controls are terrible. Once I got the hang of it, though, it played just fine. The combat is responsive(once you master your controls) and the gameplay is smooth.I highly recommend that you complete your first playthrough without the use of a walkthrough. Anything that you might miss can be obtained in newgame+, and having each boss be an epic new surprise is well worth it."

It is basically a punishement in my opinion against good players from not being able to show how successful they are in completing the game at the LOWEST possible level, as they are forced to use them or potentially lose them.I do like the gradual loss of humanity versus going immediately hollow from Dark Souls (with no loss of health) versus Demon's Souls (half loss of total health), as this mechanic is completely fair.  It is visual in appearance as well as an indicator.Finally, the ability to be invaded at ANY TIME, adds a real challenge to the game hollow or not.For those who perfer to play solo, this is not a problem either, as you can easily go offline from Steam and take that path, without any real penalty.  Not everyone wants to be constantly invaded, and I can understand that, because of the variety of cheaters and gankers that sometimes appear in the game.Nothing is less fun than be double or triple teamed by players who design character builds exclusively for PvP, and you are set up for PvE.The other reason offline is preferred (at least by me), is that unless you have a ROCK solid internet connection, lag can give you hell in this game as well as ""world"" disconnects.If you want to play online, make sure you are using a LAN connection, versus WIFI.If you know Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition, you will not be disappointed, and the DLC is worth the money to experience the full lore and history of the game.An outstanding game experience overall, and easily punishes your mistakes because you know you made them not because the game was ""cheap"".I have already finished the entire game, including all the DLC, and it certainly was worth my time.Right now, I am revisiting areas using ""Bonfire Aestics"" to farm materials before I start on NG++ with my journery to Drangiec all over again..."

If you want a button masher with a nice storyline, DON'T buy Dark SoulsI loved Dark Souls 1 and this game is even better for a few reasons. It's a much prettier game and there's more contrast between areas. The storyline, while not blatantly obvious, doesn't require writing down and studying every piece of information to try figure it out. The fighting is pretty much the same but more punishing if you miss time a parry or backstab (parries are easier now and backstabs harder). The PC version plays much better than DS1 did, it was made for PC and isn't a port, the results show. Some of the mechanics have changed a bit (limited respawning of creatures limits farming and losing a bit of total health when you die) and may seem unfair at first but it doesn't change the difficulty immensely, just takes some getting used to. The only flaw I find is that most of the enemies are replicas of enemies in the previous games, but it's really not a big deal. I'd definitely recommend this game."

At first you may think,""wow this is pretty easy, I dont see the big deal"" But as soon as you first challenge a boss, or get over whelmed by a giant metal knight, and then have to fight six more knights even stronger than the last, is such a fun, and angering, challenge. Once you feel you are getting good, and have a strong weapon, and strong armor, then you meet pvp. A random red figure shows up in your world, and the text at the bottom saying,""xXnoobslayerXx"" or something of the sort apears. You think with a name like that they cant be hard.

You can invest skill points into things such as strength to allow you to use bigger and badder weapons and to increase damage output. You can invest points into Intelligence, allowing you to use spells and Faith to use Miracles. You can create builds such as a Knight or a Dark Mage. The maximum is Level 838, which almost immpossible to get.Soul Memory is quite a contriversal feature. It cancels out the matchmaking system from Dark Souls 1, throwing out Soul Level matchmaking. Soul Memory is divided up into tiers. You can be Level 45, but losing souls constantly and forgeting to Level up; You can PvP with a guy who is Soul Level 345, and he's fully geared.

What it does improve on is the player character and online features for sure. Starting with the online features, PvP has been more focused on in this installment. Some of the covenants now allow arena style combat through a matchmaking system, instead of only being able to invade/be invaded. The invasions are still there and it all works a lot smoother now. There are plenty more options for PvP. Leaving messages on the ground for other players is smoother. You can access it through the start menu instead of having to equip the orange soap stone.I found the character options to allow more creativity. You can now level up your Vitality to allow you to have more carry weight. This means that if your vitality is high enough you can be more nimble while wearing heavier armor and won't fat roll. You can now equip 3 weapons to each hand instead of two. New spells have been introduced and a new spell type called Hexes. Upgrading items is pretty much unchanged apart from the fact that you can now remove imbuements from weapons if you're not happy with them. There is no more bonfire kindling, you slowly upgrade your Estus Flask by finding Estus Shards in the world. This is a much better design than instantly giving you maxed out flasks by sacrificing a couple humanities. Humanity is also gone as an item, now you can use Human Effigies to instantly restore your humanity anywhere in the world. I'm not sure how i feel about this, i mean i never used the humanity much in the first game, but i did like the risk reward system it had. You can also respec your character if you find a certain rare item. It all allows for a lot more experimentation, but it also reduces the risks in the game, which lowers the difficulty greatly.The world of Drangleic is a beautiful, but the way it's pieced together is far less interesting. Lordran interconnected in so many ways that finding shortcuts was incredibly interesting. Finding that link between a high level area and a low level one felt like a relief and achievement. DS2 doesn't really have that, you have a central hub that splits off into a few quite linear paths. It's almost like Demons Souls without the loading screens. You can also fast travel right off the bat so in most cases once you reach a bonfire you won't have any reason to revisit the path you took to get there except for soul farming. Another big issue i have is like in Demon Souls you can only level up your character by revisiting the hub area. Now with the way the world is designed this means the fast travel is incredibly useful, but it's ridiculous that you can't just level up at any bonfire. It would make no difference to the gameplay what so ever. This design choice just creates tedium, and after the perfect design of the first game i don't understand why they would change it.If course the main thing you'll probably want to knwo about is the boss fights? Well...they're underwhelming, and all over the place in difficulty. I'm finding the later bosses to be far easier than some of the early ones, and none of them are really that interesting. They're still incredibly tense battles, but i feel slightly overpowered (for a DS game anyway). Even the standard enemies throughtout the world don't feel as challenging. They attack faster in than in the first game but a lot of them you can literally just run past. They also stop respawning after you've killed them a number of times, which is another weird design choice i don't understand.I don't know what else i can really say. It's like they've added tedium through their world design and have sprouted other bad design choices from that initial bad design choice. It's still a great game, it's still very challenging, but it's just not as interesting or rewarding as its predecessor."

Perhaps a case of two steps forward, one step back."
,Recommended,236430,13952325,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Clovis,"While DS2 lacks the perfect integration of gameplay and story found in the original Dark Souls, it is still a fantastic action RPG with many interesting environments and characters. Unlike with Dark Souls, some areas of the game are a letdown and some bosses are a bit unoriginal. This is really only a minor problem though.The game has been streamlined, but still retains plenty of challenge. Most of the changes are great and avoid some unnecesary annoyances from DS1. The only exception is losing max health from deaths. This can, at first, seem like it could make a difficult situation soon become impossible. In practice though, this shouldn't be a problem for most players. An early game item resolves most of the problem, a later area completely removes the problem, and you can always avoid it by jumping into the fantastic co-op (helping another player defeat a boss is really fun, and it restores your max health).For me, the replay value in DS2 is almost incomparable for an action game. There is a wide range of weapon/spell based approaches to the game. Playing through solo, using NPC summons, or going co-op adds to that. I'm not into PVP, but that's another avenue for extending gameplay. One of the best streamlines in DS2 is an item that lets you re-spec your character, so you don't have to start completely from scratch to try a new style. As soon as the credits rolled on New Game, I jumped back in, picked up some missing items, and hit NG+. While I've been playing NG+ I've been planning a new character so that I can help other first time players with all the bosses. There's just not enough time to get everything in!On the difficulty: there are no difficulty options like ""Easy"" or ""Hard"" here, but I think any gamer could finish DS2. If you want ""Hard mode"", just jump right in blind. You might end up gimping your character or spending hours lost, but I'm guessing you'll get the best payoff in the end. I created my own ""Medium"" difficulty game by playing solo using guides and wikis to help me along, but no summons to help in fights. But, you can make things easier by using the NPC summons and Co-Op. The game can really go from a Nintendo-hard challenge to a fun romp with friends depending on your choices.Final note: Games for Windows Live is dead, and DS2 never used it. The online components have worked really well for me, although it looks like PvP has some lag issues."

Bloodborne was the successor to Dark souls I wanted. and with that I feel quite satiated, the story doesn't feel convoluted and stupid, item descriptions actually felt connected to the world instead of just a bunch of pronouns with question marks. But, neither game has anywhere near as much spell variety or weapon variety as Dark souls II. It feels like this game was designed, with less focus on the story and interesting boss fights, and more on gameplay.things like Shield Breaking forces players in pvp to be on the offensive instead of turtling into a corner, invasions would occur actively due to the fact that you never really lose the ability to engage in pvp in an area, regardless if a boss is dead or not.  small soaps, while mostly selfish, would give you the ability to co-op for short commitments.to end this bubble of ranting, I just want to say that the game has flaws, big ones (bosses are extremely boring. you will never get a story experience like that of Bloodborne, Demon's Souls or Dark Souls I, world is a badly designed mess, lazy level design, soulvessels leading to shortened playtime, disgusting copy-pasta textures in areas that should have recieved the most work) But, if you do it for the PVP or the Co-Op you'll be in for a treat."

Gameplay has been improved combat wise, save for death penalties, lifegems, and some added stats that did more harm than good. The world here felt mainly uninspired and wasn't intertwined with clever shortcuts that many loved about the original. Boss battles were overall disappointing due to their mostly low difficulty and bland designs, except for a few sprinkled around the game. DLC was overall better than the base game with better areas, but the bosses were still disappointing.It's still a great RPG, just not the best Dark Souls game. If you want to get into the series, start with the original."

Many of the locations are eye-catching even if you were to turn all the settings down, and I have found myself stopping to take a better look are details of the landscapes.Overall, I'd recommend buying it, though some may want to wait for the rerelease sometime 2015."

I says to him, ""Hey devs, as long as it's more of the same as in the first, I'll be happy."" And ole devs musta took that to heart because that's exactly what DS2 is. More of the same in a different context and environment. It's a fun game, but be prepared to die and struggle and curse and not know where to go. Accidentally kill off important NPCs only to find you don't have enough souls to talk to their ghost. Attack some harmless looking pigs only to die over and over again to harmless looking pigs that are just so damn tiny, none of your attacks hit them. Uninstall the game for hours and tell your friends, yeah, I beat it, but it just didn't have that feeling I got from the first one, you know? A/5."

This game is terrible if you think of it as a sequel, but, as it's own game, this game is amazing.  By itself, Dark Souls II is a great fantasy RPG.  It has many elements you won't see in other traditional RPG's, and some elements of the first game translate over.Unfortunately, the hidden and immersive story of the first game is missing here.  In fact, it seems the writers just threw out ideas that seemed good and stapled them together.  The seamlessness of the world is also gone here; areas don't feel connected like they should and resemble the story of the game, thrown together.  A lot of the bosses feel very similar, and, in fact, there are bosses just copy and pasted from the first game.  However, if this is your first Souls game, or, if you hold it away from Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, the game is excellent.Pros:- The game has some decent graphics that can easily be modified by GeDoSaTo- It has a great replayability factor- The Difficulty- Great connectivity to PvP and CoOp- Great mechanics i.e. Souls that can translate to weapons- Some epic boss fights- DLC- More beginner friendlyCons:- DLC- Difficulty- Some boss fights feel either cheap or repetitive- The story seems pieced together a random"

I'm not one for hand holding, but a little hint as to where I should go or what I should do would be nice. There's really not so much content in the game as there is running around confused all the time. Might take hundreds of hours to complete because you have to explore everything 5 times to figure out what to do next.Most people seem to go crazy about the whole dying alot thing. Personally I think its just a game where it's easy to die more than a difficult game. Perhaps since so many games these days have made it nearly impossible to die, this game has gone in the opposite direction and it somehow feels fresh. If you counted how many deaths occurred in the original Mario Bros. for Nintendo, you might find that Dark Souls isn't really all that hard. It seems like a clunky Ninja Gaiden from Xbox and PS2.That being said, I did find it fun after getting used to the pauses between attacks and dodges. Once you get the timing down you can kill stuff a lot better.If you like Ninja Gaiden like games, you'll probably like this one. Personally I'd rather just play Ninja Gaiden. The controls are better in Ninja Gaiden and the attacks are much more combo/fight gamey (N.G. is esentially an open world DOA2 with a story and character progression).All in all, I have complaints and I find it overhyped, but I'm statisfied with the purchase and I look forward to playing it some more."

I don't have a tremendous amount of hours on my steam acount but I played on my friends account and clocked in an extra 50 or so hours just on my characters alone. It's a game that will constantly challenge you and more often than not you will not be rewarded for these challenges you will get that feeling of accomplishment only too die a few minutes later and having too do it all over again, so yeah I would absolutely recommend it but just go in knowing that it is definately not for everyone it is an extremely challenging game full of unfair fights and an insane amount of death, definately worth a try and especially if it's on sale definately worth the buy...PRAISE THE SUN!"

Great combat system; it feels authentic2. Innovative online co-operative system, allowing me to team up with others or for them to team up with me3. Non-linear4. Each enemy is unique and awesome in design5. Lots of different cool spells, gear, weapons, etc6. You can see the spirits and bloodstains of other players playing the same level as you7. You can read tips from other players (or write them yourself) about the environment and nearby enemy8. Great game design, sound and voice acting adds to the immersion9. You can create many different characters like bandits, swordsman and mages10. You can challenge other players to fight in an arena (using a statue at a convenent) or within a level (using a soap sign)Cons:1. Lack of a story to immerse you (this may annoy some)2. No easy mode. Can be very frustrating at times; you will die a lot! (It is definitely a challenge unless you look on youtube for hints)3. You can get invaded by others when you are fighting many enemiesThere is definitely replay value as you can create various characters and try beating the game in a different style. You don't have to play online but it makes it more fun. If there was a better story element to this game, I would have rated it higher. But maybe that is what the developers intended I don't know.To play it on PC it is recommended to use a controller for the best experience. It makes fighting much easier, especially against other online players who have very quick reflexes (some of them anyway!).Overall, I love the game and have spent many hours playing it (it took me around 40 hours the first playthrough to complete).Overall rating: 9.2/10Gameplay 9.5/10Sound: 9.5/10Design: 10/10Story: 7.5/10Online element: 9/10Value for money: 9.5/10"

I love the idea of being invaded or invading someone while they are playing through the campaign, but it angers me that co-op among friends is impossible.  I recommend this game and I don't, if you like to die alot, get trolled by people and npcs, get lost all the time, then this game is for you.

With that said, you're still in for a challenge.If you played Dark Souls on the PC, here are the key disfference:Looks better than the original Dark Souls for the PC and has a better framerate (which makes it easier on the eye to play).The game is easier than Dark Souls aswell, as stated above, though you can increase the difficulty if you feel that you need a better challenge. Also, people can invade you while being a ghoul compared to Dark Souls-With that said, my early impressions are that the design is a bit all over the place compared to a more consistent design in Dark Souls when it comes to locations and character/monster design.That doesn't make it a bad game, most of the key aspects are still solid which is a testament to the legwork done in the previous game(s) but it's a shame that they didn't give it a bit more polish."

Not like, ""oh hey this puzzle is hard"", but more like ""Oh hey I didn't time my dodge right and now I'm dead"", hard. There are changes between all three games, but Dark Souls 2 brings the most.Combat to me is more fluid. With the addition of the Adaptability stat, you can still lug around the heaviest weapons and swing as fast as dual weilding daggers. It does seem that dodging is faster than bringing your shield up however, and trying to figure that out lead to some very fustrating deaths. Stamina regen is probably a bigger thing in this game compared to the others, as doing actions that put you over what stam you have, make it seem like it takes even longer than usual to regen. I'm not going to go into the dual weilding aspect as I don't understand the point, nor will I the parrying/riposte system because I've always been bad at those in all three games.Story is still as cryptic as ever, but seems more focused on the Undead than the world. After talking with enough NPCs it seems the ""Link the Fire"" ending of Dark Souls 1 is the cannon ending, but with a larger time gap than first anticipated. The hardest part of figuring out the story are the items; as not all items (even major seeming ones), fail to contribute much, or anything at all to the story. I believe I have figured a good portion of it out, so if you are willing to hear my point of view on it, message me and we will discuss :DI have heard the arguement that Dark Souls 2 is easier than the first...I say let them play NG+ and see if that arguement is still valid."

When I heard that that Miyazaki was not involved with this new project I became suspicious but I knew I was going to try it anyway because of my love for the first two games. I have put in over 130 hours so far and can tell you that it is vast, beautiful, fun, has refined gameplay changes and is untimately a failure. Demon's Souls was a 'dark fantasy' game with a degree of difficulty that was married to this. Dark Souls was less so, but still retained much of the firsts dark beauty and absorbing story and characters. The writing in Dark Souls 2 is poor and there has been little effort in constructing an overarching story or related characters - indeed the main protagonist does even not make it onto the scene until you're about to fight them at the very end. This is a Souls game without the soul, contrived and at worst gimmicky. We are supposed to be confronting and vanquishing the forces of evil in these games, not slaying a random and meaningless glut of bosses and mobs.

This game shows you bare minimum amount of controls for your character then you have to learn the rest through combat or reading tooltips.  You will die... a lot... then die even more.  ""Get good"" is the only way to finish this game.  Everything can kill you if you aren't careful.  The story isn't directly told to you but hidden in the items and what you do in the game.  You might go through the entire game without figuring out what the lore is, but if you figure out the story it will amaze you with how well hidden so much lore was.  The hidden story is amazing."

Of coures the game is gonna be worse than the first Dark Souls like every sequel but the 60fps was a huge improvment.

Don't expect to do well at all on your first try, just concentrate on achieving one goal and move on from there. The story is similar to DSI In the fact that it's given to you piece meal from item descriptions and the snippets of information you can gather just from looking at your surroundings. The game itself is beautiful and pretty well balanced. The only real flaw that I can garner comes from the multiplayer aspect: Getting invaded randomly by a red completely breaks the immersion. Especially if their name is something along the lines of 420yoloxXexecutionerXxyolo420 and they're wearing havels and the jester chest.Along similar lines the multiplayer EVERYWHERE THAT ISN'T JAPAN. Suffers from /ridiculous/ lag. You will get backstabbed from across a room. You will get hit by daggers from across a room. You will be hit with projectiles that haven't yet been fired. And the worst part is: there is no disadvantage to being the cause of lag. In fact, some players choose to have their computer overworked to create lag as that lowers the frame rate. And since this is DS lower frame rate = more invincibility frames and less equipment degredation. As a result PvP is an on again off again sort of deal. Its great when it works and its goddamned awful when it doesn't.Don't even get me started on the pvp builds people use. There is nothing more frustrating than a havel clown with great magic barrier spamming laggy resonant souls at you.7/10From,You need to have more than two servers for the entirety of your community, and one of them should not be Japan only.

If Dark Souls was defined ""Hard"" I would define Dark Souls 2 ""Challenging"", it's different, because there is less frunstration and more challenge, naturally. I am not a fan of fantasy games, with mages, dragons, spells and stuff, but Dark Souls 2 allows you to develop your character the way you want it, and if you want to try a different build, there is the option to reallocate your skill points. I am talking about skill points like every other RPG, sure, but in Dark Souls 2 your success on the field is not dependent only on your stats, but also on your skills. you could have 99 of every point, but if you don't know, for example, when to dodge a sword thrust from an enemy, you will die anyways, naked or with a stainless steel armor +5. And the only way to raise your skill is practising, trying new combat styles until you find the one that fits you them most. But remember, maybe the next boss requires a completely different style. So don't fear death, and keep trying until you see the health bar of the boss reaching 0, and then, before any kind of reward, like souls (currency) or items, you will feel great, powerful, because you finally slain that damned boss. This is My favourite aspect of Dark Souls, 1 and 2. I would definitely give it a 10/10"

,Recommended,236430,13749277,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Applay,"I have thousand hours in this game, I know what I'm talking, so here's my final review.Dark Souls is very known for being a difficult game. Not because it forces you to be pixel perfect or have insane fast reaction time. It just doesn't tell you how things work, and you have to figure out about things by yourself. So if you like to explore and learn by trial, it's a great game.There are two things that got the fans of the series disappointed. One of them is the E3 footage they showed us. Where they promissed a really, really good looking game with a lot of atmosfere and interesting level design. The final product had different graphics, level design was dumbed down and it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off people. And now they promise they will deliver better graphics and multiplayer if we pay for it. Great!Second thing is that a lot of people complain the game isn't very hard as the previous ones. It's partially true. While the game won't feel as much difficult if you had played a previous Souls game, most of the bosses were really lazy and you could beat them by doing the same tactics over and over.Here comes a spoiler about how to beat bosses and most enemies, so you better skip this paragraph... You can just run to their back and hit after they attack combo. That's it! The bosses are oversized enemies just to scare you, and they lack AoE attacks to keep players away from their backs!About the DLC, it's the only good part of the game, really. Level design is great! You can see places you will reach or have passed by, while you progress. You look behind and see that bonfired you rested at, you look forward and see an area that you will reach later (or not, some of them are hidden areas).Most bosses are great and challenging, because they have a large variety of attacks, and attacks that can get you offguard if you try to use that tactic I mentioned before.You will have fun playing it, that's for sure! Just don't close your eyes to the problems this game has, and to the fact the developers suddenly decided to change a lot of things they showed us, without saying a word about it."

The low res textures in some areas are odd butthey aren't game breaking as it's usually something small that you are running by.The AI is good. Some act like mindless drones, and others seem to key in on you, and others yet have very telling patterns. Even the mobs with the telling patterns are hard. If you don't time things just right they will kill you, often in one or two hits.Death, I've seen a lot of it. I haven't been playing any actually challenging games of this nature, at least not for quite some time so it took me a lot of deaths to get used to it. I decided re-farming the mobs in an area for a bit would get me better at handling them. Just as I found out they don't just keep respawning forever each time you use the camp fire I had my first PVP encounter.I didn't really know what was happening at first, all I knew is I couldn't use the camp fire to heal and reset what mobs where still going to spawn. The notification reminded me of a world event in an MMO. As I hung out near the camp fire I kept looking around trying to see if anyone was coming, and sure enough there he/she was. A little dodging, a little blocking, and a whole lot of flame sword and one refillable healing pot and it was victory! It was a bit intence but obviously grinding out for a bit and learning how to really control my toon helped out a lot.The PVP was exciting, and if I hadn't had that healing pot and even a little less humanity left I would have been toast. It will keep you on your toes for sure.At any rate, much more game to go but so far I have to give it a solid thumbs up.Exciting, fun, hard, nerd rage inducing bliss. Welcome back to the days of un nerfed fun and challenge.About 19 hours in now and I've downed a boss and faced annother. The game just gets better, and harder the farther in you go.I'm about 32 hours in now... Yes the game is still fun, no I haven't beaten it.I played my first bit of co-op today and it was a blast. Turns out you get a lot of Souls for helping others out. It's fun as well. I'll be doing a lot more of that when I can. There is one thing I would like to note though. Leveling is somewhat painful, as it's farming the same mobs over and over again, and by the same I don't mean the same type in different areas, I mean the exact same mobs, over and over using a campfire to reset them. This get's old pretty quick, but just when I think I can't possibly kill them again without blowing my brains out then they stop spawning and leave a safe passage to the bigger harder guys.I've killed a few bosses now, and a few of the passive NPCs for their weapons. I've done a little more PVP, never usually by choice, but it does add a fun twist to break up the same old mob killing spree.I'm pretty sure I'm still a long way from the end and even with my complaint about the same areas and mobs to level, it's still keeping my interest and fun to play because of the sense of accomplishment when you finally defeat something that was knocking you down."

This is a HUGE over-simplification, but is, at its core, true: if you want a game that you can play while one hand is crushing candies on your iPad, your other is clicking cookies on your phone, and your feet are fumbling around on the keyboard trying to find the combonation of keys that makes you jump, you're going to have a bad time. If you want a game where you just hold out your hands and the game gives you a ton of items and gold and tells you that you're the best around, and nobody's ever going to take you down, you're going to be quite dissappointed. If you want a game that draws massive arrows on the floor telling you exactly where to go, what NPC's to talk to in what order, and where that one place you need to go to move on to the last part of the game, you know, that stupid black rotunda-thing? What was it called, Winter Shrine? Yeah, that part was slightly BS, but the rest of the time it gives you a massive sense of independence. You aren't just following orders: you're plopped into a dangerous, immersive world that doesn't hold your hand, but instead lets you struggle and explore, make your own path, earn your victories, and party like it's 1999 when you finally take down that big boss that gave you so much trouble. That being said, Dark Souls one does this too, and does a better job of it, but I still found DS2 quite enjoyable.In the beginning of the game, Dark Souls 2 gives you a bit more dialogue then Dark Souls one started with, which you may or may not speed through because all you care about is your ring of marginally increased health and your precious Estus Flask. Then you see that you only have one use and promptly flip the emerald herald the bird for being so stingy. Anyway, this hollow shell of a story probably means very little to you, so you run around looking for something to stab, or shoot soul arrows at, or... heal while looking angrily at your agressor? You have several cool classes to choose from at the beginning, each changing up your early gameplay a bit, but don't worry too much: you can find the gear of all the other classes later on. Anyway, you wander around, find a couple areas, filled to the brim with soldiers and golems who can't wait to hand you your♥♥♥♥♥ Then, after a couple tries, you'll beat all of them, and feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, which will be totally destroyed as soon as you move slightly further along and see another host of enemies, each weilding a chunk of your♥♥♥♥♥that they're just waiting to hand you. But you keep pressing on, defeating enemies, finding items, growing stronger, and letting out a contented sigh every time you see, in big, prowd, glowing letters ""BONFIRE LIT"", or ""VICTORY ACHIEVED"", knowing full well how hard you worked for that. And, if you are like me, you'll love it. You will love it so much that you'll keep adventuring and fighting, making your own path through Drangleic.And one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate. Without really knowing why..."

For this game is full of failures, especially if you don't already have some experience and undestanding of basic techinques of the series from Dark Souls.  You will have a very real chance to beat this game if you stick with it.  Don't let your ego take over.  You'll brag about how easy it was beating that one boss, only to die 15 seconds later by some unknown entity you were unprepared for.  The game can be linear, but will still give you the option of which things to do first.  I personally got a greatsoul that I wasn't supposed to get for a while, and only figured this out by looking it up on a forum.  Compared to Dark Soul's GFWL finicky online multiplayer, Dark Souls II is quite the improvement.  While I wasn't invaded very much on my first playthrough, excluding certain PvP heavy areas, I did get invaded a bit on NewGame+.  However my favorite multiplayer mechanic is currently co-op.  The co-op in Dark Souls II is certainly a mechanic you will want to try out with a friend or random player you find.  Be it helping another worldmaster with their challenges or summoning other players to your world, you'll find this can be a load of fun.  Just remember the more players you summon the harder your foes will get, gaining increased health and whatnot.  My recommendation when you do manage to beat the game and pass all the challenges your world has given you, is to not rush into NG+, and instead prepare yourself for NG+ by getting any items you may have left behind and upgarde your equipment.Now I'll leave you hollows to collecting your souls and preparing for the real challenge ahead.9.5/10"

After going back and forth playing both games for 200-300 hours, I must say I am very happy with the improvements.  The controls never fail me.  I only feel like animations pull me into  hits I legitamitely dodged in bad latency pvp (ds1 every grapple cheated, with worms pulling you back 10 feet) Most importantly to me every moment in Dark Souls 2 feels like I could overcome any obstacle with better timing. Dark Souls 1 had boss combos and abilities that are actually undodgeable.  A classic example is one of the giant enemies in DS2 starting a swing and hitting a player directly behind them, but that also existed in DS1, with even more ridiculous non animated movements. So now its less random chance and more skill.  Both games have issues with phantom range, or weapons hurting you without actually colliding with your model.  DS1 has more problems with enemy attacks having high phantom range, and DS2 has more issues in pvp with player weapon phantom ranges.   From Software makes excellent titles I own, but has rage inducing customer service interaction.  2 of their games in this genre are console only, and a lot of the screenshots and interview information given about this game has been totally false.  While I dont care too much about graphics not being as promised, or that there is a new version that has better graphics so soon after release, I am bothered a lot by them saying that it would be a full game without dlc, and then releasing dlc followed by a new standalone version with all dlc and improved multiplayer so soon, without this being an upgrade I could buy into without dropping another full game $$$$ on it.TLDRDark Sould 2 is a great game that improves on many aspects of Dark souls 1.Over the years as a fan of dark souls and Armored Core I have learned one thing.  Wait one year after release to buy and play any From Software title.This Version is obsolete, do not buy.It gives me much pain to put do not recommend on one of my favorite games ever, but that could be changed with just a multiplayer integration fix with the new version."

,Recommended,236430,10073935,"Posted: 10 May, 2014",all,Nuclear Fox,"So, this is the game that I was waiting for a long time, and overall wasn't disappointed.Pros:+Good controls and smooth camera movement, huge improvement over port of first part. Controller is recommended, but keyboard+mouse work great too, especially if you have multi-button mouse.+Graphics. It has its own graphical style, not a ""skyrim_ultra_tons_of_mods"", but my eyes were happy.+Atmosphere and lore. While the story isn't told much here, lore part compensates this absolutely. Every item description, every NPC dialog, even little moments of pre-fight videos can tell you something about history of the world. I recommend to read forums after completing the game to read theoris of how all the things are connected.+Thoughtful fights. You can't just cookie cut every enemy here like you are demigod or something. You are not god, you are actually almost nothing, many enemies can 2-shot you. You will die, but with every death you will think ""Oh, so that's how these guys move before slicing me to dust. I shall do something."" Then, of course, you will die again, because that's how you learn everything. But with every death you get, you will get better at this game.+Online features. Bloodstains showing places where other people died, messages from those who survived, signs from people who want to go coop with you to help you slay some enemies. And of course, invasions. At almost every time you can be attacked not only by mobs, but also by other players willing to get rewards or fun from your death, and this adds to the whole atmosphere of fear.Cons:-Bosses. If you haven't played first part, you will probably like them, but if you're familiar with bosses of DS1, most of these bosses will likely be not-so-awesome for you. Luckily, there are some exceptions to this rule, for example, a Chariot boss running circles and killing both you and its own allies or Looking Glass, who is able to summon other players to fight against you right in the middle of the fight.-Disbalance. Many people right now complain about certain builds being too overpowered, and in some things I agree with them, but if you don't go pvp often, that is not much of a problem.-Frustration. If you don't like games that make you die over and over, this is not for you. Funny to compare these, but here it is close to games like Super Meat Boy. Matter of taste, anyway, but I had to say it to warn everyone._______________________________________________________________________________________OVERALL: I'll give this game a 8.5/10 A great game, but still it is for a specific sort of gamers."
,Recommended,236430,9947260,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,Libertygeek,"First off at the time of this posting I have less than 4 hours invested in Dark Souls so things could always change but so far I am having a great time with the game.  I have had a ton of fun dying and with each death I arise back at the bonfire with new found knowledge.  Hindsight is 20/20 and each DS2 death provides plenty of insight.   Encounters that were completely owning me over and over again eventually turned into cake walks.  Like Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1, DS2 isn't for someone that isn't prepared to keep trying over and over.   It is not a game that I will play every day because some days I simply do not think I could handle the hardcore punishment that Dark Souls is famous for.There was so much debate prior to the PC release how the game would far compared to the first DS game.  First off do not play Dark Souls for the graphics.  I am not saying that the game is ugly by any means, but graphics take a back seat so if you expect a beautiful game there are a number of times DS2 will fail you.   However my only real complaint so far with DS2 isn't graphics or Gameplay but sound.  While I love the soundtrack I do not enjoy soundtracks while I play, they just take too much out of the immersion to me.  So with the soundtrack off, the ambient sound is well, fairly annoying.  From the very start of the game when my character walks through weeds I cringe at the sound.   But once again DS2 isn't about graphics or sound, it is about gameplay that is punishing but not unfair.I haven't ran into any invasions yet of course I am early in the game.   Story wise, there is plenty of Lore in the background but the game doesn't push it in your face which actually to me is nice because I enjoy the lore but sometimes I just want to kick hollowed butt and the game allows me to enjoy both on my own timeframe.I have been playing on via HDMI to my larger HDTV and with an X360 controller.   I have tried it mouse only but the mouse controls are a bit touchy.All in all most likely you already had the game preordered and have died over and over again or you are waiting for a sale.

Either that or your circles are so highly specialized that nobody in them plays this particular blend of Action-RPG.So, let's get the obvious out of your way. This game is hard. You will die a lot. It's the understudy of every first-party title made for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This game is unforgiving... however it's also very fair with how unforgiving it is.Every enemy is designed to telegraph its moves to a degree. If you learn the enemy, you can defeat it very easily. If you don't learn to read your enemies, you'll be seeing you ""You Died"" banner a lot more than you should. Every death you experience will be your own fault. That's just how the game works.You'll try to slip in one extra attack and get finished off by a enemy twice your mass, carrying a weapon that no human being should be able to so much as lift. You'll dodge-roll off the side of a cliff because you weren't paying attention. You will walk right onto a pressure plate and get perforated with arrows. That's just the highlight reel. There are many, many deaths waiting for you in Dark Souls.But that doesn't make it a bad game. Quite to the contrary really, it makes it agreatgame. Dark Souls is a solid piece of Game Design. Nothing supurfluous has been added, and nothing essential has been removed. Everything can be defeated, in theory, by a level one character if the player is skilled enough. Every attack can be evaded, if you know how to time your dodge. Every attack can be blocked, if you can time your shielding right. Every enemy can be slain, if you have the patience to learn from your excrutiating deaths.Of course... that's just Dark Souls being Dark Souls. You'll also have to get used to the fact that this game is ""Single Player with Benefits."" The Multiplayer features are about half-optional. You can play offline easily. However you'll be losing a lot of information by doing so. If you're playing offline, you won't be able to see messages or bloodstains. Both of them will warn you of danger, and tell you of secrets you might want to poke your head in at.The tradeoff for that information is the ability to be invaded by other players, but invasions are realtively uncommon in my experience. If you're worried about them, join the Apostles of Blue Covenant and wear the ring. That will give you good odds of having a Sentinel of Blue Covenant member ""counter-invade"" your game to help you fight off the other invader.That's all I've got for you guys. Good luck, and Praise the Sun."

I also only covered topics that I thought were important so there might be one you want to know more about that I did not go over.Storyline/Bosses:Most of the bosses are a lot simplier and easier to fight, the storyline is interesting but very easy to beat and slightly less replayability. Feels like there are less bosses than Dark Souls 1 but I think there is actually like 1-2 more that are required for the storyline? I might be wrong but you get the point...PvP:The PvP is a lot more sophisticated. You can no longer hide behind a shield and wait for an opening, recovering health by using items or miracles takes more time than in Dark Souls 1 so people chugging estus are a lot less common, Poise is less effective and rolling has different I-frames (unless you level up ADP to max then you get more I-frames than you would with the grain ring from Dark Souls 1.) (Dark magic still pretty OP)Soundtrack:The soundtrack in my opinion is worse than Dark Souls 1, in Dark Souls 1 it had a really unique taste and was a lot more enjoyable than in Dark Souls 2. Although there are some tracks in Dark Souls 2 that are pretty good most of the music just sounds the same and blends together...Overall I'd give it a 10/10. If you're coming straight from Dark Souls 1 or even Demon Souls it might be a lot harder to get used to and less enjoyable but after a while it'll be a fun experience."

Defeating bosses is rewarding, traversing new areas brings on the challenge of facing new and varied enemies. The game contains numerous weapons, armors, spells, miracles and hexes allowing players freedom and individuality in their approach to character development. Each area is very distinct and some are considerably beautiful. Whereas the quick travel feature had to be earned in the original Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 allows players to quick travel from bonfire to bonfire from the start. This feature adds a degree of ease in an otherwise unforgiving game. The gameplay is responsive and flows well compared to the original Dark Souls. I would suggest playing with a controller, and in moments of considerable frustration there is always the change of summoning other players into your world. From my experience the majority of players who are willing to help are reliable and may even guide you to the secerts and well hidden items throughout the game that may go unfound or unnoticed by casual gamers.I feel this game offers much to be enjoyed and many chances to test yourself."

The dodging system really works with Adaptability and a real sense of accomplishment comes from beating every monster/boss in this game.My game ran fine after the first installation, but I am fairly frustrated that the Saves are not going to a cloud...rather saved on your system instead, but this is a small thing.

Obtuse design is frustrating until you get to a boss that can only be defeated by changing something unhinted at outside of the boss room, summoning other players/NPCs to help you or spamming elemental resist gear, then it's infuriating. The first several hours are painfully slow due to the stamina system and scarce low-level gear, blocking and weapon swinging take up so much stamina that fights with larger enemies drag on for a long time as you block/swing twice then have to back off to let your stamina refill. Controls are often slow to respond, which is deadly in tense situations. Losing all currency on death, and permanently if you die again without reclaiming, forces you to waste time going back and farming earlier areas so you're not underpowered for later areas.I've played plenty of difficult games in my time, brutal and unforgiving, but I prefer something that's genuinely challenging and not simply cruel."

Its mechanical improvements are massive compared to the clunkyness of Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls.Also, while the level design suffers in the Default Game... I can hardly believe the same people made Sunken King and Iron King that made Dark Souls II. If there was any reason to get this game, it would be the DLC.As someone with 250+ hours in both Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls II, I can say this for certain:-If you want a game that will leave you speechless with amazing Story/Lore elements, insane boss design, memorable level design, interesting NPCs and a slightly clunky albeit charming style... Get Dark Souls 1.-For those who don't necessarily care about the story or the lore, and I know there are many... Dark Souls II is the game you want. There are plenty of interesting places to invade and fight in. The combat is much more fluid and is not nearly the backstab-fetish pleaser that Dark Souls 1 PvP is. The game also looks amazing when you use GeDoSaTo.P.S. I love both games a lot. The Souls series is my favorite set of video games ever. All this being said, they are both great games in their own rights. Some may like one more than others and everyone has their own opinion, which is fine. This is mine however. Enjoy!"

Some of the bosses were very imaginative and had a cool way in which you can approach the fights, whereas others were a bit disappointing and a couple were just a rehash from early game. The game is better ported than the first but still isn't great. I would strongly recommend controller as trying to use a keyboard just results in things like ""press {Xbox b} to roll"" even though you specify you are using keyboard and mouse. However, the game feels much smoother to play and controls feel more responsive. I also didn't experience any lag issues throughout the entire game.Now this is going to sound strange but I was actually a little disappointed at the games difficulty. It actually felt a bit too easy. I probably did 1/5 of the bosses first try and around 2/3 within a few tries. In fact there was only one boss that gave me a lot of trouble and I was very happy to beat. Nowhere near the level of Ornstein and Smough. Just something about the boss difficulty was lacking. This game felt more of a woo I beat another boss. Whereas almost all of the bosses in the first game gave me a lot to think about and left me feeling a massive sense of accomplishment after beating them. I only got that for maybe 2 bosses in this game.Having said this I cannot deny that this game is absolutely excellent. Once you get into it you'll get incredibly immersed in the world and you will be playing for hours at a time. That's how you tell it's a great game.Overall, I really enjoyed dark souls 2 and would recommend to buy."

Danger (and opportunity for those willing to risk it) lurks around every corner. with enemies who are frighting just for the power they have. The game is designed so even the lowlliest of enemy can slay anything if players let their guard down.

Sometimes parts of the game may seem impossible and extremely frustrating but once you beat it there is no feeling like it I have yet to find elsewhere in gaming. The game itself from an aesthetic standpoint is beautiful and runs great all the environments are unique and really immerse you in the souls world which is filled to the brim with history and lore. Every skeleton has a story every destroyed castle or abandoned cave has history and you can tell when you walk around. Its really easy to get lost in such a well built world and you will see minutes turn to hours easily. In comparison to the first game DS2 has some pluses as well as some minuses gameplay wise.+'s:-Matchmaking is a lot more smoother-Teleport between bonfires makes traveling about easier.-No more areas like blight town that have crazy grapchis issues-PC is pretty well polished have witnessed very little to 0 bugs(so far)-Even more challenging bosses-Beautiful environments-Even better overworld or home base brings a lot of the NPC's together for you-DLC is really good-'s:-Fastraveling kinda destroys the cohesivness of some environments with each other-Have to travel back to overworld and speak with NPC to level up-Some ""shortcuts"" in DS2 feel sloppily made or not really helpful and there are a lot less due to fast travel(Im looking at you Last Bastille).-Some Enemies and bosses attacks have insane ""homing""/""lock on"" making them really frustrating to fight-with some boss fights difficulty is added with adding more enemies overall(kinda cheating i feel like).Mixed:Some enemies/bosses copy pasted from first game can be cool at times but not at others.Overall the game is great and some of the cons I listed are really nitpicky things to look at if you loves Souls games than this one is a great addition to the bunch and really brings a lot to the table.

Not impressed.Look final note, the game itself is brilliant - the new ""Sin"" version, even more so.  If you don't have it, but that version - but do not buy this version."

,Recommended,236430,10083202,"Posted: 11 May, 2014",all,pH. Lucy,"Dark Souls 2 is the obvious sequel to Dark Souls, and has the same level of depth, but not of difficulty. I cleared DS2 in around 40 hours, and new game plus, in around 24 total. It's as engaging as the first, but lacks the challenge, not to mention the new invasion system, while refreshing, can be grating at times if you're just backtracking for loot you've missed. You can be invaded while hollow, and it takes the same system from Demon Souls in which everytime you die, it erodes your health slightly. This in tandem with the invasions while hollow, during busy times of the day can prove irritating, as you enter an area and immediately get invaded by ""Seph1r0th"", who kills you with Dark Magic, taunts and it leaves you with less hp.For PvPers: Yes, the netcode is still atrocious. And Dark Magic definitely need some tweaks, as two shotting people loses it's novelty if everyone tries to do it.For PvEers: Yes, there is a covenant to make the game harder. It awards you with a ring that lets you punch people.Bosses: The boss battles for this game were interesting, most of the challenging bosses aren't actually necessary to finish the game, and some of the ones necessary to progress just felt repetitive and too easy to complete. Overall, if you liked the difficulty of the bosses in DS1, seek out the additional bosses, you won't be disappointed.Weapons and Builds: Having tried a Strength, Dex and Magic based build, I can say if you want a more difficult DS2 Experience, go with a melee build. If you want an easy ride through to PvP level, then pick magic, as sorcery is hilariously easy.Music: The music in boss battles is once again fantastic, though a little less memorable than the tracks in DS1. Notably, my favourite would have to beVelstadts Theme.It really adds to the atmosphere of the fight.Overall, It's a great game, just outshined by the first. Is it worth £40? That's up for debate. I'd say the original was, but I certainly don't feel robbed for having paid it. Personally, I'd wait for a sale, it's a good game thought it doesn't have the spirit of the original.Overall, I'd give it a 8/10."

I hope you have plenty of free time to spend researching the game. This is not neccesarily a bad thing but you might want to reconsider picking this game up if you have a family or life.Lastly, From Software is re-releasing DS2 as Schoolars of the First SIn with enhanced gameplay and visuals.

,Recommended,236430,10496933,"Posted: 16 June, 2014",all,Walrus-Sama,"Dark Souls 2, should you get it? Well lets have a look shall we.First off, the PC port. Is it Good? Yes, very. High framerate, high resolution textures, good lighting (Please note that it is not a good as what was shown in the early demo footage but it is still good) and wind physics (Wind physics + cloth looks really good by the way) makes it very pretty. Performance is always more important than looks, and the performace Dark Souls 2 is very good indeed (better than I was expecting). My framerate was always high and never dipped below 60 fps. The draw distance is good for the most part but there were a few times were I saw objects pop in late, but I only seem to see this when at the borderline between one area and another. Now controls, the use of Mouse and Keyboard in the menus is better than the Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition but not perfect. It is possible to play this game useing Keyboard and Mouse (Better than Dark Souls 1 anyway). However, I highly recommend you play this game with a controller/gamepad.Now the game itself, is it good? Yes, the game like the other Souls game rewards skilled play and brutally punishes mistakes. If you die (You will die a lot in this game) you will become Hollow, a Zombie like state, were you will lose some of your max health (If you keep dieing your max health will keep going down but it will only go to 50% of your max health when fully hollowed) and you wont be able to summon phantoms to help you. Useing a human effige will make you human again and will restore your max health, but they are a little hard to find, don't waste them. I think this game is easier than Dark Souls 1 but it is still harder than most games. Their are not as many ""hard"" boss's as there was in Dark Souls 1 but some will still make you want to beat your head against the wall...*Cough*Ancient Dragon*Cough*. The game has a lot of content and will probably take you about 30 to 40 hours to complete (Playthrough 1) which is 3 to 4 times the length of most other games and it has a lot of replayablity and many secrets to discover.Its also good to note that the multiplayer elements of the game, such as summoning a Phantom, can make areas and boss's extremely easy. And summons 90% of the time will work, unlike Darks Souls 1, so thats good. On the subject of multiplayer I should probable mention PvP...Its okay but some cheap things like Hexes and getting stunlocked because of the weird way poise works in this can make it seem unfair. You get a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in PvP so you may want to stay away if you are easly enraged, but thats up to you.Their are a few things I should mention but I wont so you get the best experience on your first play through of Dark Souls 2, but here are some tips; Watch out for traps and ambushs, mind your surrondings, fall damage is high compared to Dark Souls 1, its more important to upgrade your weapon than your armor, dodgeing>blocking and try to have both melee and ranged attacks.EditAfter a recent patch the pvp is a bit more balanced and more enjoyable, however still not perfect. Also, after playing some pvp with my new character (Mina) I've picked up a few useful bits of info for pvp and pve. They are as follows (The order of these means nothing) : Sheilds kinda suck, dodgeing is better. Doesnt matter how big and hard hitting your weapon is, it means nothing if you can't hit me. Magic may be OP and good for pve, but again, it means nothing if you cannot hit me in pvp. Can't heal in the arena's anymore (Thank ♥♥♥♥), so Estus chugging scrubs are ♥♥♥♥ed. In duels, its polite to bow first and let them (and you) aplly buffs before the fight, and no healing during a fight. In Invasions however, anything goes. If you are the invader, expect the Host to heal (uselly running away from you to heal while in full Havels armor...), chase that ♥♥♥♥er down and backstab him when he trys this. If you are cruel (like me) you can use the enviroment to your advantage when invadeing, like enemys and traps (Not Gwyndolin). Throwing Knifes are very useful in pvp, cheap (100 souls per 1, can carry 99) and can be used by any build, use them. Always have both a Melee and Ranged weapon equiped, with Melee being your primary weapon. If you uses bows, poision arrows are the best (3-4 arrows to poision, will do about 100+ damage per arrow and the poision will do 1500+ before running out).Anyway, should you buy Dark Souls 2? Yes. It is the weakest of the Soul series. It has a few flaws and may not be as hard as Dark Souls 1 but its head and shoulders above most other games. Well worth your money. Praise the sun!"

76561198136716174,Recommended,236430,10329791,"Posted: 2 June, 2014",all,TwistedAsura,"Dark Souls 2 is interesting to say the least. This is a game I consider a masterpiece in the modern wave of clone games being released. The experience of playing Dark Souls and DS2 is completly unuiqe. Not many games send you into the world with the full expectation of you dying over and over again(As the opening NPCs remind you). Dark Souls does not just kill you because it can though. Dark Souls wants to teach you that blindly rushing into a fight swinging your massive sword blindly is not always the best option. If you want to succeed in the world of Dark Souls you have to be willing to think before you act. View your surroundings and learn what your enemies are weak to. Trying to run up to a boss and out damage them before they kill you like in some action games is simply just not an option here. You have to study the bosses and learn their patterns before you can truly begin to fight.Dark Souls will make you question your self confidence. Even the best of gamers can come into this world and be taken down instantly simply because they would assume the tiny skeleton mob was not going to hit 75% of their maximum health. Two to three hits from most mobs in the game is enough to kill most players on their first or second playthrough. But... With each death comes knowledge. The heavy attack used to kill the small mob in one hit did not work on the katana wielding knight because he could draw his sword before the hit would connect. You return to were the katana wielding knight killed you with this new found knowledge and conquer him. You do not win in Dark Souls because the game throws hints at you every time you turn a corner. You win because you have improved and learned since the last encounter.That brings me to the topic of immersion. Unlike in almost any other game out when you die in Dark Souls you actually DIE in the story. Most games load you to the checkpoint and storyline wise your character never died. In Dark Souls death is part of the story. Dying weakens your body and removes your humanity. You return to the bonfire as a hollow. You feel as if the world did not just stop and go back because you died(Although enemies do respawn upon death).When it comes to playstyles this game has many options. From wielding a tiny dagger to dual wielding Ultra Greatswords(Yep. Bigger than big swords). Each moveset is unuiqe and some weapons in each catagory of weapon have unuiqe attacks. Spells, Hexes(Dark magic), Pyromancies and Miracles(Light magic) are available to those who would rather play from a distance. You are not limited to one or the other though. A player with the right stats could wield a massive hammer in one hand and a staff for spells in the other.Now to compare Dark Souls 2 to its predecessor I can say there are some nice changes as well as frustrating ones. In the previous game you started the game with 5 Estus Flasks(The healing potion given upon resting). This game starts you with one. This forces the player to be MUCH more cautious in the early game while killing because it is very easy to die with only one healing item until you acquire more. Although in return now there are other healing items that can be used when found or bought from merchants.   Players can now teleport from bonfire to bonfire at the very beginning but can only level up at a woman found at the main town's bonfire. The combat in Dark Souls 2 feels more precise than it did in one. The heavier weapons feel like they swing at the speed they should. Instead of spawning an infinite number of times enemies are limitied to ten respawns now. This may sound limiting to the Dark Souls one player but with NG+(Discussed later) it is no problem.Online interactions in Dark Souls 2 are fun and frustrating. A player can be randomly invaded by another player who is a red spirit at almost any given time. On the same note though there are ways for less confident players to ask for help from those willing to. The Sun covenant(Sunbros) and Blue Sentinels are dedicated to helping the weak. Golden and white spirits can be summoned to help clear areas of the game or at most boss fights. Some covenants only wish to protect their own land and will do anything in their power to do so. Killing anyone who might trespass. As to not spoil anything about the covenants further I will leave it at that.Dark Souls 2 has AMAZING replay value. The player can go into NG+(New Game Plus) once beating the game allowing them play the game with increased difficulty and more enemies. The player keeps all gear and most of the items in their inventory. NG+ goes all the way up to NG+7 before stopping the increase in difficulty. That means the game can be played 8 times before fully defeating the hardest mode. Alongside this there is a new item called bonfire ascetic that allows a player to increase one specific areas difficulty to the next NG allowing them to fight the enemies again.On an end note I can say that Dark Souls 2 is an amazing and challenging game that anyone seeking a fun and rewarding time should play. I have never felt more rewarded in a video game than during some of the boss fights and difficult areas in Dark Souls. I give it a rating of 9.8 out of 10. With only minor flaws in things such as game balancing and certain online features. All in all I HIGHLY recommend this game."

,Recommended,236430,11993715,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,Brickfist,"Coming from Dark Souls 1, there's a lot of things you'll notice that are different. Generally speaking, players in Dark Souls II are more spoiled than those who played Dark Souls 1. You are able to travel to any bonfire you've lit anywhere in the world from the very begining of the game and resources are a lot easier to come by. Not only that, but you can also respec your character if you've decided that you screwed something up or just want to try another type of build on the same character. When i first saw all that, I thought ""This game is nothing compared to the first one"". The main things I focused on that were fixed was that you ran the game at 60 FPS (Which is FANTASTIC) and the general fighting mechanics are tweaked to be much better as well as the AI for the enemies for sure got a major tweak.Secondly, Dark Souls 2 is a lot more linear than the first game. In Lordran, you had to explore to find any hope of getting where you wanted to be in some cases.  In Drangleic, most of it is pretty straight forward: Go here, follow the path until you find your way back and then go to another path. Straight. Line.Lastly, the PvP scene has taken quite the hit not in terms of mechanics but more of community base. In 2, PvP has a much broader scene with easier ways to access fights (Thank god that we no longer have to fight GFWL) and there's plenty more people that what you'll find in the first game as well as many more PvP oriented covenants. The downside, however, is the large influx of players who tend to just want to be overall jackasses while participating. Though, that's to be expected with an online game.Regardless of your knowledge of the previous games, the fact stands that this is still an absolutely wonderful game. This game ties VERY closely with the Lore of the first game and even a little bit towards Demon Souls as well.  The level designs don't match up to Dark Souls 1 but are still very nice and the bosses are well designed and fantastic. It has amazing secrets that compell you to constantly explore and branch out but at the same time still offers a sense of difficulty that never leaves you with a moment of boredom. 10/10 fantastic sequel to an already amazing series.TL;DR + More+Better fighting mechanics+Better Online capabilities+Fantastic Designs of weaponry/armor and bosses+Fantastic Lore+A good challenge+Diverse options for character customization and build creation+Never ending excitement-Some mechanics are flawed in PvP-Community is about 50/50 Cancer/Amazing People-Lag is unforgiving if your opponent has a toaster for a modem.PS: DLC's are worth every penny. This isn't an EA ""DLC"" this is an honest to god expansion with Lore, Loot, worlds, bosses, enemies...everything that a DLC really should be."

,Recommended,236430,10177780,"Posted: 20 May, 2014",all,Wvrldsmoji,"So I used to have a slightly lengthy review on Dark Souls II. Having spent much more time with the game and really digging through the lore and each area in the game, I have come to a different conclusion.I used to think of this as a perfect game, but honestly I think I was just riding the hype train this game had surrounding it. I am an avid fan of the Souls series, but quite honestly, this game does not hold up to the standards set by the first Dark Souls. The original Dark Souls had so much amazing content, and it was a completely fresh game to me. I had never played anything like Dark Souls aside from games like Skyrim, which only really hold the same era. Dark Souls is an experience I will never forget.That being said, Dark Souls II isn't as good. It still has fun bosses, good level design, and pretty much infinite replayability (if you like PvP or just enjoy making many different challenging builds to attempt to complete the game with). Dark Souls II honestly just feels like a game that was made to fill the craving Dark Souls 1 left many people. It did an amazing job at it, but it's just that, it only filled a craving, it didn't add anything new.The biggest problem Dark Souls II has is lore. Sure, there is a lot of lore and stories surrounding the game, but at least in Dark Souls 1 it felt like I had more of a purpose to be playing through the game. Not to mention the NPC's in Dark Souls 1 felt like they were actually people in the world, not just vendors like in Dark Souls II. Also, although the level design is great and each area is both fun and challenging, the actual world as a whole doesn't make a lot of sense. The game literally has you ride an elevator from the top of a windmill to a castle surrounded by mountains and lava. That makes no sense. Like, none at all. A lot of this game just feels like randomly strung together areas, none of which are as great as the areas in Dark Souls 1.Basically, if you liked Dark Souls 1 and crave more of the gameplay Dark Souls 1 brought to the table, you will find this game a salve for those cravings. However, if you are looking for new content in the same style, you may be dissapointed.All in all, Dark Souls II is a great game, but it just isn't as good as Dark Souls 1.I give Dark Souls II a 7/10.*Cheesy smile*"

To really enjoy the game you have to invest in it (beside money) time and emotions. Yes, it is very demanding. After that, you're going to be in a bliss state after each-however small it may be-victory.Generally speaking, it's a game about being undead.

That's all I'll share though, for the sake of reading.The gameplay?  Well it's fantastically done in it's mechanics, as per usually done by FromSoftware, and it's unhealthily addicting.

I can easily max out the game, and it runs as smooth as butter, and not a single framedrop (Even while livestreaming which uses more resources).This is the first time I played a Souls game on PC, and I am not dissapointed at all, the delay for the PC version was totally worth it.

I also can't express how happy I am that some features and level design ideas from Demon's Souls make a return. With determination and a constant learning of the layout and enemies you will experience the most rewarding gameplay known to man. From Software have been masters of bleak atmosphere for the last 15 years and Dark Souls 2 continues that tradition. This time around they help you out more at the beginning, but it's still tough from the start just like the Souls games are known for. The PC version also performs very well. Running at 60 fps and with improved textures over the console version it makes for a very satisfying experience. Although I must warn that these games aren't for everyone.

In a area where the tower of a fortress is destroyed, I defeated the boss, and took an elevator UP, into a LAVA LEVEL.Difficulty: I think the new director had to much emphasis on ""Difficulty"", making the player fight large amounts of enemies at once, with movement tracking. Also a lot of the enemies are humanoids.----Even If what I said can be really off putting, It's still a really fun game, that's replayable and has that same sense of accomplishment. The game is not impossible, and it can be really pretty at times. But no game is perfect."

Well, FROM Software is charging full price for having DX11 support as a whole seperate game. No i'm not joking. Quality of Dark Souls 2 aside, i simply cannot support such a move, especially when the results of the DX11 version is so minute. It sets a dangerous precedant for PC gaming if it is supported. Imagine Fallout 4 being sold in DX9 and DX11 versions seperately. How about a DX12 remaster? Its a low move, and there is barely enough added content to warrant its price. On to the actual game, which ISNT BAD.If you liked Dark Souls 1, this is pretty much the same game in a different environment, but this time theres fast travel and the game does have a connected sprawling world. Which is a shame since that made the first one so much more memorable and cohesive as a whole. Gameplay wise i have to say the hitboxes feel a little cheaper this time round, especially with the larger enemies, and the enemy design isnt as inventive.Its just armoured knights in many different variations, it pales in comparison to the variety we saw previously. The story too, ends off similarly, and the journey there, along with the music is nowhere near as emotional.Overall, if you just want more Dark Soul gameplay, its still here, its just uninspired with its weaker lore and atmosphere, and feels like a large DLC that isnt as good as the original."

One of the first articles that was released from the developer stated that they were planning on making the game easier and more accessible to the gaming community. At first I saw this as a reduction in the difficulty of the game but I can personally claim along with many others that this is not the case. It still has the intensity as the first Dark Souls along with Demon Souls but refines mechanics and takes an already well polished game to superb levels. In all honesty, I was concerned about the PC port on the basis of how atrocious the Dark Souls port was. After doing some research from reviewers that got their hands on the game early along with PC gameplay trailers being released, the more confident I became in From Software creating a stable port. As a result, the PC port plays much better than it's console counterparts running at full 60 FPS with no fluctuations and being more optimized for mid build PC's and higher end with full graphics customization that Dark Souls originally lacked. Overall it is a phenomenal port and it is clear that From Software put in the time and dedication to making Dark Souls II accessible on PC and an extremely enjoyable experience. I have been a fan of the Soul's Series since the start of Demon Souls and I highly recommend this game."

Anyone who like action rpgs and wants a bit of a challenge, you will love this game. Its a tough, unforgiving, and incredibly rewarding experience. With that said, this game does have problems. My issues with the game partly come from playing the previous souls games so much (probably over 1,000 hours in Demons and Dark Souls combined).TL; DR version = Game is great but souls vets may be dissapointed by it.Pros:- More variety to weapons and armor allowing for better customization- Leveling is much easier process removing the need to grind for souls- Despawning enemies makes boss runs easier.Cons:- Soul Memory is a poorly inplemented mechanic- Very linear starting areas makes the game feel less engrossing than previous games- Most bosses are very straightforward and somewhat boring making them feel inferior to previous bosses in souls games.- Worky hitboxes added with the agility stat leads to a frustrating situation where you feel like you get hit when you shouldn't have- Level design is a downgrade from Demons and Dark Souls 1.- Story feels convulted and confusing instead of hidden like Demons and Dark Souls 1 stories were and lore feels more like it   was borrowing from Dark Souls instead of creating its own interesting lore or building on the lore created in Dark Souls 1.- Game world not as realized and feels a bit too gamey. Like it was put there because this is a video game and this is what you put in video games.I know it sounds like I ragged on the game a lot here but honestly I love the game and have already put 100 hours into already but there things that bothered me about it as a someone who put a lot of time into the souls games."

Looks nice, plays nice, and it's one of my favorites, but as a new release, it's so bugged it's at some points unplayable in this stage. A couple of glitches and problems with the game to note.1. Glitch: This one is game breaking, and if you don't want to delete the character, since you're around 60% with this glitch, you have to wait for a patch if this happens. At the entrance to Dranleic Castle, theres two Heavy Crossbow Royal Guardsman and each death makes the giants grab and turn the wheels on each side of the door to open it, well 1 or both can actually not recieve the souls, not opening the door, and pretty much ruining the save until a patch fixing it comes out.2. Glitch: Theres a hitbox glitch to where things will hit you when they don't, multiple WEBM's and GIF's will show attacks being a meter away and still getting hit, this can happen often with the Ruin Sentinals and Horseman's Chariot.3. Problem: Poise is almost non-existent and the poise break of a weapon is pretty much false for most weapons. For a Katana the poise break is under 50 (around 20), but two-handing it can stun somebody in heavy armor with massive poise in a single it, so the poise damage is a lot higher than said.4. PvP in general is almost broke, of course I'm proficent in PvP so I don't really have too much trouble dealing with this, but a lot of new PvPer's will be discouraged from these. One is Souls Memory, being all of your allocated souls on that character whether you have them or not. This Soul Memory can make level 100's fight 600's if the 100 PvP's a lot. This can be a problem when high levels take little damage, making them resort to powerful spells, which leads to the next problem. Most PvP is 150+ and with hexas all you need is a hex-buffed Raw Santiers Spear and Great souls residence, both having the capability to 1-shot you in one hit, dodging the magic and parrying the spear is relativly easy since it's usually the newer or not skilled players who use these, but can be really negative for new players wanting to get into PvP. This also leads to low diversity when everyone is a hex/havel or just a hex build.Now for the good parts.Atmosphere: This is especially strong when you are mostly playing single player, the isolation of some areas or knowing how easy it can be to die really makes you want to focus on the game and making it more of an attention-grabbing experience.Combat: The possiblities for builds and massive amounts of ways to disperse of enemies really brings out the creativity of the player or players as they go through the game. Multiple types of weapons and sub-types in those weapons. The game can also put you on wits end making you use things that just clogged your inventory like throwing knives or black firebombs to get passed ranged enemies or break poisoness or acidic pots.All in all a lot of the games flaws that I mentioned were objective and can be fixed when more patches roll in, I tried to be as objective as possible (even if I was a little bias sense I loved DkS 1, even with it's flaws). I recomend picking it up."

Dark Souls 2 doesn't entirely dissapoint, but it does have some problems.-First I will say all that I found good.The PC port was much better than in Dark Souls 1. I didn't think that 1s was too bad, so I whent back to play it today, and it was tough to get back into it for me.It overall looks better, in my opinion. It's much less dreary, even though that was kind of a plus for the first one.The gameplay is much smoother, since the framerate stays near 60 instead of 30. This makes gameplay much more pleasurable.I found I liked the new healing system better than in 1s, I feel like it fits better.All of the fresh new things like new places and weapons/armor are a nice new experience to play through.-Now I'll say some of the things I didn't like...The world doesn't feel as connected as it was in dark souls one, and there arent really many, if any, open areas. Most areas are fairly small, fairly linear, and fairly enclosed. There are still plenty of branching paths, but overall I wouldve appreciated a more connected feel.Some of the patches they have placed were pretty shocking to me, as I had just done my first time doing a faith build in any souls game, and the lightning spears were limited to just a few casts. I can understand why, but it'll take some time to get adjusted.In PVP there is plenty of laggy hits and seemingly unfair fights. I guess thats just to be expected. (also I suck at PVP in the first place, co-op is more my thing)I kind of feel that the characters in this weren't as memorable as in dark souls 1. There were some that I really liked, but I kind of ended up forgetting about a bunch of the bosses, and other npcs along the way.And as evryone else says, soul memory is annoying. Not being able to play with people around my level because either everyone else has (and or had) more or less souls in the total of their characters play time is frustrating, because I feel like i'm really being limited with who I play with (Which mostl seems just Bell Bros and Red summons and Dragon summons).-All in all, I still really like this game. I like what From has done for the most part, and I realise it must of been hard to capture the magic that the first game had. It is still a very enjoyable game, it just might get old after finishing it once or twice, but I hope the dlc will be good, even though it will cost money when I don't have much. I would still reccommend this to anyone who enjoys the souls series,  even with its flaws."

I put over 600 hours into the first Dark Souls between two platforms, and I adored it.  Dark Souls 2 is the sequel everyone wanted; plenty of content, incredibly similar game mechanics, a few minor tweaks to improve the gameplay, and a load of new items and abilities.The multiplayer has been revamped quite a bit.  Summons are more frequent and much easier to fulfill, and invasions are usually successful as well.  Rather than waiting for your invasion to happen, it executes the invasion instantly or tells you there's nowhere to invade.  This means you can usually find an invasion within 1-3 tries, each of which only takes a few seconds.  This is light-years better than the old system, which made you wait a good minute or so before it told you there were no players to invade.The story is similar; it's set deep within the NPCs and only given to you if you search for it.  You could either get the bare minimum and blast through the game, or you could drain every NPC of their dialogue and learn hordes of lore about the land of Drangleic.Overall, beautiful game.  Everything a Dark Souls fan could ask for.  Dark Souls 2 is one of the greatest sequels of all time, making the Dark Souls series one of the best in all of gaming history.

One of the From Software developers mentioned that backstabbing in DSII will not be as easy as it was in the prequel. This is partially true due to backstabs now having a short preceding animation before the actual backstab animation begins, during which the target can move freely to evade it. This can be considered a small hindrance, because the real problem is getting behind an enemy that has his aimbot locked on the player. One should be happy that you can't cheaply kill many monsters just by chaining backstabs anymore, but this creates more problems in a different area. This aimbot mechanics makes dodging very difficult for the player, because no matter where they attempt to roll, as long as they stay within the range of the attack, the monster will keep aiming his strike right at the player until it lands perfectly between their eyes. Having played the game through almost twice as a dual-wielding melee character, some monsters were agile enough to turn 360+ degrees during their attack animations, landing them with microscopic precision. This mechanic no doubt often puts players who rely on dodging into tight spots, frequently resulting in death, which becomes exactly the reason why an overwhelming number of players use shields. Despite the now seemingly obsolete dodging at the start of the game, players who have the nerve and tenacity to press on utilizing a no-shield combat style will soon find out that higher Adaptability (ADP) stat values will increase the invincibility frame time during dodges. High enough ADP will enable the player to avoid almost any attack in the game, provided the timing is correct. A certain number of ADP points becomes the breaking point, past which dodging becomes an extremely efficient method of avoiding attacks and landing counters. Frequently, players who survived the no-shield ordeal at the start of the game will find themselves rolling into monster's and boss' attacks to allow themselves to use those extra few moments they would spend running back to the target if they dodged away to land an additional attack. Unfortunately, having mastered this, single enemy encounters become the square root of the perceived difficulty (bosses too), arguably even easier than if the player used a shield. It is sad to note that the real challenge in this game comes from having to battle multiple monsters at once and the game does like to place the player into such situations frequently. No matter how good the player is at dodging, the brain of an average human prevents us from tracking movements of 2+ separate entities and reacting correctly. The question has to be asked: Is this the right type of difficulty to implement in a Souls game? Arguably, no. The difficulty of previous Souls games was of the other kind. The one which put the player into one-on-one encounters with a tough enemy. The player could succeed in killing said enemy, relying on perfect timing and/or tactics, without the need to push against the wall that is the brain. On the other hand, this is the essence of Dark Souls II, aimbot + the enemies that are difficult in the wrong way.Nevertheless, is this an enjoyable game? Yes... but with a difficulty that is truly enjoyed by the most tenacious of people."

A unique experience that lets you customize and upgrade   your character in various ways, while constantly providing new  harder creatures and bosses all more scary and impressive than the previous ones.  I see only a few negative points about this game, the most obvious would be the online system, which in my opinion is not a solid multiplayer experience.

The more you die, the more you get hollowed, to the point where you only have half of your health. To get back the other half of your health you will need a human effigy, which isn't a common item at all.The game is definitely better on PC, especially for the 60 FPS and faster loading screens over the 30 FPS lock and 20-30 second loading screens that the consoles offer. The game is playable with mouse and keyboard, but I still recommend getting a controller to play this game.The gameplay is great, the fighting system is really fun. You have a HUGE choice of weapons, and you fight against many different types of enemies, and most bossfights are pretty fun, except for the ones that are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (won't mention them because spoilers). You can also fight against people online, which I think, is one of the greatest selling points of this game, the PvP.Speaking of the greatest selling points, I think the lore is very interesting as well. Each item has a description which tells a story, even though unlike the first game there is some missing lore. But as time passes, people make up theories about the lore which are very interesting as well (make sure to end the game before watching any lore videos though).In conclusion, I really can't say which game is better: Dark Souls I or Dark Souls II. Both games are worth playing, no matter how much you rage, or how much controllers you throw to your monitor, these two games are probably the best RPGs i've played (maybe its because I dont play RPGs much but oh well). If you're new to the Souls series, I highly recommend Dark Souls I first. Still, a great game."

I followed the franchise for a long while and I never hated a single game. I've played and replayed the game a lot of time, went to multiple New games and all that. Only thing is, on my playthrough for NG+3 I decided I'd kill Licia for the rotunda lockstone right after doing the dragonrider. So I do that and I fail miserably, thus respawning to the bonfire next to her. I then proceed to try to kill her multiple time until the game makes Licia despawn. I then proceed to majula, still as sure I want to kill her a ever. Only to see she didn't make it back and is NOWHERE to be found. As this is a NG 3, I decide to spawn it using cheat engine, this way I can keep progressing. Little did I know about this softban feature.. I keep playing regularly with no problem.. Until that one day where I notice there is NO signs on the Iron keep bridge.. I put my sign regardless, not too scared by it as I am still unaware of the softbans. I end up getting summoned by an hacker using firebombs that throws dozens of spells at once and die. I then add the guy to say ""Well that was awesome, but I've never seen an hacker that obvious in the past."" and he replies ""That's because you were softbanned."" And he then explains me the whole thing. I go to FROM's website just to see it is completely in japanese. I then go to the provided email to ask why I was softbanned and explain the situation. The support pretty much tells me ""Well, ♥♥♥♥ you, you'll have to stay softbanned because we have no power on that, we just tell people they were softbanned and this is FROM's work to take the softbans off."" In the end, my experience of Dark souls 2 was excellent but this is something I can't accept as an ingame feature, especially when the game is so focused on multiplayer experience.Pros:-Fun experience-Lot of replayability-Accessible for new players-Fair controls-Better port than Dks1Cons:-Rather dissapointing story-Too easy for a fan-Bosses pretty much ripped off from Dark souls 1-Intense fall damageAs I said, I would've gave this a positive review if it wasn't for the soft ban feature."

Где то геморное передвижение до добытия какого-то предмета? Игра действительно вышла на славу. Мне даже показалось, что она интереснее и сложнее первой части. Персонажи красивые и колоритные, и теперь если они умерли, их можно оживить за души. Но стоит вам уйти и вернуться - всё, плати заново. Ловушки. Их стало очень много. Теперь всё туманно и загадочно, тут надо постоянно предполагать. Да и теперь реиграбельность играет большую роль. Теперь если пройти игру и убить кого-то, может  выпасть что-то интересное, можно будет что-то новое скрафтить. В первой же части, реиграбельность зависела только от меча Гвина и огромного копья молнии, если я не ошибаюсь, и старых предметов. Саундтрек потрясающий. Боссы, конечно, не настолько завораживают, как в первой части, опять же. Красивые локации освещённые солнцем, тёмные локации освещённые луной, всё это очень красиво, нет сомнения. Ковенанты теперь также имеют свою определённую цель. Большинство, может быть. Новая система добычи оружия боссов неплохая. Однако система Level Up довольно... геморная, что ли. Тащиться в Маджулу после каждого босса - маразм. Новая система ко-опа и PvP куда лучше старой, поиск довольно быстрый. Призыв тоже почти всегда быстрый. Однако местные ганкеры и противники в роли хозяина мира более наглые. Это, знаете ли, оскорбляет чувства вторженцев. Этикет в первой же части, не нарушался чаще всего.Честно сказать, сначала я недолюбливал эту игру. Человеку привыкшему к первой части, прошедшему её 3 раза, будет очень сложно привыкнуть к этой завораживающей игре.9.95/10."

I guess I was too busy playing the game to do one. :)The story line is lackluster when compared to the original. Without trying to give away too much of a spoiler the story line focuses on the fact the universe/civilization of Dark Souls is stuck on an infinite repeat of destroying and rebuilding itself. Because of this you really don't feel like you're getting anything new. But if we assume this is going to be a three part series then this would make a logical step for the second DS game. There still is a story line to be enjoyed, however, and I found it to be fun. The whole deal between the King and the Queen is awesome. And I believe the DLC will make up for any of the story line failings.Just like the first Dark Souls the gameplay is very addictive. I found the gameplay to be even better in the sequel. Everything just feels so much better. Covenants are more useful and PVP is just as good as before, if not better. My only complaint about DS2 is that it was easier than DS1, but that might only be because I already had 200 hours of practice on DS1. Either way I hear the DLC will fix this as well.May the Dark Shine your way."

76561198003481636,Not Recommended,236430,10054251,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,Lord Magus,"This review pains me a bit as I'm a long time fan of the Souls games, specifically Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1.Overall, I'll start with the fact that the game is visually quite appealing. The video quality is considerably greater than the console versions. You can tell a lot of care went into this aspect. The place where the game really started unravel for me was in the very basic mechanics of the game. From the literally hundreds of hours that I've spent playing the first two, it's easy to say that the timing of attacks, dodges, blocks, and the like, has become hard wired as muscle memory. Painfully, the combat system, despite being praised as ""new and improved,"" is actually worse in my opinion. The timing on your attacks, blocks, rolls, etc, has all been slowed down. There is an ""adpatability"" stat that you can put points into that improves your characters action speed, like when using healing items, but the benefits do not seem very noticable. Tracking with your weapons, especially thrusting weapons, is noticably bad. The enemies, however, seem to have all been given a boost to accuracy and potency. Staggering enemies is unlikely, but your character seems to stagger and be interrupted by even the slightest hit. Combine the obvious nerf to every move made by the character and the buff to enemy attacks, and you get a new combat system that's more annoying than challenging.When I mentioned thrusting weapon tracking specifically, I'm referring to the accuracy that your attacks have with such weapons and whether or not they'll even hit the target you're locked on to. This is not a case of the enemy dodging, just simply hitting your target. Enemies now also seem to rarely run out of stamina or stagger when they hit your shield, (and this is even with higher stability shields). Combined with the tendency of your character to quickly become winded after two or three strikes, and combat has become stilted and awkward, even with mundane enemies.Another obvious change is the kick attack from the previous titles. Instead of quick attack that gives the player the chance to disrupt an enemy blocking, we're given a very slow shield bash that requires a painfully slow wind up. Again, this seems to serve no purpose other than crudely attempting to increase difficulty. Also note that this shield break attack is now less likely to truly disrupt or stagger an opponent.To keep this review reasonable in length, I'll just summarize by saying that many small changes have been made to the combat system, 99% of which are unnecessary. It goes back to the common sense approach of: If it isn't broken, don't fix it.Perhaps these changes will not bother some, but I found them to be a constant nuisance. I'm not on the expert playing level with the other Souls games, but I'd like to think I've gotten a basic mastery of the combat system, enough to really enjoy those games.So in conclusion, if you're completely new to this series, you're not going to notice these changes. If you're a seasoned Souls veteran and still on the fence about whether or not to pick this one up, I'd have to say pass. I obviously can't speak for everyone, but given the choice, I'd rather go back and play Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls. And despite being an overall decent title, I can't truly recommend it."

Don't get frustrated if it's too hard at first, and don't move forward too fast. Give the game some time at the first couple levels and teach yourself how to in example: defend, parry, target-lock, roll-to-dodge etc. and the game will be way easier. You need to learn a lot of movesets from the enemies & your own weapons. (This game offers so impossibly many weapons by the way)So, if you have a 32-bit OS I suggest buying the DSII Bundle with all the DLC's. The DLC's aren't too long but they can be really challenging for the first 2-3 times you beat the game.Without further explaining (I seriously could write everything here), check the Dark Souls 2 Wiki's, check some Dark Souls 2 Youtube videos and try to understand the game, it will be SO much fun, I promise! (Unless you lose your nerves easily and can't stand dying in a game a lot at first, of course. You gotta control yourself, don't let yourself go in a rampage as that'll lower your gaming quality a lot and you'll just die more and get even more frustrated.

Gameplay is buttery smooth and despite the last minute lighting changes announced by fromsoft it looks rather nice, although it could be better.Not quite as difficult as DS1 imo as it's easier to gain souls to level up and bonfire warping can be done from the beginning, the world is less interconnected as well, but i'm just nitpicking here as all 3 souls games are near flawless when it comes to pure enjoyment and style.Thanks to no GFWL  summoning and pvp is plentiful and fun, lovely.Story isn't as good though, the lore is poor in comparison to DS1 hence why they needed to alter it for Scholar of the First Sin.The game is top tier though overall.420praiseitsunlightmaggot"

,Recommended,236430,10425632,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,Jinhitsu,"UPDATED: Dark Souls II is fairly enteraining, yet surprisingly easy. If you've never played a Souls game before, I strongly suggest starting with this one. This Souls game was much easier to grasp then its predecessors, Dark Souls and Demon's Souls. It's combat mechanics are much more fluent, which makes up for it's lack of creative enemies. If you enjoy fight 27 giant people with even bigger swords/maces/or axes, I hope you enjoy this games lack-luster bosses.The Combat areas, especially for the four primals feel ultimately different from one and other. Every area has a new mob enemy to try and kill and gain knowledge on, but they also seem a lot less punishing, unless your facing 7 or 10 of them. From invisble warriors to possessed spider people. You get a very different feel for each area.The very thing that caught the eye in this game was the vast, creative weapions in this game. Exploding hammers, light bending Sabrecat teeth, and even a fist that allows it's wearer to become possessed with the spirit of Ryu/Heihachi. It wioll take you a while to get bored of the vast weaponry supplied to you.Overall, it has a very monotonous boss system, and the story is lacking; however, I still give this game a thumbs up, because of the large amount of fun gameplay it gives to the player. If you ever think, ""Why does the boss get that move but I don't?"" You will enjoy this game. You will almost never ask yourself this question."

The reason for that is that this game is a serious time vampire! When you first start you just can't have enough!The leveling system is pretty freaking awesome you use ""souls"" as ""money"" so when you kill an enemy/another playerYou get their soul/'s ! Now this will proberly lead to a lot of farming but its better then dying over and over again! ""Trust me, it really is xD""Now i will talk about the coop.Yes this game does indeed have coop. A LOT of coop. You can use summon signs to summon other players into your world so they can help you progress in your save, this is a very nice feature since a bunch of people seem to get stuck all the time!So if you are stuck just summon someone!Now to the PVP aspect of the game.Now this is where the real challenge starts!Throughout the game you might become a thing called ""Invaded"" That means another player just entered your world.. To kill you for your souls.Now this is where you will need to use your skills in battle... Against a human opponent. Now this is WAY tougher then the normal AI enemies you fight ""Well most of the time it is!""  Now if this target kills you in your world he will get all your souls and you will go Hollow, But! If you kill the invader you get all his souls and victory! When you're hollow you can't summon other people but you can still get summoned. So how do you turn human again? Use Human effigies. Everytime you die in this game you will go hollow and it also takes bits and bits off your health bar so just be carefull when playing!Story wise?Oh there is a lot of Lore in this game! Some of it very interesting too! But most of the time you will probably not notice it, that's at least what happens to a lot of people when they play the game :)Weapons?Oh there is A LOT of weapons in Dark Souls!You just fought a boss? Well why don't you just go ahed and make the weapon the boss had with your new boss soul?The weapons spread for a range of - Spears - Swords - Crossbows - Bows And much more!That was my review of Dark Souls 2The game is overall just great i recommend every RPG fan to get this game is so worth the money!Also this game is easier then the first game just letting you know, so don't be scared of it being too Hard!Have a good day and i will see you in my next review!"

Frustrating is not the word but frustration is not always a bad thing in gaming but to purposefully put so much effort into producing a game to be so infuriating it becomes a flaw and in this case i think it is a bad business plan.No doubt there are going to be people saying 'it made quite a bit of money therefore it is obviously excellent' but games like this are never going to escape the niche that they are in and become something more."

,Recommended,236430,10461296,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,Royial20 [TURBO],"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mvI0NuTyBgDark Souls II: In the same vain as its predecessor, Dark Souls II is a much more improved and accessible title without sacrificing much of its core elements. The game is still challenging, obscure, intriguing and even a bit frustrating. Though some of the level design isn’t as interconnected as the previous Dark Souls the game still has great level design and each area will feel quite different from the previous and will always be new and refreshing with new enemies to face in each area. The PC port from the consoles is much better than the first game; however, it still is not recommended that you play with a mouse and keyboard. The game itself doesn’t even recognize the difference between a controller interface and the mouse and keyboard, all of the in-game prompts and the tutorial only show controller inputs and will never show keyboard and mouse inputs. The default key bindings also don’t feel intuitive or normal, for example when hitting the ESC key in most games will back out of a menu or bring one up, not in Dark Souls II though. Aside from that, there are more graphical options than the previous title; more resolutions to choose from are a welcomed addition. In terms of graphics, the game does not look as impressive as was previously shown before its release. Lighting in general is fairly flat as well as character shadows and shadows in general; water looks particularly bad and characters are quite stoic to the point they don’t even move their mouths when talking. However, the levels, enemies, armor, weapons, spells, bosses are all great looking and in general feel like the only solid improvement in terms of graphics. The sound and music in the game is also worth noting, it all sounds great, and music is pretty awesome although fairly low key and quite, much of this game’s music is quite aside from using items and spells and combat. Combat also feels good, it won’t take as long to get use too the timing of your weapons since there is much more fluidity and makes combat a bit more interesting from the previous installment. The game also seems to want to ease players into its world, you’ll get large areas of weaker enemies, dotted with some stronger ones before facing your first boss and a few of the first boss fights are fairly straight forward and can be easily taken on.Overall the game is a huge improvement from Dark Souls. Things aren’t as obscure to figure out, magic is more readily available and more common to find, combat is fluid and fast, PVP is no longer something only advanced Dark Souls players can enjoy and changing the game to be more co-op friendly is greatly appreciated although the latency issues during PVP can and will be frustrating. The graphics are improved but not by a lot, lighting and shadows don’t seem as good as dark souls two and the game does not look as good as previously shown. The PC port also is improved but not by much, the game will not recognize mouse and keyboard use and will always only show controller inputs during prompts and some other weird and frustrating choices make it almost key that you play this game with a controller only. However, at the end of the day I feel that Dark Souls II is a great sequel and a better entry for new comers to jump into first. If you owned the previous Dark Souls you’ll find more of the same awesome here and if you haven’t tried Dark Souls but are interested in doing so, try Dark Souls II first.-Thumbs Up from Royial"

I jumped for it. I was used to pressing B after sprinting to jump in Dark Souls 1. Not in this game. First out of many deaths.After beating the game alot of times i finally feel like i have mastered the game. Started off with some pvp recently. Going for a light armor and dual uchigatanas. Doing great. After a while i meet like 20 gankers, 10 hackers, 45 full havel armor. This all in about 10 minutes.I recently got the dlc's and decided to play them hoping to get something new out of the game as i had finished it a few times now. When i first started the dlc's i got invaded by the same guy three times in a row, killed him though, but still, havel's are great. When i finally got to the point where i started fighting the mobs. I died. Over and over again.I spawned, killed a few, fell down/got shot. Repeat.10/9, loving the ganking hackers in pvp and the stupid summon system."

,Not Recommended,236430,13800142,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Anime is KILLING America.,"If you've never played Demon's or Dark Souls then I would say everything below this is irrelevant. Even for those of you who have, the game is still good, especially by the standards we as consumers allow to be set so low for games and their developers nowadays... However for fans of the series who appreciated it on a deeper level than just ""It's fun"" or ""It's hard, but I enjoy a challenge,"" you may want to read what I have to say, below.All in all Dark Souls II is a mediocre and ultimately disappointing successor to Dark Souls, no more; no less.I could go into detail about all of the poor design decisions, the lies and disgusting business practices of FromSoft as well as Bandai Namco, but frankly I don't consider it worth my time.Before a PC version of this game was available I purchased the collector's edition for Xbox 360.Within weeks I had put hundreds of hours into the game, completed a handful or two of playthroughs, attempted about 3 dozen times to beat the game without dying or resting at a bonfire in the same playthrough, while still killing all the enemies in my path and PvPed more than I probably did any of those previous things.Within that same time I beat my first playthrough and felt cheated. Every playthrough afterwards during that left me with the same feeling, as well. It's very common for Developers to exaggerate their games. especially lately, but it's still a bad thing. Maybe had the game not had different directors, had smarter design decisions and help up with all of it's promises, it would be the masterpiece it could have been.However, that's far from the case and I walk away from the game feeling that it is by far the worst installment in an otherwise phenomenal series.By the bar some other popular games set, I would say this is a fantastic game and damn near a masterpiece, comparatively.By the bar me and my expectations for this game as a sequel set, I would say simply out of my overwhelming love for the series that this game is a stain on the franchise.If Dark Souls is a 9/10, which is about what I consider it, then Dark Souls II would be about a 4/10, in my opinion."

The lore is intriguing and adds some new story elements to the universe, but it fails to add much relevance to the main plot and just explains a seemingly unnecessary sidestory.

,Recommended,236430,10433028,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,Erik,"Has a hard learning curve and can be daunting for a new player (certainly was for me). The game does not take your hand and walk you through it, it expects you to find the solutions quickly or the hard way. With that said this is perhaps the most fun game I've played in the last year or two. When I intially started playing I thought the game was crap, I hated on it because I sucked at it and I simply couldn't understand why people thought that it was remotely good. I ended up quiting. For some reason, the day after I felt like playing it again and while I still sucked I got better and better to the point where I finally found and defeated the ""First"" boss (the game allows you to go to 3 different places right after the ""tutorial"" area, the boss I'm refering to is the first boss in the sense that the area he is in, is the area you should start in, difficulty-wise). After beating the first boss the game became really, really fun and addictive. Needless to say, I've completed the game on normal mode and I really enjoyed it. Here are my tips for any new players. Firstly, play with a controller. Having a controller makes this game sooooooo much easier than playing with M&K. If you absoultly MUST play with M&K, download the mod from nexusmods which changes the prompts from xbox controller prompts to keyboard prompts. Secondly, exhaust dialogue with every NPC you can. NPCs give items, ""quests"" and valubale info if you talk enough with them. Thirdly, learn how stats work and BLOCK, BLOCK, BLOCK! I can't tell you how underrated blocking was for my intital first bit of playing. Blocking is a god-send and makes the game easier by far.If the difficulty seems off-putting don't worry, I suck at games like this but I still enjoyed it and beat the game. With the ability to summon other players to help on bosses, beating the game can become a good deal easier. Also this site is your best friend for any help:http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Souls+2+WikiThe mod I was refering to is:http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/30/?Also, if graphics are a concern, consider downloading GeDoSaTo to downsample, this really makes the game look sooo much prettier.http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=gedosato"

,Recommended,236430,10628682,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Knightcrim,"Let me start off by saying this is a fantastic game. I absolutely loved Demons Souls and Dark Souls, but this one to me shot both out of the water. That being said, it's not without it's flaws, so let me get those out of the way first.Much like the first one, this game suffers from bad PC controls. While it's not as bad as the first one, I'm beginning to think this style of game simply works better with a controller. If you have no issue with sloppy keyboard controls or just plugging in a controller, buy away.Frankly, I was rather disappointed by the lack of lighting system that was shown in their tech demo, but there are plenty of other, more proffessional reviewers out there who have beaten this topic into the ground, so go decide for yourself.The game is a bit more linear than Dark Souls and Demons Souls. I personally don't have an issue with this, and feel that it has created an very fleshed out game, I'm sure some other Souls fans might have an issue with it.That's really all of the complaints I have about this game. The PC port is incredible by comparison with it's predecessor, and while I've heard complaints, I think the game looks incredible. The areas are fantastic, and the bosses are a delight as usual. The controls on a controller feel tighter than they ever did in Dark Souls or Demons Souls. The beginning of the game definitely feels like it's easier on beginners, which I think is a fair enough design choice.As I've stated up above, this game is fantastic. There are some cons, but in my opinion, they're far outweighed by all the incredible things this game has to offer.9.5/10"

Here's the thing though, the challenge is extremely indicative of how hard I used to find video games. I remember getting stuck and dieing dozens of time trying to get a star in Super Mario 64. I got older, and games became less difficult. Dark Souls seems to scale up and provides that same challenge I used to love in video games.Yes, you will die. A lot. You will be a zombie, and you will get invaded, but this is hands-down the most rewarding game I've played. There's a legitimate sense of discovery of ""well I'm not sure what to do, but I think I can go here now. Let's find out.""Quick note about the combat, if you like the Monster Hunter series' combat, Dark Souls is very similar. Fast paced and dodge-centered (unless you just build straight tank).Overall, Dark Souls 2 is a complete RPG experience, filled with a sense of discovery and pioneering your own character and class.

I give Dark Souls 2 a solid 7/10. Furthermore, I would recomend it to someone that has not even touched the previous Souls games.I intently relished playing Dark Souls 1 and I enjoyed every minute of it. This marks the eighth time I have tried to get into Dark Souls 2. I just can not seem to be able to break through the ""wall"" like I could with Dark Souls 1. In my reasoning I will be comparing this game to its forebearer, Dark Souls 1, because first, Dark Souls 2 is a sequal and second, sequals should be judged by how much they improve upon the franchise.My first concern about this game, in light of its predecesors, is the controls. Dark Souls 1 had tight and responsive feeling controls. While hard to get used to, I never actually fought the controlls. I would say that over 90% of my deaths in Dark Souls 2 were not due to actual combat, but simply fighting the regretably uncontrolable camera. The last time I played a game where the camera was this bad, it had a ""64"" somewhere in the title. I am not joking here....its unfortunate......highly unfortunate. Whereas the first game was responive, this one feels like your character is walking on ball bearings. I see what they were trying to do. They wanted to give the player a sense of momentum and force, which is admirable but ultimatly a flawed idea. It just clutters up combat and the feel of the gameplay.My second concern is the design. Dark Souls 1 felt like it had more in common with an older RPG; in that there was no fast travel and if you could see it, you could go there. In Dark Souls 2 the developers sacrificed the first formula for a limited version of a fast-travel mechanic. It causes the world to have a less cohesive feeling and it stutters the gameplay. Next, the story and bosses are just a lazy redo of Dark Souls 1. Yes, the developers wanted to focus on another aspect of the Dark Souls universe, but there is no new material addressed. In Dark Souls 1, it felt like you already missed the party a long time ago, but are just expected to act like an insignificant janitor cleaning up the mess. I Dark Souls 2 it makes it clear that you are the party and all the boss monsters are invited to be shredded by yours truly. Finally, the pace of battle has been changed. This is primarily why I wouldn't recomend it to another Dark Souls player. If you have mastered the timing and rythm of combat in of Dark Souls 1; you will be lost in Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 1 had fast-paced, well-timed combat that a begining player could begin to pick up on rather quickly. Dark Souls 2's change of pace to a slower tempo is crippling. Everything just feels sluggish and slower which leads me to my last concern.The game runs like a beached whale. I am serious. Dark Souls 1 had its moments where my pc would begin to experince poor frame-rate such as the notorious Blighttown area. To be fair, I was playing on a laptop and I expected that. Now I have a top-of-the-line desktop tower built to take anything that I can throw at it. Dark Souls 2 consistently has cripplingly poor framerate issues. It honerstly feels like its processing an advanced lighting engine that is not there. Dark Souls 1 actually had better graphics and lighting that this game. It feels like perfomance was traded for some beautiful skyboxes and an excluded lighting mechanic. This game feels as though there are huge pieces that, for whatever reason, were just not included.In short, If this was just more of Dark Souls 1, I would be aboard for the whole ride. This simply is neither an improvmet on nor just more Dark Souls 1. This actually feels like a step back from the perspective of a souls player.  Dark Souls 1 was a well-rouned, well stitched together, and tight felling game. Dark Souls 2 on the other hand, simply feels like it is blatently unfinished and I regret its controlls, design choices, and performance. This game had such potential and every once and awhile you can feel something better trying to happen within it. If this had been its own stand-alone game, not of the Dark Souls franchise, I would probably think better of it. On its own, its not a bad game by any means, but it has much to live up to and it does not come close to delivering."

76561198019773388,Not Recommended,236430,13908812,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,No. 8,"I bought Dark Souls 2 due to its consistently positive ratings although I am not a big fan of the Hack and Slash genre. Having played the game for over 75 hours now (Steam does not count the hours played in offline mode) I wonder if I downloaded some corrupt version where all the good parts are missing. For me this is one of the worst games I have played in a long time and definitely the most overrated one.The main reason for that is the story of the game: it just does not have any. You are thrown into a world you nearly learn nothing about. You are just told that you have to collect souls because... hmm... yeah, I think because you are undead and that is what undead creatures do.So you start running from one ""level"" to the next, each ending in a boss fight. Some of these fights are cool, most of them are just annoying. And again you learn nothing about the bosses. They are simply there but why you have to fight them or how they ended as what they are stays a mystery. Maybe if the bosses were able to talk it would have been different but all of them are doomed to be silent.But not only the story lacks proper explanations, the game mechanics itself also do. Fortunately everything can be looked up on the internet but would it have been such a problem to explain the letters determining the weapon damage scaling with your character attributes ingame (as one example)?Then there are the controls: I for my part would say that it is impossible to play the game with a keyboard and a mouse in a satisfying way. You cannot even bind any actions to other mouse buttons than LMB, RMB and the wheel.I played with a XBOX 360 controller which worked fine but if I buy a PC game why do I need such a workaround?But there is also one real nice thing about the game: the coop or multiplayer part. Being able to summon other players for boss fights or help others by leaving a summon sign is a great feature. The option to enter covenants to fight 1 vs 1 is cool too.Sadly this is also a double-edged thing: as long as you are logged in to the gameservers you can get invaded by other players mostly anytime. Especially in areas which are linked to a covenant it is guaranteed that you will not only have to fight mobs but also real people. And they are just waiting to f**k up an innocent trespasser, wielding weapons which are buffed with unblockable elemental damage beyond measure. The worst part are the lags resulting in enemies being at other positions you see them, ultimately resulting in them backstabbing you although they were just 20 steps in front of you.If you want to avoid this, you have to switch Steam to the offline mode but this means you cannot unlock any achievements or summon/ be summoned.Maybe you could ignore all of this if the fights against mobs and bosses were enjoyable but in my opinion they are not. In most situations it is hit and roll or hit and run (or if the enemy proves to be too strong just run). You cannot fight ""stylish"" or C-C-C-Combo Break the enemy, usually it is just attack twice and roll out of reach...So all in all I do not regret to say that the game is not worth its money and the time spent playing it."

Overall, I would highly recommend this if you loved the first two Souls games, or if you want to jump into the series for the first time because Dark Souls 2 does an excellent job of letting the player know about mechanics before the real game starts."

I love the lore and story for this one and also love the DLC. Couldn't have done a better job if you ask me! They improved a lot on the fighting mechanics and graphics since Demon Souls! Each boss fight is a new experience and although it isn't a boss fight where you need to hit them in a certain spot to kill them, it still takes skill and strategy to defeat your foes! Ech and every area is a new adventure and im constantly falling for the cleverly placed traps by the developers. Im sure Bloodbourne will be as good, if not better, than Dark Souls 2. As soon as i heard that a new Dark Souls game was in production, the hype became real, i bought Dark Souls on PC for the sole purpose of beating it 100 times in preperation for what lie ahead in the sequel! With over 100 hours (and most likely more to come) i strongly reccomend, no, URGE anyone with 40 dollars or more of spending money, to please get this game, you will thank me when you beat it and you have all the satisfaction in the world! It's an amazing adventure, and for some reason, i can't help but re-live the experience over and over again!"

The visuals are very average (I guess that's why they have the DX11 version) and the game would crash from time to time. Honestly, these are minor issues. The gameplay alone makes this game a 9/10.

More weapons, more armors, more locations, and many more ways to die. Plus it actually runs on PC this time! No need for DSfix or any other mods just to play it. (Though I did encounter a slight mouse delay after rebinding my keys, so I had to download a hotkey scripting program to fix it but other then that it works beautifully). Oh yes and how could I not mention that the game runs on a server now. Thats right no more getting 30 failed summons in a row or waiting 30 minutes in game for you to register better with other players.This is by far my favorite entery in the Souls series. Is it harder then Dark Souls? No. Is it easier? No. Is getting invaded as a hollow a hell of a lot better cause if you die you don't lose your humanity? Hell Yeah it is.Course the number one thing to remember if your a new comer to Dark Souls is: This is a game about learning from your mistakes. Understanding the world, figuring out how to defeat bosses or large groups of enemies. It's all in the game, but it's up to you to figure it out. So don't expect any hand holding or arrows pointing you where to go next.So here's a few things to remember.1: Talk to everyone multiple times in a row. Alot of npc's give items or information as new area open.2: Read item discriptions. Lots of items fill in the blanks to the story as well as build on the lore of the game.3. Don't be afraid to try everything in mulitple ways. For instant, effigies can be both used as a item and burned at bonfires      for different effects.4: Explore, Explore, Explore. Sometimes good things lay off the beaten path5: Be prepare to be frustrated. There are moments when you will hate the living daylights out of Dark Souls, whether it's by a large group of enemies.... or a small group of enemies.... or one enemy.... I really hate those mages in the Shrine of Amana.6: Play the game without any guides or wiki's. Having beaten DS1 with a guide and beating DS2 without one, I can clearly say you get a much better feeling of accomplishment without the use of a guide and the world feels so much more majestic when you don't know what area you'll be coming upon next.7: PREPARE TO DIE"

I will say I think I liked the first Dark Souls game better than the second one, but only for the story, everything else I liked better in 2. The fact you can farm out areas is really helpful when trying to make it to a new boss and you can respawn these areas with an item as well so its not like you can farm the game and never farm again.  It took me like 50 hours to beat this game one time, which earned me about 52 percent complete according to Steam, and I plan on putting in many more hours before I go to NG+. If you have played the first Dark Souls then you already know what to expect from this game, there are plenty of differences that I wont go into but if your new to the series prepare to die a lot more, more than likely, than a veteran of the series.  The boss designs are pretty nice, but the boss weapons really didn't appeal to me that much.  You have to trade them to a certain NPC, which after my first encounter with him I could never find him again so I just used them for souls, but when I looked at the items I was not very impressed.  I prefer the crafting of soul weapons that the first game had, but I digress.

Once you get used to dying hundreads of times, the game grows on you.Here's some advice, decide early on if you're going to play offline or online completely. Online comes with co-op, but comes with the dreaded  invasions, from other players, trying to murder you for all your souls. If you fancy yourself an invader, by all means, do so though. If you're going to play online, make use of co-op as much as possible to get a feeling of an area before you actually go through it.You also may want some background information on gameplay mechanics and such.  Try the Dark Souls II wiki for that.I wish this game had more of a social aspect to it though.  I've met many people through co-op, but rarely in Dark Souls II do you get a chance to communicate with those you work with. The game really needs some party text communication and a friend's list.Other than that it's a really good game. It keeps you at your feet.

Those people are wrong. It still maintains the essence of being a hard-as-balls game. However, the difficulty lies in a different corner this time around. Whereas Dark Souls originally challenged players by punishing for messing up, Dark Souls 2 (from here DaS2) has a lot of points where it kills you just for the sake of killing you. Putting many enemies in one small area isn't the right way to make a game challenging imo. DaS1 did a better job at this, putting the player against fair enemies in fair situations. If you'd mess up, that was your own fault and you could learn from this. Many DaS2 areas (cough, shrine of amana cough) are just designed to be rage inducing, and the new dev team missed the point here.The bosses, on the other hand, are a whole different story. While some borrow elements from bosses from the first game (Iron King --> Ceaseless Discharge & Rat Authority --> Sif) they are mostly challenging and will take some attempt to get through. I didn't feel like any of the fights were particulairly unfair, although some had plain stupid gimmick mechanics behind them, ranging from toxic that had to be turned off at the other and of the level, to enemies that suddenly half damage taken for no reason.So it's still hard, but feels less fair at points.===WORLD DESIGN===The world is HUGE. Truly, there's many more levels and places to go than in DaS1. Although the level transition sometimes feels stupid (from the top of a castle to the bottom of a fire pit, what?!) the areas are rich and varied and look great. I personally hated only 2 or 3 out of the 35+ different areas, so that's a great thing. Nearly every area has it's own unique enemies and challenges the player in different ways. All the areas are stuffed with secrets and items and really reward exploration. The game improved on this part.===ONLINE===The biggest improvement comes from online interactivity. Where DaS1 on PC suffered from THE SINGLE WORST DRM (yes gfwl, I hate you) making playing with friends near impossible, and summons/invasions take forever, SteamWorks makes this a smooth experience. Summons appear instantly, invasions work flawlessly and overall online interactivity is amazing. The only downside is that FROMsoft decided it was a good idea to put 'soul memory' in the game, a system that greatly limits summoning ranges & invasion ranges based on the total amount of souls ever collected. A bit of a downside, but that won't matter when you hit NG+.This, along with other additions and changes make Dark Souls 2 a great game and a must have if you enjoyed the first one."

76561198072140962,Recommended,236430,13672631,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,KGov,"Having invested 117 hours according to Steam, Dark Souls 2 is, to be sincerely honest, one of the most precious, rare gem I have ever played since I started entering the gaming scene of the '90s SNES era (5 or six years old)! Character customization is deep, allowing a full physical customization to those who are into it. Take it at face value--Dark Souls 2 is amazingly hard to master. Literally any enemy you encounter is a viable threat as each hit sustained can withdraw a decent to horrendous amount of HP, and trust me that I say your character, whatever the chosen class, will need to increase HP as progress is made. Not only that, but factor in other important attributes like Endurance, Adaptability, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith, and a lot more you will need to manage your Souls well.What are Souls?Laid-back answer: each monster you successfully slay grants you the monster's souls; you spend them leveling up your attributes and/or buying, enchanting, and repairing weapons/armor. Merchants sell items  which you buy with souls. When you die, you lose all your souls. Fortunately you can run back to the spot you died and retrieve them. Unfortunately if you die a second time before collecting your dropped souls, they are gone forever... dun, Dun, DUN! Basically, view souls as currency and in this type of game it is the true design of risk and reward.'Should I risk 10K Souls by keep going on?' 'I can always collect them back should I die.' 'But there's always a chance I'll die again, losing 10K Souls.' 'Or should I cash them in?'In addition to carefully managing souls, I cannot stress how important stamina plays a gigantic role. To simply put it, each swing of a sword, club, spear, staff, and shield blocks getting pounded and dodging reduces stamina. Less stamina equates to less actions, but this also applies for your opponent as well. You will not know how much stamina an enemy has, only its HP is displayed, but you will know by the actions performed; monster swings in a 180 degree arc three times means its stamina is completely depleted, and now is your perfect opening to unleash hell. Monster takes a swing or two means it still has stamina so be cautious. Light or strong animation, observe the differences and approach appropiately. The action is nothing like God of War or Devil May Cry!The gear loadout is pretty brilliant. Each armor/weapon has its own stats and you can strengthen them with many diverse enchantments.Exploration is like a grade school field trip. Different routes can be traveled and you are not limited to a set destination. Having trouble with a particular area or boss? Work on another map and come back. Even some bosses can be optional by traveling a different path. Check every inch of the environment! There are a plethora of hidden secrets, rooms, and treasure. You will know by reading the messages placed by other helpful, or troll, players.Bosses can always be dueled by co-op with other players. A total of three, including you, can co-op bosses or even just the trash monsters. Want offline mode? NPCs can be summoned. Even you can be summoned to aid if you engrave your re-useable summoning sign called the Soapstone.Not for casuals, but if you are one I guarantee you will want to punch pregnant puppy over and over in sync with how many times you die. Do not give up! Persevere!"

76561198007138850,Recommended,236430,13215988,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Iron Tarkus,"Dark Souls II is a competently executed Zelda for grown-ups that is somewhat tainted by flaws stimming from an identity crisis and the occassional bout of plain old fashioned bad ideas. I should add that GFWL has prevented me from playing DS1, so this review will not compare the two games. Additionally, I cannot access multiplayer because I am playing this game on a potato. That said, let's begin the review, shall we?The atmosphere is great and combat is for the most part visceral and satisfying, although I'd argue that the game in many ways shoots itself in the foot in the manner in which it deals with weight. You see, you can't just flail around spamming attacks in Dark Souls because blows have weight and force behind them. While a dagger or rapier will strike faster than a greatsword or maul, for comparison's sake, a light weapon in DS strikes about as fast as a two-handed weapon in Skyrim. (Incidentally, the ability to choose to wield one-handed weapons with both hands for extra damage is another nice touch in DS.) The problem is, at high levels, it is possible to dual wield Zweihanders roughly the size of the Incredible Hulk, a feat which quite frankly runs quite contrary to the quasi-realistic handling of weapons at lower levels and leaves the game looking a bit schizophrenic. Anything that manages to break suspension of disbelief in a game where a transgendered undead swordsman can buy spells from a demonic cat in a zombie shantytown can probably be considered to be an artistic failure. Additionally, while it is a good idea on paper to have armor negatively effect mobility, the way in which it is executed in practice can lead to some builds which can generously be described as batshit insane. For example, a good way to combine defense, mobility, and counteroffensive parrying capabilities is to have a sword-n'-boarder that runs around buck♥♥♥♥♥nude, allowing you to quick roll and run very fast while blocking the attacks of mooks, opening them to a counterstrike.The controls are mostly solid and responsive with a few major puzzlers. For example, to jump, you must hold down B to sprint and then click the left stick, being careful not to accidentally nudge the stick slightly when doing so as this will cause you to veer off course and probably plunge into one of the game's many bottomless pits. I don't care if the game is supposed to be ""Hardcore,"" not having a single jump button is not ""challenging,"" it is just poor ergonomic design. The lack of an ability to pause is equally baffling. Sometimes you've got to answer the phone or go to the bathroom or whatever, and it'd be nice not to be splattered by the giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hippo monster when you put the controller down to do so. I suppose the argument could be made that PvP and Co-Op preclude the inclusion of a pause function, but I'd argue that all you'd have to do is disable it whenever you're being invaded, invading, summoning, or being summoned.Another major flaw of the game is the way it handles death. When you die, you come back as an undead Hollowed and lose your souls, (the game's combination currency/XP) and a portion of your maximum health, (up to a maximum of half after a dozen or so deaths.) This makes the game progressively harder each time you die. Health can be restored by using a Human Effigy to restore your humanity, but there are a finite amount of them in the game. You can regain the souls you lost by touching the Bloodstain where you died, but because enemies respawn after you die or rest at a campfire until you kill them ten or so times, in a particularly challenging area, you'll probably just die again. As there can only be one Bloodstain active at a time, this means the souls in the previous Bloodstain are lost for good. And as enemies stop spawning after a point, there are a finite amount of souls in the game.The problem with this is not that it adds challenge, but that it discourages exploration and experimentation because a rational person is just going to grind in a relatively safe area until the monsters stop spawning, which frankly gets kind of dull after a point. It's also worth noting that the Artificial Intelligence isn't. Sometimes you can just stand there twelve feet in front of an enemy and he'll just stand there staring into space until you cross the arbitrary eleven foot eleven inch mark after which he will furiously charge you. Foes are challenging, but rely more on overpowered attacks than tactical expertise, and battles devolve into ""figure out the unchanging pattern of the killer automaton."" Granted, for a klutz like me who doesn't have quick reflexes, it's still quite the challenge, but for someone who's actually good at video games, I could actaully see the infamously difficult Dark Souls becoming too easy.Overall, I would recommend this game for anyone looking for a good hack-and-slash dark fantasy adventure. However, I would add that the game's reputation as ""OMFG HARDCORE"" has created something of an Emperor's New Clothes type effect where people hesitate to point out the game's occassional spot of bad design out of fear of being labeled a ""filthy casual"" who needs to ""git gud"" since clearly the bad camera angle and poor lighting that caused you to die in that one dungeon was meant as a challenge to weed out♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥like you and was not a mistake, you ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. Of course, dismissing something because some of the fans are jerks will mean you'll have nothing left to like, so one obviously should not let this deter you from buying the game, and like most fandoms, most DS players are basically normal human beings, but one should be forewarned of the occassional toxic egotist in the community.TL;DR: A solid and fun game that falls somewhat short of perfection. Challenging test of timing and reflexes, but relatively undynamic combat AI and the neccessity to grind can lead to tedium."

Why did I love the Mega Man series?  It had great gameplay, tough bosses, and (in most cases) challenging yet fair sections that required you to be patient and execute your moves well.  One wrong move?  In most cases, it meant starting over.  Was this frustrating at times?  Sure!  I threw my controller against the wall more times than I could count.  Ah, but when you succeeded?  When you saw that boss explode into nothingness?  Getting his weapon (the one he used to blast your♥♥♥♥♥into next week several times)?  That feeling was AMAZING!  Over the years though, games seemed to get easier.  ""Accessible"" is another way to spin it, but I noticed that, with few exceptions, games were just becoming gratification experiences.When the original Dark Souls came out, I was aware of it's fantastic reviews, but I ignored it.  Primarily because it was on console, but when the PC version hit, I avoided that too as I had heard the port was awful (I wasn't aware of DSfix at the time).

There's a tutorial area in the beggining of the game, but as far as game mechanics go, that's going to take some time and experience.  Don't worry though, there's plenty of online resources and guides to get your started.Combat is amazing in this game, once you get the hang of it.  It's not the kind of combat though when you charge in Leeroy Jenkins style and hack and slash bad guys before they know what hit them.  No, you're starting the game with your head barely above water.  Most enemies can, and will kill you in a few hits.  This includes half-dead piglets, by the way.  You'll see what I mean......Initially, this will be amazingly frustrating.  But then, something happens.  You start to learn to wait and read your enemies' attacks.  You learn to take advantage of their missteps and punish them for making them.  This game will completely change your thought process, as even the most basic enemies are capable of taking you down if you're careless.  And then there's the bosses.  They're (mostly) big, bad, and merciless.  You'll die countless times.  But then you'll triumph.  I'm not joking when I say that some of the boss battles in this game had my hands shaking when they were over.  Yes, they are that intense (well, there is ONE in the main game that is kind of a joke, I'll let you uncover which).In short, the gameplay is old school in the sense that it's challenging to a large degree but also incredibly rewarding.  You'll quit some nights and tell yourself you're done.  But you won't be done.  You'll be back.  Trust me.Graphics:The graphics are good. Not as good as, say, modded Skyrim but above average.  There's currently a few graphics mods you can use to glam it up but I don't really think the graphics need much sprucing up.  I also want to say that, unlike Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, this game is very well-optimized on PC.  My specs are:i7 3770k 4.2 ghzEVGA GTX 670 2gb8 gb of RAMI get 60 fps at 1080p without a hiccup.  I've never experienced slowdown in this game, even during the most intense boss fights.  I also want to note something else though, in support of how well this game is optimized.  I also played this game on my Dell XPS L502x.  Those specs are:i7 3.7 ghzGT 540m8 gb RAMThose are not impressive specs for a laptop for gaming.  The GT540m wasn't even a great card when it was new.  That being said, with only a few settings turned off, I STILL can get close to 60 fps on this mediocore laptop at 720p and it looks fine.  My point is, even if you have a low-medium range rig, you will be able to run the game just fine.Controls:Don't use the keyboard.  Use a game pad.  Seriously.  Buy a used Xbox 360 wired controller or a PS3 controller if you've got one lying around somewhere.  The keyboard controls are not BAD per se, but after trying the game intitally with keyboard and mouse I plugged in my old 360 controller.  This is one of the few games on PC that I would recommend using a game pad over the keyboard/mouse setup.  Maybe you'll disagree.  I HATE gamepads in most situations but for this game I wouldnt play it any other way.  It just feels ""right"" on a gamepad.  Again, the keyboard and mouse setup is not unusable, just not ideal in my opinion.Story:This is another area where Dark Souls is much different than other games.  You don't get the expository dialogue of most games.  This game instead reveals its story in subtle ways, mainly through item and soul descriptions.  This might not be your thing, but I actually found it pretty refreshing.  I'll admit, I had to go online a few times to understand what was going on after I beat the game, but it's not something that should deter you from playing the game.Multiplayer:In Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, multiplayer takes the form of summoning and invasions.  The way this works is that other players can actually ""invade"" your world as a dark spirit and attempt to kill you.  This adds another level of difficulty to an already difficult game as you can advance far in a level only to be struck down by ""MLG420BLAZEIT"" and then taunted by same.  This can be remedied by playing the game offline, but I wouldn't recommend this.  Invasions can be a lot of fun and winning them can be quite a rush!The other way multiplayer occurs is by summoning other players into your world to help you.  If you're in human form, you can summon players to co-op a level with you and these same players can help you fight the bosses in the game.  I've got a lot of hours in the game and at this point can solo all the bosses, but in my first playthrough I summoned every chance I could.  You can also BE summoned to help other players which is really rewarding.Replay Value:Once you beat the game, you can access New Game +, which allows you to replay the game with all your gear (minus a few key items needed to advance the story).  This time around, there are new enemies and the normal ones are tougher.  There are also a few items you can get.  More significant though are the DLC.......DLC:The DLC in this game is amazing.  It also adds roughly 25-30 extra hours of gameplay.  I would highly recommend getting all three.  They are all top quality and offer enough variety from the regular game to warrant the purchase.  I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me.  Get the DLCConclusion:This game is hard.  There's no denying that.  It will frustrate you undoubtedly, but it will also reward greatly.  If you're tired of the same old ""press X to (insert pointless, mundane action)"" type of gameplay, then give this game a shot.  It's not demanding systems-requirement wise and will keep you busy for a long time."

76561198099303902,Recommended,236430,12733113,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Written Down,"Overall Dark Souls 2 is a great game. It has plenty of content. There are tons of bosses, an insane amount of areas to fight through, and a plethora of armor and weapons. Just like the previous souls games there is also a lot of replay value.However, out of the games in the souls series, this was unfortunately my least favorite.Don't get me wrong, it is a great game that i do recommend playing. But if you have played the previous souls game, this one might be a little bit of a dissapointment. I found the areas to be too easy to progress through. The challenge just wasn't there. Enemies movesets are slow and predictable. Even if you mess up and get hit, it doesn't matter that much; the enemies don't hit very hard. To add along to their low damage they also have low health. It felt like the developers toned down the difficulty a lot. Maybe to appeal to new players to the series.The bosses are also incredibly easy. I beat the majority of the bosses in one try. They added A LOT more bosses in this game than usual. It seemed like they sacrificed difficulty for quantity. I would rather have few and difficult bosses than many and easy. In the other souls games I usually got that ♥♥♥♥ YEAH feeling when I beat a boss but this time around I rarely got that feeling; it didn't feel rewarding. I WANT to get destroyed by bosses. I WANT to have to focus and actually be skillfull to succeed. This is not the case though. Even the final boss failed to deliver a challenge. I, and many others, beat the final boss in one try and often refer to the final boss as a joke.To add on to lackluster bosses and enemies. the level design just wasn't Dark Souls style. In the first Dark Souls you often found the areas of the map to intertwine in this magnificent fashion. This once again was a huge part of the first dark souls that I loved and wasn't delivered this time around. In Dark Souls 2 the levels just have areas that you go to, beat the bosses, reach a primal bonfire, light it and go back to Majula. They don't intertwine the areas to lead from one to another. There is actually a random small pointless area thats just a dead end. Like, what the hell were they thinking? WHY???And my biggest complaint. The bonfires. They are everywhere this time around. I never felt relieved to reach a bonfire, or struggled to reach a bonfire, or even had to look for one that is hidden well. They just put the bonfires everywhere, and out in the open. It took a HUGE part out of the challenge of the game.One of the BEST things about this game though is the DLC. The developers did a FANTASTIC job with the DLC areas and bosses. The DLCs are AMAZING. The level design was awesome and the bosses were actually difficult. Not only the bosses but the regular enemies themselves. It actually felt rewarding. Not only did the DLC pump of the difficulty and overall quality but they introduced some pretty sweet gear and spells to top it all off.If you are looking for a challenge like I was you will be a little dissapointed. Despite all of these complaints about the game, it is still fun and well worth the money. The game has a lot of entertainment value. Even though it may not feel as rewarding as the other souls games, it offers more content to explore. I just prefer quality over quantity.Overall 8/10"

With some changed, and rather clunky at first, controls for Keyboard and Mouse users and battle techniques out the window I got surprised. Unlike Dark Souls 1 who's learning curve is rather small, DS2 has a VERY steep one. All of the status effects, exlcuding poisn and toxic, have diffrent effects, enemies are harder, etc. etc. After relearning I fell in love it was a brutally punishing game. Its still the same mysterious lore and world we new as DS1. However, This game is VERY brutal more so then DS1. Remember being able to make it decently far without dieing in the undead burg? NOPE this is even harder. I found myself struggling to stay alive just on some rats in the HUB, however after creating a strategy I began to advance to the end and to New Game Plus.

I've got to say it was hard to put down initially.  The secret passages, the gear, the difficulty...all there from dark souls I except the combat is even harder! Yes. There is now a delay when you make even a light attack to the point where you need to prioritize attack speed with your opponents attacks.  Healing is even scarcer. You only get 1 estus flask with occasional healing drops off trash mobs. When you heal, you slow down and cant defend. Its hard guys, really hard.  I tried this with a keyboard and mouse and it was just awful. MUCH better than DS I but still not the way the game is meant to be played. Play with a kb & m and you'll see what I mean. Combat is much more difficult with it and movement is always set to running unless you press the x or z keys to toggle walking.  It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥and much better if you just plug in a 360 controller.  In fact, all of the in game prompts are in xbox 360 lol.

Enemies track, and some have infinite stamina. You'll have enemies rising from pits that, if you were to knock them back into, would kill them immediately. The coherent and connected world of Dark Souls is gone and now you get areas that can either be summed up as ""That one area from Dark Souls but..."" or it's an actually interesting area and it's extremely short, linear, and doesn't make any geographical sense. The story doesn't make any sense. If you wanted explanations for most things from Dark Souls, you could go read item descriptions and talk to NPCs. In Dark Souls 2, it's just a mess, just a huge mess. You start off seeking a cure, that falls through, so now you're off to be king? Being forced to talk to Emerald Herald to level up sucks too. It gives the feeling that the game is letting you level up instead of you just becoming stronger through your own experience, and no being able to teleport doesn't make up for that. In fact teleportation just allowed the B team to be even lazier with level design. Almost everywhere is extremely linear, at the most, one linear path branches off into 3 other linear paths.I played this beginning to end and all I have to show for it is dissappointment by how close to being a decent game it is. They didn't have the old director involved in this and it shows. The games aren't about being hard, they're about being rewarding and fair, which requires challenge, not precognition. I went into this knowing about some of it's problems, but I loved the first Dark Souls and wanted more so badly that I thought ""Even if all the little acts of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t add up too much, it'll still be mostly good."" It wasn't worth it. If you're dead set on getting into the Souls Series and don't mind the fact that armor is entirely useless and that shields and poise are too, then play this one first, because not only will you rarely be invaded and have plenty of time to learn the basic gist of the combat system but because every other Souls game will be a major improvement in comparison. I could go on and on about everylittle thing they messed up in this game, but a general summary for Dark Souls 2 would be ""One step forward, two steps back."""

Note that I do not have the season pass or any of the DLC because it's more money than I'm willing to spend on a single video game, no matter how much I actually like it.Please don't tell people how I live.Dark Souls 2 is a sequel to Dark souls which is a successor to Demon's Souls, which in turn is a spiritual successor to Kings Field. I'm sure if we dig deep enough we can fit Ultima in there somewhere.You play as a Zombie. I mean Undead. With your soul slowly tearing itself away from you and your memory fading, you travel to the land of Drangleic, a land of knights and kings and giant men who probably look good in a speedo. After falling into a lake, I think, you end up marching your corpse up into a little cabin where a few old ladies and their maid live. These old ladies call you a chump, slap some complexion into your face, and send you on your merry way to exhaust all NPC dialogue and appraise every single item you come across for that sweet sweet flavor text so you can sort of maybe kind of figure out what happened to the kingdom. Maybe.Dark Souls 2 plays much like Dark Souls, where you travel far and wide and kill everything that stands in your way. Or kill them again, I'm not entirely certain on how the undead part works. Attack and defense are mapped to your shoulder buttons, or your mouse clicks if you're brave or a hairy man living in a box behind the local Coop like me. Combat consists of you waiting for an opening to shove your boot so far up some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s brown hole that they taste leather and iron. Your reward for ending someones guard or monster career three days from retirement is their souls. Brutal.Souls work like experience and currency, with it you can buy new items and even buff up your character so he can pretend he goes to the undead gym and do undead bench presses instead of murdering other undead in cold blood and sucking the life force out of them you awful awful monster. That's not to say your victims won't put up a fight. Outside of magic, monsters, and melee, you will have to deal with traps and even other players. These players are called jerks and should leave me alone I'm trying to get to the next boss, go bother someone who isn't trying to take the giant medusa lady atop a windmill on a date.Jerk.But lets talk about the difficulty, one of the Souls' series main features. A lot of reviewers and journalists called this game impossible. These people also still eat their own boogers. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.Dark Souls 2 is a game about experience, the more you know, the better you do. If you take it slow and examine your surroundings, chances are you won't get smacked in the face by a trap. Trap as in something that kills you, not trap as in the kind of stripper you hope your friends hire for you as a goof during your birthday party and you go ""Haha, you guys got me."" But secretly you enjoy it.It's okay, your secret is safe with me.But anyway. Dark Souls 2 is in no way an impossible game, unless you are a complete chump. It's difficult to those going into the series for the first time but if you played Dark Souls or even Demon's Souls, chances are you're going to die much much less than most people, I myself died less than 30 times through my entire run through. If you're a veteran to the series, see it more as another adventure than a challenge. Unless you're into the competitive scene, you dork. Then the difficulty will ramp up quite a bit until you get the hang of PVP combat.The bosses, on the other hand, are a hit or miss. Many people criticized the point that many bosses were just humanoid, but to me it felt right. It felt like each boss battle like this was a duel between two opponents rather than an obstacle, like a sword fight or a battle for a tuna sandwich. The non-humanoids can be interesting, but many of them just kind of irked me for a multiple of reasons I shouldn't get into, less I be called a scrub.Should you play Dark Souls 2: The Wrath of Khan?If you're a fan of the series, you probably already have. But if you're new to the series? I say starting out with the cheaper and, in my opinion better crafted, Dark Souls, or even Demon's Souls is a more enticing option. Or even Kingsfield if you feel like being hip and ""With it"".  Dark Souls 2 is a competant member of the family, but it won't be doing much new to catch you off guard.I give Dark souls 2, 3 Berserk References out of 4.Why is Gutts still on the boat?The curator:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation"

They'll say this game isn't hardcore enough, that it's lore can't even hold a candle in the direction of the original Dark Souls, and that generally the game is worse than it's predessesor.I disagree to a point, to a certain point, I can see where the original fans are coming from.When looked at on it's own, when not being compared to Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 is a fantastic game that you can truly immerse yourself in just by sheer amount of time playing it. I find myself trying to think about how I want to plan out future builds for PvP or PvE or Co-op, whatever. I digress, the game itself has a very, very refined combat system, easily the best I've ever utilized in a game. Every realistic melee weapon you could want is probably in this game in some shape or another. Magic is interesting and varied and there's multiple ways to approach each given encounter with enemies. Through this game, you will experience frustration and anger, but when you finally achieve victory, it really gives off a feeling of true satisfaction. You beat that boss that was kicking the crap out of you before and now he lies dead on the floor, it's a good feeling to get from a video game and it's difficult to describe in words. This game's movement system, combat system, it's different bosses, are all top level awesome.Anyways; Pros and ConsPROS:-Fantastic PvP system, easy to get into a game, easy to leave games, etc.-Loads of initial choice, what path do you want to go to reach your inevitable destination?-Movement system is extremely refined and feels very fluid-As does the combat, still extremely refined-Extremely interesting lore if you decide to take the time out to read various item descriptions-Extremely engaging and time consuming, the mentality of ""just one more match"" or ""just one more boss"" is really addictingCONS:-Soul memory system isn't great, although with a more recent update it's been fixed-Extremely foggy pathing at times. There's a few headscratching moments where you sit there thinking to yourself ""huh, what do I do now?"" and the game barely hints at it-Some extremely broken (in terms of PvP) weapons that, when used can almost assure victory for it's wielder-Apparently this game takes a dump on Dark Souls lore, which I don't know much about, but we're looking at it as a standalone gameOverall 9/10. It's my most played game on Steam and I personally love every second of it. I recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs and has been feeling the need for more challenge or more ""UMPH"" to their RPG experience."

This was after From Software explicitly stated that the first release would be the only one. Several months later, I came back again. (I don't even remember why at this point. I think I was hoping to see patched keyboard+mouse controls.) This time, I discovered that From Software had re-released the game with ""enhanced"" graphics. (The same graphics that were there before, in press releases. They just had to be dumbed down so the game would run on consoles.)Are you seeing a pattern here?I pre-purchased this game in the hopes that it would be better than the port for the first Dark Souls.

The npcs are very forgettable and add very little to the overall feel of the game.

The game looks decent, but it feels like a console game, even the graphics. If the graphics were the only issue, I'd deal as they aren't awful, but the controls are simply bad (Only buy this if you have a controller that works with your PC)!!!I can't comment on the game itself. I'm sure it's awesome, but I can't play a game with bad controls. I wanted to use my kb & mouse, but that just doesn't work for me. Heck, you can't even scroll in or out, at least not that I could see. Personally, I'd buy it on the PS3 or Xbox, because the pc port is not what I expected...

If you manage to remap the controls to where power attack is something other than double clicking combat still dosn't get any faster, due mainly to the fact that if double click no longer does a power attack then clicking quickly won't do anything at all until you stop. there is also the matter of input lag, at least i experienced some, from a starting position of my had about 1 foot from my mouse i was able to click and return my hand before the attack animation started, not sure how long that is exactly, but it's fairly signifigant.another problem i've had is with lock on, rather than being able to tab through targets, you move the mouse, and it has to move a large enough distance to switch targets, making it very dificult to deal with large numbers of enemies.all i have to say is either play it on console, get an xbox controller(and pray that it will use the same controls as the console version), or wait for a mod to make the controls useable... i personally won't be playing much of it until one of the latter 2 options has been done... i might get an xbox controller... but i'm not sure. overall if they had litterally given us a list of controls and alowed for free key maping with the same core controlls as the console, exept tab targeting rather than moving the mouse to switch targets, it would have been mostly playable... if not compleately fine... but as it stands, the game is bad because of the bad controls... because of how slow it makes combat it doesn't even feel tense... almoast feels like a turn based rpg on some enemies, you let them thrash around for a bit, then poke them, and repeat untill they die. as opposed to being able to dodge and damage at the same time."

,Not Recommended,236430,9924101,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,Scrubshark,"I am quite disapointed with this game.First of all they did not fulfill their promise.Their trailer/ teaser showed a huge graphics overhaul and the lighting mechanism.I don't care much for graphics, i think they are ok, what i do care about is false advertising. And showing graphics and then not living up to them is lying. Same goes for lighting. I was kind of excited for this but never had to use a torch. Another thing they didn't implement yet showed on their trailer.What impression does this give me?"" Let's build hype so the pre-order are super high."""" Rush this product, we need money and then we can already start with DLC.""At any rate this is the least of my concerns with not recommending this game.The pre-order bonus weapons are plain useless, why even include them? For me it would have been fine just having OST and that comic. But then again ==> impulsive buyers, younger crowd, etc..Now the part that made me quit this game on completion.There is barely no difficulty in this game, it is all replaced with artificial difficulty.Most deaths occur to being stunlocked and combo'd to death, a vertical slash swiping horizontally to follow your roll. Hits that do not hit your character, yet take away health.Rarely do you face loner enemies like the black knights in DS 1 for example. Which were worthy and dangerous adversaries. In DS 2 you will most of the time find yourself outnumbered. And for a bunch of depraved corpses they can move damn fast and have lots of stamina.This also includes magic homing attacks, yes Amana it's about you..The same goes for invasions etc. there's lag, which causes overall frustration especially if you are in a tough area where you finally managed to progress and some invader beats you down especially if he lags very hard or the hitdetection messes up, which it does quite frequently. The fact they put out the red eye orb infinite usage doesn't really stimulate much invasion, which i don't really mind but would make it a boring grind for me if i wanted to invade.Then again there's quite the ammount of cheaters in the game like in DS 1 that roam freely. Again From fails to do something about it.the bosses are ok for the most part. The looking glass knight was refreshing though i dislike him summoning players in the game but hey it's a nice touch. Most bosses though don't feel rewarding for killing. How many times i got sucked into a grapple animation while being slightly out of reach. The overall of bosses is not so satisfying and some are even copy pasted from DS 1 or mobs in DS 2.Some bosses even get mob thrash in order to be difficult like Freya. It's to make the game difficult but i think it's not really adding anything to the challenge. It makes the artificial difficulty higher though.Then NG + is supossed to be harder which it was but again tweaking artificial difficulty. Sinner gets some red ghost pyromancers to help, there's more red phantoms everywhere. In short ==> swarm tactics. Again upping artificial difficulty and not feeling so challenging but rather unfair.I noticed differences in playing DS 1 and DS 2. In DS 2 i'm more relying on spamming health items and other stuff while in DS 1 i try to refrain from using healing items until the boss fight so i have the biggest chance of survival. Which could lead to this impression: die in DS 2, just buy more soulgems, herbs, rouge water whatevs. Outtank the problem.Soul Memory is not popular, i don't really care that much but what i do find nasty about it is that if a hacker would invade you or you invade one that has 99999999 souls and he jumps off a cliff or so, you get a very high soul memory and you'll get invaded by people way bove your paygrade.the story itself is not bad, it's ok, DS 1 had better story and atmosphere IMO.Bonfires had much more weight and meaning in DS 1 as in you could not just teleport everywhere at the start of the game. It was used to level up, become human, kindle. there were fewer bonfires making them very precious.in DS 2 some areas are riddled with them, you can teleport from start and they only replenish Estus and reset the mobs. Leveling up, you always have to go to the herald, listening to her ramblings over and over, same with estus shards. Everything has to be done with the herald. Which is not gamebreaking i just find it annoying. Bonfires always had weight in DS lore but now they don't get that much importance anymore.I could be wrong since i rushed through this game with a walkthrough after having enough of this game. I just wanted to see the end story, but i haven't seen a single firekeeper in the game, and aren't bonfires supossed to douse when firekeepers are dead. Besides the 4 witches in things betwixt there aren't any keepers.In short: i do not recommend this game at all. It's a step back from DS 1 maybe because of all the hype and attention over the years and Bandai Cracking the whip, maybe greed, i don't care. The results count and for me, it's a mediocre game at best.EDIT:Bought the DLC too... all of them were exact the same shait as i mentioned above... an illustrious gangbang of opponents and behemoths spouting their hot magma ♥♥♥♥ on you..Not to mention the other attempt to make a BlightTown anal bleeding dungeon.. YES SUNKEN CROWN, YOU.The dragon boss was the only good thing about this dlc.Now the Iron crown or whatever.. the dlc with the tower of fire and ash.It was MEH at best..  Fume knight was quite boring.Finally Ivory Crown.. Interesting visuals, nice little snow effect on clothes. Interesting aspect of the female voice. ( I won't spoil it)Final boss had a nice arena but the boss itself was rather a disapointment.. i found the sabre cat boss to be the most surprising but it relied on a cheap unavoidable first death. Screw you for exploring you daft minge... you should have taken the other direction. But that is ok.. it was surprising.The rest of the enemies are just plain stupid.Scolar of DLC is a cashgrab... whatever the hell you all say.. it adds NOTHING to the game...Just some units need replacing a new NPC here and there, some items. done... oh and the direct X upgrade of course which you all craved while stroking the fallus of Bandai.Cheap abyssmal business practice that raked in heaps of cash because the new era gamer is a spineless and gutless hyped up freakshow on a leash.Let us hope DS 3 will be better with the old leading dev behind it.DS 2 was a load of trash.. and Yui or whatever his name is can stay buried with the Rotten in the Gutter,, where he belongs."

Dark souls 1 features realism into the game, and made all monsters hard, but most of all, they are unique and fair. Dark souls 1, huge monsters who hit hard have attack animations which are fair, and can be dodged. In this game, everything has auto target, and focuses on making things hard, rather than unique. They also tossed out the fair element. An enemy with a giant club could pivot 90 degrees (almost as if standing on a record player) half way during their attack animation and whack you. all bosses are pretty much humanoids. Dark souls gameplay is meant more for 1v1 combat , but now you just walk into 1 way tunnels with 7-8 of the same guys grouped together. Pvp is pretty broken. You get can get invaded by MORE than 1 person at the same time, all whilst you are attempting fighting off mobs which only target the host. Also lag makes it so you could slice and dice a person, and even hear the sound of metal on metal, but a quarter of a second later they roll away and are still at full hp. would i recommend this game? probably not.

The controls are miserable, the story is disconnected, the graphics are incredibly inconsistent, and, worst of all, the game abandoned Dark Souls I's ""hard but fair"" policy. Dark Souls I used ambushes to push the player away from areas they weren't ready for (notably the Catacombs via Graveyard), while Dark Souls II relies on that as the main method of attack. Most enemies have far better range, tracking, and poise, even from the start. The enemy, area, and boss design feel rushed and lazy, only worsened by the terrible combat system. The only thing going for this game is the PvP, but you must trek through the garbage game to get to the PvP levels.

While I'm sure there are far more-involved Dark Souls enthusiasts out there than myself, I believe I was big enough into Dark Souls to be a judge of DS2's state as a sequel.There's a reason DS1 spawned an array of clones. Everything about it was unique, interesting, and mostly-well executed. Dark Souls 2 is an officially-branded clone of its predecessor. It's not a sequel, it's not even a spiritual successor. It's every bit as much of a pale, badly hewn-together clone as the abysmal Lords of the Fallen and other such games.It's like From realized they had lightning in a bottle, and they weren't quite sure just WHAT it was exactly that people liked about the first game. Like they made a great game by accident, a-million-monkeys-in-a-room-typing-on-typewriters-style, and they were utterly stumped as to what made it work.So, Dark Souls 1 was widely considered to be *hard,* so....hard it is, then. Dark Souls 2 goes to great lengths to tell you about just how hard it is - every single hammy, cringy word delivered by its myriad cookie-cutter NPCs is specifically written to tell you all about it. Despair, despair, souls, souls, *souls,* despair, there is no hope. From the onset, it's immediately evident that this is a game that is trying entirely too hard to be hard.So what's actually wrong with it? Especially in comparison to the first game? Oh, there's lots.The animations are laughably bad. This is very hard to square, because DS1 was essentially the pinnacle of how third-person animations should be. Characters had weight in their step. You could *feel* your character's feet on the ground as you moved. If you wore thick armor, there was a definite *feel* of being heavy, weighty, and protected. In Dark Souls 2, characters are on ice skates, all the freaking time. Running and walking animations are just plain bad - ESPECIALLY if you make the mistake of playing as a female character. Speaking of which, did I mention that the characters are horribly out of proportion and look like stretched clay figurines? Anyway, yeah, coming from the fantastic animations of DS1, the terrible animations of this game look straight-up criminal. I cannot overstate just how much this sabotages the underlying *feel* of gameplay.Visual design? Very pedestrian, especially when coming off of DS1's grim, yet memorable backdrops. Everything here looks like a retread of that game at best, and a completely forgettible mess of same-color hodge-podge at worst.Gameplay? Surprisingly cludgy and unresponsive. I'm not really sure how they managed to screw this up, because I feel as though to do so would have required some amount of effort. I mean, it's not like they had to completely scrap all their work on the last game, right? Who knows, maybe they did - that would explain why they didn't merely keep the last game's far superior animations instead of making terrible new ones. But yes, the combat is stiff, clunky, and horribly imprecise compared to the original.It could have been done on purpose, honestly. It seems to have been built around gimping your character as much as possible. You HAVE to be using the target lock on mechanic if you want to actually hit anything. Otherwise, who the hell knows where your strikes are going to go. Parrying is strange - something has been altered in the mechanic to make it way less reliable than before. I'm not strictly against change, but there's definitely a lack of precision in the input and response compared to before. Character movement has a bizarre deadzone that makes precise steps strangely hard to trigger without dead-running in a direction, and dodge rolls feel consistently wrong. Attacks are stiff, have way too much wind up, and rarely, if ever, exhibit any kind of ""flow."" Hitting enemies is completely without satisfaction. And I know it's a nitpick, but even the SOUND EFFECTS of a hit are lacking, which only makes it worse. They're cartoony and overdone.As for the enemies, oh boy. I don't even know where to begin. The entire game's schick is throwing you in a cramped room with enemies packing oversized swords. They bum rush you, and throw off endless 'tard-swings that are as embarrassing to watch as they are frustrating to contend with. Dark Souls 1 was about timing. Dark Souls 2 is about tanking 'tard swings until you get an opening to land a clumsy hit-string of your own. It's boring, it's rote, and it sucks tremendously. Words cannot properly describe how laughably the enemy animates when pulling off these physics-defying sword-flailing freakouts. It's just pathetic.This game is often called the black sheep of the franchise. Some claim Dark Souls 3 is indeed better. I can't say. All I know is, this game has ruined any confidence I had left in From Software, and that's truly a hard thing to come to terms with. They've made some of my favorite games. But this game.

So I hope I know what I'm talking about.The first thing you need to know is, that this game wasn't made by the same producer who did Dark Souls 1. And it shows. Heavily so. If I knew that before, I would not have bought it.Dark Souls II gets an unreal and undeserved amount of praise I can neither grasp nor understand. I can hardly recommend it to anyone, especially if you have never played one of these games before.It's incredibly hard. And not in a good way. This whole game is an uninspired on-rails corridor third person FPS with melee weapons. The story is boring and makes no sense, is practically a direct copy from Dark Souls 1 and nothing more but a bad excuse for this game to exist. It has a disgusting amount of fan pandering and references to the last game, which have no right to exist. The Overall game feels like it was designed by fans rather than qualified personel.The combat system did not receive any improvement whatsoever. Often i found myself battling the controls and especially the uncomfortable camera more than any enemy, which resulted in many unreasonable deaths.The world itself feels nonorganic. Its like you are waddling through a theme park. The areas are short and feel malconnected to each other and have all way too many bonfires. There are Checkpoints almost around each corner. Graphicwise this game only received minor improvements and the music is a mayor letdown from Dark Souls 1.The enemies in this game are a complete joke. Not only do they all almost fight the same way (large humanoid Knight-type enemies with big weapons), they also often come in packs. Either they smash you to paste if you don't single them out or you gotta run untill they reset where you can cheese them out with ranged attacks. That enemies despawn after a certain number off kills is just unacceptable.The boss battles are uninspired and unfair and only rely on the formula: The more stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥we throw at you the better it gets. You are either facepalming because the boss battles are too easy or so ridicoulous hard and unenjoyable that its no fun to replay them. But you are expected to do so. I found myself getting tired of this neverending onslaught way over I reached the castle of the king of the game, but no, the game wants you to soldier on through 5 more levels. Why? There's no reason to stretch the game out like an old chewing gum.Most of the weapons in this game are either ugly or no fun to use. Not to mention the multiplayer system is both in cooperative and PVP boring, timeconsuming and unsatisfying. The way players connect with this new Soul Memory makes absolutely no sense and makes nobody happy. Aside from that in the end game everybody runs around in the same cookie-cutter overpowered shitgear. You are better off playing alone.But the worst, and i mean absolute worst gamebreaking mechanic that was reintroduced in this game is the healing system. You no longer rely on Estrus Flasks as main heal resource, but on a collection of healing crystals, that heal more slowly, but are avaiable in infinite amounts. The tense and stategic moments of planned healing is gone for good. This crystal ♥♥♥♥♥pam broke the games design and everything that could have been redeemable for this title.The cherry on top of this whole mess is the fact that they charge for three parts of DLC at 10 Euros each. Greed knows no bounds here. Im not gonna buy this and neither should you. Speak with your wallet.If you have even read so far to this point i'd like to thank you for your time. Even if you bought this game and don't agree with me.All I can say is, that this game was all but a big disappointment. And I hope the producer from Dark Souls 1 will return one day to make a new game and make me forget this farce."

For example - You find a chest after having trudged through a very long section of monsters that wear you down, and it's rigged ; simply instantly killing you upon opening it.This is a stark contrast compared to how the game was previously executing it's difficulty ; as chests could, indeed, kill you before - But they would fight you (They were mimics) and you had a fair fight against them. It wasn't simply a one hit KO unconditionally. And you could also mitigate the damage from the Mimics slightly by usage of controls.Likewise with other situations that tend to become ""difficult"", it comes down to a cheap usage of Environment. I understand that the developers wanted to make a difficult game, but having the hazard being you falling off a ledge ; or placing a hole in a platform in a very inconspicious place - does not leave the environment feeling as if it's hazardous. It feels as if it's put there ; KNOWINGLY, to cause you a cheap death.Death in Dark Souls should be when you fight valiantly against a monster or a seemingly overwhelming foe that tests your skills in form of timings in Riposting or your excellence in timing of your move-set or in your management of stamina with blocking etc.None of these things occur, though. Essentialy, you are fighting against not falling into a bloody hole in the ground or falling into the water - More so then fighting the actual monsters. And since when is shallow water hazardous? Is our hero unable to swim?It may be a wanting to harken back to ""Old-school"", but it feels extremely outdated and quite frankly - cheap - To make the player die instantly by touching water, or falling down a hole. This is Dark Souls, not Super Mario to the SNES.Outover this - the game takes another approach that i find to be a cheap mechanic. The idea of ""Throw enough monsters at the player - It will be a challenge"". Yes, you are right - Fighting 3 monsters at once ; is difficult. Does it feel challenging? No.Because the way you solve fighting 3 monsters at the same time , is not fighting 3 monsters at the same time. You pull them away until you get 1 and manage to make the other mob ""Magically"" run back to it's original spawn point like it all suddenly got very awkward for it to stick around.All these elements add up to break the immersion of the game and the sense of difficulty ; it renders the game to feel as if you are having to slow down eating your meal and pick out ocassionaly dead flies from it. Which is not appealing.The game flow should be represented in such a way, that the game paces naturally and that you are not artifically held up by some constraint or thing that makes you incredibly self-aware of the situation. Then it's bad game design ; it's bad design, if you are able to TELL exactly what they wanted to do and it doesn't feel good to know that. If you can just point to the sky and say ""They want us to look at the pretty sky"" - It's bad.Which i feel in all honesty, they did not understand making this game. The environment itself is great, looks awesome - the story approach, arguably good. But the way of dealing with the difficulty in comparison to the old Dark Souls game? Terrible. Absolutely awful.Can i remmond this game to someone else?No. Dark Souls 1 was where the gameplay was best off, in my opinion - And they failed to take lessons from that game."

I enjoy it quite a lot.You should not buy it.Dark Souls II, for you uninitiated, is a dungeon crawler that pits you against a relentlessly hostile world, tasking you with navigating deathtrap environments populated by enemies fiendishly positioned to put you between as many rocks and hard places as possible. It sells itself on its difficulty, and to its credit it is a difficult game. It will kill you with rage-inducing frequency until you git gud.The levels are visually varied and, for the most part, aesthetically pleasing. Moving away from Dark Souls' run-down brown and grey color pallete, Dark Souls II reflects the world's descent into decay in full color; Heide's Tower of Flame looks no less doomed to vanish completely beneath the waves for all its dazzling blues, and in this respect Dark Souls II has clearly surpassed its predecessor.It's difficult to immerse yourself fully in the game's world, however, because the story is bad. That's really all there is to it. The design philosophy underlying Dark Souls series storytelling is immersion through sparcity: you are left to tell your own story, piecing together a narrative from the skeleton provided you by the game and the things you find and do while playing. In order for this to work, however, the game needs to provide a workable skeleton. Dark Souls did this. Dark Souls II does not.Dark Souls starts off with a brief genesis myth, outlining the great powers that have shaped the world and naming major names that you should watch out for. It gives you the general problem afflicting the world: the Fire is dying, and the lands are overrun with undead. You are one such undead, locked away in the Undead Asylum because nobody knows what else to do with your kind. The game starts. Oscar of Astora breaks you out of the asylum and delivers to you a vague prophecy that promises that if you travel to Lordran and ring the Bell of Awakening you will discover the fate of the undead.This is your motivation. Discovering the fate of the undead is relevant to you personally as one of the undead, and it could potentially solve one of the two major problems plaguing the world. You don't know what the Bell of Awakening is, yet, but you find out immediately after arriving in Lordran; there are actually two Bells, and you have to ring them both. You are given  sparse direction about how to do this, the game telling you only that one bell is in the Undead Parish and the other in Blighttown. You are left to find these places for yourself but you know it when you do find them, and this lets you know that you are on the right track. Once both bells are rung that narrative thread runs out, but you are given a new one, involving both the dying of the Fire and the fate of the undead and tying back in to the genesis myth from the introduction. You follow this second thread to the end of the game. The ending's meaning is not explicitly explained, but over the course of your journey you are given enough information to piece together what has happened and what the effects of your actions are.Notice that for all it took two meaty paragraphs to type up, the story is actually bare-bones, even downright simple. This is how it should be. People talk a lot about the Souls series having complex and difficult lore--and it does--but the *plot*, the sequence of events that befall your character, is straightforward and easy to understand. The complexity lies in the backstory, the half-glimpses of other places and times that contribute to the world you move through but with which you do not directly interact. That's fine: you don't need to know anything about the politics of the Dragon School of Vinheim for the things your character does to make sense. The plot has to answer a single question for you: Why are you doing what you are doing?Dark Souls II fails at this.You are told that you are one of the undead, doomed to degenerate into a mindless Hollow, feeding on the souls of human beings. Once you had a life, with other people in another place, but the curse has taken that from you. In search of a cure you wander, drawn inexorably to the kingdom of Drangleic. You don't have a choice in the matter: Drangleic is a lure for the undead, calling them across space and time for unknown reasons, and you will eventually find yourself there. Two general problems, then, much like the first game: you are slowly Hollowing and need a cure, and Drangleic is vaguely ominous and possibly evil and while you're there you might as well find out why.You wind up in Majula and run smack into the Emerald Herald. She's Ms. Exposition, or what passes for it in a Souls game, and she's here to do what the Crestfallen Warrior did: give you a goal to be on the lookout for, some vague hints as to where you'll find it, and send you off. You start talking to her, and she tells you about how to become the next monarch of Drangleic.Wait, what? No, ma'am, I think you're confused. Drangleic is the secondary plot thread at the moment, it doesn't come to the forefront of the story until I've learned more about what's happened to it while trying to find a cure for the undead curse. You're not supposed to be talking about becoming the monarch and seeking the king until the second half of the game. But no, no more from her about curing the curse. Not that the curse is suddenly forgotten: every time she addresses you you're the ""Bearer of the Curse"" so it's always there, right in your face, and you wondering what in God's name happened to trying to cure it. Why am I running around killing the four Old Ones to take their souls? Are they going to help me cure the curse? No, they'll let me seek an audience with the King. Why do I want that? Not telling me? Oh, okay.The hideous part is that this is completely explained in literally four lines of unused dialogue. ""The curse is a part of life itself. No one will ever be rid of it. And so there is only one choice. To await a worthy monarch. A monarch who can shoulder your burden. Lest this land swallow you whole… As it has so many others."" Those aren't the only last-minute omissions that damage the story, either. It's done in other places, always to the game's detriment. The effect is deeply unsatisfying and sours the rest of the game.Corners have been inexplicably cut in other places as well. The pleasing-but-unspectacular graphics are a pale shadow of what we saw in the teasers, and the lighting engine and torch mechanics were almost completely stripped out. The rate at which equipment loses integrity was tied to either the frame count or the processor speed, leading to weapons and rings breaking twice as fast on the PC as on consoles: there is no fix for this as yet. Enemies are given absolutely bizarre tracking, massive bosses spinning on a dime to strike players standing behind them (look up a video of the Covetous Demon or the Rotten spinning like tops). Because of this, fights fall into a pattern of strike, dodge out of range, wait for the enemy to exhaust their pattern, repeat, turning them more into tests of patience than tests of skill.Most damning is the broken multiplayer matchmaking system. Sorting by Soul Memory instead of Soul Level means that there is no incentive to ever stop leveling up. Character builds are a thing of the past: you will move towards the mathematically optimal monobuild, maximizing defense and offense with no tradeoffs or interesting quirks, or you will be curbstomped by other players who have. This is a game-breaking flaw. It also means that you can't stay and co-op on a single boss whose fight you particularly enjoy; you'll quickly move beyond the Soul Memory range.All in all, it smacks of a cash-grab, laziness from a dev team who knew they were guaranteed sales based on the good name of previous releases. It is not what it could, or should, have been.Do not reward this misbehavior. Do not buy this game."

,Not Recommended,236430,22289771,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Foxeo,"As a huge fan of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, I looked forward to Dark Souls 2 with anticipation. While many of the initial issues with the game were patched out, the game doesn't quite live up to the series' standards. The graphics just don't seem as impressive as its predecessors, and the much-lauded lighting system is wholly absent, rendering the torch mechanic virtually useless. The story is incredibly convoluted and confusing, leaving many giant plotholes and other issues.Basic combat is incredibly frustrating, based on numerous changes to how it works. Movement feels floaty and awkward, and rolling is fairly ineffective until you level up your agility stat. Stamina drains extremely quickly, and low stamina slows your character's attacks down, which feels sluggish. A ""sweet spot"" system makes certain weapons much harder to use, and therefore less preferable and less effective. You're repeatedly ambushed by unreasonably large groups of enemies, and the broken poise system means you can be staggered by the simplest, weakest attacks. The game is missing some obvious shortcuts that would have enhanced the experience and made it much more pleasant to retry failed boss fights, and the geography of the game world is nonsensical. Parries and backstabs are slower and less satisfying, coupled with silly-looking animations.Healing is a poorly balanced combination of consumables and Estus, the system from Dark Souls. Numerous boss fights are either ripped straight from Dark Souls, or barely modified versions of bosses from Dark Souls. The leveling system is tied to a character, which makes no sense given that bonfires still let you do everything else they did in Dark Souls. You have to mash through four lines of dialogue every single time you want to level up. Default keyboard/mouse controls are absolutely ridiculous. For example, your most common attack, referred to as R1 by many, is mapped to the right mouse button. You are intended to click the right mouse button as your default, most commonly used attack. Obviously this is absurd, and a sure sign they had no idea how to map controls for PC games.Overall, I found it a disappointing sequel that didn't know whether it wanted to follow in Miyazaki's footsteps, or venture out and do its own thing; ultimately, it became a messy mish-mash of both. Occasionally I return to the game, hoping I'll feel differently, but I find playing through the game a chore.You can watch my full review here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvWB7Yk2VQ"

Challenging is where you set a goal that is higher than normal, but in the ""attainable"" range.  Fun is something that rewards you for effort you put in.  And a Game is something made for enjoyment.None of those things were true in the hour I spent trying to figure out why this game is so popular despite its clunky (far too mild a term) controls, crappy camera movement (spazzes constantly, especially in corridors or tight spaces--like it's designed to make it hard to see what's going on) and the fact that none of the bindings for keyboard make sense.I understand it's a console game, but if you move it to PC the least you could do is put keybindings in places that make sense and/or display notifications for which buttons do what.  Otherwise, the game should say ""controller required/recommended"".Total ripoff, will not be purchasing anything similar or by the same people ever again.And to those who say ""you're just butthurt because you died"", you might be right, at least in part--I'm mad because I died while having no clue why it was happening or how I could avoid it; Over, and over, and over, and over again.

This games graphical quality in my opinion is a joke. This game has repeating textures or tiled textures. I'm not sure what this is called, but imagine a 3x3 grid. That makes 9 squares. In this game each square would have the same texture and that would equal a wall. Also I will never forgive a wall that has a picture of a window on it and on the other side of that wall there would be no window.There is so much more wrong with this game such as the bosses being unfair instead of challenging, but many others have already covered this.I also can't get over how easy this game is.If you're looking for an ugly game with good gameplay then this is for you!"

I even argued with some of my friends, who felt like the graphics downgrade (see e.g. the following youtube video) was a dealbreaker.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykbT03r_9ZoHowever, the game, while enjoyable, still had flaws, the most glaring of which was, in my opinion, the ridiculous idea of mapping weak and strong attacks to single-clicking / double-clicking left and right mouse buttons, as well as not providing in-game support for Mouse4 and Mouse5 buttons. The former issue caused noticeable attack delay for M+KB users, unless you were ok with remapping your mouse controls with external tools. Just changing the mouse binding of strong attacks to something else did not fix the issue, as the game would still check whether each click was a single or a double click (by waiting a given amount of time, thus the delay) and simply do nothing, instead of weak attacking, if a double click was recognized. This was later fixed by providing users the option to disable double click input altogether (although it is necessary to enable and disable it again every time when launching the game to make it start working).Then FROM lied. Souls died. This is what they said:“For Dark Souls 2, we don’t even expect any additional downloadable content because we want to deliver a full game, the full experience, to fans who purchase the package from day one. We did do additional content for Dark Souls, but generally downloadable content for Dark Souls II is not really being considered. Buy the package and you’ll get the full experience, and you’ll have as much fun as anybody else. Spending a couple dollars on certain items does not help the experience. So no free-to-play yet!”(source:http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/20/dark-souls-2-dlc-is-not-really-being-considered)Then they announced not just one, but three DLCs. The community had gotten fooled. I refused to buy the season pass on principle. I loved this game, but I just would not.Then we got fooled again. Scamco released a standalone ""DX11 version of the game"", like it's a brand new ""next gen"" thing. Like DX11 wasn't here when DS2 first came out last year. Like we're cows that are supposed to be milked for cash. They are basically asking us for more money to give us the game we were shown in the beginning, before they gimped PC graphics (and gameplay) to enforce parity with the PS3 and XBox 360 versions.No, thanks.And I am supposed to pay 25€ to upgrade. In my case it *might* be worth it because I don't have the DLCs, but I still won't, because I would be supporting anti-consumer policies.The game is really good, but we consumers should not support such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices.I basically blacklisted FROM and Scamco and will never buy one of their games anymore, unless the gamer community gets a serious apology from them, that is.

Resolution is 1920x1080 perfect game looks good for how easy it is to run and the environment are creative. Controls are yes with dark souls being unplayable this time round most people said they are better with a controller well that’s because most have played the first with a controller but I have only used a mouse and keyboard for this game. I would not have it another way and yes I beat the whole game with mouse and key broad. How long is the story I hear you ask well took me 45 hours with a little side battles in pvp 35 maybe. I was quick to beat this game because school was approaching at the time but unlike me who will all-nighter it this game will last you a long time.

I had a blast with the Witcher 2 an was told this game was somewhat similar albeit harder and definitely a different take.I don't mind hard games, I am usually drawn towards them - so I expected Dark Souls 2 to be no surprise.When I got into the game it definitely has a Japanese feel to it - which is fine, not usually my style but I figured I'd roll with it. The character creation first impressions was...well it's pretty terrible. It's almost impossible to not make your guy look really lame. I played with it for almost 30 minutes before giving up and accepting that my guy would look like a final fantasy reject.The graphics: I guess they're ok - but they seem pretty dated for a 2014 release, especially when compared to games like Skyrim and The Witcher 2. The UI is really really bad - like looks as though it was made in 2005 or earlier by an intern who just learned photoshop.This is quite possibly the worst port to PC I've ever played (and I've played a lot of games). There was absolutely zero thought into making this a PC game, the tool tips are still for Xbox.The controls are also very bad, they might be better on console but in general I don't want to have to press 14 buttons (exagerration) to jump. All in all the game felt very clunky, from the graphics, the level design, the UI...it was just bad.For anyone who is interested in a dark-fantasy game that is highly touted I would HIGHLY recommend doing more research before purchasing this. It's one of the worst games I've played in the last 5 years. The presentation is very amateurish, the story did not seem engaging and the level design was bland from the get go.Long story short - do not buy this game unless you are absolutely a Dark Souls 1 fan."

There is a bar with controller commands that take up the entire bottom of the screen, but as I said, they are all for controller.   I don't play with a controller and this has come up with a number of incomplete, bad, poor ports, etc... and the standard answer is to just use a controller, which I refuse to accept.  I bought this for my PC and I prefer the advantages that that affords, I will not downgrade to a controller because the developer was lazy and I will not play a game that I have to setup macros to do every action, that would defeat the purpose of a keyboard.They need to complete the port and address this by making the controls standard, like all other games in this genre.  There have been no actions I have seen that require all these complicated two, three key press commands.  Everything that you encounter with an available action has a prompt that shows the controller key.  The commands are redundant, like movement and camera because it's all based on a controller.  The commands available are typically ctr+A Key or Alt+a key or Shift+ a key or worse, a 3rd key even. You can't customize the controls like it may say, because when you select a key to change a pop-up it forces you to use a number of preset commands, which are all as described above, Alt_key, etc...  I would really like to get some enjoyment out of this game considering it was as expensive as any other AAA game, but just it's just another bad port that needs attention with respect to the PC aspect, duh, otherwise, do as other publishers, don't release it until you have complete the PC port.I can't rate this game, it has too many control issues with keys , like jump, that do not work, other commands that are impossible to remember during battle. The tutorial is horrible as it also is all about controller keys so it teaches you nothing.  If you want to play with a keyboard, get ready for a game that includes dying a lot, plus all the times you will die due to the controller issue.If there are basic commands, they are not on Steam and to spend this kind of money on Steam, to have to rely on a 3rd pary site while playing is pathetic.  Developers and publushers are just pushing the boundries these days for what WE should accept as playable and it's time that they stand up and give us what we paid for, not some incomplete port that they CAN sell as a PC game even though it's not any fun to play on the PC with the standard equipment, a keyboard and mouse."

Hollowing has a more significant impact in DS2 - temporarily losing a percentage of your max HP until you use an item to reverse the hollowing (not the humanity stat - which has been removed); dual-wielding has become much more viable in the form of a new system called the power stance; the old curse status has been effectively replaced by the less-severe petrify status, and a new status called curse - which is relatively minor in its effect, but much more common than DS1's curse - has been introduced.+There are more weapon types in DS2 than in DS1 - including a few new classes of weapons, such as twinblades - and a new branch of spellcasting has been added (hexes - the damage adjustment of which is based on whichever is lower - Intelligence or Faith). Unfortunately, a few of my old PvE favorites (e.g. manserpent greatsword, demon's greataxe) have been removed.+Pyromancy damage is now dependent (to a moderate degree) on Intelligence and Faith, so it's no longer the near-build-independent ability that it was in DS1.+Stats have been reworked, and there are no longer any stats that you'll probably never invest in. (Hello, Resistance from DS1.)+DS2's NPCs' characters, and sometimes backstories, are more ""filled out"" than those in DS1. The voice acting is also a bit better. (There are a few characters to whom you actually develop some attachment.)+Fast travel is available between all bonfires that you've visisted starting at the beginning of the game. I'm a bit conflicted about this. Walking everywhere before I had the Lordvessel let me take in the environments in DS1, but eventually I hated having to walk back and forth between distant areas more than a few times. DS2's world is a bit bigger than DS1's, so the fast travel becomes a bit more important; as a result, I'll call this a positive.+Matching with other players (for assistance or PvP) in NG has changed and is now based on total souls used; this is to prevent low-level but heavily-equipped players from destroying people who are equipped with level-appropriate gear. In NG+, this system gets deactivated.Negatives (of DS2 relative to DS1):-DS2 is somewhat less difficult than DS1. For those who dropped DS1 because it was too difficult, this will be a good thing; for those who relished the more difficult sections of DS1 and the sense of victory after completing them, don't expect that feeling to be quite as strong or to manifest itself quite as often. I consider this a net negative since most people familiar enough with DS1 to use it as a frame of reference probably mostly fall into the latter category.-DS1 bosses are, overall, more interesting. Many of the DS2 bosses are large humanoids - though only a few are as simple as fighting a more-difficult regular enemy. There are few bosses on the creative level of, say, the Gaping Dragon, the Centipede Demon, or Smough & Ornstein.-Pure Dexterity builds are not particularly viable in DS2. Quality builds (mixed Str/Dex) are still viable - now also because they tend to be effective builds for focusing on power stancing.-Enemies will only respawn (after killing them, then resting at a bonfire) ~10-15 times. After that, if you want to farm those same enemies, you have to use an item which will effectively put the region associated with that bonfire into NG+ difficulty. (When you go into actual NG+, any regions where you have used that item will be increased again in enemy difficulty, e.g. to NG++.) This can be repeated multiple times at each bonfire during the same playthrough. If you're farming rare-drop items, this can get particularly annoying. (On the upside, many treasures respawn by going through this process, so it becomes pretty easy to farm rare matierals this way.)-DS2's environment is prettier than DS1's, but it's also less bleak and dreary. Part of why it feels this way is probably because the human population of Drangleic (DS2's kingdom) is higher - and less likely to go hollow mid-game - than the population of Lordran. Regardless of the reason, you never get quite the same feeling of dread in DS2 as when you enter Blighttown for the first time or when you enter Sen's Fortress for the umpteenth time.Overall, I recommend DS2 to Souls series veterans as well as new players. For the experienced, there's plenty of fun to be had in DS2, even if there aren't as many moments of temporarily overwhelming difficulty followed by an extreme sense of accomplishment as there were in DS1. For new players who aren't quite as enamored of the difficulty level that the Souls series seems to embrace, DS2 may be the best entry point for the series."

76561198230515804,Recommended,236430,28933653,Posted: 2 January,all,Forekus,"Even after Dark Souls III has come out, I still come back to this gem for a good time.Why?Thereplay valueand thePvP.Dark Souls II is by far my favourite in the entire franchise. I've never played these games for the challenge, I play them for the skill-based combat system and the interesting dark fantasy setting, and this game has by far my favourite combat. Everything just seems so balanced and the combat really rewards skilled players. This means that, unlike DS3, the PvP is actually good, and skilled players, actually get rewarded, and bad players will actually get punished (unlike the R1 spammable weapons and rolls of DS3). In my opinion, this game shines in PvP for many reasons (this is in contrast to DS3), such as: arenas, better rewards, build variety, animation cancels, backstepping that works, more skill-based combat, and actually not♥♥♥♥♥♥invasions. Now there are a plethora of other issues with DS3's PvP, but I won't get into that.Moving over to the PvE section of this game, sure, the bosses are fun and all, but once you memorize all of their attacks, the game becomes way too easy. I will admit, that this game does have the weakest boss design of all the souls games. So why do I keep replaying DS2's PvE portion, over and over? Well, this game has probably the most diverse build-type possibilities in any souls game (imo), since unlike DS1 and DS3, everything seems way more balanced (and, unlike DS3, actually has a poise system). There's also Power Stancing to boot. I also like the way you are rewarded for certain feats in this game, such as the Illusionary Rings and the actual rewards in the arena (unlike DS3). This is in addition to the fact that this game has many systems in place, that punish you for mistakes, making this game way more punishing than the other games, both in PvE and in PvP, or at least in my opinion.Now many have stated, that the level design and boss design in this game are subpar when compared to the others. And yes, as stated earlier, I do admit that they are probably right in this aspect. However, I will say that DS1's later levels were rather flawed, and didn't hold up like the rest of the game, unlike this game. DS3 is way too linear, and in my opinion, way too easy, thereby hindering it's replayability. And I haven't even mentioned this game's DLC yet. DS2 has some of the best DLC of any game I have ever played. The Sunken King DLC has great level design, the Iron King DLC has pretty spectacular bosses and the Ivory King DLC has an amazing sense of scale. All of DS2's DLC is memorable and worth replaying. Another one of the better features of this game, is the way NG+ works. Sure, bonfire ascetics are a neat addition, that let you go into NG+ for farming and other reasons. However, NG+ as a whole, is far more satisfying than in the other games. While yes, bosses and all the enemies are given additional health and deal more damage; unlike the other games, red phantom versions of enemies are also scattered throughout the game, which make it more challenging and engaging. Then, in addition to this, certain bosses also drop additional souls, that allow you to craft new weapons, which are unobtainable in NG.This all plays back to the replayability of this game, which this game has a lot of. Now while the game also adds Soul Vessels, which allow you to respec your character, and the game shoves more than enough titanite down your throat (thereby defeating the purpose of replaying the game), I still find the PvE engaging enough, that I enjoy replaying it, and the more diverse builds possible, only add to that.I have bought this game like 3 times now (Xbox 360, regular edition on PC and SOFTS on PC), and I don't regret a single purchase. Now, Steam says I only have like 90 hours on record, but I have had at least 500 hours spent in it by now. Why were so many hours spent offline? Well, that's because I enjoy messing around with this game's PvE in offline mode (or maybe that's just because my school blocks Steam).So, to conclude me rambling on about this game, I will say that I love this game. I have many fond memories of it, and it will probably remain one of my most favourite games of all time. It has the best PvP in the whole souls franchise, and its PvE is great too. Now I won't say this is a perfect game, but I would recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone looking for a fun game, with an awesome combat system and a solid PvP foundation. I will also say that this is a great entry-point to the souls franchise, since this game has a pretty solid tutorial area, unlike the other games. I also feel like this game is easier to get into, since it's typically an easier game, when compared to DS1 (although DS3 is probably easier)."

You enter the new area, defeat 5-8 enemies average and then a bonfire, except for very rare parts of the game.The most important part of the game, weapons, is ruined. There is one moveset that is the same for every weapon of this type, so if really counting how much weapons there are we then we will come from, for example, 100 to 5.Whips backstab and riposte. I don`t even want to talk about it, just watch it on youtube. R.I.P. all whip users.Netcode, connection and dedicatedserver.mp4. If you played the game then you know what I`m saying. In other case, watch thishttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccB6OsRJ-ME.They said no DLC`s. And guess what I saw today at the Steam news? I think you know what.Poise does nothing in PVP (poise is the stat that determines how much damage you can take straight in your face (no blocking) before getting staggered or stun-locked. Therefore, if you wear armor with the highest physical defence you can be still stunlocked by the broken sword.Fromsoft does more work on DLCs then on patches.Demon Souls - true RPG with good story and characters. Absolutely incredible boss battles and levels.Dark Souls: Prepare to die edition with DSfix - as good as Demon Souls in terms of RP, story and characters. More armor and weapons with cool movesets and appearance, in this one DS1 just destroys Demon Souls. Covenants, their badass leaders and unique rewards for being a loyal member of them. Better upgrade system that had a lot of logic and didn`t require farming.Dark Souls 2 - more action, less RP. Almost no memmorable bosses, awful level and enemies design. So many bad things that I won`t be able to fit in this review.If you played the first Dark Souls and you have a good connection with other players there than don`t buy DS2, I`m 100% sure that you will just waste your money and, worse, incourage them to make more bad games."

I prefer to experience failure in RL and not in a game.  The game, just like the first one, is HARD.  The combat system is terrible.  There is no targeting system (PC). Combat is extremely clunky and slow.  All the enemies will kill you quickly.  And yes, I understand that this is all by design.  But, while I prefer a harder gaming experience, I don't like to be growling halfway through the training dungeon.  Additionally, despite it taking very little effort to port the controls over to a PC from a console, this game joins the list of games (which includes the first one) that didn't take any time to port the controls.  It's not as simple as remapping keys.  The keyboard + mouse is a lot different than the gamepad.  It's so lazy when game designers don't take the small amount of time to do this and just try to maximize profits by allowing to players to remap keys and calling it a ""PC game.""

The story is absolutely terrible and messy, and often doesn't make much sense. But the worst part of this game is the down right horrible enemy desing. For exmaple Drakekeepers with the great hammer seems to have unlimited stamina, and they swing the hammer like a helicopter, good luck with all the melee characters. That's just plain unfair to favor range characters like that. Another flaw with the desing is that enemies almost always comes in pairs, two huge enemies comming at you at the same time is just terrible design, all you have to do is to hope that both of them attack at the same time so you can maybe get one hit without being overrunned and losing about 90% of your health. Goodl luck with all the melee characters.On the positive side the game runs much smoother than previous Souls game and the graphics are great too. Still with it's flaws it's better than most of the games that came out this year. With just a few tweeks this game would have been superior to the previous games.

I woud recommend it to anyone who loves Melee combat games and RPG's where you are not hand holded. I played it on the XBOX 360 and beat it... but my 360 died the next day.So I purchased the PC version and it is so much better than the Console versions.  Looks good, smooth gameplay, and the multiplayer connection problems were a ton better than the 360 version.  After 60 hours in the PC version - I beat it three times and got 100% Acheivements.If you have never played Dark Souls or Demon Souls.  Dark Soulss 2 is a third person view fantasy world/combat game that allows for precise melee combat and range magic/bows.  The combat can be awkward but rewarding once you figure it out.  It has RPG Elements of stat points as you level and armor/weapons to collect and enhance their strength.The multiplayer is unlike any other game series.  People can invade your single player game to try and kill you... or you can summon them for a level/boss fight - but they disappear back to their world after the fight.  If you kill a bunch of good guy NPC's, then people can invade your world to kill you as revenge.  There is also areas for PVP that allow a que up process or hang out in an area to be attacked/invaded.This game has a ton of bosses - 20+ and a lot of different areas to explore.  The First play through will likely take 30-40 hours but the second play through will take about 10-15 because you get to keep all your gear/levels.  By my third play through I did it under 7 or 8 hours.Technically the game is still quite hard if you never played a ""Souls"", but not as hard as Dark Souls 1.  That is only because I find that Dark Souls 2 is more fair than Dark Souls 1 because part one had a lot of spots that were cheap deaths or the poor direction.  Dark Souls 2 fixed these so it is more accessible for people who hate games that kill hem over and over, but you'll still die a lot in this game because they increased the combat difficulty for normal monsters by increasing the volume of them and bosses.Not as rewarding as other souls games when you beat a tough boss, but still a great game and better made than the previous two technically but not as easily adored as the previous two souls games.Totally worth it and an awesome game.  If you watch a video and the combat looks fun or you want a good RPG game with responsive/precise combat where your skills = in game skills - then buy it and play it.  You'll yell at it and get angry, but you'll want to continue to play!"

I mean anyone who has eyes , hands , and a head with something in it can easily play past this , as long as he has those mentioned up.It is tho a game people with high steadfastness will find even easier , as it hides much riddles , traps or even locations for the player to discover and probably raze to the ground .Online features include bloodstains which ofc make most of us laugh to death when seeing how those people die .I think it is those same people who say DS II is such a hard game .It also includes Messages written on the ground , either helpful either funny that make DS II a less ... Depressing ... game.Invasions on guys with Signs of Spite in INV can also be done by people in a specific Covenant , the blue Sentinels.Or even you can join the Blood Brotherhood and attack helpless guys like that.Every boss is easy to pass only if you have a comrade or two to help you , really .The only boss i managed finishing by my own was the Double Sentry and Magus.In other words everyone must play cooperatively .Generally the only bad thing is that you will sometime finish the game like i did only after 20 something hours and then you will quit it just like most of us did . Others get burnt on it and even play  it till today , tho .Altho it is a time when most people speak of DS III  , DS II is still a good and worthy game ,something depending on one's personality , tho .That plus another con , the fact that if you do only 1 WRONG move you will have to start the whole game again.For example kill someone like the Emerald herald and you're toast.Or kill the smith and you will be blocked from achieving anything.you can revive those guys in Graves ofc but still you have to offer a terrific amount of souls each time."

,Not Recommended,236430,14576857,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,Orglebrash Devourer of Kittens,"First off, this is not Dark Souls 1.  It was made by a different team, and should in no way be considered a sequel.  The name in and of itself is a lie, and leads to false expectations.  However, it is named as a sequel, so comparisons to Dark Souls 1 must be expected and accepted.  Moving on.The game is a good game, that can't be denied.  I wish steam gave the option to call it a ""neutral"" opinion, because that most reflects what mine is.  As it is, I'll be posting it as a negative review.  Let me just lay out my thoughts on the game.Pros (not many):-Jump button can be bound to left thumbstick.  Thank god.-Left handed weapons are actually useable.-Larger variety in armor.-Connecting is fast and simple.Cons(a lot):-Movement on controllers at least feels very 8-directional.  Unlike DS1, where it had a very 360 degrees feel to it.-Rolling is now a stat.  Rolling.  A stat.  Now you have to buy your i-frames?  I don't have much issue with it because I just kill dragonrider first and get 20 adp, but still it feels like a completely unnecessary addition to the mix.-There are far too many stats.  It feels like they wanted to make it different than the other games in the souls ""series"" and they succeeded at that.  However, for that difference we are stuck with a confusing mess of numbers and modifiers.-There is no poise system.  To be fair, poise shouldn't have been implemented in ds1, but they tried to keep some movesets and that led to some stunlocking that just feels frustrating and loose.-Endurance is almost nonexistent.  In DS1 and Demon's, endurance feels like it's actually realistic.  In this game, it just feels like my guy can't run more than 15 feet without needing a break.-Enemies feel like they've just been dumped into random places.   In Dark and Demon's, enemy placement was strategic.  The games were difficult not because a lot of enemies, but because the enemies were well-placed.  This game just puts piles of them against you as if it were trying to be God of War.-Pvp latancy is absurd.  I have a good connection, roughly 20 ping.  However, I consistently get hit from 5-10 feet away.  Hit registration needs to be fixed.-The art style feels like a huge downgrade from Dark Souls 1.  Sure, the game runs great on my laptop.  But I'd rather run steady 30fps instead of 45 and actually have more detail in the game.-Boss AI is awful.  You expect an upgrade from game to game, but the ai seems the same as DS1.  No improvements made, limited set of actions, very predictable.-A lot of recycled content.  To be fair, Dark Souls 1 had the same issue with many of the bosses being the same as Demon's (Asylum Demon and Bed of Chaos I'm looking at you).  Dark Souls 2 is no different, taking bosses from Dark Souls 1 (Sif 2.0) and Demon's Souls (Dragons, everyone?)-Soul Memory.  God, Soul Memory.  I understand why it was implemented, to stop twinking, but at least take it out in NG+ so I don't have to fight max levels all the time?All in all, DS2 was a dissappointment.

76561198095648143,Recommended,236430,10456568,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,Daedric DeathBlazer,"Ok so i have put about 150 hours into this and now i really think that i have the right to judge the game now after completeing it 3 times with three different builds. So first let me just get this out of the way and say that i love good graphics and particle effects but i am by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ infact if the game was fun or challenging enough I would not care about the graphics at all. Some examples of these would have to be cell shaded games and old very well done games like Morrowind/Oblivion and GTA 1,2,3 and 4 which are very old games but hold up because they either have a great story or extreamley fun gameplay. Ok if you just want to know how good the gameplay is compared to Dark Souls 1  well comared to Dark Souls 1 the gameplay is pretty much improved ALOT but there are a few annoying things about a few animations in the game. My first problem is with one animation inperticular the Estus Flask animation (if this is your first souls games the Estus Flask is what heals you in emergencyes) i have done some testing with the Estus Flask animations compareing the animations from Dark Souls1 and Dark Souls 2. And what i found is that the origonal animation from DKS1 takes about 2 seconds but in DKS2 it takes double the time which is extemley annoying on the fact that in my opinion the game playes better than DKS1 and runs at 60fps on PC which in my opinion makes the gameplay alot faster. My big problem with this is that it feels like the Fromsoftware just said ""Oh we got rid of the lighting engine to make the game easier for beginners but we need to make it harder oh i know make the Estus Flask animation take 3 years"".And my other problem is a very mlinor one but when you fat roll it looks really wierd and when you fat roll you really don't feel that weight or impact like you did in DKS1 were it had a loud noise so when you hit the ground it and your amor would make metal clanging noises as you move.So now instead of feeling like felling like a heavily armored badass i just feel straight up slow.And my last problem with the animations would have to be the animations that were removed from the game that would happen if you didn't have the reqired strength for a weapon you would try to hit and it would look pretty funny actually and you would go to swing and your guy would look like he was to weak to wield it.And since im already just listing the bad things lets just get them all out of the way first.So i have played the game alot and i can tell you that even know im not overleveled at some parts some of the bosses are absolute pushovers and the ones that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was (      S  P   O   I    L   E  R   A  L  E  R  T  !!!!!!!!        ) The Old Dragon Slayer and the Guardian Dragon they both are some of the coolest bosses in the game and they are soooooo pain stakingly easy i beat the Old Dragon Slayer on my second try and i beat the Guardian Dragon on my first try that is just stupid it was the Gaping Dragon from DKS1 all over again but what worries me is that there are more in this game than DKS1. And few  of the areas arn't as interesting and as cool as the ones in DKS1 one shining example of this is the place with the windmill sure its neat but it seems to me like just the generic Poison area a d Iron Keep seemed like the generic Fire area. And to wrap up the bad things let me just say this to Fromsoftware Don't bait and switch us with the graphics an lighting i really only play souls games for the gameplay and the atomshere but i liked the way that it looked in beta how it was really dark and desaturated with crazy partical effects and a hint of purple to it in the lock on redicle and the bosses health bars.Ok so with all of the bad things out of the way what does this game do good? Do the pros outweigh the cons. And if you want to know if the game is worth buting my svery short answer would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥YES. The games pros backstab the cons and kicks them into the Smelter Demon. The game is not restricted anymore by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ windows live and isn't capped at 30FPS any more and the Pc port has been MAJORLY improved compared to DKS1 that had an absolute discrace of a port. Dark Souls 2 looks REALLY GOOD on PC even without the lighting enging and exteme partical effexts shown off in the beta. I think this port compared to the DKS1 port is superb! Now lets talk about the areas that i LOVE for example the Shaded wood are really cool it is a forest in the game shrouded in mist and you can hardly see anything in front of you and in there are screaming trees and complete invisable ghosts that attack you. I also love Iron Keep despite what i said about it above i just wish that they did something unique with it like mad the whole thing under lava the metal that was heated damaged you when you walk on it because its to hot and there would be like cool spots and some parts were like flooded with lava and you would have to like drain it or find an alternitive path like the Clockwork city from Morrowing or something like that it would have been neat. But its still a really cool place with some awsome bosses like the Smelter Demon and one of the 4 lord lord souls which I WILL NOT SPOIL FOR YOU but its really cool. I also liked how unlike the first games the cloth on your armor like blow in the wind and move around and are dynamic its really cool. I also really LOVE how there is a ring in the game that makes it 10x easier to connect to your friends than in DKS1. And believe it or not i like how the fall damage isn't as riducules in DKS2 as where in DKS1 you could fall from like the top of the empire states building just take an Estus Flask and be fine and in this one its ALOT more reasonable.This is controversial but i actualy really like how you have less invincibility frames when you roll in DKS2 but you can improve them by upgrading your adaptability wich in my opinion is really cool. I also like the new dual wielding system that they have i have beat the game once as a dual wielder and i recentley started a fith game as a dual wielder again because i find it REALLY fun and challenging to do and i think that its really cool that you can power wield two swords of the same type a example would be a shortsword and a long sword which are both straight swords so even know they arn'r EXACTLEY the same you can still power wield them if you have at least 1.5x the requirements of each weapon. I also did a magic playthrough as one of my three and while a bit over powered the hexes look prett ♥♥♥♥ing awsome and just saying fyi a hex is like dark magic in the game. Speaking of spells if you liked the spells from DKS1 you will love it here they have the same spells and more.And there is also new types of damages to enchant like darkness and mundane even know im not sure what exactly mundane does.There is also less types of titinite in the game because it helped to simplify smithing and i was pretty ok with it. And all of the enemey have pretty good A.i I would say its a spet up from DKS1 but there is a really annoying proximity problem when if you just run around a corner they are out of there proximity and they just run back to there spawing location unlike the ones in DKS1 which were actually pretty unrelenting to say the least but it is a minor complaint hardly worth mentioning and could easily be fixed by a patch of some sorts. I also admire the shere varietey of enemeys in the game and on that i commend Fromsoftware. And the game is modable and don't listen to the people who say you will get VAC banned because you won't when you connect to another player steam scans your game files and searches for knows cheat items sit back and thinks about it how dumb would it be if they just VAC banned you because you accidently got like a word document in there or something in your folder so go ahead and mod. Dark Souls 2 is a GREAT game but it is a TERRIBLE sequal.I would have to give Dark Souls 2 a 8/10"

,Recommended,236430,11310587,"Posted: 18 July, 2014",all,TheStealthyMonk,"Dark souls 2 was released in PAL region on the 14th march 2014. Made by “From Software” and published by “From Software” and “Namco Bandai Games”. The long waited sequel has hit shelves with focus selling 1.2 million copies on release. Keeping to it same genre “action roleplaying” the game includes features such as single player and online multiplayer which combine together to create a game which can change to a multiplayer at any time.Since the success of dark souls “From Software” have been working to create their worst nightmares into dark souls 2. Harder bosses, more choses, PVP and ever thing to threaten the player to insure that once he/she has conceded that area he/she can feel rewarded.New features include new bosses, weapons, spells, item, armour and rings. This is so the customisation options are endless, for example duel wield great swords and enchant them with powerful spells or using nothing but your fist to KO all that stand in your path.They have also made the start of the game more friendly to newcomer of the game because “SPOILER” in dark souls begging you were put right into a boss fight with that many clear intrusions but in this game there is a full tutorials area which is completely optional so that the player that need to learn the game more can.I have complete both dark souls 1 and 2 and both have their ups and downs, but the one I most enjoyed was dark souls 2. This is because in dark souls, once you completed the game once it was quite dull going thought it again with the same set because that was the point I focused in meaning I can’t change to any class because I don’t have the requirements, but in dark souls 2 you can find “soul vessels” which if given to a satin person they will reset your points (not level) meaning I could play a fighter in one play though and then a mage in the other.Now onto the bad points about dark souls 2. First the severs are not the best at the moment meaning that the hit boxes in PVP can sometime be incorrect and mess you up. Also some bosses where copied over in late game in PVE and for me a boss should be a unique encounter which only happens once.To sum up I think dark souls 2 is a great game to pick up and I would recommend this game to hard-core gamers and medieval fans or player who enjoy challenges with up to 2 friends.Rating 4/5-1 point because of the sever lag and the copying of bosses"

,Not Recommended,236430,10193873,"Posted: 21 May, 2014",all,Zealot,"What a journey it's been through the souls universe. Having my first taste with the Dark Souls PC port, and even purchasing a PS3 to play exclusives with Demon's Souls on the list, I was hyped for Dark Souls 2 and thought ""What could go wrong?""Well, unfortunately... Quite a bit. This isn't to say the game is a complete wash, as I still had fun and would recommend playing it to fans of the series, but I wouldn't say it's worth the full sale price. My main gripes with this game in particular mostly comes down to gameplay mechanics and level design. Levels this time around with a few exceptions felt very bland and uneventful. It felt like one place suddenly went into the next completely unrelated area. Take Earthen Peak for instance - a huge tower esque structure surrounded by poison which somehow after you take an elevator even further upward from the top, you find yourself in the Iron Keep. Iron Keep is a fortress surrounded and filled with lava. Invisible, floating lava sky fortress? I think not. A lot of parts in the game just collided with one another, no particular blending in any way. This killed a lot of the immersion for me, as you don't suddenly go from one extreme to another without some sort of buffer zone in between - unless you're playing Dark Souls 2. The art style was nice overall, and I did find myself enjoying the scenery rather frequently (enhanced moreso with an ENB shader mod and SweetFX).Gameplay has the same general feel as the previous souls games, with noticeable improvements to AI. This would seem great, as the original in most cases required a sidestep and backstab to cheese your way through opponents, except this time around attacks track your movements while your opponent spins like some type of turret to face you, no matter where you move. Ultimately this leads to some frustrating deaths along with seeing your physical character well out of the way of an attack, but still being hit by it despite the fact it should have been impossible (Looking at you, Rat King). I found bosses to be very lackluster this time around, and in most cases I couldn't give half a♥♥♥♥♥♥about who or what I was fighting - especially when the actual fights themselves ended up being an absolute joke most of the time. Save for the Old Dragonslayer, Smelter Demon, and Nashandra - most fights in the game were a pushover. Worse so - a number of fights involve multiple enemies or bosses in order to increase the difficulty and seemingly cover up the fact that the fight was terribly designed from the start. Most enemies copy a similar tactic and instead of being a well designed and clever foe, they simply swarm you with 2 or 3 at a time to add 'difficulty' where there otherwise wouldn't be. It's okay for a while, but towards the end it just starts to feel like poor design.All in all, I had an okay time with this game. It's fun, and for fans of the series it'll likely be a must play - but it's nothing close to what I'd hoped for. The port to PC was handled much better this time around and the options are plenty, but the overall lasting appeal of this game really pales in comparison. I've barely managed 40 hours on this game, whereas I got at least 70 on a single play through of the original. Chalk it up to me having been more experienced after playing Demon's Souls and Dark Souls perhaps, but I expected more from this game. Those of us with experience in this series expected a challenge and better design, as we had two games previously to learn from, and it wasn't really delivered."

I guess being a power-user with a trimmed/optimized OS has its perks :PAlso, PLAY USING A GAMEPAD. FROMsoftware doesn't know what a mouse and keyboard are, so just don't bother with them. Seriously, get a gamepad, they're dirt cheap on amazon. If you don't, and decide to use K+M, you'll look like an idiot when you start complaining about the controls. Get a gamepad, don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ All the talk about ""THEY PROMISED GOOD CONTROLS *hyperventilating*"" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The absolute majority of their dev work on the PC version went into graphical tech and engine stability. Again, the devs don't know what a keyboard and mouse is, stop crying.ACTUAL REVIEW PART:The visuals are amazing. Not crysis 3 good, but very well done. You'll be sucked in instantly. The lighting is very good (albeit dated tech). Shadows add to the bleak and melancholy theme of the world. Textures are sharp and detailed. Animation is fantastic; everything flows together to make the characters more natural (and at times, unnatural).Sound design is nothing short of masterful. The music dims out during times of peaceful respite or when you're deep in a dungeon. It really helps sell the ""I could get murdered at any second by something from any direction"" feel of the game. This system really shines during boss fights, where the music hightens into a symphony of desperation once a boss is near death. You really FEEL your struggle, and this makes victory feel even better.Gameplay-wise, it's a *souls game. The recipe has been refined and moulded with bits and pieces added or removed, but at its core it's still a *souls game. This is a good thing. The UI has been significantly improved. Menus are quick (sometimes too quick), there's no hiccups when you're blasting through your inventory trying to equip another weapon in place of your broken one while a group of undead are rushing at you. Oh yes, there's no pausing; better find a bonfire. Combat is fast paced, but methodical and strategic just like the previous games. The various subsystems (e.g. magic, upgrading, durability, fast travel, leveling up, etc) have been redesigned. Things are more straight-forward and it helps alleviate the notorious learning curve that this series has.Even if you haven't played the previous games, you should play this one. If you're a fan of dark fantasy and love a good challenge, this is it. Just get a ♥♥♥♥ing gamepad."

PvE mechanics, Storytelling, and Single Player in general are notably worse, even in ways that they should  not. It seems everything was sacrificed for a better online experience, but online isn't much better. Matchmaking is easier, but you are constantly invadable. Netcode has been praised, but I have not seen much if any improvements (20 MB/s connection, still getting ghost hits, and backstabs). Balance is centered around NG+ now, and many of the spells used in PvP result in one-hit kills even against players who push health and resistances to its upper limits.Singleplayer needs specific mentioning because of how painful it is. The story is heavy-handed, transparent, and unusually self-aware. Many bosses are copied in part or whole from Dark Souls almoast shamelessly and without innovation. Enemies in general have less attack variety, and rely more heavily on ""record player tracking"" and hitboxes that extend well away from their weapons. Rolling has been crippled, along with player weapon damage, but rolling is faster for most weight levels. The end result is the game forcing you to use a heavy shield and a reach weapon. Furthermore dexterity-based weapons have less durability now, with most weapons having durablility comparable to Crystal weapons from Dark Souls 1. Dexterity weapons typically have 20-60% the durability of their strength-based counterparts. You must have multiple backup weapons to fight enemies to the next area, or run past many of the encounters to prevent breakage.Maybe the game will recieve a patch to make the singleplayer more enjoyable, and perhaps multiplayer will recieve significant rebalancing, but I can not enjoy the game as it is right now."

You can make your own build and play very diffrent using diffrent melee weapons, crossbows/bows, diffrent types of magic, armour, rings that give you perks,  and skills that change your character a lot, making your player able to wear super heavy armour, good with magic, fast, have lots of health or endurence, there is even  diffrent skills for diffrent magic. Once you beat the game you can replay it again with the same character but with new monsters and becomes harder giving much more replayability.Coop: Getting your butt kicked? Find a white or orange summon sign to summon players to help you in the area you're in or with bosses for some jolly co-operation  (Only works when you're not a zombie, use a human effigie to become human again). Not a human and need to summon someone to help you? simple, place down your white summon sign and help someone else fight the boss, defeating bosses in other players worlds makes you human and also gives you souls (souls are the currency in Dark Souls). Do have good internet or have no internet while playing? there is also NPCs that can help you at a lot of the bossesPVP: Oh boy, some people may dislike this but I for one think this is a great idea for video games and it works, there is diffrent ways to do PVP in this, but the most cool and interesting idea is the ""Invading"", Invading is when a player uses and item to join your world (Invades you) and has to go hunt you down. Don't like people coming into your world and being able to kill you? IT'S DARK SOULS, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HARD. another way to PVP is to join a covenant where you must deffend an area from other players, or a convenant that allows you to duel in a arena with other players in the covenant. Dark Souls does a decent job of setting you up to fight players around your lvl and skills, theres a thing called Soul Memory that matches you up against people who have gotten around as much souls as you, I dislike this though and prefer how Dark Souls 1 did it.Dark Souls VS Dark souls 2: I have not gotten that far in Dark Souls so far, but I'm in far enough to truly understand whats better in both of them, I like the matching players systems  more in the first game, but nobody plays the coop much in the first game for some reason so find friends. The atomsphere in the 2nd game is better in my opinion, its more prettier, some people might like the sad look of the first game though. Another propblem is there is no Solaire to be summoned in Dark Souls 2, so I can't have the true jollly co-operation experience in it. The 2nd game is easier, but can is still be hard as hell. All in all I think they're both great games, I think the 2nd is better though, please do not beat me for saying that, plz."

I like the Souls games - tense and terrifying but something about the game keeps making me come back for it again and again. I recall the first time I picked up the PS3 version of Demons Souls in Gamespot on a whim about a week after it was released. After the first part where I died in the long walkway before Phalanx and then repeatedly died trying to kill the boulder rolling guys and other Silver Knights, I realized this game was different.And after DS and DS2, I think I am glad I got to play these games. Highly recommended. Bizarre bosses and carefully designed levels to make you squirm and squeal in anger first and then delight, it is a bootcamp of a game. Carefully chiseling away at your anger and replacing that with discipline as you reapproach an area armed with the foreknowledge of your defeat before and adjusting your strategy, each kill then becomes more engaging and rewarding.A must experience game IMO.9.75/10"

Back to the game itself, the graphics are an even major improvement and the game has a more friendly feel to it compared to the first installment.

Much superior graphics to the original, although graphics were never a big deal to begin with in this game. New stats means more places to put your points which means more thinking is required to make your build for pvp. If you only pve you can play endlessly till you get 99 in everything if you wanted to. Overall the game is good and definitely worth trying.There are downsides though. One is that pve is way better than pvp currently (as of 6-5-14). Magic has become very overpowered, quality builds are non-existent in dark souls 2 (no one would go 40 str 40 dex in this version of dark souls). Elemental weapons +10 do more dmg than A/S rank scaling weapons at +10 with 40 into the required main dmg stat (str or dex, or both). Players can buff themselves multiple times over, stacking iron skin, numbness, and many others making you basically have god mode. Likewise I don't see dex as being a viable stat to use at all, even if the stat boosts your ability to inflict status ailments (in pvp this is negligable since players can 1 or 2 hit any one or give up because the enemy stacked many buffs)Besides PVP another issue is soul memmory. Every single soul you get is recorded, and your ability to be matched up with other players is based on your soul memmory. Your soul memmory could be 1 million and anothers also 1 million. The problem with this is that you could be only soul level 80 while the other player is soul level 120 and you have to pvp some one who from the start is already superior than yourself. On top of this they could also have better gear, at which point you should just give up. This makes PVP unfair as you may not get the chance to ever fight some one on equal grounds as yourself. Without this there is no point in PVP at all. (granted some skill is involved, but a hit from a low level without a +10 weapon is nothing compared to a high level with a +10 weapon. A high level would have to suck really bad to lose to an undergeared player)"

The main problem with the game is the PVP.  On your first playthrough, there are only a couple of locations where other players can ""invade"" your world and fight you, but afterwards you can be invaded almost anywhere at any time.  This is extremely obnoxious because you can't step away from your computer for a couple minutes, nor can you expect you go out exploring and take your time through an area because there will be always be someone if not multiple someones that you'll have to fight to survive, even when you're not in the mood for PVP.  I understand you can go offline to avoid PVP invasions, but it's not worth the effort to me, I'd rather the game build in more acceptable ways to avoid it.  I actually really like the way PVP works in the game, but it needs to have a simple on/off switch, as a result, in its current state I can't recommend the game."

To me, it was just never quite as good as the first Dark Souls was. Laggy netcode, poorly balanced weaponry, and a meta of max level due to the asinine Soul Memory system really have just dissuaded me from every playing this again.In addition, the main criticsm I have of Dark Souls II is that From Software did not fully understand what made Dark Souls so special in the first place. Dark Souls was not a hard game, it was incredibly fair to you yet punishing if you continuously make mistakes. Dark Souls II is a hard game, but not for the right reasons. The majority of the ""difficulty"" came from throwing a horde of enemies at you at once. Bosses were not well designed and either brutally difficult or laughably easy. The only boss fight which I really loved in this was Sir Alonne because he was one of the few bosses that had a very well designed moveset.I'd like to point out that I think that Dark Souls II is an 'alright' game, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor, Dark Souls."

This game -will- kick you in the teeth over and over your first run through. Now, if you have an adaptive personality this game shouldn't be too difficult as, like I said, it's a huge learning curve. With all that being said, this game is INCREDIBLE...PvE wise. The Souls series is mainly a ""Boss-by-Boss"" type of game, meaning the main attraction to most people are the difficult boss fights. But in Dark Souls 2, the boss fights are a lot of fun, ranging from extremely challenging to♥♥♥♥♥♥easy. Normal mobs in this game are a bit different, as I will let you make up your own strategies on how to deal with them. With PvE aside, now on to PvP. My -least- favourite part of this game, and the -biggest- con in my opinion. Now...when I say Player versus Player, I mean arena-wise and I mean serious matches to either win or have fun, not ""Troll-Fights"" where the opponent or you is doing some gimmick to tease the other player. So let me say this: PvP is broken. Almost completely. Sure they are players who ""limit"" themselves, (I.E. staying at a certain Soul Level) but most people will want to keep going. Which mean that person's stats are going to be HUGE. Which goes into their DMG, and can be utterly pointless for you to even queue  for pvp. If you have high skill at this game or adept at dodging you shouldn't have too much of a problem. That being said many people don't go into the route of ""making builds"" rather than using a certain spam weapon. I'll let you find out and form your own -opinion- of what is or what isn't overpowered.All that aside I UTTERLY and COMPLETELY recommend this game. 9/10! Great PvE & PvP even if PvP can be a bit frustrating sometimes."

In oblivion and morrowind your character had traits (strebgth, wisdom, enduranse that sorta thing) and everytime you leveled up you would adjust your traits(depending on your play style will recieve more e.g. heavy melee will recieve more points to apply to a trait/stat that affected melee directly) and with this your stats (HP, Stam and Magicka) would adjust according giving you a number of health, stamina and magicka based on points in your character sheet.

More Dark Souls is good.The Bad:- Soul Memory - A mechanic in which every soul you have ever gained is counted up, and is the only factor in connecting online - sounds good on paper, but in practice, cheating players can be SL500 and mod their soul memory to 0 abd invade anyone, and a player that limits their character to SL100 for PvP will be punished for playing their character longer and not levelling.- Boss design - There are few bosses in this game on the same level as Ornstein and Smough, Artorias, Kalameet, etc - a lot of bosses are just dudes with swords, which are alright but it gets somewhat repetitive.- No Patches.The Ugly:- Keyboard controls are pretty terribad still.- If you have a VAC ban from any game on Steam you will be unable to play online - they are supposedly looking into this but it puts a damper on it when people have VAC bans from Modern Warfare 2 where cheaters leveled you up to max level without you being able to stop it.It's good though. 8/8, it's pretty gr8 m8.

A lot may have changed, I will update once I play it.I certainly enjoyed this game a lot, a real lot. It was improved over the original (Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition, namely) in every single way. However there were a few key differences that I did not enjoy, and some things that I just flat out preferred in the original over the sequel, not because it was better in the original, but because thats what I just flat out prefer.PROS:+ Mechanics improved+ Stat mangement made significantly more interesting, stats are no longer black and white.+ PvP is MUCH improved.+ The game performs SIGNIFICANTLY better than the original.CONS:- Weapons variety and reasonabiliy of options seems lessened over the original, despite entirely new categories of weapons being introduced.- PvP lag is significant during invasions, I don't know why but half the time I get ""lag killed"" (hit out of range, die randomly from an attack I haven't experienced yet).- It seems significantly easier to level up, which almost becomes a secondary concern until VERY late in the game (beyond level 120). Leveling requirements don't seem to require souls along what seemed to be an almost exponential scale anymore, and following scaling much closer to a linear increase of requirements. While this is NOT a true negative, it removes some of the sense of accomplishment you get from leveling up (it becomes almost trivial).OF NOTE:> The game can be played on an even higher difficulty level, see the Victory stone in the wiki.> My Dark Souls PTDE armor set (custom armor configuration) is one of my all time favorites, I was not able to find an equivalently enjoyable set in DS2, which makes me more BIASED towards DS1 slightly. However, the plot was what sealed the deal in terms of which game I prefer.*SPOILER ALERT*- Because the story builds off the original storyline, as essentially a repeat of events happening later on down the timeline, I found I liked the more epic ""first time occurence"" of the first games storyline. This detracted from the narrative experience in my opinion.*END SPOILER*That said, Dark Souls 1 player or not, I still recommend this game, you should play it (all the way through, not rushing) if you played the first, even if you are skeptical, and you should play it if you haven't. Demon's Souls players go either way. I would say its less of a sequel and more of a continuation."

It's truly like a completely different game. The loading is practically instant, especially compared to the console version.The multiplayer of this port is truly outstanding beyond the well-designed multiplayer the Souls series has going for it. Whether it's dueling, invading, summoning, or helping other players randomly w/ bosses or other players, I will say with a straight face this game has the best multiplayer for an third-party,  Action RPG game of all time.The first game would've had that title if it didn't integrated GFWL, but that's an off-topic subject.If you like hardcore games like Ninja Gaiden, you must play this game.

Dark Souls is challenging; there's a learning curve that you need to overcome and if you're not careful you will die no matter how much experience you have. However, I've never been killed without a clear idea of what I did wrong and what I should have done differently.The good:  Much, much better port than its predecessor. Graphics are beautiful, the 60fps makes everything smooth and fluid, and it runs without a hitch on my laptop, which is a few years old. The game plays much the same as its predecessor, and still has excellent combat mechanics, which are ultimately what you're here for. PVP is competitive and intense, but not inaccessible. Ultimately, I have had tons of fun with this game.The bad: The world feels a bit less realized than the DS I world. Dark Souls doesn't tell story by exposition and dialogue; 99% of the story is in the environments and they felt a bit more cardboard than the ones in DS I. I think some tweaks are still in order for balance and shoring up some things (those halberd and katana hitboxes, though), but nothing major."

Graphically it isn't the best game to ever be made, but they aren't so bad that they detract from the game as some would have you believe and they are still well above console graphics. Optimization wise I run it fluidly on a laptop with a 670mx at 1080p medium settings with no lag whatsoever.Now onto the controls. They are absolutely horrid. I don't think any effort whatsoever was giving into developing a control scheme that made sense and they obviously didn't try as it is apparent by tutorial valley telling you to press the ""y"" key on an xbox controller. However a good few minutes in the keybinding section and you can fix this issue completely. Still though the developers went back on their promise with this blatent disregard for actual true keyboard support.Once the controls are out of the way the game is great. Combat is exciting and frustating in very unequal measure leaning towards the latter. The challenge is real, and one may not even enjoy the game since the premise of it seems to be making it unbeatable. So if you got experience with DS1 or their other titles by all means purchase. If not, learn what you are getting into first because this isn't a game for everyone and Steam will not give you a refund because you don't like it.Also the opening cutscene deserves merit for its awesomeness."

I don't see why you would want to play this game with keyboard and mouse, but everyone has their preferences when it comes to playing games. If you play with keyboard and mouse, do some looking around before buying this game. Check out reviews and see what people say.

Most enjoyable if you don't read guides or watch walkthrough; this way you are forced to think of strategies, equip combinations and the such if you want to keep going.The only negative point: it lacks the amazing atmosphere and great metroidvania-like feeling of the world of the original but it is still a great game. Also, akward mouse and keyboard setup with few costumization as far as I played. It feels that the PVP was greatly improved, it still need some tweaks tho.As for this PC version, thought I had just a glimpse at it, it looks so much better than the PS3 one. The three four noticeable points were:+Support of full HD, unlike the original Dark Souls port on PC and DSII on PS3. On the PS3 one, I don't know if its just me, but I swear you can even notice dinamic resolution changes sometimes, to keep with the framerates, it sucks.+Unlocked framerate, I played it at 60fps unlike the 30fps of the PS3 version.+Higher resolution textures. This plus the 1080p makes the game twice better.-Akward mouse and keyboard configuration, I would play this with a PS3/Xbox360 controller.Anyways, this is the definitive version of the game, the 60pfs alone make it feel so much better in such action oriented experience. I can see myself playing this one in the long term instead of the PS3 one, once I finish everything in that one I'll switch to this one for good."

What is being shown is pre-release screenshots, or basically ""What we were promised"".Although there are certain graphical enhancements you can install to make your game look as ""purty"" as this, you can't fix what ain't there.Also, it's highly recommended that you purchase the DLCs, or the DX11 version when it is released.

But the challenges offered are epic.Compared to Dark Souls this game lacks a lot of charisma and personality, but the refinement of the mechanics (mostly the combat system) make it more enjoyable in my opinion.To play it on PC without using a connected controller you need to rebind all attacks to keyboard buttons, which is kind of lame. If you do not do this your input has a near 50ms delay, which in a game about fast reactions is highly unwanted. Parrying and leap attacking are also impossible with the default bindings (to mouse).The game is fun and long (on a blind playthrough) and offers plenty of post-game things like NG+, ++, etc. and of course PvP is always available.For the amount of gameplay offered (potentially endless) this game is definitely worth it."

Unfortunately, the opaque plotline reduces the single player aspect to a superficial hack-and-slash experience.Furthermore, the multiplayer PvP experience is ruined by the P2P connection scheme. What is this? The `90s? Games have been making widespread use of dedicated game servers since Quake. The net-code is also dodgy, begging you to question why you spent so much time grinding up to the top level and gear as you watch your character taking damage from an opponent that appears to be striking the air a map (and probably a continent) away. Seriously, I live in northern Europe and was match-made with someone in Thailand -- the lag made the game unplayable. This is why games are making use of regions now.Ultimately, it's enjoyable to play through once or twice on single player, perhaps with a bit of co-op thrown in -- but don't have any expectations about prolonging your use of the game to duke it out with other players.

Expect PS3 level graphics, albeit at a higher resolution.PVP is fun with experience, but frustrating as you're learning the game.  Players can invade you anywhere, at any time, and can ruin your day if they catch you while you're already struggling with the PVE content.  Play offline if you don't want to get ganked.  Join a covenant with an arena early to get some practice in to even the playing field.If you like this game, I highly suggest the DLCs, as they are some of the best content in the game."

,Recommended,236430,31935741,Posted: 24 May,all,FNATIC Charles,"Right... so of course this is gonna get a thumbs up cuz it's dark souls :3 but i do have a few complaints about this game. I'm just about to fininsh the main part of the game and have decided to do the Dlc's first, and i have to say this far i'm disappointed when it comes to the bosses in this game. Neither of the ones i've done thus far have been har because of the boss itself and the design and attacks of it. A few have been sorta hard ar first but it only takes a few tries to learn em. The ones that i've had bigger problems with has only been like that because of the way leading up to the boss. Take the slemter demon for example. The boss itself was not that hard in my opinion, but reaching the door without loosing almost all estus flasks or other resources is a completely different story. That is in my opinion the biggest reason for that boss' difficulty. Same goes for the Dlc version of the same boss. Though the fume knight has been a hard one for me thus far, so thumbs up for that one xD  One other thing is the lock on systems and attacking when using it. Idk why but i found the first games version much easier to control than the second game. Might just be personal preference, but that is my opinion at least :/ There also seems to be a delay when i try to do some actions. A lot of the times i try to run or use the X button ability, the character doesnt wanna do the actions. Might just be my game or the controller, Idk. I don't have that delay in The Witcher 3 for example, so idk :/Still, it's a good game. I love the design of the areas, though it's a bit underwhelming compared to the first dark souls in my opinion. The area (forgot the name) when you're way up high on those rock pillars with a lot of dragons flying around was SO COOL, i loved it. The winter shrine dlc area as well looks SO GOOD.Overall i like the game. It's not as good as the first, and i believe the third might be better as well when i come to it. I can understand why this game is considered by a lot of people as the worst in the dark souls serious, but that doesn't mean it's bad.I'm gonna give it 7/10, PRAISE THE SUN LADS!"
,Recommended,236430,10353890,"Posted: 5 June, 2014",all,Mason,"Where to start.When I played through the first Dark Souls game, it was by far a much more memorable experience for me.Dark Souls 2's first impression was as good as the game gets. A washed up, linear experience where they tried too hard to make it anywhere near ""innovative""Now I'm not one of those people that was angered over the removal of a few lighting aspects (even though they were pretty much what was going to make the torch useful), but the overall changes made from the previous beta versions were noticable.I noticed a feature in-game that appeared to be a sort of ""region block"" feature. As in, no longer would I be getting invaded by Russians or Brazilians using bananas and coconuts as internet. Of course, I was exited to see this as anybody else was. But that happiness was shot down instantly as I was shock-waved into Oblivion during PvP.On the note of PvP, let's talk about balancing. This is a souls game, so there will always be unbalancing of some sort, no matter how many patches From Software throws out. Of course, the game is still fairly new, so we can only expect waves of patches and fixes to roll in. Although, knowing From Soft, they'll likely turn nuclear hexes into floating♥♥♥♥♥♥ and avelyns into super soakers.I'm gonna be on the topic of bosses with a tad bit of spoilers here, especially the final boss, so if you're still afraid of having the whole game destroyed for you (if it already hasn't been), then you may want to skip this part. Ok, so, the bosses can vary. I'm going to be one of those guys who will say there is a handful of artificials in there. The Smelter Demon simply Artorias's three times before he even hits half health, and while he is defeatable with a series of dodges, it is still a lazy design for a boss. Sassy large black lady Nashandra was one of the most dissapointing final bosses I have fought in a while. Gwyn was a more fitting final boss than fem nito.Even though I♥♥♥♥♥♥on it, it's a decent game that I recommend (if it goes on sale).I give it a sturdy 7.3/10PS.

A good deal of unnecessary cluttering gameplay elements have been fixed without compromising the feel. Also impressive is the attention given to having a balanced pvp experience. There have been some welcome changes to matchmaking in pvp, in that players are now matched based on their total souls (game currency) gathered over the coursed of the game, as opposed to their level. This elimates a former very frustrating aspect of the original dark souls, where players could choose to stop leveling their character in order to be able to easily beat others in pvp with their superior equipment.Overall, I would say that I am satisfied with my experience in dark souls 2.

In the PvE section I included the invasions and such because they give the game that extra spunk and keeps you on edge. The bosses are fun and by your second play through all are relatively easy. My first character was a 2 handed/shield wielding monster but it took me about 36 hours to beat the game at level 146. I made a faith character next and it took me about 7 hours and I got to level 189 before I beat the game. Not sure if its because I was use to the game or for the fact that magic casters do an insane amount of damage. For first time players melee is the challenging route and magic is the breeze through the game route. Even on NP+ I beat all the bosses with just the NPC on my first try... Now to the PvP aspect of the game, I've tried different convenants to test out the PvP system to see how it worked and I disliked it. I fought players who vanished then back stabbed me and killed me and appeared on the other side of the room. I faced just about every class in the game and I saw different weapon combinations and spell usages. I don't think the magic aspect is fair because it so easy to dodge however at the same time it can 1 hit kill you if you mess up your roll, or don't have a magic shield. My main problem is that I don't feel dark souls 2 needed the PvP aspect to get achievements though... With the lag that is there for me and a few other players that I have seen with people vanishing or hitting the backstab even when they are in the front of me. Overall I enjoyed this game the secrets/NPCs/Bosses. The invasions were fun even if I died, just not going to be able to 100% complete the game because I am not doing 500+ matches for the Blue convenant just to get it done with for the miracles achievement."

Art reminds me of a darker Lord of the Rings, gameplay reminds me of a more mature zelda game with online strangers and foes."

It has many flaws regarding level design and something that really disappointed me: the universe of the game didn't feel unique like Lordran. I had the sensation of Drangleic being a bunch of different areas stitched together, building a world without a clear identity. The lore of it didn't keep me interested for a long time too. Oddly enough, I spent much more time with this game, rather than the first one and dare to say that I had more fun traveling through Drangleic. The gameplay just feels right and is very diversified. I played with three completely different builds, using the most different kinds of weapons and none of them were hard to adapt, or felt weird.This game, is my view, succeeds in creating an extremely fun and functional gameplay - both in single player and multiplayer, which is better than ever. From Software failed to create an universe that surpassed the beauty and complexity of Lordran and that's ok, because Drangleic is still awesome. Dark Souls 2 gave me the chills that I used to have when I played classic games during my childhood, the fear of dying and having to do everything again. This feeling is something that I didn't feel in a long time. It is noticeably easier than the first game, but not less challenging. Everyone who wants the sensation of being inside a different world, overcoming great challenges and experiencing an incredible multiplayer should play this one.9/10"

The game is hard, and that's cool, but what's not cool is that the in game help tells you how to do things by hitting the B button.  Well I don't have a B button.  Let's check key bindings.  No way to bind a key to that, and no option to bind a key to do the thing that the help sign was teaching me to do.  So, instead of using the controls to fight hard battles, I'm spending a good deal of time trying to figure how how to DO things.  Even as I figure them out, it's obvious that the game wasn't made to be played without a controller.  I may make a visit to my local hardware store and buy a controller so I can revisit the game, but as it is, the controls are so unintuitive I have no desire to play."

As a Dark Souls 1 veteran, I found the pc controls slightly more complicated, but easy to use once you mastered it, and it's a way better pc version than the first game. All in all, good graphics, excellent smoothness of frames, awesome sound effects, immersive story and great ambiance.10/10, would and am playing again. :D"
