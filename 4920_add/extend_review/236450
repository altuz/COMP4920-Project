,Recommended,236450,9741199,"Posted: 5 April, 2014",all,Aussiedroid,"This is the best PAC-MAN version I have played since the original, although it has a bit of a twist. All the game modes are time based so you could have a 5 or 10min run at a score, or have a specific challenge like how many ghosts you can eat in one go or how quickly you can collect a certain number of fruits. There is a ton of maps and PAC-MAN themes you can unlock too, although I wish the classic theme was unlocked by default.It feels like an authentic PAC-MAN game; it has all the sound effects you would expect, good soundtrack and responsive controls. You need those responsive controls as it gets really fast when you survive longer! To make it more forgiving, you do have bombs and a slow motion ""bullet time"" effect giving you an extra split-second to make the right move. Even with these tools at your disposal there still an excellent challenge for your reflexes; Online leaderboards as well to challenge your friends :)One thing that could definitely have been left out is the Facebook medals to earn in-game; this should not be part of the games' achievements! At most it should be an option for those who want to use FB, not required to get all the in-game achievements nor plaster the icons with a 'Share' tag till you do share it!Facebook farce aside, the game itself is a great trip down memory lane introducing a modern twist to the PAC-MAN legacy.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"
,Recommended,236450,10962208,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,silly'Goose,"This is probably the best 3.75 I have spend this year. No words can describe how much I enjoyed it. If it's on sale, it's a steal and you should be arrested for buying masterpeices at such low prices.Before I begin to explain myself why I highly encourage you to buy the game, I would love to say that I am a huge Pac-man fan. I grew up playing Pac-man acardes since I lived in a small neighbhorhood with an acarde not to far from my house. Walking to school, I would spend 25 cents to play Pac-man. So, to play a modern Pac man game that does everything exactly right and BETTER just brightens my heart.This game simply does everything right, and if you love pac-man as much as I do, you will quickly agree that this is your favorite purchase.To begin with, the music is fantastic. Reentrance( DLC song) is probably my Video Game music of my Year almost beating DuckTales's legendary ""The Moon"". It's very techno-ish. I am not usually a fan of this type of music, BUT surprising, I instantly fell in love with it. It does its job right of making you feel very intense as your heart beat raises as the game rapidly gets FASTER. It's freaken intense and the music overall just enchances the experience. MUSIC DONE RIGHT.The game offers the original calm relaxing game we all know love in stunning beatiful visuals. There are servals skins and colors to pick from! From 2D outlines to fully 3D. There even Dig Dug! Just look at the screenshots! They're the perfect colors and visuals for this game. There is simply no complains about the graphics. HOWEVER, there is no resolution settings, and I believe it runs at 720p.In addition, Championship Edition DX+ is able to convert a unviserally claimed game, which is played for calming and relax, into this instantly fast, suspenseful, intense game that is can be VERY addicting. This is where the game shinies the most. Besides the usual collecting orbs and trying to get high scores, now they included a rate of speed, bombs, and slow down feature. Being honest I hated them. I felt that it made the game too easy. BUT, as soon as the game blasted to 40 speed of rate, the game completely changed as I grateful for the new features. Now, when you're close to a ghost, the game slows down, so the player is allow to make better decisions on where to move next. In addition, if you're about to die due to being trap, you can use the bomb feature to destroy all the ghost. I try as much as possible to avoid the bomb, but I still enjoy using it as it can be a lifesaver to achiveing a higher score. Overall, if you love fast gameplay, you will love this game. At 50, the game went soo fast that my eyes couldn't catch up. However, I eventually got used to it.My favorite feature is the Free mode where the player is allowed to set a time limit. It's basically like a time attack and your goal is to see how many points can you can obtain. I am a college student who has been dying to find a game where I can pick up for 10mins and return to homework. I've even played it on campus as many commented saying its ""pac-man on acid"" or ""What is this sonic?"".Overall, there are a TON of gamemodes. I could explain them all, but its just something a player has to try on their own.To conclude, I'm glad to see a new Pac-man game isn't just clone of the original with HD fancy graphics. To those who would rather play it on a TV Pac-man console or on a flashgame, I'd like to mention that the game introduces so many new features and visuals elements that it entirelly changes everything, and you'll get a FAR better experience than playing it on a flashgame on TV console.I can see a TON of effort put into the game, and it simply stands out. This is by far the best Pac-Man game you can buy on a console or PC."

Unfortunately, there were two things that soured the experience for me. The first was the fact that to use the classic Pac-Man skin you need to obtain all of the the achievements, as well as all the medals, which appear to be more or less a second set of achievements not tracked by Steam. The second is that to achieve all of those medals, one has to have or sign up for a facebook account and then spam your facebook followers with what amounts to advertisements for the game. While, separately, each of these issues alone wouldn't have been enough to sour me on this game enough to post a bad review, together they're irritating enough to make me regret purchasing it in the first place, even if it was on sale."

,Recommended,236450,25420502,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,SubrosianChainsawMassacre_|BC|,"This game is absolutely bonkers, in a good way though.PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+is like normal PAC-MAN, only the map is rotated 90 degrees, there aretonsof ghosts instead of just 4, and it's a race to eat as many dots, food and ghosts as possible before the timer runs out.The game is split into several boards with different structures, dot and ghost positioning, and paths to follow. None of them really feel any harder than the others, but they're all difficult in their own way. The DLC boards are a fun addition, but I wouldn't recommend you buy them separately from the game, since it's cheaper to buy the fullBig Eaterpack and just get all of it at once.Gameplay wise, it's actually a lot more complicated than basic PAC-MAN. Pac controls as you'd expect him to, and the basic premise is still there, but given a twist. Dots appear in simple paths for Pac-Man to follow, and once they've all been eaten, a piece of fruit spawns for him to eat, which creates the next path for him to follow. Power pellets work the same as every other version of PAC-MAN. Eat one and all the ghosts become edible...all 40 of them.The ghosts in this game are much more numerous than any other version. They generally chase you in lines which get longer and longer as you pass by more sleeping ghosts, and there are usually one or two ghosts roaming around independently to try and throw you off. Often you'll be scarfing down 40 or more ghosts in one go after consuming a power pellet and racking up a ton of points. Some ghosts even hold power pellets so yo can keep yourself going. And if you're afraid you'll run out of juice at a bad time, have no fear. They added a meter on the top of the screen showing how long until the pellet wears off. And even if you do run out at an inopportune moment or are trapped between ghosts with no way out, you have another way to deal with them, bombs.Bombs are another thing ghosts can carry, and are essentially a screen nuke for all the ghosts chasing you and any other ghosts who Pac is about to collide with. Bombs can be the difference between getting a higher score and getting killed (which doesn't stop the timer, but I'll get to that in a bit), and should be used sparingly, because the ghosts can trap you even more easily if you aren't careful after using a bomb, and the cycle just repeats itself until you run out.The biggest change to gameplay is the actual objective. Instead of just eating all the dots, this game is a score attack, you want to get as many points as possible in a set amount of time, usually five minutes. Once the timer starts, it does not stop until it runs out, which means dying has a serious impact on your score. This is because respawning takes about 3 seconds, and it slows the game speed meter on the bottom of the screen down to the nearest multiple of 5, slowing you down even more. Using bombs and even going near ghosts can also slow you down. Using a bomb freezes Pac in place for half a second, and going near a ghost slows the game down and briefly zooms in on Pac to let you know to dodge or use a bomb.And to be entirely honest, I actually really like these changes. It makes the game very fast paced and requires very quick thinking and reflexes to get that high score, making this game a real good challenge and quite addicting to play. I could totally see this in an arcade if they were still as prevalent as they were in the 80s, and I would glady drop a few quarters if I came across it.A fun spin on a classic title for a perfectly reasonable price, and an absolute steal when on sale. If you like arcade style madness, this is a great time and I highly recommend it."

FUN BUT VERY DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY THAN THE GOOD OLD PAC-MANThe game is rather fun and there is a good incentive to replay for  high-scores especially if some of your friends have it too as the leaderboards are well done. On sale it's a decent offer.However overall I find the gameplay much more bland than the good old vintage Mrs PacMan. PacMan set an early milestone in computer AI, with very simple rules, and small variations for each ghost gave them each a distinct personality. It required patience and skills to regroup the 4 ghosts before eating the energy pills and ate the 4 ghosts for max score. Moreover the levels design required some thought and planning to finish them without being killed.In contrast in this Championship DX+ edition, all ghosts have the same algorithmn, moreover they are quite dumb and don't actually chase you, they merely follow you mindlessly, in effectyour goal is too move close to sleeping ghosts, and they will automatically add them to the ghost train that follow you. Until you get a energy pill for mass slaughter combos. Early on this is rather fun, but in the end it is rather repetitive, it relies heavily on memorizing patterns, and executing them quicker as the game speed increase, and it definitely lack the strategic elements of Mrs Pac-Man.Finally the game have a ""bullet time"" kind of slow-down when ghosts come close to you and you also have bombs to send back all ghosts at once to the prison, which make the game very easy, and you actually don't get kill very oftenThe game speed varies from 1 to 50, however when above 40, I had some issue with my controller, as Pac-Man move too fast to allow you to execute complex sequences of turns, resulting in many wrong turns.Some achievements require a Facebook account, this really s**ks.With all the extra bells and whistles in this edition, Its a shame that they didn't include the original simple gameplay, as it wouldn't have required a lot of additional programming.In the end I disagree that this is the ""best"" Pac-Man edition, it feels too much a different game."

That was then.'Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+' (it's a good thing you play as a giant mouth) is one of the strongest and most ridiculously well crafted revivals of a classic I've ever seen, never mind that the older versions really aren't my cup of tea.  Even though the series predates much of the gaming industry, this entry feels like it belongs in the modern era, and the improvements it makes to the time-honored formula are an absolute delight.The rules are the same as they were--navigate a maze, eat dots and fruit for points, avoid the ghosts chasing you, and snag giant pills so you can turn your enemies into an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Then come the more interesting decisions--the mazes don't completely fill up with dots, and the lines the game feeds you like an ever-tantalizing carrot often take on the shape of patterns designed to lead you a certain way.  Remember how the original game had only a few ghosts?  Here, part of the point is to run by ghosts sleeping in nooks and crannies, which gets more and more of them chasing you until your legion pursuers stretch themselves in a string so long that there becomes a real danger of you being trapped in an area where the string's head chases you while the tail won't let you escape.  Think of the old game Snake, except you're the prey.Pac-Man has a new trick up his proverbial sleeve as well--he has a limited supply of bombs that essentially send the ghosts back to their starting point, leaving him unscathed.  If you're a purist and you don't want to use these, that's perfectly understandable, and the game will make special note of your bravery (especially if you still don't die).  This ties into the game's commendable approach to difficulty: while ""beginner"" and harder difficulties exist, much of their distinction lies in the speed of the game, which goes up or down depending on the player's performance.  If a bomb is used or if Pac-Man dies, the game smartly assumes the player is having trouble and scales its speed slightly down.  This way, newcomers and inexperienced players can enjoy this title without it being as inaccessible as the Garden of Eden, while experts and thrill-seekers can satisfy their little hearts with challenges that really are their own reward.  Likewise, the power pills that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts (don't type ""power pill"" into a search engine, which I learned the hard way) now have a visible time meter at the top of the screen, so you don't have to guess how long they'll last.  This leads to incredibly polished sections where the game will basically hand you a free pill and lead you down a prescribed path such that the power pill wears off a fraction of a second before you careen into an otherwise hapless ghost who receives the grace of God at the last possible moment, forcing you as the player to either change direction quickly, use a bomb, or die.Maybe I have Pac-Man Fever™ from saying ""just one more level"" five too many times when it's 1:30 in the morning and I really should be getting some sleep, but even though this game never tries to shoehorn in a needless story or out-of-place powerups, it still shows itself to be provocative in its own way, whether Pac-Man is frantically leading the increasingly irritable rainbow hordes on the way to the Promised Pill (Numbers 14:1-25) or finally reaching said pill, turning back around, and mowing down his powerless aggressors one by two by ten, with Sam Fisher's steely determination, a fervor that would make Call of Duty cry, and enough bonus points to keep the leaderboard lovers and achievement hounds coming back again and again.Even if the game only contained the one map, mode, and visual skin I've tried (along with the time trials), it would still be a compelling and amazing package well worthy of attention, but I find it both fascinating and disturbing that this already remarkable game has plenty of content I haven't even touched.  I have no idea whether this excellent tribute to everyone's favorite pizza-shaped scourge of the undying takes place in some weird, multicolored extraplanar labyrinth where you're really Cthulhu alternately fleeing and devouring the vengeful souls of the slain, but either way, a series I couldn't recommend has given me an installment I can't recommend enough (cf. Tomb Raider), and that is as much praise as I could imagine a game deserving.  This addictive and bounteous wonder comes across like Pac-Man with F-Zero GX's pacing, and the music does an admirable job of playing the part, especially when the epic crescendo at the end of a high-speed Score Attack round makes me feel like I've just gotten off a roller coaster.Once you go Pac, you don't go back."

Unlike the original game, each playthrough is timed in CE DX+ which makes chasing high-scores a frantic race of sorts. From watching gameplay videos it might appear to be overwhelmingly fast at times, but it's actually quite manageable and easy to get into once you learn the maze layouts and ghost movement patterns. It has this great flow to it that makes getting into a groove such a sublime and satisfying experience. The music is uptempo, catchy, and completely on the money as well. Just a perfect soundtrack for this kind of game. I had no issues with the controls either; always responsive, never felt any lag.I do have a couple gripes with Pac-Man CE DX+. It only runs at 720p which makes the image on a 1080p monitor a little blurry, but it's not nearly as bad as I would've expected. Everything moving as quickly as it does helps negate this issue for the most part. The bigger issue, though, is the overall menu/scoreboard/options interface. It feels archaic, clunky, and is more of a hassle to deal with than it has any right to be. Also, it should be mentioned how lousy the Steam demo for this game is. It's a single track that lasts for about 2 minutes and then fades out before the pace begins to pick up, making it nearly impossible to get a feel for the game prior to purchasing. It's better than nothing, but that isn't saying much.Overall, Pac-Man CE DX+ is a delight to play. The Pac-Man series has never really interested or hooked me all that much in the past, but this remake was an entirely different story. Between the extensive track and BGM selections (especially if you opt for the AYCE Edition, which I definitely recommend) and frenzied gameplay that lends itself well to 20-30 minute bursts, this is a game that I can see myself going back to time and time again."

It may sound simple, and it is, but it's also a lot of fun.  It won't be long before you start seeing long chains of ghosts chasing you, and eating a power up, turning around and gobbling them all up, while you try to do random activities through the day.Each stage has different time challenges, and you can alter the way the stage looks and how the characters look. That is a nice feature. I've keep reading people having some sort of input lag and other technical issues, and was a bit concerned. But i got the game anyway, and had no issues myself."

So what's so great about this version you ask?This version is a revamped pacman experience. With all new puzzles, and all new levels you've got countless hours to waste in this maze chasing ghosts in all new ways.To any new comer or veteran of the franchise I'd highly would recommend the championship edition.CHALLENGE : Just try to see if you can hit 1,000,000 in the championship edition on expert level. Its not easy.Now, you're probably asking yourself : Why should I buy this game? : One simple answer. Because its just fun.

Also, wake up as many sleeping ghosts as possible and keep them in a giant snake trailing behind you until you can grab a powerup and gobble down forty of them in one huge, satisfying gulp. Play well to speed up the game so you can do more before time runs out, make quick decisions in bullet-time when you're about to collide with a ghost, and use panic bombs when you've trapped yourself.In a way, it’s nothing like classic Pac-man, but in another way, it’s surprisingly similar. The skill of dodging ghosts, judging how to use pills, and pathfinding through lines of dots is still very much there, only now it’s ridiculously fast-paced and you have a trail of ghosts following you.The looping, non-random stage layouts make for a perfect competitive experience, and the time-attack nature of the game makes it possible to consume in bite-sized portions instead of having to spend hours on a single credit like you had to at the arcade to get a high score.The ascetics of the game are both superb and customizable; there are dozens of alternate skins available (even more if you got all the DLC), and the soundtrack is awesome.Oh, and achievement hunters need not fear: all the achievements will be out of your way in no time at all, making this an easy pick for your 100% trophy case.$15 is steep, so get the DLC pack on sale if you can, preferably for $5 or less.

Boy, did I regret that decision. Fixed camera angles and a difficulty that went up and down like a whack-a-mole's hammer ruined the game and I tossed it out the 3rd floor window. Funny thing is, that game came with additional versions of past Pacman games but I felt at an extreme disadvantage when it came to survival, whether you were to jump or not.Red about this game and I realised I have been missing that drive to complete a game 100%. It either needed to be an extremely specific genre and game (Arkham Series) or something I could do in a week or so (Shadow Of Mordor). There was no feeling of replayability and a strive to perfection, like say, Wipeout HD. I now know that I am starving for arcade games like Burnout and this one.A constant need to get better at this is ever present due to the ranking method. I have only completed Championship II with an S ranking and this has taken me a considerable time. It is extremely addictive to figure out the nooks and crannies of every course and trying to maximize your score by eating up a long chain of ghosts is the best way of saying ♥♥♥♥ you to these guys. It is revenge, pure and simple but as sweet as it is, it also has to be planned out.

,Recommended,236450,16912339,"Posted: 6 July, 2015",all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"I began playing this game in 2015, the 35 year anniversary for Pac-Man. Pac-Man grew to be an iconic classic game. Many versions of Pac-Man games have come out since 1980 trying to cash in on Pac-Man’s greatness. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX brings back the Pac-Man fever on Steam and shows that Pac-Man has aged quite well.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX has the traditional Pac-Man that everyone has loved over the years, but with updated graphics and new modes. There is still that addictive feature that brings players back for more munching of dots, pellets, fruits, and ghosts. The goal is to score as high as possible. I began with score attacks which require you to travel around the maze while being pursued by ghosts in 5 or 10 minutes. It has the feel of the original Pac-Man, but with state of the art graphics. There are various time trials which require you to eat a particular fruit in a limited period of time, but the fruit will reappear only after eating all the required dots in a particular section of the maze. This creates a sense of urgency so that the fruit can appear quickly enough while time is ticking.One of the first differences I noticed in this edition of Pac-Man was the availability of bombs to get out of a tight situation. These bombs send all the ghosts back to their home in the center of the screen.  I don’t recall having bombs at my disposal when I first played Pac-Man back in the day. As a result of the bombs, you can die less often and focus more on earning high scores. There are many more ghosts in Pac-Man Championship Edition DX than ever and this means you will have more opportunities to gobble up ghosts as soon as you locate and eat a power pellet. One mode that is very interesting is the ghost combo mode which requires you to gobble up as many consecutive ghosts as possible to register the highest number of ghost combos by time the clock reaches zero. It feels really satisfying to eat so many ghosts in such short order. In most of the modes eating as many ghosts as possible is key to attaining very high scores. Besides high scores, there is the motive to unlock more challenging modes by completing the mazes without losing all your lives.The replay value of this game is through the roof because of the available modes and the desire to score higher and higher every time you play. The sounds of the game are great and still retain the feel of the classic, original Pac-Man. The music intensifies as the clock ticks down to zero.The leaderboards have plenty of stats, including where you stand worldwide and among your Steam friends. I am surprised that this game doesn’t have more than 12 Steam achievements. It seems to me that there should be more achievements given all the modes and challenges players can accomplish. There is a replay feature that you can use to watch replays of your performance. What I found disappointing about the replay is the inability to save replays. It is cool to have a replay feature, but it would have been cooler to be able to save replays. The low number of Steam achievements and the inability to save replays are probably my only disappointments in this game. However, the game is so well designed and has such great gameplay that they easily overshadow the low number of Steam achievements and the inability to save replays.Pac-Man Championship Edition is very addictive and can encourage players to get better and better for a long time. The game design retains the classic feel of the original game and there are various maze skins to choose from for aesthetical purposes. For a price of $10, this arcade game is well worth it as it feels like it retains its great tradition while updating it to look modern. This is high entertainment value for $10 and the game shows that Pac-Man has definitely aged well.My Score: 9.5/10"

As in traditional Pac-Man games, ghost behavior is deterministic and predictable, so courses can be played entirely on memorized routes - which, due to the incredible speed of the game at Expert levels, is how the game is meant to be played. The game is on a clock, so slowing down is a score penalty.Finding excellent routes on each board, and executing them, is a lot of fun, but after a certain point, the game loses its replay value. It took around 30 hours for me (across two versions of the game), which isn't too bad, but after hitting S rank on every item, it can be hard to see why to keep playing. There are usually more ways to improve one's score than one might think at first...Special note to the soundtrack - most of the background music is excellent, especially Pac-Rainbow and Pac-Steps (which is DLC)."

While most Pac-Man sequels were basically the same thing with a small tweak, this game manages to stand out.The focus this time is less survival, more high score accumulation.The main game concept is still the same. You are Pac-Man, and go around the maze eating stuff. But the objective is not to just eat. The game gives you a path of dots, around which are ghosts waiting to eat you who start following you when you approach. Power Pellets are not as common as in the original game, so watch those small spaces. The game DOES have ghost repelling bombs but they do run out and are only refillable by eating ghosts. Once you eat a pattern, a fruit piece on the other side of the maze appears to replace the pattern you ate.While this version is not so urgent and survivalistic in tone, it can be really fun, especially the faster the session gets. Plus each maze has a set of challenges with which to clear it. It may not be the Pac-Man your dad sank hours worth of quarters into, but it is still fun.I give it a 9.5/10, because one unlockable would be impossible to get without a Facebook account as the requirement to get it is to get all the medals and achievements and post them to your Facebook feed."

I was skeptical that anything could trump the tried-and-true formula of the original arcade classics, but this not only destroyed my expectations, it took those little bits and arranged them in a giant ""TOLD U SO"" on the floor. PMCEDX+ takes the original game you love and makes it faster, more colorful, more powerful, and more varied than the original game.The relative concept is simple; collect different patterns of dots while avoiding sleeping ghosts. Each half of a room you clear opens up the other half, and the ghosts you awaken form a raging conga line behind you. While nabbing a power pellet in the original games was fun enough, this game steps that up, allowing you to devour hordes of ghosts and turn that raging conga line into nothing. All this to fast-paced electronic music and colorful, abstract stages. PMCEDX+ is a game that knows how to make your palms sweat and make you breathe a sigh of relief after beating a tough level. It can be difficult, but it never feels frustrating.I guess if there's anything to knock about this game, it's that it feels a bit shorter than it should be. The game has lots of challenges and maps for you, but they seem to be over pretty quickly. Despite this, the levels are a plast to play over and over. It's a game where you feel like everything is about to come off the rails at any second, and you're just barely holding on, and it's pure bliss.

You didn't think they'd let you move so fast and not give the ghosts anything either did you? Mazes are littered with sleeping ghosts which will follow your exact path after you move past them. The original ghosts you know and ""love"" will still be after you, following (more or less) their classic attack patterns (I feel like Pinky isn't quite as prescient as he used to be).So now when you eat a power pellet, you can be looking at a lot more than that coveted 3000 points for a 4-ghost combo - how does up to 3600 each sound? In a chain of 10-20 (or more)?For a 30+ year pac-veteran like myself, it sounds like catharsis.I only have 2 complaints about the game - overpriced DLC that brings nothing new to the table, and the fact that the player must manually select to end their game from the main menu, rather than being able to just escape or cancel button out from the title screen. FaceBook users may find the passive-agressive auto-posted dialogue directly translated from the Japanese to be tedious (some other reviews harp on this a lot), but I don't have an account, so I can't really say.The game itself comes heavily recommended - but the DLC bundles and alternate Namco game reskins are completely non-essential.But hey, it's Steam - there will always be a sale!If you like puzzle/arcade experiences that reward high risk behavior, or if you've been playing Pac-Man since the punk rockers at the local arcade had to find you a chair to stand on so that you could reach the joystick, then I think you'll have a lot of fun with this one."

However this is the first time I've bought DLC.Overall I think this is a pretty smart game. Very simple and very easy however figuring out a high score is also very intersting. I see many players say that the game is too easy due to the slow down when your about to run into a ghost. I feel these players are missing a key aspect in that while the action may be slowing down so you can prevent a death, the timer does not slow down. This means when finding ways to increase your score and death is already irrevelant, just nearing death means your wasting time, and wasting time means your wasting points.I was rather impressed by the DLC. All the boards are just as interesting as the original, if not more so. Where optiomal patterns that often change depending on your speed, length of train, and how many roaming ghosts there are.In short if your looking for an casual easy arcade experieince it's a pretty good game, but also if your looking for a game to try to find the best way to grab that high score I think it's rather great!"

It sure prevents you from dieing, but it appears even when I clearly navigate around a ghost without even running into it - and then messes up my turn timing.

,Recommended,236450,12204821,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,timeformime,"Boiled down to one phrase, Pac-Man CE is that elusive holy grail publishers chase after - it's the reboot that surpasses the original. it's got an officially licensed, authentic retro character and feel, but still deep, strategic, 21st century gameplay. Other retro characters should be so lucky to be re-imagined with this kind of love and attention. What stood out to me during my few hours with this game were the tight gameplay, absurdly colorful graphics, and the customization. There's a slight caveat to the graphics: keep in mind that it's not an exhaustive port from the original 360 version, and doesn't go past 720p, so your mileage may vary on the graphics if super crisp hi-def visuals are a must for you.It's an incredibly addictive experience, but for me, having seen most stages and modes after a few hours, it didn't overstay its welcome. Your time with it can just be short and sweet, but depending on what you want out of it, and whether or not you care about the leaderboards, it easily offers enough variety to be your go-to arcade game. The DLC will give you a little more of everything - it's worth the $1.70 price difference if you want a handful of extra maps, visuals and music. I wasn't old enough to play Rally-X or Dig Dug, but it's cool to have them here. The more the merrier.The gameplay moves too fast for you to consciously think about it, which means, like an arcade game should, it really engages your reptile brain, as you instinctively weave Pac-Man in and around ghosts closing in on him, and if you do it right, you get to munch up a buffet line of ghosts all by yourself. There are just very simple 4-way controls and a button for bombs, and that's it, which for me means it's the perfect laptop game to be played on the go. I wouldn't play it to relax or destress, because Pac-Man is anything but relaxing, but even just for 5 minutes, it gets me in the zone with something more in depth than some iOS game. If you try it for free this week, I think you'll find it's worth a buy and a permanent spot in your library, for those times when straight-faced action games just won't do it for you."

It still captures the Pac-Man feel perfectly, and on top of that it's the first Pac-Man game I've enjoyed.This game seems to be titled ""Championship Edition"" as it turns an endless Pac-Man gauntlet into a 5 (or 10) minute score attack challenge, an excellent timeframe for a competition. When played for casual survival, the game is an absolute breeze that'll bore most fans within hours as you get multiple raw surival mechanisms (bombs and slowdown before collisions) which drastically lower the difficulty of the game.The challenge comes from playing for score. Using either of those survival mechanisms or dying will drastically lower your potential final score, as after using a bomb you're not able to gather up ghosts to chain for a few moments afterwards. Dying or bombing lowers the game's speed level along with lowering the point value of the dots, which means you absorb fewer points over time than you would if you had not messed up. It's still better to bomb than to die, though - death will shave at least 5 seconds of point-collecting time away.Ghost chaining feels both fun and rewarding - mowing down a massive line of ghosts and watching your score skyrocket is a highly satisfying experience. The longer you play, the more familiar you become with all the mazes (and how they change over time!) and you amass more and more ghosts into your gluttonous point farm.There are online leaderboards where you can view and compete with your friends scores along with automatic replays so you can view their runs, but the global overall ranking boards are currently plagued with blatant cheating (2 bil points? har) that may be a turnoff.Overall, it's an excellent score attack game. It has an arcade feel to it in that it's easy to get the hang of it, but challenging to master. All things considered, the chaining system feels more fun and rewarding than most arcade shooting games, but that doesn't say much."

Players should NEVER have to post to Facebook for an unlock (even in Facebook games, this should be limited to ONCE). Let me say that again, Namco: players should NEVER be required to post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, MySpace, LiveJournal, WordPress, or even Steam itself for an unlock in your game. The fact that the ability was even included (and shown off at the end of every bout in the maze) is bad enough, but as an unlock requirement, it's just plain stupid.Apart from that, the interface could use a little work. It's tough to tell what mode you're about to play in the course if you've unlocked something and have just returned from the Facebook nag screen (note: it's the same mode you just played). It wouldn't be as confusing if the cursor on the menu was in the same place you'd left it (instead, it's on the thing you just unlocked).So yeah, the social crap is more than a little irksome, especially for a game they aspire to charge money for. However, if you don't mind that (or are willing to put up with it for the sake of a Pac-Man game that looks, sounds, and feels new and exciting), then this game's probably for you."

What Namco has managed to do is take the original Pac-Man title and inject it with some true adreneline, revitalizing the classic ""high score"" culture indicative of the 80s/90s arcade scene.While this edition adheres to the core Pac-Man gameplay (go around a grid getting pellets and objects, avoid ghosts, and use power pellets to devour said ghosts for points), there's a more significant emphasis on speed and risk/reward gameplay. Whereas the original Pac-Man was devided into rounds that ended once the last pellet was taken, the action in Championship Edition is continuous and relentless (think Tetris), nevering throwing you through stages but instead watching to stage proliferate with more enemies and pellets as you grab each wave of pellets and objects.The aforementioned risk/reward aspect to the gameplay kicks in with the ghosts that give chase to you. While ghosts still spawn in the center and roam out from there much like the original more ghosts are placed stationary across the game field. These inactive ghosts will pursue you once you've come into adjacent contact with them, typically forming up what amounts to a ghost chain. Building ghost chains comes naturally in pursuing pellets and using a power pellet to vanquish your hunters is only natural. The higher the chain you build the better the score hike once you nab a power pellet to devour them en masse, but one must also consider how much aggro they're creating on the play field and how safely they can manuever their way to said super pellets to down that chain. It's this conflict that forms the basis of the adreneline pumping gameplay combined with the game's speed rachetting up as you consume more pellets, objects, and ghost chains.Visually the game still contains the black and neon vibes of it's original incarnation (though in a much cleaner modern resolution) but other backdrops for the action include a distinctly Lego feel, as well as Dig Dug and Rallxy X themed DLCs among other things. Stage visuals, character visuals, and background tunes are all selectable per board except for cases where you use the DLC themes which use everything related to that DLC together.Aside from that little quibble and perhaps the insanity of controlling the final speeds at 40-50 (it felt oddly off on my D-Pad for turns at that point) this is an incredibly simple yet very perfect revamp of a classic. Namco didn't take everything about Pac-Man and turn him on his round head. Instead they opted to go back and explore the original concept with mild (yet still somehow extreme) modifications that paid off. Once the speed kicks up and you start having pursuers all across the board, it becomes extremely satisfying once you grab that power pellet and put every last ghost in its place, watching the points bombard your score counter in the process. This is undoubtably the best coat of paint for this 1980 classic."

When you collect that fruit, it not only puts a new set of pellets, but redesigns the map of that side and pellet design.2. When you pass by the green ghosts, when ghosts behind you pass them they follow you. This results in some long chains of ghost in which you can devour when you get the power pellet.3. Once you get the hang of things you'll notice that the way everything is set up is so that there is a ""victory"" trail. It is a path you can take that all the pellets lead to, it is the only path you should be on. If you play on expert, you have to deal with four of the ghosts keeping you from staying on that path. You'll understand when you play."

You maneuver Pac-man around a maze, dodge ghosts, eat pac-dots, then a power-pellet in order to eat ghosts.This one however is fast. You build up speed from the start to get a feel for the chosen course or board. The course changes every time you follow the trail of pac-dots to eat the fruit or item at the end. This course change lets you lure in more sleeping ghosts to follow you in an increasingly fast and longer trail. Once you've lured enough and ate enough items, you get a pac-dot at the end of your high speed muching fest, allowing you to go for the long trail of ghosts you've accumulated, racking up points. This is so satisfying!Pros:+ It's a high speed classic pac-man with a challenging score-attack playstyle+ The courses allow for different ways of tackling the high score challenges, so when you miss that one corner and fail to lure more ghosts, you can take a different method of following pac-dots in order to achieve the same lure you intend. That or utilize the course design to your playstyle, or using bombs to put back an entire trail of ghosts in order to achieve a larger ghost combo and extend power-pellet timers. It's versatile and has a lot of mechanical depth to it.+ Visuals are dazzling and colorful. You can also customize these to whatever you want (with a few exceptions because we live in an era of DLC)+ Ranking system is such a fun way to play with friends, but is ultimately reserved only for friends. (I will get to this later)+ There are also replays from the ranking system which are fun to watch. These helped me discover new playstyles on familiar courses and increased my high score. It's good but it is flawed, very much so.+ There's plenty of variety in courses and modes. From score attack, time trial, and ghost combo. All of these are fun and feel right in the high speed nature of the game.Cons:- I don't feel particularly happy about urging me to buy DLC. These are only visual content sure, but I have a slight feeling most of this stuff is in my copy already and I only need to buy the key to unlock them. I highly despise this practice.- Global ranking is full of hackers. You'll get ridiculous 200 billion scores from players. And 0.01 top score in time trial. It's insane. Watching their replays reflects nothing of their performance.- Replays are buggy. Very often replays do not at all accurately represent the play of other players. The replay is often stuck in an endless loop of deaths, resulting in a pretty pointless replay.- I feel like the controls are very slightly off at the highest speed. Sometimes pac-man won't turn at a crucial moment, or turn too early, resulting in a familiar death sound. It doesn't really take away from the experience as much but it does negatively impact the high levels of play."

There is also a Speedometer that tells you how fast you are going because the better you do, the faster and faster the game gets. Totally frantic! I have never enjoyed Pac-Man as much as this version.I picked up the All-You-Can-Eat Edition which includes a lot of DLC. The Dig Dug skin is fantastic! (Rally-X not so much). The new courses are fun. I've seen comments that say Highway II looks just like Highway. It does look the same but it is way harder. There are many wandering ghosts like in the original Pac-Man in addition to the conga line. Mountain is a fun new course. The achievements are few and not that hard to get.

I still love that old game to this very day... but this isn't a review of the original game, is it?I had to give that brief history lesson, because the sheer amounts of nostalgia I feel while playing this version is almost overwhelming.. yet, at the same time, it also feels amazingly fresh. The first time you gobble down a long string of ghosts, you'll have the biggest grin and probably not even realize it. Why? Because that huge speed increase caught you off guard.. so you'll remember that instead.The goal is still to get as many points as possible, only now it's done with a time limit. Mazes are divided in two, and clearing one half of dots will place a fruit on the other half. Eating the fruit will cause more dots to appear on the empty half while also altering the maze layout on that half as well.The dot patterns also often contain green sleeping ghosts. Getting close will wake them and they'll immidiately give chase, becoming rainbow colored in the process (their color constantly shifts and changes). Gathering large strings of these ghosts is a primary method of scoring points when you come across a power pellet.Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are also present and act much like they used to before. Getting too close will also make these guys angry and they can join the train. If so, their eyes will pop back into ghost house to reappear. As such.. Blinky will add quite a bit to the train just because he's the chaser, and the angry ghost train is that on crack anyway. Clyde ends up being a bit dangerous thanks to his somewhat random nature when combined with the train following you and the overall speed of the game. Pinky and Inky are also dangerous in their own regards, just not as much.<3 InkyThe music also must be stated. Whoever it is who made these tracks deserves more credit than they probably got. There is absolutely no way you'd be able to take your eyes off the action to glance up at a timer at the higher speeds. The closer the timer is to running out, the more intrusive the music gets compared to the sound effects of the game itself.. and it builds up to a climax as the timer runs out. The brilliance behind that cannot go without being mentioned.This game, man. It's an updated take on a legend, and it's done perfectly. A 'classic' mode would have been icing on the cake.. but whatever. If you're a fan of Pac-Man, you're doing yourself a huge disservice by not AT LEAST trying out the demo.EDIT Sept. 16, 2015: So having unlocked the 'classic' skin and giving it a go... I feel let down by it, honestly. Keep in mind that Pac-Man is a game I loved since a VERY young age.But anyway... to nitpick the 'classic' skin if I may, and I certainly may.....The colors on the sleeping/angry ghosts are horribly muted. I know they didn't exist in the old game, but still. They just look bad. All of the other 'characters' are bright and colorful, but these look drab and boring...Inky isn't cyan. For the non-classic skins this is fine. But for the 'classic' skin, why isn't he cyan?..The ghosts have black eyes. I'm fine with this in regards to the angry ghost chain, but why do the four main ghosts not have blue eyes?..The normal 'pac-dots' are round. In the original game, circles weren't invented yet. The dots were small squares. In this regard, and for the eye color of the ghosts, the Type A skin does a better job than the classic skin does!I dunno. The classic skin does some things right, but I just can't get over the nitpicks. It completely fails at being 'classic'. But I can't change my recommendation on that alone.. nobody can. It's still a fantastic game. ...I just won't be using the classic skin all that much. :)"

I can't believe I never wrote a review for one of my most played, yet PERFECT games on Steam.Anyway..If you like pacman with a twist I recommend buying this one as it offers about 15 hours of full gameplay through all mazes across the past and present versions of pacman. Oh and yes, it supports all steam functions, and it is more-less one of the best versions of pacman existing in my opinion.Yes there are ups and downs with this version. For starters the PC variant(or at least on windows 8.1) it seems to be a tad off with sounds, or some sounds compared to the ps3/xbox versions seem to not function or just break. a minor bug.Also the fact that some keyboards are simply not fast enough to handle the controls of how fast you are actually moving in this game(at speed 50 it seems fine but using a few generic keyboards or a low end Logitech seemed to not register movements, might be me, who knows, can't tell you.)Its also a light game even though it has a bit of graphics eye candy it can run on low end hardware(however my tablet with the Intel Z3735 throttles after about 10 minutes which can ruin game play so keep that in mind)Also this game has a tablet mode(thus why i tried it with said tablet, surface pro 3 owners should be fine however)This game also runs well under Wine, just be mindful to actually install the right font to play under linux.Lastly this game is really short. There is DLC which is nice, but this game is for something to play quickly, not something longterm, really it feels like a game that should be on a smart phone actually(wait, isnt it?)I give this game a high rate of approval and if i had to rate it out of 10, it would get a 8.8 and heres why-There are minor bugs, none game breaking but still minor bugs in the game-Hackers ruined the score boards, you can still get into the top 5% but its a challenge-No linux native port-Can be wonky on some devices-Tablet support is hit and miss, some tablets will not function with this mode enabled sadly so keep that in mind-On the plus side, it runs on low end hardware.-Can be purchased on sale for cheap, I recommend the DLC as well for added fun!"

It is not very puzzled, so you likely won't get stumped. When I was playing, I finally noticed after soooooo many games that it was on the difficulty expert (Hardest Difficulty). There is normal games like 5 and 10 minute plays, and there is also time trials (Which Arn't A Trial). They are short but the speed is insane. There is lots of different maps, and they all are done well. My favourite part of this game is that you can get over 20 ghosts chasing you in a line, and then eat them all with a powerup."

Namco has modernized the Pac-Man formula by recognizing that high-level Pac-Man is a pray-as-you-go real-time travelling salesman optimization problem.Once you’ve grokked the (entirely deterministic) optimal route for chomping dots, popping pills and avoiding ghosts, what remains is an extremely low-margin input timing optimization game, twisting Pac-Man around bends as quickly as possible to shave milliseconds off level clear time.Unromantic as it sounds, the first part of the problem of mastering Pac-Man is rote and redundant. It is, primarily, a question of discipline, since mastery can be achieved in two ways: Either you repeat the optimal path until it is way past muscle memory and your primary cause of RSI, or you can simply draw a long arrow from Pac-Man’s starting point through the optimum path and practice turning really fast.With this in mind, Pac-Man offers no real challenge outside of its simple timing exercise, since only the pink ghost can actually cut you off, and its movement is fully predictable. This reality would discourage many a designer. After all, the game has been revealed a sham: Fully deterministic, lacking in challenge and with perfect execution only long, boring hours of Steve Wiebemanship away.Fortunately, Namco recognized this truth -- and cultivated it. In derederedeconstructing Pac-Man into PMCEDX+, Namco has drawn that arrow on the screen for you so you know where to go, and made the ghosts a potentially inconvenient rather than lethal visual reward♥♥♥♥♥progress indicator♥♥♥♥♥packed lunch, eagerly following Pac-Man down the dotted optimum, only the pink one breaking formation and occasionally trying to fool you -- deterministically, of course.Dot trails are punctuated by fruits, which spawn the next set of dots, ghosts, fruits -- and maybe a power pill, allowing you to realize the value of your ghost tail, that yellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turning face and eating its tail from the neck down, freeze-frame on each delicious chomp of ectoplasm. It’s Snake where you eat your own tail.The challenge is still turning as fast as you can, and -- as the ever-accelerating pace turns from manic to chaotic -- trying not to miss your turn, lest you nearly crash into a ghost, slowing time to a crawl to let you dodge while the stopwatch keeps ticking in real-time, tenth of a second passing, then a fifth and your world record hopes are dashed.PMCEDX+ is Pac-Man stripped entirely of any pretension that choice matters, that creative application of affordances is a virtue and that players seek something more than the right neurotransmitters in the right place at the right time. It is honest about its finely-honed, eagerly embraced degeneracy, its monomaniacal faith in the sublimity of the core Pac-Man experience.Undistracted by false choices and ghosts that never really haunted you anyway, you are encouraged to embrace the aesthetics of pure performance and pop some pills. You should."

Nostalgia time.  Well, I was dead wrong.  Don't get me wrong, it's Pac-Man alright... but radically different.  The game dynamics are vastly improved.  The pellet pattern changes dynamically within the game, making the board feel more like a GAME board than a maze where you simply have to navigate every corner, as it was in the original.  The ghost chases are INSANELY fun.  I had what must have been 50 ghosts chasing me in a row, like the classic ""snake"" game.  And then the it was my turn to eat THEM!!  One after the other in rapid succession, down the giant yellow gullet.  There's a ""warning"" slow down to give you time to react when you're about to be eaten, but it feels natural and far less frustrating than the original Pac-Man where you hit a ghost and that was it... bloo, Bloo, bLOO, BLOOP!

And it's Pac-Man. You should probably play it.Pros:Refined and faster-paced gameplay versus the original!New mechanics and massive modifications that help differentiate it from the original Championship Edition.Stellar Persentation.Tons of visual options, music, and bonus time trials.Nitpicks:DLCs are cool but they seem a bit unnecessary.The menus feel a bit clunky to move around.Cons:Leaderboards have been filled with cheaters, ruining one of the best aspects of the game.The ReviewIt’s easy to see why this game was a massive hit during the early XBLA/PSN days. It took the Iwatani-designed version of the original Championship Edition and went even farther with it. Despite the naming, it is a much more different game from the original Championship due to it’s much faster pace, brand new mechanics, and loads of new visual/audio features.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX throws away the survival element from the 1980 classic, and instead incentivizes players to follow patterns and munch on hundreds of ghosts for the best score possible. Eating the fruit upon eating all of the pellets on one side will rotate and change the other side of the level into a new layout, repeating in the same order until the timer runs out. It's very now a score-em-up, with you earning the majority of your points from collecting a massive chain of ghosts, then eating all of them with a power pellet.And this is the one major change that fundamentally redesigns this game as a whole. Various ghosts are now spread across the level layouts, and you can get them to follow Pac-Man, following his every move. You want these ghosts to chase you, as you’ll eventually be able to rack up insane amounts of points by picking up a power-pellet. But don't worry, because if you feel overwhelmed or are trapped, the game allows you to use screen-clearing bombs to push the ghosts back, which can be valuable to those who want to save precious seconds, or slow the in-game speed that rapidly increases while the game is playing. Basically, the game has almost a huge amount of new mechanics that's easier to show than talk about.And these new game mechanics aren't the only major differences with CE DX. The game’s speed now ramps up even faster the more pellets you eat, there are even more levels, time trial modes for each level, and a lot more visual options to change. Because of this, Championship Edition DX ends up becoming a surprisingly fresh experience that introduces a different type of way of playing Pac-Man, albeit one that isn’t exactly going for what made Pac-Man work. It’s main challenge is now pattern memorization, rather than the effective movement + score hunting present in the original. But like the original Pac-Man, it doesn’t get old that easily!Presentation-wise is relatively decent, although the game’s main menu is terrible in both its visual look and actually accessing things with it. The music is nothing special but is definitely well-made for the game, and the visuals for the game can be customized. You can change the game’s artstyle and music in any level, and it’s a really unique and cool feature, although some of the visuals are very hit-and-mess (Ghostly Adventures *cough cough*).DLC is a bit of a mixed bag. While the concept of new levels and themes are cool, some of them were just done poorly (Ghostly Adventures *hack* *wheeze*). They’re better picking up when the game + DLC pack is on a absurdly good price, because otherwise I wouldn’t see myself buying all of this.PC Optimization is relatively normal. It can probably run on a typical Windows Tablet since the original PC version was built off of that, so it’s definitely not a big worry. I wish there were more resolution options, however. Leaderboards are unfortunately quite the mess, so you can forget playing for the best score online since everyone has already blatantly cheated their way up.There’s really not much to talk about when it comes to this game though. It’s Pac-Man. It’s Pac-Man, Championship Edition DX, a completely different and fun way of playing the game. And you should play it.TL;DR - If you like Pac-Man or good score-em-ups, you should definitely pick this gem up.For more reviews on all sorts of games, followLots' o Giveaway'sgroup curations and reviewshere!"

,Recommended,236450,16246572,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,Shadow the Edgelord,"In PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition DX+ you play a small MAN named PAC. It is PAC's job, as the last surviving member of a near extinct race of super-beings known as MANs, to hunt down and attempt to destroy those who brought his own race to the brink of extinction.Throughout the course of the game you will travel to many of the large, colourful metropolises, known as MAPs. These MAPs are the home cities of the Ghosts, a race of somewhat dim-witted, as well as colourful, sentient beings. The Ghosts are the primary antagonists of the game, and it is your job to consume their eggs in an attempt to wipe out their race. In the same way, you will also find yourself devouring their primary sources of food, in an effort to deny them supplies. The Ghosts are, by nature, a swarming race of expert close-combatants, who will stop at nothing to overwhelm PAC and destroy him, as they did the rest of his race.A new side of PAC is revealed in this game, one which was previously unseen in other games featuring him, such as Mario Kart and Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing Transformed. This is his violent and fanatical side. In almost every level, PAC makes use of bombs which he straps to his body and detonates, should he be surrounded by the antagonists. It is for this reason that there has been so much controversy over this game, especially with some of the middle eastern gaming companies, such as IGN and Kotaku.Through the use of an interdimensional source of energy, known as 'power-ups', PAC can traverse the aether and enter a realm whereby he has the ability to remove the Ghosts from time and space. His race managed to harness the power-ups and condense them into small usable spheres, which is the main reason why the MANs were so feared, and why the Ghosts rose up against them. You will make use of this energy fairly frequently, and I feel it adds a nice flavour to the frantic and fear-driven gameplay that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Overall this is a fairly decent first person shooter, with some good RTS mechanics thrown in that really strengthen the gameplay, and harken back to the MOBA roots of PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition DX+.8/10"

,Recommended,236450,15989245,"Posted: 24 May, 2015",all,Harley,"Some classic games age better than others.Pac-Man is one of those titles that still plays well today despite the fact it originally came out in 1980. That doesn't mean that it's perfect, however, nor does it mean that people have been happy to leave it alone since that time. Indeed, the Wikipedia entry listing all the Pac-Man games throughout history includes no fewer than 51 games (not including compilations) that either focus on or feature Pac-Man and/or his family at one point or another -- though many of these games radically deviated from the original formula of eating all the dots in a maze while avoiding the unwanted attentions of four ghosts.Of all the adaptations that remain at least reasonably true to the original game, two of the finest are surely 2007's Pac-Man Championship Edition, which made the game a timed score-attack affair, and its 2010 follow-up Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.Om nom nom. Or something.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX (hereafter Pac-Man CE DX) was a masterclass in how to modernize an arcade classic: it kept the original gameplay intact while simultaneously incorporating features that simply wouldn't have been possible on the hardware of 1980. Its biggest change to the formula was the addition of ""sleeping"" ghosts scattered around the ever-changing maze layouts; passing close by them would cause them to wake up and start following Pac-Man in an ever-lengthening rainbow-colored trail. Scoring highly in Pac-Man CE DX was a matter of deliberately building up this trail to be as long as possible, then unleashing a Power Pellet to gobble up as many as you could in rapid succession, the screen exploding in a shower of disembodied ghost eyes flying off the screen as Pac-Man chomped his way to victory.The simple addition of the sleeping ghosts had a huge impact on the way you had to play Pac-Man CE DX. Because they were always in the same, predictable locations, it became possible to calculate an ""optimum"" route through the game's maze layouts, though actually successfully executing that optimum route became more and more difficult as the game accelerated to speeds '80s arcade game makers could only dream of. Fortunately, the game provides a number of ""time attack"" modes which prioritize quickly completing mazes over scoring as many points as possible, and these provide a helpful means of learning the layouts a little at a time before applying them to the 5- or 10-minute score attack modes that provide the game's main, insanely addictive draw. Alternatively, you can use the ""Ghost Combo"" mode to test how many ghosts you can successfully chomp in one go before a Power Pellet's effects wear off.If you played Pac-Man CE DX back in 2010, you already know all this, of course, and you're probably wondering what that little plus sign at the end of the title indicates.Well, it's not a completely new game, though the ""Plus"" edition does mark its first appearance on PC platforms via Steam. Rather, the new version -- available as a free update for those who already own it on console -- adds a few extra bits and pieces while keeping the core game experience just as it's always been. Specifically, it adds some social and comparison features to make it a little easier to check out how you're doing compared to your friends, and a new set of ""medals"" to complement the existing bank of achievements and trophies. The game also now has support for add-on content which can either be purchased separately or acquired via the ""All You Can Eat"" bundle. Currently available DLC includes four new mazes, three new visual themes (based on Dig-Dug, Rally-X and the upcoming Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures) and two new background music tracks, one of which is the finest piece of Japanese jazz funk/drum and bass I've heard from Namco since Ridge Racer Type-4. Have a listen for yourself.The new mazes are interesting and worth a look for veterans. The Championship III course is a particular highlight, offering a significantly tougher challenge than any of the other courses in the new content -- I found it hard to even break a million on this one, while I'm comfortably well over 1.5 million on most others. Big Eater offers an entertainingly ghost-heavy (and consequently potentially high-scoring) romp that will probably take a few attempts to get your head around, while Mountain offers a highly technical, asymmetrical course that will likewise require a bit of practice to work out the best route through. The weak link in the new courses is probably Highway II, which is just a little too similar to its predecessor for comfort, though nonetheless features some interesting ""wrap-around"" layouts that require a keen awareness of how both sides of the maze relate to one another as you gobble your way off one side and chomp back on the other.One of the more annoying new features about the update is the ability to share achievements and medals on Facebook. Indeed, three of the available medals are tied directly to how many other things you've shared on Facebook, and in order to unlock the classic Pac-Man skin for the game, you need to share all of your achievements and five medals, making for a total of 17 separate posts cluttering up your Facebook page all in the name of making the game look like its 1980 original self.There are three main problems with this: firstly, the medals and achievements are all extremely easy to acquire with the exception of one, meaning they're not really worthy of bragging about; secondly, there's no means of posting the one thing you might genuinely want to share on social media, i.e. your actual score and leaderboard position; thirdly, try as I might, on both the Xbox 360 and PC versions I could not make the Facebook functionality work at all anyway, making the whole thing somewhat redundant. It feels like a half-hearted, unnecessary and badly implemented attempt to add social gaming features into a game that was already pretty good at encouraging competition between friends and among the community as a whole without shoehorning Facebook into the equation. It doesn't need to be there, and the fact that it doesn't work properly and thus actually locks people out of game content just adds insult to injury.The ""Classic"" skin is locked behind Facebook sharing. Boo!I can't stay mad, though. Despite the Facebook-related idiocy, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ remains as ludicrously addictive as it was the day it came out back in 2010 -- and the addition of a new Steam version means that a whole new audience can now discover it for the first time. Good integration with Steam's network on the PC version means that you can quickly and easily compare your performance to your Steam friends list right from the game's main menu, though it might have perhaps been nice to see a more direct means of challenging one another. Steam Cloud support also means that you can transfer your progress from one computer to another without having to unlock everything all over again, though the reliability of this was occasionally a little flaky while I was trying it out. I lost progress on one occasion, though it's possible this was more due to the dodgy Internet connection I had at the time than a problem with Steam Cloud or the game itself.Regardless of a few flaws here and there, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ remains the perfect coffee-break game -- you can sit down and play for just five minutes and feel like you've had a rewarding experience, but at the same time if you want to spend several hours perfecting your cornering on the game's wide variety of mazes, you can do that too. It's an enjoyably intense experience by yourself, but if you can recruit a few friends to set up an impromptu league of your own, it becomes one of the most addictive games in the known universe. You have been warned!10/10"

,Recommended,236450,9091353,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Senor,"Pac-Man CE DX (the predecessor to DX+) is a great game. The shocker with DX+ is twofold. One, the DLC stages are as good as the older stages*. Two, the menu update that came with DX+ makes the menus less responsive.CE DX on the Xbox 360 had simple and responsive menus. The menus are mostly the same in DX+, but the few things that they added slow everything down. There's Facebook sharing. Yuck. Whenever you select one of the special skins (Dig-Dug, Rally X, Pac is Back), everything slows to a crawl for around a second as the game loads the skin data and messes around with your settings.Apparently Namco won't let you play with Dig-Dug characters on a Pac-Man background, or use the Dig-Dug song for anything but the Dig-Dug skin. It's a very silly restriction, and since the practical effect of the restriction isless responsive menus, Namco and the company who did the port should be ashamed of themselves.Originally, the files for this game were in an easily moddable format. But then the fun police at Namco or Mine Loader Software had to put a stop to it, lest people create custom skins or levels. Everything is now packed into one not-moddable file. At best, this was done because they didn't want people to buy the base game and then pirate the special skins. At worst, it was because they were scared that people would create new content using their intellectual property. Either way, it's bogus, and very, very sad, since it took extra effort to REMOVE modding support.The game only runs at 720p, which if it were easier to mod might not be the case. If you use a 360 controller, don't forget to turn on vibration in the settings.*With the new DLC stages, it seems like they only exist in 5-minute mode. The regular DX (not +) stages can be played for 5 or 10 minutes, and have more unique mazes to cycle through before you see the same maze twice.Once you actually start playing, DX+ is the most fun you can have with Pac-Man. Pac-Man CE DX+ is a fantastic game with very unfortunate business decisions bogging it down. Yes, you should buy it. It's great. Get the version with all the DLC. It's worth it."

This is the game!+Over 40 ghosts on screen+And many more!Cons:-The idea of there being 4 unique ghost characters is kind of lost-You kinda need a Facebook account...+and that's pretty much it!Overall, I do reccomend this game, it is a great one and if you ask me if I'd buy it for 10 bucks, I say go for it!

Yes, I lived in Japan in the 1980’s. “Pac Man” has a special place in my heart. “Pac Man  DX” is actually a very respectable and fun gameplay variant on the orginal Pac-Man, has excellent production values, and I would have given it my highest recommendation, but....... It has (apparently) NO ARCADE MODE! You can only play in short bursts, in “time attack” mode, and that is just not Pac-Man!!! You can play for five minutes, or ten minutes. No “next level,” and no cartoon intermissions. “Pac Man DX” only allows you a small time limit to play, on one level. Once the timer runs out, GAME OVER, no matter how well you were doing!THAT’S TERRIBLE!Pac Man (and just about all sequels and variants) is an endurance game; you keep playing until you lose your last life! Get to the next level, get the next “key”, see the next “cinema,”  keep going as long as you can.... that’s Pac-Man!If you’re a fan of “Pac Man,” then sure, buy this, expecially if it’s on sale, but you’ll probably be disappointed (as I was).

,Recommended,236450,8510216,"Posted: 2 January, 2014",all,Zeek,"[I've edited my review completely, changing my recommendation.]This game.  I've lost countless hours to it on the Xbox 360 version, and when I found out it was coming to PC, I was excited.  I really only ever got my 360 out to play this, and having it on my computer instead would be far more convenient.  Pac-Man CE:DX is the sequel to the first Pac-Man CE, something that, I believe, is still limited to consoles and handhelds.  That game was quite fun, and DX took that and gave it a serious make over, both visually and gameplay wise.This game captures the arcade feel of Pac-Man quite well, minus the sense of endlessness.  If you’ve missed the Pac-Man boat until now, you play as a yellow circle that eats dots and avoids ghosts in a maze.  Why?  That’s a good question.  But, all of that aside, DX is comprised of a couple maze types, all of which have differing qualities that set them apart.  For instance, one called ""Spiral"" features designs that mimic a spiraling shape, and has you constantly looping around.  ""Junction,"" as you may expect, has a variety of entrance and exit points that allow you to traverse all across the screen in a matter of seconds.  The big draw of the CE series of Pac-Man, is that once you clear a side of a maze (it's divided in half), a fruit will appear. Once eaten, the other side of the maze morphs into something else.  This goes on and on until time is up.  What DX does that the original CE didn't, is that there's now a train of ghosts that follows you around until you gobble them up.  There are ghosts scattered around the maze, sleeping, and they wake up and join the ghost train once Pac-Man passes.  There are also bombs that reset all the active ghosts on screen to the ghost pen in case you get yourself stuck.  Lastly, some ghosts will be carrying bombs or power pellets, so that when Pac-Man is able to eat them, he’ll collect that power-up.So, basically, the gameplay is: eat a bunch of dots, gather some ghosts to follow you, get a power pellet and go to town.  The maze patterns eventually repeat, and this goes on until time runs out.There’s a few different gameplay modes, with the big two being 5-minute and 10-minute runs.  These two modes are what you’ll be coming back to, and they are the core gameplay of doing what I’ve already described in the time limit.  The other modes are:*Ghost Combo: Eat a power pellet, and consistently eat ghosts for as long as possible.*Time Trial: Complete the course as fast as possible*Darkness: Complete the maze when only the dots light up the walls; everything is hard to see*Free Play: Do what you want in the maze without a time limitThe visual style of this game is fantastic, and is something my friends frequently joke about being something that would be wonderful to watch while under the influence of something.  Namco-Bandai kept the charm of the original game, and then smashed in some dubstep and trippy visuals.  You can also select different visual styles of Pac-Man (from the iconic arcade type, to the design seen in Pac-Mania) and colors for the maze.  Overall, they WILL NOT detract you from the game going on, but people watching may get a bit hypnotized.  (I will note that there are a few visual styles that make things a bit more difficult, but you’ll find what works best on your own.)The music is hit or miss for me.  Some tracks stand out, others are boring.  The annoying thing about the music in general, however, is that as time runs out, the music reaches a quickened pace to mirror the dread of ""you're almost out of time, better hurry up and get that last bonus.""  If you're like me, this can easily put you on edge and screw up where you normally don't.  I usually just keep the music off and listen to something a little more slow and/or peaceful (it's helped me numerous times when I tried to beat my high scores).You can breeze through most of the mazes in an hour or two, and you’ll be coming back for more to beat high scores and get on the leaderboards.  It’s important to note that you are paying for a game that you’ll play the same couple levels over and over again, aiming for a high score.  So, if that doesn’t sound like something you’d like, then I’d say not to bother with this game.  But, if you like arcade games, then this is absolutely perfect.However, there are a few small (or big?) issues with this port:This game suffers from random frame rate drops very frequently during normal play.  On consoles, this is unseen.  I don’t know why this happens, and it isn’t just my computer.  It can happen when there isn’t much going on screen, and also can happen when the screen is filled with activity.  This has been reported in the Steam community for this game, and I have a couple friends who have purchased this version of the game and they also experience random FPS drops.  Being that I already own this on the Xbox 360, I’d much rather play that version of it, since I know it’ll stay constant.The other issue I’ve found is that the textures in the game are definitely not as crisp as those on the console counterpart.  There are artifacts in the images (the “READY?” message before each game is where it is highly noticeable).  Why this is, I have no idea.  Apparently, at one point, this game was more mod-friendly, allowing file replacement for different sprites and textures in the game.  However, now, the game is grouped into one large file that you can’t edit.  I’d imagine this might have been fixable, but, I have no idea.The biggest problem, however, is the frame rate issue, since that has tripped me up a few times while playing, and I don’t understand why it’s even happening.  Other people have experienced this, and you probably will to during playing.  This game requires quick reflexes, and if the game drops a few frames during those times, it can make you run into a ghost when you meant to turn.Despite all of that, the game isn’t bad on the PC.  If you don’t have a 360 or a PS3, this does get the job done.  However, if you have an easily accessible 360 or a PS3, I’d recommend getting it on there instead of Steam, since the game doesn’t have any issues (and the leaderboards are far more populated)."

Visually, it's eye candy and it gives the feeling of being on a modernized dedicated arcade machine. The audio track is perfect and creates a mood of tension even before things get hectic. There are new game mechanics and powerups that add nice twists without corrupting the feel of the game. I usually hate leaderboards because I just don't care how well or badly strangers are doing, but they added the ability to replay other people's runs, which is a great way to learn new tricks. It isn't perfect, however. It doesn't support Logitech controllers, and I mean AT ALL. It's not that the buttons do the wrong thing, they do NOTHING. But even if it did work, they took the lazy road and hard-coded the controller layout, which I don't forgive even in a low-budget indie game. But despite that irritant, I still recommend the game for PAC-MAN enthusiasts."

You still eat dots, run from ghosts until you eat a power pellet and can consume the ghosts. This time though, the maze changes as you play.Length:4-5 hoursGenre:Maze, ArcadeScore:5.5/10Full Review:It’s another Pac-Man game, it doesn’t differ much from the original game. For those that somehow don’t know what Pac-Man is about, you play as a little yellow… whatever it is that Pac-Man is, and you run around a maze eating dots, avoiding the ghosts that try to kill you, eating a power pellet so that you’re able to consume the ghosts instead of them doing you in, and eating fruit. The aim of the game is simply to get as high of a score as possible.The game has some slight alterations from the original, instead of playing through a series of repeating levels, you play each level for a set time limit, aiming to earn as high a score as possible.  Each maze is divided into two halves, when you eat all the dots on one half of a maze, a fruit will appear on the other half. When you eat the fruit, the dotless side of the maze will change, spawning new dots, ghosts, and corridors to navigate.The game also features a few other modes in addition to the main score attack modes, a series of time trials for each level, which are sadly lacking in any real depth or quality, and a mode where you try to eat as many ghosts as you can before your power pellet runs out. (You can extend the pellet’s duration by consuming another power pellet).That’s about all there is to the game. There’s not much to it, and while I prefer the original Pac-Man to this one, it’s still a decent time killer, able to waste 10 or 20 minutes here and there. Just don’t expect anything mind-blowing."

This review will be pretty long, but if you do not want to read the whole thing, just buy the game now; it is almost perfect. So anyways, on the review. I originally bought this game a few years ago on the Xbox Live Arcade, and loved it. I never really played it all that much, but I still enjoyed it enough to want a PC version. After 3 long years of waiting, it happened; I saw DX + in the steam store, and was really excited. I was finally going to be able to play this game on my PC! After a month of waiting, I purchased the game and my expectations were really high. I quickly downloaded the game, and started playing. Hearing the awesome menu music brought back some memories from when I first played the game 3 years ago. I then selected the Championship II course and played the 5 minute score attack mode. I was instantly hooked; I knew this game was worth the $15 I paid for it. After 30 minutes of play, I noticed a few things that detracted from the overall experienced. First off, the game was locked at 720p, and you cannot change the resolution in game. I am sure there is a fix by forcing it to a 1080p resolution through steam, but it is still unfortunate that you cannot do it in the game itself. Although, I was able to resolve this problem by switching the game to windowed mode, which I do not personally mind (although this could be a potential issue). Another negative is the lag, which happens from time to time. I have a really powerful system, which can run all games on max settings, with a minimum of 30 FPS. So for the game to lag, it has to be either poorly optimized or poorly coded. There is one more thing which I should mention, which is that in order to unlock the classic skin, you need to share some achievements and medals on Facebook. This was not bothersome for myself, but I can see it being an issue for some. Anyways, back on to the positives. There is a lot of variety; there are a ton of courses to play and master, a ton of BGM for you to listen to while playing, a ton of skins and quite a few different modes in each course. If you plan to play every course and get an S rank on each one, expect to play this game for a minimum of 30 hours. This game gives you a ton of bang for your buck; it is very addictive. To sum up, DX + is fantastic, and is definitely worth your time and money. Even though there are a few flaws, the pros FAR out way the cons, and is must buy."

I think I played this game when it was free one weekend and it was just a freaking blast. It was on sale and I bought it along with the DLC for it. I know I don't have alot of hours logged on it but trust me, this game is outrageously fun. I mean, assuming you like your Pac-Man extremely fast.This isn't like the Pac-Man of old, it's hard to describe but you can see it in the store video. It gives you dots to gobble, in certain patterns rather than giving you the whole screen. Once you get all the dots there are (and there are routes you can take if you notice), more dots will appear. Any time you turn the ghosts blue, for every ghost eaten, this game gets faster and faster, until it's just utterly insane.You can die multiple times, and continue, and you can hit Enter any time if you have a bomb and it will blast all the ghosts away, as a kind of an emergancy save if you get trapped. But if you lose ghosts, you lost all the points you could have gotten from eating them, so for high scores, you don't want do that.There are tons of stages and lots of modes, literally, dozens of them and while they aren't horribly different, they are different enough and they unlock as you defeat ones that already open. There are time attacks, eat the most ghosts, get the high score, and a few other styles that the match will take place in.There's tons to do and it's only $9.99 for it! If you think you'll love Pac-Man on speed, you want this game. You will not regret it."

It is the most perfect traditional style Pac-Man game to date. Words can't describe how satisfying the experience of playing this game is.But here's where the BUT comes in...I paid $9.99 to get this game complete via pre-order. It came with a bunch extra simple modifications to the game in the form of mazes, skins and extra background music. Pretty fair price for a complete package. However, once the game launched, all those extra options got taken out of the game and sliced up into various unnecessary DLC packs. Let me just say this is a complete insult to Pac-Man fans everywhere! There was no reason (except for greed) to separate these features out of the game when it launched. Let's take a closer look at this crock of sh... I mean smelly chocolate pudding.For $9.99 I got the game plus all of the below. Now if you plunk down your $.9.99, you'll get the base game and have to pay extra for each of the items listed. I'll put the price beside every piece, so you can see how it adds up. For heaven's sake, these are just modifications to the game; maze configurations, skins, and Background music:$1.99 Mountain Course$1.99 Big Eater Course$1.99 Championship III and Highway II Courses$1.99 Dig Dug Skin$1.99 Rally X Skin$1.99 Pac Is Back Skin$.99 Pac Steps Music$.99 Reentrance MusicBuying these individually is insane and I'm sure no one will do that. But Namco thinks its doing you a favor by giving you an ""All You Can Eat"" pack after the fact for $14.99! That's the base game and every item listed above. But still, that's 50% more than what I paid for the game with all its content! Billy Mitchell would be rolling around in his grave (if he wasn't still alive).All I can say is, for the love of Pete, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until comes on sale! And I'm saying wait until it's no more than $5, AND includes the game with all it's DLC packs. Namco needs to get the message that gamers are sick and tired of being nickel and dimed. I am glad I preordered it, and that I'm enjoying the experience, but I'm really angry that so many companies think that this kind of BS is acceptable.What's next, a bow attached to Pac-Man for another $1.99 so I can play as the Ms's?"

You're still eating dots and avoiding ghosts like usual. What is new is now the stages change without interrupting gameplay and you find sleeping ghosts sprinkled seemingly randomly around the level. Also, the scoring emphasizes finding the fastest route around the maze and leading a train of ghosts behind you until you manage to find a powerpill and score lots of points for clearing the ghosts.Playing is genuinely fun in small doses and you can compare your scores alongside with your Steam-friendlist and all the players globally. On the other hand this ""social integration"" has gone downright ugly considering several of the achievements require you to announce some of other miniscule accomplishements in the Facebook! You want the retro Pac-Man visuals? Then you need to share over a dozen of varying achievements which gets embarrasing really; most of them aren't even any real feats, they'll just end up cluttering your FB profile. How awkward.Which leads to the final verdict: Would I recommend this game? Yes, unless you for some reason have always hated Pac-Man. The actual gameplay underneath the needless bloat is fun and you might even appreciate the techno soundtrack. There are ample customization over the visuals and style (some of them are DLC) and a few different game modes. You won't 100% clear this game in a couple of days. There's a demo available so give it a go. I'd say it gives you the very best impression of the game and does it's best to leave you hungry for more.

For such minor content, the costs are simply too high.

Get the best performance (highest score, best ghost combo, best time) and become the number 1 among players.Many people say that this game is too easy.Yes, you're absolutely right: lives are extremely easy to score, there's a slow motion that helps you to change direction at the very last moment, the AI of the ghosts is most of times pretty lacking, and there are bombs to save you in the most tight situation.But remember: this game's objective is NOT survival, it's about getting the best score and surpass the other players.Losing a life, abusing bombs or moving aimlessly means wasting time, and more time you waste less points you are going to score.The challenge is not the game itself: the other players are the real challenge. Do you think you can do better than that person right above you? Prove it.I just have a minor complaint about the controls: sometimes they don't seem to respond very well and Pac-Man will not change direction as I want. I don't know if it's a problem with the game (I tried both an Xbox and a PS3 controller. More or less same result) or just me because I'm not well accustomed to the very high speed this game can reach. Excluding this, it's okay most times."

This reinvention of the original classic is perfect in nearly every imaginable way. Design, sound, controls, variety, nearly everything a veteran of the original will enjoy. The game shifts away from pure survival (which can be taken advantage of with patterns) to a more fast-paced score attack where speed and score become more important. This makes the gameplay far more satisfying as you make split second decisions at extremely high speed to a kickass retro-inspired soundtrack to score as high as possible. Namco elaborates on this by incorporating a vast leaderboard system to compete with friends, reinvigorating the love of getting the high score on that arcade machine to a friend list or global level. I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about the game, other than the menus being a bit tedious at times, but this is irrelevant compared to the rest of the game design. This is an absolute must-by whether you are a long lover of the original games or have never tried it before."

76561198003874143,Recommended,236450,10907180,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,badwolfos,"I think Namco Bandai's new business model when it comes to updating its classics is one that involves respecting but putting aside some obsolete design practices such as lives (which, while still present, don't matter at all) in favor of three main focuses: progressive design ideas (dozens of ghosts), rekindling interest in still-relevant practices (points), and sensory overload. If you also own a 7th generation console that isn't the Wii, you can experience this first-hand in an arguably stronger fashion, at least in the latter focus, sensory overload, with Galaga Legions and Galaga Legions DX, both sister titles to Pac-Man Championship Edition DX and all part of the Namco Generations series that no longer exists. While the Galaga update is almost unbearably intense but still quite good, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ feels muted in tone by comparison but even more of a blast to play. It's clear that the design team were unafraid of implementing the new ideas in an attempt to keep a classic game fresh. Here, they throttle the gameplay forward as you use the familiar large glowing pellets to gobble up many, many more ghosts than you're used to. Gone are the days of looking out for every turn as you run and hide from the ghosts out to get you. Now, you're actively searching for ghosts to join the posse that follows you wherever you go. Some search for you, others lay sleeping in the lanes, but as soon as they spot you they abandon whatever it is they're doing and join the conga line, practically waiting for you to charge in when they turn blue. One of the most satisfying gameplay experiences one can have is saving up a DMV line of ghosts and suddenly turning on them and eating each and every one of them. The ghosts are no threat. Your real enemy is time, and speed. Once the game gets going so fast you can't keep up to make proper turns, Pac-Man careens out of your control.you know what actually i'm done writing this review it's ten bucks it's super fun get it"

Instead of multiple levels, Championship Edition DX+ offers a few levels with changing maps, all of which are score centric, either to do with points, speed, level memorization, and sometimes all three. Controls are tight, but require reflex, as the game ""speeds up"" and pushes your ability to keep up. The biggest draw out of everything, however, are the leaderboards and rankings, both of which allow you to see how well your friends are doing and compete, as well as worldwide. The rankings really draw a competative spirit in me, which gives me all the more reason to play this game.The All You Can Eat Edition includes all of the DLC, which adds levels, songs, and skins based on Pac-Man and various other Namco Bandai franchises. At the time of purchase, the All You Can Eat Edition was $3.74, which was easily worth it, considering the amount of content it adds, however, it seems that the usual price is $15. Is it worth $15? It really depends on how much you can squeeze from the game as far as rankings go. If you just want to complete the game, it shouldn't take more than a few hours, however, if you want to A rank, or be one of the players at the top, you're looking at tens or hundreds of hours on this game, especially if your friends have a competative spirit."

The gameplay may seem like the first Pac-Man in arcades, but don't let that fool you this Pac-Man has more tricks than you may believe.

I grew up playing it because it was one of the first games I could play besides Sonic The Headghog... Anyways, the only way I could discribe this game if you have played PAC-MAN in a previous setting... I would have the be about the same effect as going to your buddies house... Taking like 3 hits of acid and just tripping out for a very short peroid of time. It's not classic PAC-MAN by any means, but if I get a chance to take LSD while camping in the woods with my laptop...

My only dislike about this is that there is no local dual screen they tried to work in. Other than that, buy this game and all (well, maybe not all of it) the Downloadable Content they released.

This game is not a game that you will sti down and play for 5-10 hours it's a great game that you will play when you have nothing to do or you are bored. So frankly it will never get boring everytime you will enjoy it. Recommend it 100%.

An iconic charatcer and game from the Atari days (and preety much the only thing Bandai Namco is known for after Digimon and Tales, at a very distant third.)Champisonship Edition DX+ puts a unique spin on things. Instead of having just Inky, Pinky, Binky and Clyde there are also green monsters (and by monsters I mean ghosts) littered around, these ghosts chase Pacman in a single file line and there are also rainbow mazes. The quartet is still there and still going around their business. Ghosts that do notice him will glow in ranbow colors.Outsie of Time Trial, The objective is not to clear all the pellets, but rather to have as many ghose-monster chase you around the maze and then eat the super pellets (as the food just spawns more ghost now) to devour the line and rack up tonnes of points. The speed will increased the more you score. Another mechanic are the Bombs. You start off with a few to ue if you get surrounded. However these are a last resort due to their limitations. yu also get a matrix-style slowdown if you are close to the monsters, which you can use the bombs or...take a detour awar from the ghost, or go back and forth until a ghost takes a detour. Dpending on your skill you may get the ""No Bombs"" achivememt the first time or keep getting flashbacks to Touhou and other Bullet Hell games with bombs.Oh did I mention achivements? Why Yes there are 12 of them and they are preety easy to get form my experience. There are also 12 medals to get by completing tougher challenges. No cards though.Do I reccomend it. preety much.

I eventually bought this when on sale because of such a small price, and I was very pleased.  This edition of Pac-man takes a small twist on the original.  Instead of having a large layout where you must collect all the dots while avoiding/eating ghosts, you have several game modes from score attack, time trials, and ghost combo modes on several different evolving levels.  The levels change by laying out new paths of dots and ghosts that you pass by and follow you.  You also have the ability to collect bombs that go off and send all active ghosts back to the center if things get tight.  All in all, it makes the game more dynamic and exciting, especially when you rack up the ghost eating combos.  On top of this you are able to customize the graphics from old school to neon 80s.

You wake up ghosts as you pass them, and after a little while you'll find yourself with a conga line of them chasing you. Grab a power pellet and... massive points! It's very satisfying, but there's more to it than is let on. Some ghosts give you a power pellet when you eat them, resetting the timer for the pellet's effects to wear out. This encourages you to only eat the ghosts when you most need to, creating an element of ""how long can I continuously keep the timer going""?

During no time over the course of this review were virtual ghosts hurt or abused in any way. If someone you know is abusing ghosts, speak up and say something. It's never too late. And now, onto the review...If you're a living, breathing, actual human being over the age of ten, then most likely you've played 'Pac-Man' at one time or another. Growing up I would play at local arcades and pizzerias whenever I got the chance, but I never really cared all that much about the game. That is until I picked this one up during the 2014 Summer Sale. Now all I have to say is that 'Pac-Man' is highly addictive! Sure, the levels all look relatively similar, and all you're really doing is running around collecting dots and eating frantic ghosts, but as I said before; this game is insanely addictive.And if you're thinking to yourself that you've already seen everything 'Pac-Man' has to offer, then think again. Because this is not the same game that came out all those decades ago. That's right, 'Pac-Man' has been updated with new rules, game modes, stimulating colors, and best of all: competitive online score keeping. So now you and your friends can post your high scores for all to enjoy! But seriously, if you aren't familiar with 'Pac-Man', consider picking this one up. You really can't beat it."

,Recommended,236450,14029519,"Posted: 17 January, 2015",all,spincube,"In a nutshell: takes the classic Pac-Man formula (eat dots, avoid ghosts, score points), and puts it through a Hotline Miami filter.In not so quite a nutshell, Pac-Man CE:DX+ is as much a puzzle game as it is a high-score competition with your Steam friends list. The most obvious change to the classic formula is that, normally, the ghosts are obstacles to be avoided, right? Wandering the stages according to a brief list of AI rules, only to be eaten when you chow down on a power pellet and briefly turn the tables? In this game, that's slightly altered: the ghosts wandering the maze will chase you (with a nice '!' sound effect) when you get too close, stacking as you pass more 'sleeping' ghosts that block the maze. Eventually this queue of ghosts either gets so long that you end up crashing into your stack and dying, or you come across a power pellet, turn around, and wipe them out. The longer the queue, the more points you receive: risk and reward.Second change: how the game board ('maze', 'level', whatever) works. Classic Pac-Man had you eat all the dots on the stage to progress to the next level, with charming animated interludes. This time around your goal is still the same, but played against a timer: you can get strategic in order to maximise your score. Put simply: eat all the dots on one side (left or right) of the stage, and a fruit item will spawn on theotherside. When you eat that fruit item, theotherside of the game board will warp into a new layout.Thus, to really rack up the points you need to manage the ghosts on your tail, and keep on top of the stage that changes around you as you play. Then there's the countdown timer until Game Over, the speed level controlling your movement and the ghosts', and of course the fantastic, pounding electronic soundtrack that gets more and more intense as the seconds tick away. This game fires all the neurons that Hotline Miami did, and I love it.What I disliked: how the 'classic' Pac-Man skin is hidden behind in-game 'medals' that are separate from the achievement roster, and how 'sharing on Facebook' accounts for three of these medals. There's also no simple way of comparing your progress with your friends' - for a pick-up-and-play arcade game based on high score tables, I loathe having to go to a discrete 'LEADERBOARDS' option from the main menu. I would have thought that this would be front and centre, flashing at you at every possible choice. 'FRIEND has beaten your high score on TABLE in GAME MODE', etc. In short, it doesn't - from the course selection screens you can see your position in the 'global rankings', but that's it.To summarise, if you want your hair to go grey and wear your nerves down to smoking, charred wire, buy this game and go for the 'score 1,800,000 in five minutes' medal. If you're not a fan of fast-paced, arcadey, twitch-based puzzlish gameplay, avoid."

I could deal with the hacked score boards if there was a way to scroll down to see where the more realistic scores begin (less than 3 million) but access to scores is limited, for me trying to beat scores is one of the main reasons to play pacman, the developers should clean the score boards from hackers and then put something in place to stop them hacking (at least in the same way) again. For this reason I have to vote the game down, the game is really good but this really kills it for me.The game itself is probably the best and most interesting itteration of pacman ive ever played so if your ok with the scoreboards being a mess I can recomend it.

The music is catchy and booming to get my heart thumping, and you can miz and match different music tracks or sprite designs for a custom look that fits your tastes.Actually playing the game though bored me in about 15 minutes. The big problem being that through out the whole game, I just felt like I was following a marked line- and I was- a literal line of dots showing me the clearly correct way to navigate through the ghosts and get the perfect conga line of points the moment I touched the perfectly laid Power Pellet. Now technically there is nothing keeping me from going any which direction I want, but they've got the perfect line set up going so it'd just be foolish not to use it.So in the end my only input is just following a line, the only difficulty I ever encountered playing the game was occasionaly working my way back to the line because the game picked up so much speed that I accidentally miss a turn in the maze. Thus all the maps just feel same-y, the goal never changes, you just follow the line of dots endlessly."

76561198040600970,Recommended,236450,32035869,Posted: 28 May,all,Vamphaery,"SummaryA massive, dense series of time, score, and other challenges, utilizing the classic mechanics of Pac-Man, coupled with exponentially greater speed, route selection emphasis, a few gameplay tweaks, and much higher enemy count for racking up huge score combos.Who is this for?Anyone who loves Pac-Man, but is looking to have their skills tested to the utmost.Anyone who loves Pac-Man, but always wanted a faster, more intense experience.Anyone who loves fast paced, twitch-heavy action that increases in speed and challenge the better you perform.Anyone who doesn't mind repetition of a basic premise, honed to the nth degree.Who should steer clear?Anyone who dislikes the basic mechanical design of Pac-Man, naturally.Anyone who wants the classic Pac-Man experience (that is not to be found here.)Anyone who wants great variety in gameplay or map design.Anyone who tires of repetition and skill drills.Anyone who can't enjoy the simple impetus of ""can I beat my best score/time?"" and demands more payoff than that.Full reviewIf you've played Pac-Man - and if you're a gamer at all interested in the history of this industry, it's unconscionable if you haven't... go and find an actual cabinet somewhere in your town and play it before coming back to this - then you know that at higher scores/levels, the game can get pretty frenetic and intense.Championship Edition DX+ takes those high level Pac-Man dynamics to their absolute extreme. It needs to be made clear: this is not the classic Pac-Man in a new graphical package with some optional modes. This is an entirely different, highly specialized Pac-Man experience, dedicated to speed, score, and precision.The game consists of progressively challenging score attacks and time trials, challenging players to find the fastest and most efficient route to achieving specific goals. Goals include eating as many ghosts as possible, eating a certain number of fruits within a time limit, or simply surviving for a set amount of time as the game's speed ramps up with each ghost eaten and each dot sequence completed.To that end, eschewing the classic Pac-Man design and instead amplifying it, the number of ghosts and the rate at which the game pace intensifies and escalates, have been increased dramatically. You are given a limited number of bombs as emergency countermeasures when in a particularly sticky spot, and eventually the pace becomes so frantic that only the most skilled players will be able to change direction quickly enough to follow the ideal paths for score and enemy avoidance (or consumption.)There are a number of unlockable maps, each with its own specific challenges. As you complete challenges, more maps and likewise more challenges (including in maps you've already unlocked) appear. The result is what feels like an endless (though, there is a finite number) of time and score trials, each forcing you to master the given map and advance your skills accordingly.There are a number of different visual styles available both for Pac-Man and his enemies, and for the maps themselves, which can be freely mixed and matched. There is also a large DLC suite available for the game which adds yet more content.PROSFamiliar Pac-Man fun anyone can pick up and play.Skill ceiling that goes extremely high for those who want it to.Clever map designs that force forethought and quick reflexes.Extremely gratifying, cathartic, and viscerally pleasing to chow down on endless rows of ghostsPlenty of visual customization (for a Pac-Man game,) and a fun mix of classic game inspired contemporary jams to listen to while you chomp.Leaderboards, achievements, and medals for those who want them.Facebook integration for those who want it. (I don't, but... options never hurt anyone.)CONSLeaderboards commonly dominated by cheats.May feel highly repetitive to some players.No classic arcade version mode (which may be especially disappointing given the barebones and problematic Pac-Man Museum port on PC.)No option for strictly classic music mode, which would have been nice in my opinion.Lots of visual customization options, but no way to save them so that every map automatically starts with your favorite settings (some maps default to their own style and must be changed every time manually.)ConclusionI owned this game for years on Xbox 360 before finally buying it for PC as well. If you love Pac-Man but are craving more challenge, speed, and intensity, this is definitely the game for you. It's a smörgåsbord of seemingly endless Pac-Man trials.This is a game that can be played fairly casually if one wishes to do so, but if you want to climb the leaderboards (although on Steam, they are unfortunately dominated by hacks/cheats much of the time,) you will be forced to achieve a level of skill with Pac-Man that makes the game worthy of the ""Championship"" moniker.In either extreme, and everything in between, the simple, elegant gameplay of Pac-Man is just as fun as ever, and reaches its arguable apotheosis here."

The game is incredibly fun, it's perfect for just pick up and play with no stress or expections other than just seeing if you can enter that state of zen that lets you bump up your high score.

It doesn't have very enticing progression; you kind of just pick a level, pick some rules, and do your best. When you start the level, you move slowly, and gradually increase speed as you go, which is kind of fun, but sometimes not. The AI of the ghosts is different from other PaC Man games; in this, if they spot you, the ghosts will follow behind you at a rate in which they can never catch you, unless you accidentally crash into them. This can lead to very long chains of ghosts following you, which you can in turn completely dessimate after powering up. The best part of the game however, is how time will slow if a ghost is about to get you, so even though the game is incredibly fast-paced, it gives you a very lenient opportunity to escape, should you need to. Kind of makes you feel like more of a bad♥♥♥♥♥than you really are, and I like that."

You think that's bad enough? Well, you can check leaderboards for the individual courses, and those come with replays! Watch ANY of the top 10, any you'll notice the major difference between the replays and the scoreboard. They should keep an eye on the replays more strictly to make sure the scores match, but they don't. This is blatant proof that there are hackers, and people that just don't want to see anyone else at the top.TLDR, If you want to be at the top 10 in this game, you're up against hackers, so good luck with that! Just consider yourself lucky if you make it to the A rank. :/Overall, don't worry about leaderboards (See minirant above for reasons why), but it's an addicting time-waster if you need one!"

PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ is a fun and addicting game with an amazing modern touch on the PAC-MAN franchise. The game starts out slow in the beginning of levels but gradually speeds up until it becomes a hectic, flashy race against time as you speed around the level collecting Pac-Dots and dodging ghosts at insane high speeds.Gameplay -  7/10Soundtrack -  8/10Overall - 7/10"
