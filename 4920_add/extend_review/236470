One thing led to another, and it turns out I was completely wrong about something: the ""stuttering"" the ghosts do sometimes in Super Pac-Man and Pac & Pal is apparently intentional behavior. I have no idea why, but that's that. Multiple sources seem to confirm this. Now don't I look like a jerk! That said though, I'm still preeetty sure Ms. Pac's sprite isn't supposed to jitter like it does in her game. Correct me if there's an explanation for this or if I'm crazy.Also, something I neglected to mention, while it's true that shutting the arcade cabinet off for most of these games would delete the scores, most past collections of these games would save the scores when you quit anyway, as if it was left running until you came back. You can still see your top score in the leaderboards, this just bothers me for some reason.I still don't think this is an ideal compilation, but credit where it's due, my review wasn't entirely accurate and I apologize for that.Original Review Follows:How do you mess this up?I love Pac-Man, I really do, but this is not a very high quality collection. Let's go game by game, shall we?Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Attack, Pac-Land, Championship Edition, and Battle Royale work as intended, as far as I can tell. Pac-Mania looks really washed out and some of the music sounds like a garbage disposal is going off, but hey, it was always like that. And of course, Pac-Land is like, some kind of shoddy MS Paint platformer. It's alright. A smaller version of CE is included in the superior and faster paced CE DX (The Championship 1 stage), which is already on Steam, so if that's what you're after, you should probably check that out first. Battle Royale is best played with friends, having no proper scoring system (each player is assigned a title like ""Most Pac-Man Eaten,"" or ""Won Most Rounds""...etc etc.). There is no online component to speak of.Some of the games seem to have emulation problems. In Pac & Pal, sometimes the ghosts freeze and jitter in place. The same thing happens in Super Pac-Man. I somehow doubt this was intended behavior. In Ms. Pac-Man (which, by the way, costs $5 to download after March) the player's sprite seems to wiggle around when heading up or down.And I just want to take a minute to talk about Pac-Man Arrangement here. You may be thinking it'sTHISgame, but in fact it is some other, uglier, sort-of related but also not related at all type 3D game from the PSP Namco Museum, with some tedious bosses and slow freakin' ghosts. I have no idea who could have looked at both of these side by side and said ""Yes,thisis the better version."" Why not include both Pac-Man Arrangements? Why are there two games called the same thing in the first place?The menus are okay. You can unlock badges from getting achievements in the games, which themselves unlock character models and maybe other stuff, I don't know; I haven't played long enough. Each game has some options, but no option to turn off the really bright borders around the screen. Not a deal-breaker in itself, but odd.So then comes the matter of price. Is $20 worth it for these games, and then $5 additionally for Ms. Pac? Considering Namco has released many much more fully featured, and properly emulated collections in thepastfor typically similar prices, I'd have to say: unfortunately, no. Heck, if you can navigate the Japanese PSN store, you can find all the old PS1 Namco Museum collections, and those are still as awesome as ever, complete with actual ""virtual museums"" to walk around in filled witth all kinds of obscure pamphlets and magazines and such. The version on my phone is better! And as far as I'm concerned, nothing has topped Tengen's Ms. Pac-Man port on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive.So if you get anything from this review, it's that classic Namco arcade games are awesome, but this is not the best, or even a ""good"" way to play them as it is right now. Find some other way to play these games, unless this gets a major patch and a price drop. Sad times.P.S. the cartoon sucks too."
,Recommended,236470,13208171,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,Aro,"This was another case for me of buying a game regardless of the mostly negative reviews to judge it for myself, and it's times like this that makes me wish Steam had a ""Mixed"" option for writing reviews. While I like this collection it also has a load of issues that need addressing. First let me start by saying that I love retro games, arcade classics such as Pac-Man, Q*Bert, Galaga, Dig-Dug etc. so this looked like a must-have for me, it's enjoyable but let's just say that I'mvery, very gladI bought it while it was on sale (£5 as opposed to the original £15).What you see is what you get, a collection of Pac-Man arcade classics varying from the original to some obscure games I've never heard of, a nice wide selection giving you some variety for your money. Each game plays as intended and great when you've got some time to kill just like in the old days, the collection is as follows:- Pac-Man (Original)- Pacmania- Super Pac-man- Pac-Attack- Pac & Pal- Pac-Land- Pac-Man Arrangement- Pac-Man Battle Royale- Pac-Man Championship Edition- Ms Pac-Man (Sold as DLC for some reason)Now, everything does indeed play as intended and for the most part works fine, but there are some annoying problems with this game that really grind on peoples nerves, aside from the fact that this ""museum collection"" is missing quite a few other Pac-Man titles such as Pac-Man Plus.The main issue here is that the default keyboard controls for the most of the menus and title screens are absurd and the gamedoes not give you any optionto change them, which is both strange andreallyfrustrating. On the note of options, the main game has no option menu at all, so you are stuck with the default resolution, while this doesn't bother me, I understand that a lot of you will find this annoying...While not necessarily a gameplay issue, the ""museum"" feature itself is rather pointless and tedious, it is merely aesthetic and serves no real purpose. In order to fill the museum, you must earn stamps by achieving some set goals, some of which are really hard to accomplish such as the 500,000 point stamps on some games. This ultimately feels really grindy and dull very quickly and makes life difficult if you care for getting the achievements provided, unfortunatley I do. :PSo the collection is not without it's flaws, some games such as Pac-Man Battle Royale could be played to their full potential by adding online multiplayer support, unfortunately it is limited to local multiplayer which is too bad. If you're a fan of arcade classics and this happens to be on sale, by all means, buy it. It delivers what it promises on the arcade calssics front, just be warned that the lack of options, key-binding and grinding features make this game much more tedious than it should be. I don't consider this to have been a bad purchase so I do recommend it, but not for it's full price, not at all! Make sure you get it when it's cheap, especially if you plan to buy the Ms Pac-Man DLC too.If you are not interested in retro Pac-Man and would like something more modern and fast-paced, pick up Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ instead of this, it's better than the version provided with this game.Can't believe I wrote this much information about a Pac-Man game...

No video options, so the games are stuck playing in tiny windows at their original resolution, making it legitimately difficult to play on a large screen. This even goes for the Battle Royale arcade game; the version on here is exactly the same as the arcade, which means low resolution and local multiplayer only. Also noticed substantial input lag on the older arcade games when using a 360 stick. A pathetic collection, not remotely worth the asking price, and legitimately sad that Namco/Bandai/Whoever cares so little for the treatment of their classics. Absolutely do not buy.If you want a good classic collection, look at M2's stuff or even the old Namco Museums on PS1."

You both also cant play using the same keyboard.

That being said, whether to buy Pac-Man Museum is your choice. For the full price, not so much ($25 for game + DLC is basically too much), as I had waited for 75% to roll around for the holiday sale. In the case of Steam (or anniversary sales), get it ASAP.A somewhat ok game overall; a few problems here and there (most especially on Battle Royale -- no online multiplayer), and not really into Ghostly Adventures. If you're looking for the original Championship Edition, it's in there. Otherwise a nice collection of games to choose from. (I have been getting a bit of delay on controls, but I may not have made the correct settings on the graphics card for this game yet.)I'd recommend CE DX+ way more than this, but this is still a decent choice during the sale, because I wouldn't pay $20 for little features.

,Not Recommended,236470,12194532,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Cameraman,"Namco has officially lost the right to complain about losing business to emulators like MAME.The menu is unintuitive and clearly not designed for keyboards. People use those for PC games a lot of the time, and they're a valid input method even for super complex games like Pac-Man.The game is locked to 1280x720 resolution. With my 1920x1080 monitor, this means it's letterboxed and the picture is distorted. Fullscreen is also forced on, bypassing launch commands. I think that needs emphasis because that has to be an aspect of the program written in and passing the inspection of at least one or two supervisors, tacitly approving something as bizarre and completely unnecessary as locking fullscreen in a final product.I can't tell if this is all because of some kind of lazy porting of a collection made for the iPad or something, but these are not problems people should be running into in 2014. It's worth noting that none of these things are issues with unofficially built emulators, which double-downs on how pathetic this package is. I feel ripped off and would ask for a refund, but those don't exist, putting publishers beyond accountability in the Steam/Origin era."

,Recommended,236470,22988609,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,Harley,"You're mostly buying this for Battle RoyaleLet's not beat around the bush here -- with the new Pac-Man Museum compilation, you're getting a bunch of really old games you've most likely played before, a few you probably already own, and Pac-Man Battle Royale. Royale is a bit of a unique release, as it's only been playable outside of Japan at special events and arcades, and has been highly sought out by fans of the genre.To be blunt, this is the perfect opportunity to wait for a sale just to pick up Royale.Pac-Man Museum (PC, PS3, Xbox 360 [reviewed])Developer: Namco Bandai GamesPublisher: Namco Bandai GamesReleased:  February 25, 2014MSRP: $19.99Reviewing a collection of old games can be tough, so let's start at the iconic, timeless classic: the original Pac-Man. It still holds up today, and although Museum doesn't pack a ton of nuanced options to fundamentally change the game, it does have few extras like the ability to select a starting level (once you earn it), and increase your life and bonus life thresholds.Having said that, I know a lot of people who hated the original Pac-Man until they played the Championship Edition of the game which really helped them ""get it"" -- since it was pretty much better in every way. While CE is fully included in the Museum, sadly the DX upgrade that came later is not. Why Namco would opt to give you an inferior, outdated version of Championship Edition is beyond me, and counts as a strike against Museum's quality.Next up is Pac-Mania, which is similar to the original, just with an isometric view, expanded boards, and the ability to jump. Pac's leaping power is a lot more useful than you'd think, as he can change his trajectory mid-air and jump around corners, making for a more action-oriented feel.The problem is since the view is at an angle, you can't actually see the whole board, and it's frustrating to have to track down that last pellet you can't even look at. Because of that, you'll have to change up your strategy fundamentally and go on specific routes, clearing pellets along the way. Pac-Man Arrangement is very similar in that it offers up jumping capabilities (with a classic view), but it goes a step further with other power-ups like speed boosts. Both are fun, but not nearly as engaging as Championship Edition.Then you have the decidedly dated Pac & Pal and Super Pac-Man, which don't hold up today, as they essentially operate like the original, but with convoluted additions such as ""keys"" and other weird concepts. With Pal you have a ghost that steals items and with Super, Pac-Man grows really big and can speed up to smash through walls -- that's about it.When it comes to Pac-Land and Pac-Attack, they're anything but familiar. Land is basically the black sheep of the franchise, taking the form of an odd 2D platformer in which Pac needs to escape from ghosts chasing him in vehicles like old-timey cars and UFOs.It's got a perfect ""so bad it's good vibe"" going on, although you probably won't want to play it more than a few times. Pac-Attack is basically a clone of Dr. Mario, with Pac-Man pieces eating the ghosts (viruses) instead of the requirement to match up colors. It features a two-player versus mode, which is just about the only way you're going to get mileage out of this game.Again, Battle Royale is the main reason you're probably interested in this pack. There's no surprise here -- the concept of putting four Pac-Man players in an arena and forcing them to eat each other is good fun. It uses the Championship concept of automatically arranging levels in real time around you, and it speeds up over time to increase the tension. Even if people aren't Pac-Man fans, they can still enjoy the fast-paced, simple gameplay of Royale. Thankfully, it also supports solo play against an NPC, but you'll definitely want to find three local friends for this one (mostly because Museum doesn't have an online component).Museum as a whole supports full leaderboards for every game, an in-game Stamp Book achievement system, and a ""Pac-Room"" to mess around in that stores collectibles. Visually on consoles the game looks fine, but every game outside of CE and Royale will support a tiny native resolution while a border takes up the rest of the screen. As a side note, if you buy the game before the end of March, you'll net the wonderful Ms. Pac-Man for free, which sweetens the deal.Pac-Man Museum has a bunch of middling pieces, but the addition of Battle Royale is the icing on the cake. If you've never played Championship Edition before and thus do not have DX to compare it to, it's a perfect way to re-acclimate yourself to the franchise, while you use Royale to spice up your next local gathering. Everyone else who lacks friends on-hand or has already played CE should wait for a sale, or pass this one up entirely.Pac-Man Museum reviewed by Harley3657/10GOODA solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun."

Unfortunately there is no way to turn off the sometimes distracting borders that some of the games have. You'll have to play in a well lit room to not be affected by it. Could make some people dizzy or sick.Arcade perfection wise, these games are the originals. but you can't see the games opening attraction because once you start a game, the software automatically inserts a credit for you to play so you can't see it. Also if you notice the copyright messages on the original arcade games have been modified to say NBGI on them so its not really an original game if you modify the original copyright on the screen.The controls are good. I'm using a Logitech F310 gamepad in XInput mode so it's just like playing on the XBOX 360 except its for PC.Finally I read through some of the complaints about glitchy graphics .

Maybe we could've gotten an HD remake of the old PS1 titles (Speaking of which, the 20th anniversary of Volume 1 releasing in the US is coming up. It would be nice to have something announced for then), maybe we could've gotten a decent port of one of the older ones, or maybe we could've just gotten something cool and new.But instead, we got Pac-Man Museum.So since I don't feel like doing a full review, have a Pros and Cons list:Pros:+Only way to play Battle Royale without going to an arcade.+You can play the original version of CE, in case you were ever nostalgic for that version.+Other Pac-Man arcade/console games if you don't want to emulate them.+Some other neat little extras (Honestly judging from almost everything after the PS1 titles it's really easy not to expect anything from these games).Cons:-The price tag. $20 for 9 games seems like a good deal until you compare it to all of the other Namco Museum games. For example, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade can be found for about $20 nowadays, and it has 34 games on it.-No option to change window size for games. You know, like the other Namco Museum games have.-They went the Remix/Megamix route by not bothering to include Ms. Pac-Man. But oh wait, they did eventually include it... As a DLC that costs $5.So overall, this game was kind of a disappointment. Perhaps I could've given this a positive rating if it costed less and/or had more to it, but there are so many better Namco Museum games out there. I understand that the other retro games may not be as marketable as Pac-Man, but at least give something to the fans. If you want this game I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale.

It is not an HD game, and most fo the games run in a much smaller window within the program, but that's perfectly acceptable.

The result is mostly good, but needs some more polishing before it can be considered a good buy.Like others have said, more customization options (controls and display) would be good, online multiplayer for Battle Royale would be welcomed in with open arms, and keeping Ms. Pac-Man free would also be good.  The Game selection is pretty good, but personally I would have replaced Pac-Land and Pac-Man Arrangement with Pac-Man Plus and Jr. Pac-Man.  In fact, how about having Pac-Man Plus and Jr. Pac-Man be the next two rounds of DLC? Or if we're thinking wishfully, how about a simulated version of Baby Pac-Man, the video and Pinball hybrid?Bottom Line:  Add the aforementioned customization options, keep the DLC free, add more games, take Battle Royale online, and then it'll truly be worth $20 (or 80 quarters).

I was wrong. For those of you who're busy and just wanna know my opinions summed up, I basically feel that this this game is a mockery of the original Pac Man. I recommend that you spend your hard earned cash on Championship DX+. You'll have a much better experience.For those that will actually read the entire review, know that I hated this. It felt like the worst console port ever. I'd have yet to encounter a game on Steam that didn't use WASD if it weren’t for this. That's right, you didn't read it wrong: this game doesn't support the WASD keys as controls. It makes you use the arrow keys. Luckily, I use an Xbox controller for these sorts of arcade titles, so that didn't affect me too much. Apart from that, the games weren’t in their original states. I've played Pac Man Championship (the older one) and I know for a fact it wasn't anywhere near as pixelated. Come to think of it, the entire game, hub and all, was pixelated. However, I'm fairly certain that was due to poor settings on my side. Speaking of “my side”, this game didn’t run on the first try, nor did it run on the second, or third, or fourth, for that matter. I had to go as far as to contact Bandai (Namco) and wait for a response in order to even start the game. Even after I had had (that’s not a type-o) days to build extra anticipation to play the game, I still disliked it from minute 1.All-in-all, this game really disappointed me. It’s the first game that I’ve ever installed that I’m uninstalling solely because it was unentertaining. Going back and re-reading it, I realize that my review really doesn’t “review” anything about the game at all. Still folks, trust me when I say that you do NOT want to spend your hard earned cash on “Pac Man Museum”.Seriously though, people should start a petition to add multiplayer to Championship DX+, and to add Namco Museum, a title that I’ve loved since childhood, to Steam."

Take a look:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=805200124This game has no online play, no visual options, (resolution seems stuck in 1280x720), no local multiplayer except with pacman battle royale, and this game is overpriced at $21.99 for what you get here. DLC content is Ms. Pac-Man for another $5.49 CDN!While it is nice to play some Pac-Man games you may of never heard of, most of these titles can be found on some older consoles...in fullscreen.I might add that Steam Achievement Hunters are in for a horrible surprise.The expectations of the achievements in this game are impossible for the average gamer, and spending your life trying to become pro to get these achievements with this version of these games is going to be a nightmare I imagine.The game has a unique lobby where you can collect items you get from earning lots of points, or eating lots of dots which let you collect stamps in game. This applies to the achievements too, so it could be fun to collect everything...except that it's not.I am no stranger to the pac-man series, as I am a 30s year old gamer and I grew up with many of these titles. Pac-Land on Turbografix 16, Pac-Attack on Sega Genesis, even the original Pac-Man on NES.That horrible border you can't turn off is stupid and useless, and ruins this experience. It's like playing on a tiny tablet sitting on a table in the middle of the screen.The only thing this collection has going for it is Pac-Man Battle Royale which is a 4 player competetive version of pac-man (not online, yes still a border), and Pac-man championship edition which is FULLSCREEN and is as excellent as pac-man championship edition DX+ which I also own on Steam and consider to be a much better way to spend your time and money.Don't buy this game, even on a sale, unless you have some spare cash sitting around I guess and don't care about quality.

I rate this game 10 / 10 with too much water in Pac-Land.Seriously, this is a decent collection. I enjoy every game on here, even Pac-Man Arrangement, even though I would have preferred the GBA Pac-Man arrangement. Also, don't buy this collection for Pac-Man Battle Royal, as it is only a 1 player game ( If you only have a keyboard). That being said, I have a lot of fun with this game, and it really is worth the buy if you want some good Pac-Man games. I can not say anything for Ms. Pac-Man, as I have a version already on my computer, so I have no need to buy another one. I would rate this a 8.5 / 10 due to a few of its issues that I mentioned earlier, and I can't get past the pool / lake in Pac-Land. I recommend it, as it is a good was for some single player fun."

Trick is to use xpadder so you can map the direction arrows to the stick and be sure change the diagonal sensitivity to 1 so that you don't miss your turns.

A millisecond tap = 3 taps. This was often a BIG problem in the gameplay, because when you need to make a vital turn, it often doesn't happen, even though you pressed the button well on time.If the creators of this felt like throwing in a ""broken joystick"" aesthetic, then they definitely did it.I bought this on sale and regretted it. Please don't buy this at full price."

,Recommended,236470,19129416,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,Darth Flynn,"This is a game that features many of the maze Pacman games.  From the original Pacman, Ms Pacman all the way to Pacman CE (my favourite), there are a ton of games to keep you busy here.All the games are entertaining and support XBox 360 controller.My biggest gripes however are the fact that the older games included in this bundle do not take full advantage of full screen, instead the game takes up about two thirds of the height of the screen and has a border 360 degrees around it.  I would have prefered to have the game maximised height-wise and only have a border on the sides.The other issue, and I can't work this one out, is that the games do not support a NES controller through USB.  Pacman was on the original Nintendo but you can't use that controller here.  I find this a shame because in Pacman CE with the speed you eventually move at, it can be difficult to control with either the XBox controller's analogue stick or 8-way directional pad.I had Pacman CE on the 360 and it ran in 1080p.  This version will only run in 720p which is a shame.All in all a great collection of games, incredible value if you get it in a steam sale, and something that will keep you busy.Better than hooking up your NES to your flatscreen."

,Recommended,236470,21048132,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,leathco,"Overall, this is a nice collection with a large chunk of all the Pac-Man games released. A huge plus is that this is the only way you can play Battle Royale without hunting down the extremely rare arcade version. Leaderboards are nice, and the ability to slowly fill a room with Pac-Man items is a nice touch. Controls are tight as well, which is very important in a Pac-Man title.The biggest negative is the borders. I think they are done to keep the arcades aspect ratio, but the borders around the game window are massive. I know many of these games used vertical monitors, but even in vertical mode there's still an inch or more of border on both the top and bottom of the screen! At least max out the size vertically for a vertical game.Also, it was a bummer that Ms. Pac-Man is a DLC extra. This was the most popular game in the entire series, but its considered an extra in this collection. I realize the differences between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are small in this day and age, but in the arcades at the time, the addition of new mazes, ghost patterns, and a slight tweak to the controls were pretty big, and Ms. Pac-Man to this day is considered the pinnicle of the series. It's a shame that in a Pac collection, it's not included unless you pay more.Still, these classics are replicated well in this collection. The big ones are Tournament Edition and Battle Royale, two great additions to Pac-Mans legacy. There's plenty of others to choose from as well."

I purchased it at a large discount, however, which is why I am willing to recommend it. It has a tendency to glitch while playing, usually in the form of screen flickering, which causes the graphics to alter and slow down the game. There are only about ten games included, which isn't as much as I feel should be included. Do not buy this at full price, it is only worth it for five dollars at best."
