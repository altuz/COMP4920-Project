The game had initially gotten over $221,000 from Kickstarter supporters but the final product wasn't anything like the developers had envisioned. This game was launched before it was anywhere near completed, by the company's own admission, in a cash grab by the publisher. Do not buy it. The company has moved on to new projects like Epsilon and this game is no longer supported, meaning that the developers do not intend to release further patches or content for it.A summary of the situation is below.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=401409417"

The movement is kinda clunky and the hit detection is a bit off.BUTWhat I'm trying to say here is that there's been a little bit of unfair criticism goin' on here. The brunt of it has been on this game's AI. People say it's ""bad."" But ask yourself this before you count yourself among them. What if this game just features the most advanced enemy morality system ever devised in a video game?What if, that time an enemy shot your teammate then stared at you doing nothing, what if he was simply, at that moment, being overwhelmed with the crushing reality of the fact that he'd just killed a human being? And you shot him in the face, didn't you? You didn't even think about it. You chalked it up to ""bad AI.""That terrorist got up this morning, just like you did, put on his beret, kissed his wife and kids, and left for work. His oldest daughter had just gotten into that college she loved. His little boy had show-and-tell that day at school. He was bringing his dad's fatigues in to show off to his friends. He drove to work, just like he had every other day. He said heartfelt ""good mornings"" to all his colleagues. Jim's wife had gone into labour the day earlier and given birth to a baby girl; Jim's shift ended in two hours. He was going to see her. Tom was the one who always took care of the plants around the office. He didn't mind; it brought a smile to his face. A typical Thursday.They grabbed their bombs and headed out to their routine day of terrorism. Jim and Tom sat around playing cards. Tom couldn't ever seem to win; he just liked playing because he got to hang out with Jim. He couldn't know that this was the last time he would ever see him.A frag grenade landed on Jim's lap. A flash of light and a deafening boom. Jim's body had been torn apart by shards of metal before he could react. Tom just sat there, eyes wide, cards still gripped in his hands, just trying to understand what had happened to his friend Jim. As he turned, he saw two more of his coworkers cut down by the SWAT team that was now entering the room. There had been no screams, no chance to cry out. Tom raised his weapon and fired, surprising himself. He hadn't even remembered picking it up. One of the SWAT officers crumpled to the floor, one last monosyllable escaping his lips. Tom stood there over the man, mouth slightly open. He'd done this. He'd killed this man. Why? For what? He hadn't meant to. He didn't even know the man's name. Tom turned toward the other officers, raising his hands. ""No, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, please.""He would have said these things. He would have calmly knelt down and been handcuffed and gone quietly. He would have lived the rest of his life a shell of a man, haunted by the memories of his friends, gone in the blink of an eye one Thursday. He would have done a great many things. But he wasn't given the chance. Tom was shot thirteen times by the remaining SWAT officers. He was dead before he heard the shots.10/10 best game 2014"

One of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table (Not always good). They're able to take the risks that triple A companies aren't. This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels(Maybe this is why there are only four maps...) , noob tubing, and throw in tactics (if by tactics they mean boredom) and strategy (and by strategy they mean endless buyers remorse) instead. Serellan LLC certainly deserves this award for (Ruining) their tactical shooter, Takedown: Red Sabre. (The name of the game also doubles as a request to valve)Takedown: Red Sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates (by yelling at the npcs for walking into walls)  and take on each mission differently (in exactly the same fashion) , in their hope to survive. don't expect to be running and gunning down the hallways, because (good luck finding anyone to shoot) there's no respawning(apart from the fact that you turn into team mates after death).

The game was not finished prior to launch and it remains laden with bugs and missing/broken features.  Serellan (the developer) was never able to get dynamic shadows to function properly, even with the help of the game engine's developer, so the game's lighting is a bit off.  Physics are a joke, characters do some strange things when they're killed and ragdoll physics take over, and the resulting odd behavioir is probably the only positive thing about the game because it might give you a laugh.  Artificial intelligence of the enemy was ""better than Chuck Norris"" ridiculous when the game launched, and friendly AI is borked in the opposite direction, effectively eliminating any sort of ""tactical"" feel to the game.  It plays like a really bad knockoff of a really bad game.  Spend your money on something developed by someone that is capable and willing to produce a quality indie title.  Setting $15 on fire and watching it burn would be more entertaining and worthwhile.* NOTE: It appears the new Steam tagging system is subject to heavy censorship/moderation.

Unfortunately, the game failed to live upto the hype, which was promised by the developers, as being a realistic tactical FPS. In almost every area of the game it's clear to see that the game was rushed with apparently no time spent whatsoever for polishing or improving the game before it's release.In terms of gameplay, majority of the game is actually there but it's poorly implemented. Enemies range from being completely unaware of you to being deadly accurate. The friendly AI is almost completely lacking, which makes singleplayer completely unenjoyable. However, the game's core mechanics are in fact there, which means that there is a small amount of fun to be had if you choose to play the game with friends. But be aware, there is no way to create private matches and there are no online games available at all at the time of writing this review. If you can live with some 'small' niggles such as the unbelievably slow walking speed, the fact that any height can kill you and the AI the game is playable but it just doesn't live up to what the developers promised.The level design is one of the few aspects of the game that appears to have been properly thought out with levels that feature tight hallways and open spaces which might create a tactical FPS if the game's mechanics were equally polished. The graphics aren't terrible (on low settings) and even lower end machines should be able to handle the game pretty easily.Overall, Takedown: Red Sabre is largely unfinished but might have some potential to live up to it's promises if someone took the time to finish it and give it the polish it desperately needs."

The dream come reality in 2014 fell short compared to a game made in 2005, SWAT 4.My biggest complaint is the AI is embarrassing. The enemy AI is oblivious. It never seems to respond to sound or much of the happenings in the environment. Only event that causes them to spring into action is if they catch the player visually in their line-of-sight. Additionally, the animations of enemies are robotic.As for the friendly AI, they are completely brain-dead. There are no real commands! You can tell them to stay and follow. Not look over there! Not stack up on this doorway! Not toss a flashbang in and clear! Nothing!I really wish this game lived up to my expectations, but it didn't. I cannot recommend it.

76561198042958325,Not Recommended,236510,12455030,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,[SexyShrub] ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA,"I purchased Takedown: Red Sabre back when it was around a dollar, guessing it be a capable, perhaps minimalistic first-person, tactical shooter, qualities I tend to occasionally enjoy and recommend, but in place of an entertaining romp through room clearing and CQC, I instead received an underwelming mix-match of unfinished ideas and interesting concepts.Using Takedown's 'spiritual predecessors,' the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4 -whose demos are still available online, as the standards for tactical shooters, Red Sabre falls a little short.Starting with the mission select screen, the lack of a planning stage means the player is left to begin the mission blind as to the mission objective, general routes, and overall level design. Yes, several vague objectives are posted in the form of a style-over-substance video overlay, but their possible locations, numbers, and significance are all still left unknown or murky. A realistic estimation of the cloud of combat and the limitations of simple surveillance? Not really, seeing as all three of these aspects are sensible targets of approximation during the inevitable observations that occur prior to sending in tactical teams...Right? A simple, pre-mission map with rough outlines and selectable routes would be wonderful, as would some form of dialogue between squad and commander to answer any lingering mission details.On the topic of missions, the actual mission objectives, considering Red Sabre's apparent tactical roots, are surprizingly bland and simplistic in nature, echoing the desires of a standardized checklist, rather than the actual SWAT operations they wish to emulate. Missing are the dynamic hostage rescues with captive/captor dialogue and potential loss of life due to the explosive nature of such echanges. Even compared to the earlier SWAT series, Takedown's missions are devoid of the atmospheric tension maintained through periodic use of covnversation and ambient comments.Then, when actually playing a mission, several basic capabilities are absent, namely squad manipulation and regular status updates. In place of a context menu or other useful method of commanding your team, a simple hold toggle and ROE wheel are offered, both of which obfuscate the all-essential room clearing, as your team is always behind you, in turn rendering useless the more elaborate levels with their multitude of cover and choke points, as your teammates will never actually take strategic positions or utilize flanks, and complicating simple matters of spacial awareness as our mates tend to vanish when not verbally announcing enemies, their virtual minds dead set on maintaining unnecessary radio silence. The ability to investigate, both physically and visually through your squadmates: rooms, towers, corners, windows, doors, would be a monumental improvement, as would simple formation and movement commands.This brings into light, your squad's strange lack of communication. Yes, the AI announces spotted enemies, but that's seemingly the extent of their communicative ability. Positions, actions, general side-chatter, are all absent, replaced instead with a wall of silence and death. While the latter is more a subset of mood setting and tone, the former two topics of conveyance are important aspects of movement and firing maneuvers, as proper placement of suppression and flanking teams must be confirmed before performance. That, and the awkwardness of having to spin your character around to check their periodic status, when enemies are everpresent, is painful. The movie, Way of the Gun, provides a fun example of firefight communication, as do several article by dslyecxi, a founding member of ARMA's ShacTac.Lastly is a breakdown of the player's ironically standard moveset, given the advances in recent game design and Takedown's desire to be both modern and tactical. The player is limited to a digital lean, without a stepout or means of truly examining corners and bends, two digital stances, without any real cover system, nonexistent damage modeling -foot shots are instakills, and strangely simplified gun mechanics. As stated by its own developer, Red Sabre's crippled lean was intentional, but as demonstrated in RavenShield, fully analog leaning and stance change are possible, and with a reticule present -reticules being a sensible representation of the mental focal point one references when looking around and not the fabricated, game-world only gimmick some make it out to be btw, returning fire is possible so long as the weapon is locked to the view, an equally sensible representation, given SWAT behavior. The application of such a system would allow for full realization of the environment, window avoidance, and improved surveillance, aspects only improved upon by a fluid cover system, one that allows, at least in its most basic form, temporarily full coverage from fire, as shown in Red Orchestra and even Killzone or Perfect Dark, but in a more advanced form, with some manner of controlled cover migration. Exemplified in games like Receiver and the aforementioned Orchestra, gun mechanics can be rather complex without seeming overwhelming, so long as they're presented intuitively. Ammo checking, magazine management, individual component manipulation, bracing have therefore all been implemented in the past and have helped in pulling player skill and concentration away from reflexes and placing them on planning and execution.Along with several prevalent, submitted glitches, involving firing, aiming, and stance freezes, I hope the above mentioned points help illuminate the fact that, while not the horrid abomination some have made it out to be, Takedown: Red Sabre is at its best underdeveloped and at its worst, unfinished, statuses that could effectively be remedied via patches and/or modding.Looking into the history of Red Sabre, it would seem Takedown's developer, Serellan, started a KickStarter to create a certain type of product of a certain calibre, and after raising a fair amount of money -over $220,000, released a product of subpar qualities, even after praising their own past experience and ability. That's just frustrating and unprofessional."

This game has too many obvious cons to let my bias tell you its good.Pros:-Runs fine.-Is fun if you like sweep and clear style gameplay. (something I love)-Somewhat good selection of maps and objectives and modes. (varied)-Good operator/class customisation.-Fun and good gunplay.-Good, working co-op.-Movement is OK and provides walk, quick walk and run options. (varies in speed and avaliability with the type of armour you wear).Cons:-AI Teammates open every door in 5 feet of them for no reason which results in an enemy on the other side turning around and gunning down the whole AI sqaud and 9.9/10 you as well and 10/10 making you so low on health you may as well restart.-Stealth is impossible. I have walked up a staitcase crouched, in silence and have enemies come running out of their rooms and shoot me while being completely behind door frames.-AI enemies have aimbot and wallhacks. Literally they can see you even without looking at you and they can do 180 spins in one frame and lock onto you with their first shot being deadly. The second one round is let off EVERY enemy knows exactly where you are at all times even if no one has seen you for well over 10 minutes. I have cleared a building and then walked into the next one 50+ feet away and have an enemy waiting me me on the other side of the door pointing directly at me and shooting me before I can do anything.-Friendly AI is useless as anything but extra lives and will more than likely cause over half of your deaths. They cant aim at all and just decide to shoot whatever whenever.-Your character cannot aim. I have aimed directly as people and fired off 10-12 shots all fully stable, crouched and aimed down and have let the recoil subside after each bullet and.... nothing happens. The only way to get a kill from further than 5 feet away is spray the ever loving crap out of them.-The ridiculously 'skilled' AI makes it so the only way to play properly is to run and gun hoping to get lucky shots in before the AI catches up 0.001 seconds later.-All scopes have pretty much the same zoom. The sniper scopes are useful and holographic sights are good but the ACOG like scopes on SMGs and ARs are zoomed so much that one shot leaves you looking at the sky for 3 seconds and you die. This paired with the awful inaccuracy of the shots that are dead on target means its impossible to use them.-Game has 0 online multiplayer with randoms. No servers left. No people online. Nothing.-Menu controls are slightly annoying and buttons sometimes dont respond or input too much.-In ability to customise the whole squad for one op. Once your initial charcters dies you are stuck with the default rather then the loadout you have made for that class meaning undesirable weapons and an overall unpleasant experience.-The leaning cancels when moving which makes it very hard to use properly.-The enemies will often one shot you even when you wear heavy armour which makes the sacrifice of movement speed worthless as you die instantly anyway and encourages the run and gun playstyle the game already promotes despite its intentions being the opposite.In summary the whole game is fun but the enemies are OP and the friendlies and useless and the mechanics are overall unpolished and unbalanced."

The maps feel rather well laid out, and don't really detract from what this game is.\The difficulty that is presented with the AI also feels good, the enemies have very realistic bullet damage, so when going up against them, its quite based on if you can outsmart the AI.There is also a map editor that got placed into the game, haven't used it myself, but thats pretty cool!What does detract from it?Number one thing for me, is how clunky the controls feel, I can work around everything else, but controls feeling weird are honestly just a no go from me.The way everything handles just doesn't feel smooth in the slightest, so honestly most of the times I died honestly felt like they could be chocked up to how poorly it felt like it controlled. If you want to make a game difficult and challenging, go for it, but combine difficulty with poor handling and all you manage to create frustration. If difficulty is done right it can make players strive to beat the challenge.The game also makes a few missteps in how enemies and objectives are spawned. The objective and replayability of the game comes into play with how the arena should change, because the missions you're engaging in are as quick reaction to situations, so you wouldn't be going in knowing anything besides Maaaybe the floor plan of the buildings.But this gets negated when objectives spawn in the same places no matter what.Here's a place where a system like what Payday 2 has, where buildings have certain features that get randomized every time you load up a new match, would be amazingly beneficial and would go miles for replayability.I also praised the enemies a little earlier, however I should mention they're honestly very stupid, the designers managed to get around this slightly by placing all the enemies facing towards where the player would most likely appear in front of them, but still, there were situations where I managed to go behind an enemy and just follow them for a little while, so yeah, enemies are very unintelligent from my experience.Finally, the UI is fairly clunky and not very easy to manage, choosing a loadout honestly feels very weird, its been a long time since I played it, but it feels very unwieldy and hard to work with.I think the core idea of this game is definitely saveable, can this game be patched and fixed? If the controls could be made to be tighter, I would invest more time in this game, since I would honestly be able to enjoy the game. If there was more replayability through map randomization, then I think this could be a very competitive game instead of what it is in its current state.But as I was saying, the core idea is good, but the overall package doesn't really deliver since its not really a polished package. Stay away unless some of these things get fixed."

The performance is horrendous yet calling the visuals ""basic"" would be putting it nicely. No settings can be changed in-game and all adjustments must be done at the main menu. There are only three levels of visual detail to select from and changing this requires a full exit and restart of the game. Beyond the rudimentary presentation there is a shortage of content and what's there barely feels like a game. There is a training mission that feels half-finished, and the rest of the missions make little effort to give any sort of context into the situation. You are simply thrown into arbitrary settings to kill unidentified enemies with perfect aim suffering from braindead AI to complete objectives that are never really justified beyond a simple briefing. Movement is stiff to a fault, weapons lack panache, and performing any action just feels awkward. The online multiplayer is unsurprisingly a ghost town and the handful of missions are no fun to play in single-player anyway. Even if you're still longing for a return to tactical shooters the likes of SWAT 3/4 or Rainbow Six, Takedown isn't what you're looking for and as much as you may want to like it the game is sure to disappoint."

,Not Recommended,236510,9995189,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,Chao,"Let me just preface this review by saying I wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. A hard, realistic fps was something I enjoy, and have been looking for different simulation fpses since I picked up a copy of Arma: Cold War Assault. So I was pretty excited to try this out, especially since I got it so cheap. What I got, however, was so subpar, I had a hard time making it to an hour played before turning it off and telling myself I was simply done. While I do not enjoy speaking so poorly about games, especially one that I spend such little time on, I have more than seen enough to warn against buying this game.The Good: Plenty replay valueThe Bad: Clunky controls, barely-functional AI, sub-par graphicsPremise: To put it simply, Takedown: Red Sabre is as unfinished as an Alpha test. The entire game falls short in almost every aspect of play.Story: N/AMechanics: The controls feel slow, sometimes unresponsive. A few times during play, I would swap weapons and it still have my primary out until I clicked to aim down sight or shoot or I would lean and then move, only to be stuck leaning until I leaned the other way and be trapped in some wierd continuum. As a testement to how unpolished this game is, the sprint has no animation, at all. Gunplay felt off, as well. Handguns feel like extremely weak airsoft weaponry. While every other weapon in the game usually felt normal, I couldn't help but feel that there was too small a selection. And the class-like system? Kinda a joke, considering weapons aren't restricted to a certain class.Single-player: Being a tactical fps, you're given four squadmates (or less depending on the mode), which are all of equal use: none. You cannot give them orders, and they're literally so stupid, they cannot function on their own. The squadmates tend to alert the enemies by standing in the open, even if you're behind a crate or a wall. Aside from this, their aim is usually slow, which ends up in them being killed off. This becomes a problem when its so easy to die, and while you take control of an AI after death, there's usually no use trying. Often, I took over just to be gunned down by the exact same enemy because the AI positioned themselves directly behind me. More often than that, the AI would have hp in the red, meaning there would be no surviving another shot. Its also no help that the enemy AI is incredibly unbalanced and incoherent on difficulty. Some AI are stupid while others will try to flank. Often, however, you will crawl around a corner or up some stairs to be gunned down instantly as if the enemy had an aimbot. This can cause some extremely frustrating gameplay.Multi-player: From the singular game my client could find (even after checking the server list), the game played quite the same. However, the unintelligent squadmates were replaced by players. Though they used voice chat, the lag was so terrible that every word came out choppy. As far as I could find, there was no scoreboard, so it was impossible to tell who was dead and what everyone's pings were. After dealing with the choppy-voiced insults for a couple rounds, I decided that I would much rather stick to the equally frustrating single-player portion for abit. When I tried to play multi-player again, no servers could be found and I gave up on that portion of the game.Graphics: The graphics were far from on-par with latest games in the genre, which is understandable as the studio was relatively unheard of. My PC may not be the best by far, but CSS looked better than this game, and still ran twice as well. However, they were not terrible to look at, except on the lowest setting.Final Verdict: The game is good for about 15 minutes, then the reality of the purchase sets in. The normal $5 asking price isn't high, but its still way too much for a game that ""released,"" but still feels like an early alpha test. I would not advise anyone to buy it unless you have the cash to burn."

AI seems far to fast to react to certain situations. 60% of the time you cna be instnatly killed before making a move. as a attempt on copying the rainbow six series i have to say they have failed miserably. if this game was free to play i still wouldnt recommend it due to the serious AI flaws. if these issues are fixed and working correctly and/or fixing difficulty settings. i would reccomend it. as it stands it is just far too much work to enjoy even with some serious tactics and voice comms among friends.

I wanted to believe so badly that this game would be fun despite bad reviews, because the tactical shooter was my genre, and ever since its downfall gaming just hasnt been  the same. So i buy the game, thankfully on sale, get into the screen and the game crashes. Ok.. start again and go to my loadout screen. After about 5 minutes with the sluggish ui and bland selection i save and go to start a game and the first thing i notice is there is no campaign. Ok... so i decide on the first map, thinking chronologically. The game just loads up, no team loadout screen, no planning phase, not even a whiteboard diagram of the building were assaulting. No intel to help decide on loadout. Ok... Start the mission and the weapon i have is not what i picked at all, it was the basic mp5 starter setup. WTF... Decide to play on, start scouring the keybaord to find some team controls...... none. Not only can you NOT control your team, but they sem to work against you. I went down the stairs with them and apparently noone was checking our six, since when I got to the bottom i noticed noone was following me. I go back up the stairs and see my 3 teammates all flat on their faces, with a tango just standing there not even noticing me. A perfect metaphor for the state of this game as well as the integrity of the devs. And after i back out i find it goes on and on. You cant see or access your loadouts from anywhere but the games main menu,No ROE or any tyoes of control, no idea where youre going or what your doing, Crashes every time I play it.

The whole effort at development was a fraud, perpetrated by charlatans. Everything claimed by the company staff was either wildly misinformed or made-up.

This is a huge plus for me because I love making custom♥♥♥♥♥♥in games and then playing them with my friends.+ 3 game modes across 13 different maps by default (however the Mission game mode limits the pool to only 5)+ Mirrors and glass in general actually ♥♥♥♥ing works -- there are genuine reflections that you can use to see people around corners, such as when on the top floor of the Biolab where you can see enemies under your feet by looking at the tall windows.+ Gimping works just like in the old Rainbow 6 games.+ AI is just as good at shooting as you are (assuming that you don't suck at crosshair placement and aiming), but only when they're alerted to your presence. It's exactly like Rainbow 6, except instead of multiple difficulty settings (Recruit, Veteran, Elite) each AI has its own difficulty settings. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cowardly whereas others are 360 noscope mlg xxx tier. Either extreme is very rare (maybe 1 per mission) and most AI are probably in between Raven Shield's Veteran and Elite difficulties imo.+ Atmosphere is just like the old Rainbow 6 games (e.g. rooftop biolab insertion feels exactly like the Raven Shield Penthouse insertion zone).+ You die in 1 hit most of the time unless you equip heavy armor, in which case you can take 2~5 hits. This is exactly the same as in each of the old Rainbow 6 games. It depends on where you were hit and the caliber of the gun that the guy who shot you has. HOWEVER, unlike in the old Rainbow 6 games, when you wear Heavy armor you are not allowed to sprint (default: LCtrl) anymore. imo that's completely fine.+ Hit detection on narrow edges (like shooting through doorways at tight angles) are exactly the same as in Raven Shield -- presumably because they're built with the same engine.- When you die, you don't get any feedback about your stats or whatever (e.g. accuracy, how many kills you got, et cetera).- There's no indication of how many enemies in total you're up against. Because of this, you can easily get bored running circles around the map searching for the last guy.+ The game can only be done slowly, so it's just like Rainbow 6. imo, it's even slower than that, though -- I'll explain why I think this later on down this list.+ The relationship between accuracy and movement feels exactly the same as in the old Rainbow 6 games (but it goes out the window when you scope in or use ironsights, which did technically exist in the old Rainbow 6 games because you could still zoom a little even without a scope anyway -- it just didn't look like that once they introduced first person weapon models in Raven Shield).- It lacks certain functionality that people consider ""basic"" or ""essential"" nowadays (e.g. being able to change options while in the middle of a mission) but weren't exactly taken for granted back in the old Rainbow 6 days. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the internet seem to judge a book by its cover, so to speak, and so they look at this lack of ""basic"" functionality in the menus and just drop the game completely and tell everyone it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. In my opinion, people who do this can go suck a♥♥♥♥♥♥- TotalBiscuit complained about how there are only 3 graphical settings in his review videos, but tbh I don't care because I get 60fps on my old laptop with Medium and Low settings... and all 3 settings don't take away from my gameplay experience at all so imo he's just nitpicking on that point, at least).+ It *FEELS* like I'm playng a modern Rogue Spear game, except the pace is slower (tbh Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear both were very fast paced in terms of movement and it wasn't until Raven Shield that they slowed it down, which I loved personally... but this game slows it down even more while still letting you run and sprint through clear areas at the old Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear running speeds, so I'm 100% cool with this and won't list it as a minus).+ Sound *ACTUALLY MATTERS* in this game, similar to how it matters in CounterStrike (although for different reasons). The AI will even hear you if you so much as switch to your grenades! In my opinion, this is a huge step up from all of the old Raven Shield games. Whereas in the old Rainbow 6 games, you can run around with Heavy Armor and it makes no significant difference to how the AI detects you... in this game you can actually see very easily how the AI reacts to your movements, even through walls and doors. All of this makes the gameplay slow down even more, which makes me much happier personally because that's how tactical shooters are supposed to be played in the first ♥♥♥♥ing place!+ You can choose multiple insertion zones both in Single AND in Multiplayer. In the old Rainbow 6 games, you could only do this in a few special missions for single player... but *NEVER* for multiplayer. This is a big plus for me because in Multiplayer you can divide your team into actual separate groups that start in completely different areas of the map.- There is no 2D map or anything for the missions you can play. You have to learn them as you go. This isn't a big minus for me, personally, but it is definitely a minus. It means that only people with enough experience can actually plan ahead, which takes away from the fun for me. It adds a sense of exploration to the game, true, but I don't think that this sort of thing is appropriate for this kind of game.- No pre-mission planning phase at all. The old Rainbow 6 games never did this for multiplayer, of course, but it was at least there in Single Player. Ultimately, though, it's not that big of a deal I guess but I'd still like to be able to do it in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. It only adds to the fun of the game and doesn't take anything away at all imo.+ There is a decent selection of weapons and gadgets (which is what the game calls grenades and stuff). You can't give yourself a High Capacity mag like in Raven Shield (thank you jesus I never liked that feature anyway back then because it made the gameplay speed up unnecessarily since you hardly ever had to worry about taking cover to reload)."

I came back to this for almost 15 hours because it was kind of fun to see if I could complete any of the missions despite...well.  The innumerable problems with the game.So, fun aside, I have no idea how Serellan took an existing game engine (Unreal?) and managed to make it do things like lose the connection to the host while playing SINGLE PLAYER or not have a working game browser until several patches in.  Extremely basic design decisions are poorly done:  how might you handle weapons loadouts?  Customize before each mission?  Not in this game!  You chose four loadouts from the main menu, differentiated only by their names, and then chose those by name (what did I make the Assault loadout again?) when going into a mission.  (EDIT 12/27:  oh joy!  You can edit the loadouts at the mission jump-off screen!  But you're still editing the four choices...then choosing one.........idiots...)  Your team members never changed weapons, so the one guy was always carrying a sniper rifle, even through urban hallways.  That might've mattered if the team AI did much more than absorb bullets or mutter things like ""rounds downrange""--you have basically no control over them except to ask for them not to follow you, and even if they're supposed to sometimes their pathing will fail and they'll get stuck.  Ultimately, they were only useful as extra lives--except that their loadouts couldn't be customized, so eventually YOU were the idiot stuck with the sniper rifle while trying to do CQB.I wanted badly for this game to be good, but it wasn't."

,Not Recommended,236510,21277665,"Posted: 17 February, 2016",all,Yij,"Short ReviewA supposed comeback for the tactical shooting genre, Takedown: Red Sabre passes selection and completed his training courses, yet when it came to his first real mission, he flopped… Big time.Pretty much the bare basics of a tactical shooter. Awkward menu, horrible AI, mediocre game mechanics and glitches abound. But decent graphics and great level design.Kiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “chnged gun. started game. gun didn’t change. Wnt back. changed gun. game still dusnt register change. carried on. ai squad gt stuck in door. Saw enemy across map with back turned. He turn round and killed me in half a second. Tried multiplayer. Uinable to connect 2 any server. 4/10 wud disconnect agen.”Long ReviewIt’s no secret that games these days are all about your waist high walls, linear objectives and regenerating health. Answering the cry of help from the tactical gaming community, a few industry veterans (who’s work involves that of Ghost Recon, SWAT and Halo) stepped up to the call and decided to create their very own game to resurrect this dying genre.GraphicsThe graphics range from excellent to quite poor. The environment textures look absolutely fantastic and whilst a bit too clean and sterile, offer a pleasing amount of colours and contrasts that make it an absolute shame you have to shoot up the place. It’s a shame there’s no peaceful mode as I would have loved to explore the excellently crafted map.The character models look fantastic! Boasting high polys and great texture work, each character looks like a real life operative who’s been kidnapped and transported into the Unreal engine (bless their poor souls). The character and model artists really know what they’re doing with this one. It’s a shame that characters move like they’re made out of wood and lack any idle animation, resulting in a game of musical statues. I don’t even know if they can blink.On the downside, the weapon and first person view-models look like they were pulled from a game 5 years ago. Much lower poly than you’d expect so appear rigid and angular, plus they also house a number of bad faces that reflect light at odd angles. When you have a stunning environment with life-like character models, but have to stare at your blocky arms and firearm that looks like it was made out of tin foil, it’s pretty jarring to say the least.SoundThe music is pretty good, definitely sets the mood with its militaristic theme. Whilst there isn’t a wealth load of tracks, they’re all done to great effect and tie in well with what you’d expect from a tactical shooter.As for in game sound, well there isn’t much to talk about. Everything seems eerily quiet and doors opening, soldiers screaming, spouts of gunfire is all you’re pretty much going to get. Whilst the guns sound ok, they sure sound generic and lack that looping variation you’d expect from games like Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon.GameplayTakedown: Red Sabre has come a long way since it’s behemoth of a disaster at launch, but sadly it’s still a sordid buggy shell of a game.The menu is basic but seems glitchy at times. Often I’d try to change my equipment, only for it to not register until I realised you have to click on the kit name (recon, assault, etc), then click “save loadout” then click back. At least I think that’s how I did it.Your AI squad waddles behind you like a group of duck, refusing to follow any sort of tactical formation, either choosing to form a conga line or dancing all over the place like frightened cockroaches in a matchbox. Very much like your first puppy, outsides of asking them to follow, sit, attack or stay quiet, there’s pretty much no other use for them except extra lives should you bite the dusts. Moreover, when you get killed in a doorway, they enjoy running straight into the doorway and getting capped themselves.The enemy AI is just as bad. Running around like headless chickens, staring at a shiny wall instead of that door you just blown open… then managing to do a 180 spin and headshot you from across the other side of the map in about 0.23 seconds. Cheap.I have sadly never ever been able to participate in a multiplayer match, thanks to a wide range of “connection problems” and error messages. Having played prior to writing this review, I’m still getting unable to connect to server messages and I still cannot get a LAN game to run.Movement is a little odd as you seem to slide everywhere. You can’t lean very far nor move and lean (which apparently is due to quote “The realistic nature of the game”) even though you could do so in most other tactical shooters.Asides from the terrible AI and connection issues, there is a game here, it’s just very barren. It has its moments of enjoyment and if you can accept the complete package for what it is, it’s not the end of the world. If somehow you manage to win the lottery and spot a pig flying in the air at the same time, get the multiplayer to work (if it still does) and playing with other people should make the game more enjoyable.Final WordsTakedown: Red Sabre is a huge disappointment. Whilst it’s not an absolutely terrible game, it’s far far from a good one either. Having trashed the game on a public article and being called out for having inaccurate info then told by the game developer that many problems have been solved, bottom line is many many problems still remain. Where’s my multiplayer?As for the company behind Takedown: Red Sabre, they’re making a new tactical shooter called Epsilon. The question is, should you support them? I think so!They’ve seemed to have learned from their mistakes and putting all efforts into their new title. I’ve gotten my hands on the alpha and for the price of a 6” Subway, it’s given me great bang for the buck. Still, a few bad lemons are bound to pop up in a box every now and then, so I urge you to check Epsilon out."

I always assign my Tab key to reload function in every FPS game. But for some stupid reason, the Tab key is permafixed to console or chat in this one.  That's a deal breaker for me.  Secondly, the lean function appears to be broken. You should be able to stay in that position as you strafe, but you can't, even when you change the toggle in the settings.  Weird.The gameplay itself was mediocre, nothing really stood out for me. Most everything seemed to be worse than Rainbow Six 3. It kind of a had a similiar feel to that game but everything felt dumber somehow, like I was playing a poor immitation of that game.  If it weren't for the poor controls, I might play around with this more. Overall the game feels very unpolished and unfinished.  Other than being curious masochist (like I was) or as a joke, I can't think of any good reason to play this. Every tactical shooter I've ever played before is better than this."

It held great promise and the developer spoke such sweet words, pouring honey on the ears of the people like me. Then it was released...At first it seemed like a game with some launch hick-ups and bugs. The basis was there for T:RS to take this not-so-well sought after throne, but every update was just making more and more of a mess. Then, not very long after release, they started to sell it for 1€ and gave all owners an extra copy to give away tounsuspecting enemiesfriends... which is kind of a clear sign that they threw in the towel and gave up on it.As said; the basic foundation is there; a hardcore, slow paced, co-op, tactical game... if you can get into it. It's hard enough to get a group to successfully join a server, but then you can't make that server private. The AI seems okay at first, but is actually bugged out like crap in a thunderstorm. The game freezes, the game rolls over like a dog without anyone commanding, the game just doesn't do what it's suppose to and does everything it's not suppose to. The only thing that worked from the get go; the in-game text-to-speech chat, they had removed in an update. First the maps were all too big, so you were running around searching for the last terrorist... then they made them smaller, but made them minimal.Nothing has gone right with Takedown: Red Sabre, and my kind (the hardcore co-op FPS:ers) had to look elsewhere. Fortunately we foundInsurgency, which is a bloody good game; get that one instead!The only thing T:RS managed to do was to have our gaming group make sarcastic jokes about ""...it's in the hardcore nature of the game."" and ""...this game is epic!"" which were compliments once upon a time, but after the release and subsequent downfall of T:RS have now become the worst insults we can say about a game.It's all just really sad..."

It's still infuriating. And you still can't even change video settings mid-game. Nope. Every U3 engine game has this basic, fundamental feature but not this game! Nope. Want to turn down some graphics (which you'll want to since this game is so badly optimized) then tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, because you'll have to end your game to do so. Not only that, but the graphics look ugly, both in terms of graphical fidelity and general art style that really show a real lack of flare or interest. Compare the locations here to classics such as SWAT 4 and it just doesn't compare at all,  and I have no problem at all with saying that SWAT 4 has better graphics than this. It does.The A.I. still flails wildly from jedi mind tricks to sheer, inane stupidity, with absolutely no happy middleground. Each map is either unbearably tough and unfinishable, or you steam roll opponents like they aren't even there.the guns are fine, they look like guns, I guess, so whatever. But honestly, how can you get gun models wrong in this day and age? That said, it's no Battlefield or CoD in terms of how nice they look really, so even in that area this title is just very generic.Being a massive SWAT 4 fan, I was super excited about this, but it's not even a patch on the classic. There's no hostages to speak of, your teammates are just cardboard cut outs to be mutilated by zen-like opponents, there's no atmosphere, no immersion factor, you never feel like a SWAT officer (or are these guys army guys? The game isn't even clear on that)Like a lot of people, I saw TotalBiscuits playthrough of this and was super excited. What I didn't realize is that playing the game for more than 30 minutes will tell you everything you need to know. This isn't the tactical shooter you're looking for. There's barely any room for tactical descision, as your thought process is usually ""will the A.I. headshot me from miles away in this next room or will they stand there looking at the walls?""Don't play this, play SWAT 4 instead. It's an eight year old game with more replay value, realism, fear, tension and tactical thought than anything this game has to offer."

,Not Recommended,236510,9337616,"Posted: 3 March, 2014",all,Almacov,"Takedown is a mess, but I've enjoyed the game nevertheless.It's glitchy as hell, and the netcode is unreliable, but when I have played with friends online I've had fun.It's a barebones experience. Do not expect a planning stage, or any team AI control beyond hold/follow commands and basic rules of engagement modification. The campaign is also short, and somewhat disjointed.The fact of the matter is that this game was obviously in an Early Access state upon release (The install directory of the game even lists it as ""Takedown Red Sabre Early Access""), and wasn't listed as such in the store. That was enough to deal a severe blow to what could have been a pretty decent little tactical shooter.At this point, while I hope the developers will continue fixing and improving on their design, there's little incentive for 505 Games, the publisher, to fund them to do so.Again, the whole situation is a mess, but as much as part of me wants to dismiss it wholesale, I can't say I hate the game.It's brutal and unforgiving in the same way the old Rainbow Six games were, which is bound to be offputting to some people, but scratches an itch most shooters don't for me right now.Shots can kill or seriously injure you very quickly, and there is no way to recover health.The AI opponents have moments of startling cleverness, though most of the times they drop you will be due to not cursoring over them fast enough to evade their sometimes exceptionally quick and accurate weapons fire.There's a tenseness to the action that would be lost if the damage model and AI were more forgiving.The map designs are open and interesting, each one providing you with two potential ""insertion points"" which determine where you start. Some of the design is actually fairly visually attractive, though strange things like reflections that don't actually reflect the environment in a coherent way can slightly mar the experience. (Particularly in the ""HQ"" level.)Despite there being numerous doors on most maps that are purely decorative and don't open, there's a refreshing amount of freedom to how you approach each mission. The nonlinearity also scratches an itch I haven't had many first-person games reach recently. This isn't always player-friendly design in the sense of providing easy and obvious ways to progress, but I'm not sure this is a situation where one can have their cake and eat it too.HUD is rather minimal, and they go so far as to strip you of a crosshair. You can aim down sights, but that slows your movement. Recoil is extremely noticeable on most weapons, and really needs to be minded in combat.These are traits that add interest to me, but could be deal breakers for some.What's most likely to bother people though, and rightly so, is that the game simply isn't finished. It's glitchy to the point that sometimes something as simple as switching weapons will lock you into a selection, leaving you twiddling your thumbs when the grenade slot you locked into runs out of ammo. Menus are glitchy and need to be minded, sometimes forgetting loadout changes (particularly the addition/removal of silencers). It's missing features as simple as text chat in game lobbies.Despite the fact that I myself have found enjoyment in the game, I can't bring myself to recommend anyone spend $14.99 on it - especially not when Rainbow Six 3 Gold, which is $5 cheaper, scratches all of the same gaming itches and has far more polish, depth, and content. That said, Rainbow Six 3 is more than ten years old and there have been too few games like it on the market since its release. This is a genre and style of gameplay that needs preserving, but Takedown just isn't offering enough.(As Serellan updates this title, assuming they do, I will update this review. As of the time of this writing, the last update was February 6th, 2014.)"

Bought 7 copies for 5 dollars, and got it to work as soon as i put it in, okay. The loadout is personally my favorite aspect of this game, you get to make your own loadout, to fit your personal standards, cool. But the game, is, TERRIBLE, first off, when you play the training, its basic, you already know how to fit this game, the controls are standard, but serve no purpose. When you play your first mission, you will know what I'm talking about. The AI is too smart, smarter than your highly trained SWAT team you have following you like mindless zombies. When they see a bad-guy, they say Tango Spotted, so I tell them to shoot it, they just look at it though. The enemy AI always knows where you are. Your only intel is what the game gives you. You spend more time getting killed by super buffed pirates than you do killing pirates that aren't trained. If you're going stealthy, you'd expect that they wouldn't know where you are. But really, all they do is aim at you, until you come into the direct line of sight, then they start running after you. Glass is bad for you, because you can't entirely see through it, but the enemy can, and shoot at you, killing you on the first hit. There are around 2-3 people that are programmed to look in a certain direction, and not staring at you the entire time. Your team is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you cannot tell a single person what to do. You have a sniper, an assault, and a breach, you are supposed to be the recon, but what if you don't like that class? Your team will stare at a bad guy, but not fire. They do not know where a single person is, until the person shoots them in the head, with their 99.99% accuracy, while yours and your teammates accuracy is 80%. Your team is clunky, ending up alerting the enemy before you can scope out the map, because you cannot make them wear different armor, or armor fit for what you want to do. The mission always wants you to go steath, when the mission objectives call for action. Your team always has silencers, when you don't even need them. Now I'm getting started on multiplayer. Half the time, you're on the team with a prick, who only wants you to hate the game you payed for, it's not even free, so they kill you with their insta-kill guns, wearing huge♥♥♥♥♥armor, so they kill the entire team before the game even really starts, then they kill themselves, because they're bored. Other than that the maps are too big for 6 on 6 team deathmatches. If you could have 12 people on each team, then it would be fair, and the match would be 90% more interesting, but it's full of boring experience. I was lucky to buy the game for less than a dollar, you, are not. If you really want this game, just message me and I'll send you a copy. But be warned, until the makers seriously patch this game. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. 2/10"

The base mechanics of the game (assuming you can play it; I had to disable my joystick to prevent input interference that spun me in a continous 360 to the left) are promising: as a technology demonstrator this should secure future funding. Unfortunately the niche 'tactical shooter-simulation' market continues to play the old, proven games for very good reasons: Namely that they have content and they work reliably. This is not something that Takedown: Red Sabre (TRS) can boast. I have 0.7hrs of gameplay because the game simply refuses to start despite recent patches and I had to solve the competing inputs issue before I could review the base mechanics of the game. Graphics are as you seen on the screenshots, entirely satisfactory.TRS is missing a great deal: Storied, biographed team-mates, working multiplayer, mission briefings, a campaign, a planning phase, all of the things that made Rainbow 6 a remarkable series of games prior to its franchisement into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pap for consumption by mentally damaged children. There's no reason these features cannot be applied to TRS, save for the developer's sham development process.Make no mistake: TRS is at present one of the ""work in progress"" or ""fund us as we go"" games made possible by Steam's update distribution function. Such a development model was previously impossible for technical reasons, but for marketing reasons I think TRS will prove that it should not be adopted now that the technical hurdles have been overcome.Most of the early negative comments regarding TRS were from ""railshooter"" players who have never asked more of their games than a scripted cinematic experience with no replayability and largely, no challenge or critical thought required. These were unfounded negative comments. Subsequent commentary has focused on the incomplete and outright flawed nature of the game, and what Serellan LLC has done is take a dormant market hungry for new content and alienated it completely in the span of two months. Bravo zulu; you have now created the textbook negative example.Do not bother with TRS until vast, sweeping changes are made.15-10-2013."

,Recommended,236510,9047408,"Posted: 10 February, 2014",all,DarK_St3alth,"New tactical shooter at a low price running on Unreal? Why is is so cheap?If I had to place a specific genre on the top of my list of games I want to play the most, it would have to be the ""Sci-Fi Tatical Shooter"" genre. While Stellar Marines isn't anywhere close to complete, I looked for something to challenge me in the mean time.At the end of the day, playing isn't good enough. There has to be a challenge, and that is what seems to separate the two major classes of modern gamers. Games used to make you rage to the point of throwing your machine out the window (and not due to bugs!). Takedown: Red Sabre returns to these roots for the most part, which is why it was hyped up at the start.So what about all the other reviews and metascore? Why are they giving the title a huge thumbs down? Well the key issue lays with release day. I had thought about purchasing the title on release day, but passed off wanting to ensure I wasn't wasting money on a buggy game. Good thing I did, bugs were everywhere in the game. People would disconnect from singleplayer games randomly, and the server browser didn't work. Rest assured most (if not all) release day bugs have been fixed.Being a ""hardcore"" tactical shooter, it's not easy to beat. Playing by yourself is quite a trick, so bring friends whenever possible.Speaking of friends -- to make the game enjoyable you should bring some. The game isn't VAC secured, and trolls will be in game sooner or later. Teamkilling seems to consist of a moral punishment, nothing more. There's no current system (2/10/2014) to get rid of them without knowing Unreal's console. An oversight for sure, mainly from the game being so cheap. And don't forget there's no private or password protected lobbies!The game isn't complete, and shouldn't be advertised as such. The AI is very hit-or-miss, having naturally deadly aim the moment you open the door, but then stare at you in other cases. Flashbangs don't interact how they should, as AI don't seem to be ""flashed"" when thrown. The AI also seem to be unaware of any sounds, but then can somehow know you are outside the door.Maps are well designed, modeled after real life places that a tactical team might find themselves in. The key part is that the levels don't lack in openness. You have to be naked out in the open sometime, proving to be an almost instant death if you don't play it right. Indoor environments react how they should, but door handling with latency can be an issue.Could the game be more? For sure and without a doubt. Examples would be finer tuning on the Kevlar or bullet resistant gear (like where on the body), a prone position, or even a true clip/magazine system (a big must for hardcore). However, the title has to clean up the AI. In it's current state, it's not really hardcore, but it's getting there.One way to clean the AI up would be to add group intelligence like that seen in Half Life 2. Squad tactics are shown on the human side of Takedown, but not on the AI side of things. It would be simple as adding code when an AI spots a human player, other AI join in the firefight. Just play the level called ""Facility"" on Co-op. You will see what I mean, the AI all act independently.So there you have it. All the issues but good positives as well. This review is kind of odd being price dependent. I purchased the title for about $1.79. At that cost, I would happily slap a 7 for title. At it's regular cost, 6.5. With the odd handling somehow working out to make a hard game, it certainly checks the ""different"" checkbox for me. Anyone that knows me well enough understands it's a key criteria to meet.6.5/10 - 7/10"

This game was kickstarted and I was looking forward to an actual tactical shooter as everyone else was. The team behind this game were a good set of developers who everyone believed could make a really good tactical shooter that could compare to games like SWAT 4 or the old Rainbow Six games.What you get instead is a game that seems about 80% finished, with solid shooting mechanics but shoddy texture work and poor AI. The AI sometimes hear you through two walls but sometimes don't notice you when you are next to them. Doesn't make any sense. The online community for this game doesn't exist as everyone has jumped ship on this game. So you're stuck with the AI teammates who just get killed constantly.For a dollar, if you are interested in a tactical shooter that you'll probably play for a couple of hours, go for it.

I hate to make this my first review, but I don't feel like looking at my Child Health, Safety, & Nutrition coursework for the week. Here we go.So, the good news: guns, bullets, and the overall concept.The bad news: how all those come together.I won't be the first or last to state that the AI is just awful. As mentioned in another review, the enemy soldiers can pick you off from across the map with one quick and silent shot through your cover, faster than you can say: ""I wonder if people still play Ghost Recon?"" Sometimes all of them converge on the player at one single time, and if it wasn't bad enough that one has an advantage over you (that's right, I said <<advantage>> because they're Aimbots), you'll have no hope against multiple foes because... the controls are pretty stiff. Very stiff. Fiddle and configure all you want. Go ahead, stick that 360 control in. It does not matter. Now, some of us are not surprised by a more confined feeling for a game like this... except, here, the controls wear a straight jacket. There's not much that's smooth about them. At all, really.Now, as others have also said, I really wanted to like this game. Truly. In its current state, it is <<not>> a finished game. It's not. It's ugly.Wait - speaking of ugly - have you seen the graphics on it? Now, okay, I get it, graphics are not the end-all. But it wouldn't hurt to have worked on the aesthetics as long as the gameplay, tactics, realism, and controls were all being ignored.Verdict: In its current state, this game is not worth playing or owning. If they do a gargantuan overhaul and addres all the issues we see... maybe we'll talk.'til then, dudes, turn this baby down.PS: Sorry, Mike, I gifted this to you so it wouldn't be in my ""inventory."""

The game is so hard that the player is pushed into a position where they have to use their tactical prowess to survive. Guns basically insta-kill and there are pretty much no revives.The game, in its complete form, is an utter disaster. The maps are way too linear for tactical gameplay. I kept walking down stairs or into a room with a guy, and it would be who shot first rather than what strategy I used. The map design just doesn't help this mess, and that's only the beginning.Rainbow Six and other tactical shooters are fun because they don't sacrifice gameplay for realism. In Red Sabre, you can't get revived, and you don't respawn. If you die, you lose, and you are taken back to the lobby. In Hotline miami, you die a lot, but you respawn quickly and get as many chances as you want to complete the level. The same thing goes for Super Meat Boy. The truth is, Red Sabre needs a reason to be worth playing. The graphics are bland, the maps are linear and unexciting to say the least, and I don't feel compelled to completely restart the mission each time I fail at it.The developers clearly wanted a realistic feel, so that the players would be forced to play tactically. They did almost everything wrong with this game, and it isn't even close to being redeemed. The truth is, there are way better games on the market that do what this game does, but better. Honestly, I feel like this game tries to be unique among other shooters, but goes way over the top, and sacrifices any little bit of fun this game could've been capable of."

The fact that the lean feature doesn't work when moving and combine that with the fact that you barely lean makes CQB next to impossible which the game is primarily based around. The friendly AI is always too close to you, which is strange since they are highly trained special forces soldiers or somthing, too make matters worse when you die and switch to one of the AI soldiers he's usally too close to where you got killed and the completely over powered enemy AI kills you as soon as you switch over to the next character. This game could have been a lot better if they had of held off releasing the game until much much later so they could fix the bugs properly and just improve the game in general.I hope one day the game get better so that I can recomend this game but that seems like it isn't going to be any time soon."

Ever. Even if it's free. There are several issues with the game and I am going to post a few:1. Lag. Everyone gets lag. It's terrible. However funny it is watching your team walk into walls it gets boring after a while.2. AI. The bots in this game are terrible. Team mates don't help you and enemies instantly kill you while they are facing into a wall.3. Shooting. You cannot kill anyone. Insane recoil and no weapon damage as well as inability to aim.4. Snails. You move like a snail.5. Feel. The menus are horrible. They don't work. You cannot change loadout for some reason. You cannot change settings during a game and they are very limited. The chat is horrible and messages disappear after 3 seconds. I am yet to find voice chat.6. Players. Barely anyone plays this and those who do hate it. End of.

While the AI seem to be unable to notice bullets from a far distance, they react quickly enough if they see you and don't always instagib you, for example, if you are peeking around walls. The wall-peek system, while a good concept, is executed in such a way that you end up having to slowly peek around all of the walls, in order to shoot the guy waiting around the corner before he can see you. This game might be good multiplayer, but the single-player experience feels like trying to use a cheese grater to kill a SWAT team.

Turns out, i should have just not gotten it.Quick note: I think it is worth $1.50 while its on sale, but its not worth $15 and that what i am basing my review on.Cons:-You would think by now the patches would be ironed out, but no. There is lag (i can run bf4) even in single player and there is constant stuterring. I can even occasionally shoot trough the edge of walls-The accuracy is awful for all guns except snipers and pistols. I understand that there is bullet drop and wind resistance, but i would take two shots in a row and sometimes, one bullet would go to the right while the other goes to the left. Makes no sense-Missions objectives are in the pause menu but you have no idea where your actually supposed to go. Concidering this is a simulator, you would think maybe you would have a blueprint. In one mission, a company hires you to go into their building to do some stuff, but does not give you a blueprint to locate the stuff. Do they want you to die?-when you are in lean mode and move, the game stutters-your weapon disappears when you touch a wall. I know this is on purpose but have no idea why. It is not part of a cover system and makes it easier to die when you try to hide behind a table only to learn you cant shoot.-squad system is not good at allPros:-okay, the game is not all bad. The the one-two hit kill is a nice feature for those looking for hard core games.-no respawn. True to the genre ""simulator"", once you die, your finished. If you are playing singleplayer, you can take the life of an ai teammate, but you only have three, and they can die on their own.-because you can die easily and lose 50 min of progress, it create a ""one more game"" feel as you are determined to beat that levelI will update as i play more."

I do not reccomend buying it because you would be buying a broken game that will never be fixed.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:After seeing all the negative reviews I decided to weigh in my own opinion.Sure, the game is still a bit rough around the edges, but it's fun to play on co-op.It has great potential and the developers are still working on updates and new content.If you are a tactical shooter fan you should support the developers instead of hatingon the game and just saying ""SWAT 4/Rainbow Six 3 are better"". Of course these are greatgames, but they have been around for 9 and 11 years respectively. Are you going to justkeep playing them for the next decade and discard everything else, because it's not as good?Or would you rather try and support the people that want to bring back the experience?If 14€/$15 is too steep just add the game to your wishlist and wait for a sale.There's no rush and it's easy to snag it for a fraction of the price. You evenget an extra copy so you can gift it to a friend and play together. Better yet,I'm sure all the people who hate the game so much they say ""it gave them cancer""will be more than happy to trade their extra copy or give it to you for free.Try reaching out to them.If all disappointed ""true tactical shooter fans"" tried to give constructive criticism,participate in the community and support the developer, we might eventually get the realRainbow Six and SWAT successor. The potential is there, it just needs more polish.TL;DR: This game is underrated. It has the potential, but we need to support thedevelopers instead of hating to make it work.Also, wait for a sale and buy it dirt cheap.Or trade for it since so many people have extra copies.PROS:- the weapons feel good and behave realistically- the maps are great- there is a lot of gear/equipment to choose- the graphics are good but still run decently on older computersCONS:- the AI: enemies are unpredictable and teammates are unreliable- there is no action planning- you can only give very basic orders to your teammatesPRO TIP: There is avery useful map guidefrom 505 Games on the Takedown community hub."

The doors are too big with comically low handles along with variou other  design oversights that suggest that most of this content is actually placeholders for future improvements.With that all said, this game is like that lovable beater car. The kind you have to smack the dahsboard a certain way to get the lights to come on. It's clunky and frustrating in it's own diabolical ways. It does take strategy and teamwork to clear a level once you get used to your surroundings, even then you can find yourself feet away from your final goal only to have it instantly wiped away thanks to an oversight in your exit strategy.Bottomline: This is like if Metal Gear Solid and Swat 3 had a special needs child. It might not be what you expect from a modern game, but it's certainly entertaining. Next time you see this game on sale (90%) just buy, with the DLC it was $4.50. Plus you get 3 gift passes. I suggest giving them to friends with a good sense of humor and that don't mind dealing with a frustrating game. It's so bad it's good....."

I don't recommend paying the full price if you don't like slow paced tactical gameplay.My little review and complaints are based on singleplayer missions and overall game mechanics because multiplayer is somewhat ""dead"" right now, I can't find decent pings on my region.The game feels like a ""beta"". Glass reflection is odd, the movement need to be more responsive and less awkward, AI reaction is fine but how it detects sound is sometimes unfair, AI hearing your shoots are ok, but hearing when you walk slowly or open doors is just strange, why opening doors are so noisy? Why no AI footsteps sounds? And their sound cues/chatting are so odd. If they can hear me why can't I hear them? And the AI should move more, not just stand in some corner waiting but don't make it charge like a suicidal retard.I really desire that in the future this game gets improved.

There have been free updates to it, but this project is never going to be ready.Its core feature was supposed to be open modding. Like ARMA, Takedown was to be fine tuned by the players into what they want out of their game. As far as I can tell, these mod tools still have not been released to the public and the audience has long lost their interest anyway.Existing mechanics are still limited and misguided. Game elements are designed with focus placed on whether it's a realistic implementation, rather than an implementation that results in realistic gameplay. No form of reticule, for example, does not improve realism and instead draws attention to the false 3D space you're looking upon, further breaking the immersion.The window of opportunity has come and gone.

First off, I do not mind that this game is buggy due to the fact that this is basically still simply a indie game, but the devs are not honest with the current situation, and the game is not even advertised as ""Early Access"". I mean, look at Interstellar Marines, that game is even less complete than Takedown, but it already have a solid fanbase. Also, in the discription, it is claimed that you will have to ""Plan your mission"", and ""outfit your teammates with weapons"", which are both lies. First off, you CANNOT plan your inflitration before starting the mission, and you cannot outfit your teammates either, I mean come on, I spend more time planning my attacks to take out enemies one by one in Arkham City. Also, the Al in this game is extremely typical. At close range, they are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that they won't even bother to shoot you or return fire, as long range, however, they will kill you with deadly precision. Silencers are also completely useless as I can't spot the difference between a suspressed and unsuspressed weapon. I was banned on the forums just for criticizing the game, just to tell you what kind of devs this game have. If you want a true tactical shooter with a similar price tag, I recommend Counter-Strike, Red Orchestra, Rainbow Six 3: ""Raven Shield"" Gold Edition, Insurgency and Interstellar Marines."

Seemed like a bland version of SWAT/Rainbow 6 games. When the game came out, it confirmed what I was thinking, but it was much much worse than I ever believed.First problem I had was options. Graphic options are pathetic with only v-sync, overall quality, brightness, and resolution. No way to tweak specific elements. In-game you can not access the options menu at all. You can not change graphics, controls, sound, etc. AT ALL in-game.Another problem I had was the gameplay. Controls work for the most part, but the movement felt stiff. Sometimes the game will glitch your gun when you switch and leave you stuck unarmed. AI is spotty at best. Teammates can not being commanded to move anywhere, they only follow like sheep and get in the way. They rarely get any enemies. Enemy AI is mediocre, they don't react to your unsuppressed gunfire all the time and won't shoot you even you stand right in front of them sometimes. Also the timer is obnoxiously in the middle of the screen, something that can just be on the corner of the screen.Multiplayer flat out didn't work at all. Insulting to anyone that wanted to play with others.The overall presentation and gameplay of the game is generic to put it mildly. Should of just called this game Tactical Shooter, because it does nothing to stand out from the crowd despite being much newer than similar games. If your going to revive a genre, take what was good about it and refine was not so good about it.

I see they try to fix this game up, they respond on the community and they give out free DLC. If they even fixed it, it would be really hard for them to bring back a crowd.So the gameplay is just over the top bad and funny. The AI are way too hard. They will instantly shot you, WITH THEIR BACK TURNED TO YOU! The only reason I say funny is because sometimes they ragdoll and its funny. Even though I didn't buy this game on launch, Serellan probably lost a lot of fans when they removed the Text to Speech function, which people made videos of and the are quite enjoyable. Wrong move Serellan.The graphics are perfectly fine since it runs on Unreal engine, but related to the engine are the gun reload animations and much more to anything with guns. The gun reload sounds are off from the reload animation itself so the reload sound will be done before the gun is.Overall, this game is REALLY bad and needs MAJOR work. Yet somethings aren't bad like the map designs, everything else such as AI, gun reloads, loadouts need some work. Yes, if they did fix ALL these problems, the game could make a comeback but, after all the press saying the game sucks, they'd have to pull a miracle out of their asses. So therefore I rate this game 5/10 not too good, not too bad. This is why I want a neutral button. PLUS ITS 1.50 RIGHT NOW!"

Texture quality leaves much to be desired, lighting is ok but flat, and dated. Sounds is mediocre at best. Ai is non-exsistent. The ""tactics"" are no where to be found unless in co-op with friends. There is no ROE, speed or door breach selection. Hell I even have a hard time using a map in this game. Much less tactics.

I have a hobby of finding and playing bad games, and I can't honestly consider this game bad. In fact, there are plenty of games that received higher ratings than this that were considerably worse. I'd recommend paying around $5 to $7 for this game in its current state, if they fix some of the major bugs, it's easily a $20-$30 title.Full disclosure: I did not back this on Kickstarter and paid just under $2 for it,I'm not trying to make myself feel better about my money, I genuinely enjoy this game and have played plenty of worse games. I'd sincerely give Takedown a 68/100, it'll appeal largely to fans of tactical FPS games, but everyone else won't find it nearly as enjoyable.Alpha Prime, Alpha Protocol, Blacklight: TD, Chrome, Damnation, Judge Dredd: DvD, every Painkiller not by People Can Fly, Shellshock 2: BT, Star Wars: Republic Commando... These are all games that received much higher ratings, but I consider to be far worse than Takedown.This game's AI can be buggy, sometimes it's braindead, but when it chooses to work (and it usually does) it feels reminescent of Half-Life's AI. It will find cover, it will regroup and attack as a squad, and it will try to flank you. I'd argue that the AI for me works about 75% of the time, and I feel like people are remembering the times it craps out more than when it works. We're all so used to seeing good AI that when AI IS good, we don't even notice it anymore.The weapons are realistically modelled both in terms of visuals and ballistics. Rounds will penetrate materials properly, and this feature can be used both by the player and by the AI. Glass, thin boards, flimsy sheets of metal, etc. will be react to different kinds ammo the way these things would in real life. A large, slow caliber bullet will penetrate less than a small, fast round. AP ammo will go through more than FMJ or JHPs and Soft-Nose. Takedown has some of the best ballistics I've seen from a smaller budget game.The level design is above average, but not great. Levels have enough paths to take to reach an objective that they are in no way linear. However, the addition of doors with little ""No"" symbols hovering in front of them are a little perplexing. For being a realist tactical shooter, this breaks immersion. The maps could have had more depth, but aren't bad at all.Sound design is accurate for weapons, and even the suppressed weapons make the proper level of sound. Contrary to common belief, suppressed weapons are still fairly loud, just not AS loud. The weapons firing sound like real guns, not toys as I've heard in a lot of bad shooters. However, sound isn't properly blocked by walls, and it's possible to hear enemies in other rooms.Graphics are decent but a little dated. They feel sorta 2010-ish, which isn't that bad, tbh. Enemies are clones, but the fact that most wear balaclavas keeps the cloney-ness from breaking immersion."

If you have 3 friends to play with who enjoy extrodinarily difficult games and this is on sale (I bought it here at $1.50) it can be worth it. However this is the only instance in which it can be fun.<Negative Remarks>Single player, this game is not worth your time even if it was free. I hate to label a game as being too difficult because I love good challenges, but this game is difficult for the wrong reasons. Mostly being your AI team mates and squad control. Both might as well be nonexistent. Aside from them getting shot faster than you will, they are too noisey. The best chance you have of knowing where tangos will be in this game is by sound and you squad will not stop running around and talking.The tangos seem as if they are running off an entirely different AI. They are hiding behind every door and around every corner. They are hiding in every nook and cranny on these maps. When you are spotted by an enemy you will most likely be shot. They have outstanding marksmanship and catlike reflexes. This would make a fun AI to play against if it was not this game.The controls are lacking refinment. By this I mean that it feels both sluggish and slippery and the same time. The game defaults you to walking (this can be switched to run in the gameplay setting of the options) and this makes for a very unpleasant first impression if you have not changed it to run. This causes gameplay to feel incredibly slow and uneventful. In defense of the game developers decision to make it a default, this game is not meant to be a run and gunner. This is a slow squad based tactical shooter.The last thing to talk about for faults for now is random tid-bits that just do not make any sense to me. First, when you pause the game you cannot view the controls or make any adjustments to mouse sensitivity. So hopefully you got it just the way you like it on the first try or you will have to quit the mission and jump back to the main menu. Second, door breaches are assigned to either weapon slot 3 or 4. Pressing numeric keys 3 or 4 (which ever you have breaches assigned to) does not equip them. You have to know they are assigned to ""G"". You are not told this, you just have to know by looking at the controls before you start playing the game. Call me old fashioned but I am use to tutorials teaching me everything I need to know when playing the game. This brings me to my final random frustration with the game: lack of tutorial. This is not my first rodeo, I know how to play first person shooters. This game has 2 practice maps but they both focus on how to shoot the guns and getting to look at all the cool effects from bullets hitting the wood or dummies. These maps feel as if they were just made to shoot the demo videos in pre-release.<Overall Remarks>This game was on sale for $1.50 for 2 copies so you can give one to a friend... Eh, worth it. I find it difficult to be unhappy about a game at that price. Word of warning though, this game contains VERY DIFFICULT SINGLE PLAYER.

It has a slight air of unfinished about it, but it does seem to be ""work in progress"" and from looking at the forums, a labour of love.Don't expect the razamatazz and glitz of COD or MOH because there isn't any. No spectacular cut scenes,  However, in single player, every enemy soldier I came across took a shot at me whenever I came in to his line of sight.  My team went down very quickly and I was left to ""lone wolf"" it around the level.  It was tense, not knowing whether the next corner I looked around would be my last.  I enjoyed the opening doors in ""Biolab"" level, as in other levels most of them were already opened.When I had a team they were totally superfluous except when  they were the target of an enemy which meant I wasn't shot.  Do not follow the ""hide behind a team member"" method as bullets penetrate in this game, and your teammate is  more likely to get shot by you as they move erratically, with obvious consequences.""Tactical Shooter"" it ain't.  You don't plan.  You don't command your team.  You don't set up ambushes.  It's more of a Strategic Shooter, go slow, peek every corner, hug the walls, hope you see them before they see you.I liked the graphics, and the oil rig and ship graphics were exceptional.  Sighting your shots without the obligatory ""onscreen"" cross hairs was refreshing and requires a bit of practice in the Range so you can pull off quick shots from the hip.  However aiming your weapon was consistent, and you soon get to know your gun.Perhaps a difficulty level system could be devised which gave rookies more armour to allow you to survive at least a couple of shots before you join the late and much lamented Tom Clancy?Technically it worked for me.  No crashes, no views through walls.  The sound is a little strange as your team announces that they have spotted an enemy or other useful information at the top of their voice, and hints at the fact that whether you use a suppressor or not makes no difference to the enemy AI.  Hearing a loud ""Tango sighted"" is also not much use if you don't know which team member sighted the aforesaid festive dance.Some of the levels are huge and hunting down the final terrorist can take ages; this can be described as either a) adding to the tension as the onscreen clock ticks away the seconds, ""Will you find him in time to complete the mission?"" or b) highly tedious and an issue that other games have overcome by making the last terrorist come looking for you.In summary it's cheap and merciless, a strange combination which harks back to a previous time when men were men and enemies stood up to be counted (and shot).  Without a single ""flashback"" or HD video the atmosphere of the game is tense and can all be over in a (muzzle) flash.  That's what makes it different  from the average FPS available today.I look forward to seeing more levels, or an SDK so that the people who have invested in the game can get a bit more return.If you like old school I think you might enjoy it, don't expect much, as there isn't a lot.But it is far from unplayable, and will be good for nostalgia trips on a low budget."

If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ cry-baby who can't handle a challenge, then don't even bother because you'll spend the majority of your time festering in rage as you whine about the walkspeed, damage threshhold, or some other facet of the game that was intentionally put there to shrug off the waves of people who expected this to be like any modern shooter.The truth is, Takedown: Red Sabre is a tactical shooter. You will not get the opportunity to run and gun, this is a thinking man's shooter. That means teamwork and coordination is a must for any and every mission. I apologize profusely that your usual playstyle of lone-wolf rushing into a room full of armed men is not supported, but the truth is, I'm not sure how you've evaded natural selection long enough to buy this game in the first place, because you seem to be too stupid to function.By no means is this a perfect game. The U.I is lacking in so many ways, the game feels like an alpha still, and there are a plethora of issues with multiplayer and loadout. I will not stand, however, for some two-bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a youtube account(AllSHamNoWow and StroodleNoodle) trying to get a quick ""L.O.L!"" by broadcasting their half-baked opinions about how ""hard"" or ""unfair"" it is.Takedown: Red Sabre will grab you by the throat and ram your head into the nearest table. If you have friends, they can join in to make it less painful for you, but don't be surprised when everybody gets table-shaped indents in their babysoft skulls. If you're okay with dying a few times before accomplishing a goal, then buy this game, because you're in for the ravaging of your lifetime."

The idea of this game is everything I'm looking for in a modern First Person Shooter. But the execution... that's another story.The game feels clunky and unnatural. The very movement of your characters is like pushing a train up a hill with your bare hands. The gun mechanics and the general feeling of the firearms is like riding a bull for 8 seconds - they just don't do what you want them to do. It's like the controls are made with one reason only - to fight against you.I won't even mention the idiotic AI and the amount of bugs there were at release.So, long story short - the game was hyped by its devs way too much. They promised us things, which are completely possible and should actually be done in the gaming industry.

Trouble is the gameplay in this is dull and uninspiring... Walk round a corner with Guy1, get shot in the head. Walk round the same corner with Guy2 and shoot the guy that shot Guy1, open a door and get shot in the head. Guy3 goes through the door, shoots the baddy that killed Guy2. A door across the corridor opens and Guy3 gets shot in the head. Guy4 meanwhile is stuck with his♥♥♥♥♥hanging out of a wall before the first corner.

The AI is a joke, it is not immersive at all, there are no events, basically your just entering a room and have to pie it and when you see someone you can line up a shot but the others are oblivious, the enemy units do not use formations or lean or do anything with anything but stand move and gun. The maps while a small positive in there size and diversity are few in numbers, the AI do not use any map elements or items or anything, they do not seem to acknowledge each other, like they stand there every day really? Don't they live life? Have a cig? Talk to each other, actually use each other? Na, they are just dummies. The PvP is ok but other games like Insurgency surpass this game. I prefer Tom Clancy Rainbow 6 3 over this. The AI, actually react and use each other, and the map elements, and you can open doors in inches or all at once. I think this game tried to copy that, but with better graphics.The gunplay in the game is so blah and nothing, for example in Insurgency it is decisive, and dynamic, like Counter-Strike but realistic. Here it is like a carnival game almost. They once sold this game for $1.00 so do not buy for $5, can you believe I actually paid around $45 for 3 copies, now at full price I can have 9. Please take that as a sign that this game is a no go.Remember if your looking at this game and say your gonna like it anyways, go look at Insurgency,Thats right INSURGENCY. It is exactly what your looking for and better, and has a more dynamic co-op mode. The bots in Insurgency use cover, seem to communicate with each other, you can even hear them sometimes barking orders. They also do flanking and apply pressure at key moments.Takedown Red Sabre co-op is only good when your with friends and you use your imagination. The Dev sure has issues, be careful he is sensitive about the word gay, he will ban you months after you been initially punished for it.BTW, Just breezing thru the community hub, is a whole community of people that made videos that highlight the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, even regular posts about people raging that this is incomplete, be careful the DEV has a vendetta, ♥♥♥♥♥alkers risk ban hammer."

Not because it's good, but it is so gloriously bad that I find myself dying laughing at most everything this game throws at you. It plays like your squad just came from stuffing themselves at Thanksgiving dinner and are constantly about to fall into a coma, that is unless you attach a controller. Somehow the devs put in a sprint instead of just a ""fast walk"" but only allowed you to use it when you click left stick on a controller. The AI is absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥poor (thankfully on both enemy and friendly) and it boils down to 2 enemy types: first are the dumbasses where you constantly find enemies who stare at walls endlessly, even when getting shot at, then you have the top tier terrorists who have uncanny black ops training and marksmanship who can pop your head with their pistol from a mile out without much difficulty. Very little effort went into this after it started receiving awards at PAX 2013 and is still in what other titles would consider an alpha state. If you are looking for something of the likes of Rainbow Six, look elsewhere, however, if you enjoy broken games and absolute stupidity buy this just for the experience.As a side note I would like to mention that when I purchased the 4 pack of the game, they gave me a total of EIGHT working copies by accident, so in the immortal words of Rooster Teeth's Burnie Burns ""They suck♥♥♥♥♥♥so bad they suck♥♥♥♥♥♥at sucking♥♥♥♥♥♥"""

It's extremely good if you play with people you know over voicechat through TeamSpeak for example.

Then there are the trolls who think it's extremely funny killing teammates. I've only encountered a couple of insignifican bugs, like sometimes switching weapons being a little laggy or not being able to chose another class but the recon (this wasn't a problem though since you can totally customize every single loadout). And about the AI, let's say it took about 5 trys with a team of 4 people on a map we learned to beat the mission once with 2 players alive at the end (and we do have tactical shooter experience).What I'd like to see in the future are more maps and objectives, maybe with a little more depth to the missionsI'd say if you think that this is an interesting game but you are not sure if you want to buy it or not regarding the reviews, ignore them and check out some gameplay, you'll know if you will have fun playing it.

This is not a game for you2) Inpatiant people who just get mad at slow AI progress...This game forces you to think out your plan of attack, and is set up to make sure you really feel like your in a close quarters battle. One well placed shot and your dead.. thats life. Stand out in the open, and your asking to be lit up.. If it looks like a choke point... you might want to think twice or throw in a flash bang before going through.Other words, this is a TACTICAL shooter. The gameplay is smooth. It could be much better, but what game is perfect? Sound effects seem good so far.  The weapons selection is fairly decent, but the equipment is fairly limited.   Graphics could be stronger, but are fair for the base engine the game runs on. The AI.... lets see, the big problem I have is having to constently repeat orders to my team...

I Guess for starters the gameplay its self is so awesome. The graphics are decent its no arma or farcry but its better than most games. The awesome fact that you can choose between a woping 4 guns as a priamry 2 for your secendary and 2 between your grenades. But thats were your ammo comes into play, you have like 5 different ammmo types that you can choose from. Oh and dont get me started on the maps. they are just so amazing. I love how you can only play like 10 maps. there all the same size and all the same shity qaulity. But the thing that gets me over all is that if your a guy like me with okis internet that its only 2 gbs. But the download loves to stop after like every half of a gb. But over all what i love about this game is that waiting like 3 days to do 2 gbs I love that when i spawn in my character constenly spins in a circle and there is nothing you can do about it.  i love how it adds the challenge to an already hard as hell game. over all this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ i highly reccomend it"
,Not Recommended,236510,33538980,Posted: 14 July,all,𝕤𝕡𝕠𝕠𝕜𝕪,"This game is a pile of hot trashEDIT: I guess my original review didn't sit well with someone and it was rather unhelpful, so I'll make an effort to actually review this game.So I want to start by saying that the premise of this game is very cool and that I would love to play a more refined version of this game. Another positive is that the map layouts and concepts are pretty unique so there's that.However, I can't recommend this game to an average steam browser. I'll start with my biggest gripe which is the AI. The AI is either very very very stupid, as in you can shoot and miss from 2 feet away and you'll hear the wonderful ""WHAT WAS THAT?!"" dialogue, or they're sniper elite aimbots that can shoot you from across the map for walking about two steps. And because of this bipolar AI a couple maps feel too difficult. And I know it may sound like I'm being a piece of trash and not taking the stealth serious enough to figure out how to move through the area, but I feel like if a developer wants to welcome new players to a community they should lower the AI's bar a bit.One thing I do want to say is that this game has a very steep learning curve if you aren't familiar with stealth games. I'm not saying this is a bad thing though, I don't mind having to work to get my head around a game, but with how much the AI's intelligence fluctuates, it doesn't feel like I can really get a grasp on how to progress on certain levels.The last thing I want to address is the darkness in the game. So I really do appreciate how much the devs tried to make the game super realistic with damage and controls, however the darkness is just kind of ridiculous. If you leave a direct light source it is pitch black and the flashlight is very narrow and doesn't really provide much light. I really want to see the design in this game because it looks pretty decent in sunlight, but I feel like I can't on some levels.So do I recommend this game?Well it does have a really neat concept, cool map concepts, and decent graphics. However, with the bipolar AI which creates a wide range of map difficulty and pitch darkness which negates one of the positives of this game, I'm going to say no, I don't recommend this game to the average steam browser looking for new games to play.But if you are really into stealth games, don't mind the possibility of a very difficult map, and can look passed the enveloping darkness, then I guess this may actually be the game for you."

Needs auto aim and heartbeat sensor (or equivalent) like old Rainbow Six. Even Raven Shield had these. The movement is also really wooden and primitive -- feels like you're on a Segway. Also, the Unreal Engine was never a good choice for tactical games because it forces all environments to be shrunk and cramped. A lot of the atmosphere and replay value of Rogue Spear came from the relatively larger maps and stretched out spaces. (Even if you couldn't use all the space of those old maps, the more realistically expansive maps made it feel real.) The Unreal engine (painfully ironic name) forces some compromises here in exchange for better close-up detail, but it's a bad trade off.I have mixed feelings about the old R6 planning interface, and I'm not sure how to carry that forward. The old Ghost Recon probably has the best tactical command interface ever. There doesn't seem to be any planning control here .... that would be okay maybe if there was really good in-game squad controls, but I got too annoyed with this game before looking for that. Yes I saw all the negative reviews, but I'd been curious about this game for a long time, and was hoping against hope that there was something here."

I am not ""facebook-gamer"" though, so I've naturally started with single player; maybe this explains my completely opposite experience. So, let me tell you this:The visuals indeed do look like the screens in the store.AI is not state-of-the-art, but still way better than in Medal of Honor: Afghanistan. It doesn't have aimbot, nor it could see through walls -- but it isn't blind either and it could try firing at you blindly through corner walls if it hears you.Weapon sounds do sound somewhat dull, but then again -- they sound more or less realistic, as if someone went to a shooting range with bad quality microphone. (I do own few real life firearms, so you could believe me on this. You could especially note the transition between carbine and .45ACP handgun.)And handling does differ between individual firearms as for recoil, direction of the recoil, vector of realigning etc.If someone tells you otherwise, do not listen. Or go back to your Battlefield2 or whatever. Or learn to lean and cover, shoot precisely with single shots and proceed tactically.* * *That being said, this game does have MINUSES. I've found it while searching whether good ol' SWAT4 isn't on steam and while it is remotely simmilar as for gameplay mechanics, your teammate's AI is horrid. They are moreorless onlÿ alive to accompany you through the mission so that when you get killed, you could reanimate in one of them.  When issued to hold, they only cover few sectors and happily get killed from the other. Doing search and assess is far beyond their capabilities.Crouch isn't really crouch, but ICS-like combat stance. That migh be more realistic for crouch-wwalking, but when you want to execute a crouch on a spot to lower your body height while reloading or peeking around corners, the difference between the full stance and crouch isn't nearly as significant as it ought be.* * *OVERALL:++anti-rush gameplay++non-linear maps+weapon handling+damage mechanics+randomly generated paths-useless teammate AI-overall AI-sometimes, adversaires are kind of immune to gunshots-didicult to lob grenades properly through doors when standing sidewaysVERDICT:It's not SWAT4, but it has larger maps (not CQB-only). It is extremely refreshing to play game which doesn't have emphasis on rushing, but quite the contrary. If only Takedown's bots would gain CSS's bot's situational awareness, this game would be great. This way, it's decent. Well worth my 4EUR.If you've grown on games like Castle Wolfstein (2D), System Shock, Green Berets and SWAT, buy this one also for the cost:benefit ratio is quite reasonable."

Your AI team is LITTERALLY useless there are only those once in a lifetime moments when they save from a enemy trying to kill you. Like i am still trying to finish facility but it is so hard its impossible. The multiplayer? No one plays this game anymore so lets not talk about that subject because there is usually only 2 server with max of 3 people, MAX. This is a bad game but there are some good stuff about it like level design, personally i like HQ the most I think that they did a great job at the level design. Also some of the realistic stuff of the game is pretty good like wall penentration or the way enemies react to sound like your armour or the custimization of your weapons. All in all you have to give this game a chance maybe not for $15 but for $1.49 it is an absolute good deal. The only problems in this game is the glitches, bugs and AI if they fixed those they would have a decent SWAT-based game or due to that fact that metacritic gave them shocking crap score they might still drown. I give this game a 6/10 OK but still needs ALOT of fixing. Just give it a chance."

Yeah, it isn't the tactical game we were promised, but I sure find it fun. The sound design is fantastic. There is no music in the game, which can lead to a lot of tension and enemy gunfire making you jump. A lot of people bag on the graphics being outdated, but they honestly don't bug me. They're nice. One reviewer said that there are N64 games that look more detailed, and that's a flatout lie. There are moments when you start a mission where there will be texture pop in, but that doesn't really bother me. Then again, I'm the guy that still plays MS-DOS games, haha! The AI is a mixed bag. Teammates can sometimes spot enemies I can't and they will pick them off, but there are times where they allow tangos to take us all out like dominoes. Tangos are vicious, which makes the game rather difficult, but I honestly don't mind that. With the few missions that there are, I feel like successfully completing one of them is overcoming a major challenge. I'm sure I will be over joyed when I finally do complete one, haha. The game does fail in terms of being a tactical shooter, the commands you can issue are limited to holding/following and rules of engagement. However, as a regular shooter, I think it's a fun and challenging game. I don't think Takedown: Red Sabre really deserves all of the hate that it gets. Maybe I just have bad taste in games, but I think this game is worth, at least, a try."

This is definately possible in real life, and if one watches some real life recordings of police/military in combat, they most certainly lean as they move.  For a whole host of reasons, this seems like a reasonable thing to do, as one would naturally want to try and see a target before he sees you.  Perhaps it's ""bad form"" to do this in real life, but, once again, if one watches footage of professionals engaging in such close quarters combat, they certainly DO lean while they move.  I wish that I could that here.The level of head bob as one's moving seems too limited.  I'd expect to see more indicators that my body's in motion.And now on to my main concern: the AI's performance.  It's not too bad, and perhaps on par with Arma III's, but that isn't saying much, is it?The biggest points that must be addressed is that it seems the AI forgets a target's position far too quickly.  They also seem incapable of SCANNING their enivronments ACTIVELY.  That means turning one's head on their necks - a novel concept I know, but it should be in the game.  Also, half of the time when I enter a room/corridor that I fought out of, if there's AI in other nearby rooms, they aren't even looking at their most vulnerable areas, such as doors and windows.  They should also be much more vocal when communicating with one another.That said, sometimes they put up a decent fight.AI placement doesn't seem randomized - this is a ""must have"" feature.  Too often, they'll be exactly where they were when one first played the map.I also wish that there was a way to remap my keys.What I've seen of the map designs has been entirely impressive.  Without question, this is this title's main strength and is worthy of praise.I agree with others that it would be nice if one could name their gear setups whatever they want, so that they're easier to identify for selection purposes.  Being able to have camera-snakes would be nice as well, and a wider range of equipment choices.I paid sixty cents for this game, and honestly, I feel guilty about complaining about it at all.  They even sent me a free version of the game to GIFT to someone, so that makes it even harder for me to sound too harsh.  Still, this game feels like a very late alpha build/early beta build, and needs refinement.I'll surely play more of this, and perhaps if merited, update my review later.  Till then, I strongly advise that far more time needs to be invested in the AI's capabilities, have their map placement be randomized, and broaden equipment choices for the player's team.My score for now is a 6.5/10."

I know what you're thinking, the metacritic review says it's terrible. And ♥♥♥♥ metacritic. This is a terribly AWESOME game with many redeeming qualities as long as you aren't boring.

Who doesn't want to go infinitely fast in reverse. As Tow Mater said, ""Ain't no need to watch where I'm goin'; just need to know where I've been.""Anyways, back on the subject of Takedown. It requires you to play at least one co-op mission before selecting a loadout other than Recon. I think this is working as intended so that you can get a feel for the game. After everyone dies from the perfect shot radar AI, which is most of the time, you get to choose another loadout. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Did I say I wasn't even mad?

,Recommended,236510,10094794,"Posted: 12 May, 2014",all,SGT_Rollin,"Avoid the negative reviews if you are looking for a tactical FPS. The genre has been boiled down to almost nothing the past couple years and in my opinion this is the best tactical FPS game since Vegas 2 (that I've played to be fair). This game definitely has the feeling of an old Rainbow Six game. Granted it may be buggy at times and sometimes the AI can be glitchy; overall this game is definitely worth the price it is listed at.I've also enjoyed the single player missions, which some say is boring. However, for me it brought back memories of playing the old Rainbow Six games, such as the original Rainbow Six (1998 N64) and Rogue Spear. You have 3 bots in your squad and if you are killed, you will automatically begin playing as another member in your squad.The best part of this game I would have to say is the co-op missions. The co-op missions are the same as the single player missions, but with other players instead of bots on your team. I believe you can have up to 6 (maybe more) in a single co-op mission. Lots of fun to be had here if you and some friends are looking for some tactical fun.Last, but not least is the versus game modes. There are two; team deathmatch and an attack & defend mode. Team deathmatch is pretty self explanatory. In attack & defend, one team protects the already planted bomb and the other must defuse it; pretty simple. Not quite as much fun as the co-op mode, but definitely nice to have it there in case you want to try something else.All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun tactical shooter to get into. Can't beat that price either."

It is similar to Rainbow Six but its not identical, and thats its beauty. A few of the AI are perhaps a little too fast to shoot you, but that just makes you want to become faster yourself. A great selection of weapons and a decent amount of attachments make this a good game for those who enjoy customising their loadouts. Maps are fantastic and well designed. Probabally my favourate thing about this game is that if you shoot someone, they die. You dont get COD-like enemies that you shoot in the head, then they turn around and shoot you.The only negatives are:There is nothing to unlock, so no real incentives to keep playing.If you stay on the same map for too long, it can get quite boring as the enemies have varied spawn points, but seemingly only 2 possibles for each guy.This should be worth £1.20 of anyones money, so get it while you can!"

Spawn - acting like a Rambo - won. AI extremely prepared to deal with a thinking-person that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right. Buy it."

Instead, though, I got EIGHT  COPIES OF THIS GOD FORSAKEN GAME. I have no idea where to start. Every single thing in this game is broken... But atleast the .jpegs in the offices of the dev's faces look pretty good. The AI in this game is phenomenal, so realistic... If you live in a world where every person has a hive mind, can see around every corner before you,  lives (and dies) by the saying, ""whatch your six,"" and have less than a tenth of a second reaction time. It's fantasic! This game is so broken it can make Poland's military look well constructed. They even broke the walking mechanism... The walking. Mechanism. HOW IN THE WORLD UNDER GOD'S HOLY HEAVENS DO YOU BREAK A WALKING MECHANISM??? There are three speeds to your character: ""Not humanly possible to take steps that small,"" ""a brisk trod through the park,"" and ""so fast I have to put my gun at my side."" The crouch only crouches you an inch or two, and if you lean once you're stuck... For the rest of the game.. Overall though me and my EIGHT friends have had a great time playing this game because it is SOOOOOOO BROKEN. Except for Munkee Nutt, because he somehow is capable of breaking games we give to him. I give this game 9 moist flappity hog sticks  out of 10 moist flappity hog sticks."

,Recommended,236510,9083936,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Fidel,"Ignore every review of this game that isn't recent, because it's pretty clear the developers have fixed most of the issues that people were complaining about last year. I'm not going to lie and say it's the perfect game, but it's not even close to being as bad as most of these reviewers have said it is, and to be honest, I'd even have a hard time saying this game was more bad than it is good.Like I said, the bugs that people were whining about are mostly fixed, and while it's not your typical, mindless, Michael Bay explosionfest like most ADD gamers are into today, it's still a hell of a lot of fun. It's still brutally hard like people have mentioned, but the AI obviously isn't as dumb as they used to be. I'll still have my teammates going hot when I've told them to hold their fire, but it's only when they come under fire, so I'm not going to blame them for firing back one their cover is already blown.Anyway, if you like tactical, stealthy shooters, where one or two bullets will drop you, just as they would in the real world, then you should absolutely buy this game. Ignore the mob mentality that seems to have taken over the review page, and the 12 year old gamers whose first experience gaming was on a PS2. This is just a great, old school, tactical shooter. Buy it now before this sale ends. I already bought the 4-pack, and I'm about to buy another 4-pack to keep in my inventory.Oh, and no, I don't know the developers, nor am I being paid to write this review. I just think this game has gotten a very unfair shake, and I think the price has been dropped to almost free because the developers know they've got a good game now, and they want to show everyone buy almost giving it away."
