,Recommended,236730,7796695,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Alex_SM,"Not as good as the original.Anomaly 2, the sequel to Anomaly Warzone Earth is a good game. The shame is that it isn't as good as the original part of this series.Not from the technical standpoint, that's for sure, because Anomaly 2 is a beautiful game. It's attention to detail is really good, artistic design is great and graphical fidelity is more than enough. Even the music is good, and the voice acting is better than in the original. Only flaw on this side would be the UI, that despite being quite minimal, sometimes gets confusing. There are times when it's hard to see which health bar belongs to whom. Anyway, that's just a minor flaw.Its main problem is that it starts slow. Too slow. First levels are pretty dull. Specially if you played the previous game. It spends too much time being a tutorial. And it's a shame, because it's easy to get bored soon, too soon. Then everything gets better. Then its difficulty gets higher, new towers appear,  the game stops treating you like a newbie, and the fun begins. It's a shame it needs more than an hour to realize you are ready to roll. An hour in a game which lasts about 4 hours?  - I'm in mission 9, of 14 I think, and I've had 2.5 hours of actual gameplay, so I think 4 hours for the single player campaign is a pretty good guess. That's its mistake, and it's a big one. But once you pass trough that, things get really cool again, like in the first one.As for the multiplayer... I won't say anything about it. I'm really not interested in it, and I didn't even tried it.Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, but it would have been better not spending so much time being a tutorial. Maybe it's just me, but I love those sequels that assume you have played the first one and/or you know what you are doing. Anyway, mechanics are not intricate or anything that justify so slow learning curve. Everything is pretty straightforward and easy to learn.Do I recommend it? Yes, but with a bit of caution. Bear in mind that it could disappoint during the first missions."
,Recommended,236730,19683386,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,RockstarCRO,"I will put recommended by I do so with extreme care. Anomaly is a fun tower defense game where you're on the offense while playing a bit of defense with what you got. Anomaly follows a story line where machines have taken over and humanity is struggling to survive.You play as a commander which has the ability to move about the map as he wishes. As the commander in the field, you can quickly change tactics or use a special ability at a whim. Upon getting hurt or shot, the commander regenerates his health. The units are not as fortunate and do not have this ability. This is where the commander steps in. To heal units (or to use any special ability), the commander has to put down a regenerative power up and units have to pass over it within a certain amount of time to heal. After a few seconds, the healing pad will disappear therefore proper placement is almost everything in the game. To acquire more power up supply, the units have to destroy machines as they leave stock behind.Other commander abilities include distraction (where a distraction is put down and targeted by the machines), EMP (where the machines are unable to attack for a period of time - certainly useful for larger opponents) and aim. Vice versa, being the machines your abilities are regeneration, berserk mode, taunt and kamikaze. I haven't had the time to properly explore these modes as there isn't much of an online presence within this game. During peak hours there are a few players playing but for the most part you'll be playing the one player campaign. Planning your attack is a key feature in this game. As the commander, you are able to direct your units which way to go. You may further your progress towards the ""safe zone"" in the game or you may go other routes which may lead to a bonus. Alternatively, killing more robot units will give you more stock for your power ups. This gives the player more flexibility and options in how to approach the game. Although extremely simplistic, a great idea for a game to be over and above immersive.They made the planning extremely easy to do (and easy to see the paths) and time stops when making your move. The units/vehicles themselves all each have differing abilities and 2 different forms. An assault hound for instance, can be a tank and be meant for long range battles where it's other (flame-throwing) form is meant to be in close quarters. This specific unit when in tank form fires a lot faster the more shots it takes. Other units can be used to immobilize enemies or provide shields to allies. Some units are meant for long range and deal quite a bit of damage but take a bit of time to fire again (and have smaller firing ranges). They too can switch to become close quarter fighters but each unit has it's time and place against certain opponents. Opponents can drastically change throughout the levels. You'll be fighting a nice small machine and start getting comfortable when this giant thing may come from no where. Some units fire all along a path and do consistent damage while some units need to be shot at a certain amount of times (and at a certain frequency) to evolve. There is this one shielded enemy that when fired upon quickly, will evolve into a very hard opponent.There are ways to circumvent these situations such as using units that shoot less frequently but deal more damage to not help the evolution process. What bugs me the most about the game though is the commanders movements. Especially if you are using the keyboard, there is no fluidity in the movement/animation and it feels like you can only maneuver in 9 directions.The visuals are quite appealing but at times seem that could have been a bit better. There are some scenery issues where instead of having a smoke animation, it will just be plain. When your units do miss a shot or fire a rocket into an enemy that has already been destroyed, that missile keeps it's course and does eventually explode when coming into contact with something (so a positive feature). The sounds are pretty good and the voice acting is suitable to what the plot presents. Nothing super outstanding in this department but the basics are met. The user interface within the game is easy to navigate.Overall, a decently good game that is worth a purchase on sale and only if you find this sort of genre interesting.RATING : 6.85/10GameplayC+Story / CampaignB-Visuals / User InterfaceC+Sounds / MusicB-Replay-abilityC+OverallC+ScreenShots :What planning a route looks like.

,Recommended,236730,1737278,"Posted: 19 September, 2013",all,jill920,"It's one of the best looking Indie titles I've ever seen.Gameplay wise, you still use vehicles to destroy the alien's towers, but there is a twist:Vehicles can now ""Morph"" between 2 modes, each vehicle and their modes have a specified role in combat (so that's a total of 10 vehicles!). This gameplay mechanic adds more reflexes than carefully thinking through observations of the map layouts.The strategic elements are still there, but much easier than the 1st one. If you completed Anomaly: Warzone Earth on ""Casual"" then in Anomaly 2, you can just jump right in ""Hardcore"". Although there is a ""Nightmare"" difficulty, it's just Hardcore towers dealing more damage.Many sound assets are re-used from Anomaly: Korea. But the Original Soundtracks are really nice. They correctly capture the winter-appocalypse and heroic feeling, with rays of hope shining from the horizon. The OSTs are available for free on the dev's website, made my ""Piotr Musial"":http://www.11bitstudios.com/games/15/soundtracksMultiplayer is also fun. You can play as the Alien :)Friday, Feb 6 2014 Edit:#After delving deeper into the Multiplayer part, I have to say, it is really good. As you can imagine, Multiplayer pits 2 opponents against each other. One controls the Convoy (attacker) and one controls the Towers (Defender). The Convoy and its abilities mostly stay the same as singleplayer, but it's the Towers where it gets interesting. To balance out the odds, the developers added a few ""twists"" for the Towers.The objective of the attacker is to destroy the defender's core structure - the Generator. Games are based on point-system. Whoever reaches the designated amount of point first is the winner, or you can win by leading the oponent by X amount of points. The attacker gains points for destroying towers and some will provide more points than the others. The defender gains points for damaging the attacker's convoy.The Tower player will be provided with 7 available towers from the Singleplayer with the addition of the Harvesters. The Harvester is only available in Multiplayer and it harvests Abilities, Points and Carusaurum. You can have multiple Harvesters, but only one can harvest at a time.Towers' Abilities: Regen, Berserk, Taunt and Kamikaze. Additionally, similar to the Convoy's ability to morph their units, the Towers can emit Energy Waves when you double-click on them. Each tower comes with a unique type of Energy Wave that can turn the tides of the battle.Multiplayer also introduces Tech Upgrades. With each upgrade, the effect of the later one will get stronger, so planning is vital along with play styles. Amount of upgrades varies depending on the map's size.So, what do you get out of the Multiplayer section of Anomaly 2? A whole lot, I have to say, that is if you have someone to play with. The flow of the battle always changes, there's no clear winner as the points can rack up rapidly if done right. The Tech Upgrades give both players a wide array of play styles, from Endurance, Ambush to Full-on War. All of which will create very exciting battles against friends, or foes.Keep in mind though, there are no hot keys for the Towers, so clicking a lot is expected.#In the end, Anomaly 2 has proved to be ""my"" worthy successor to Anomaly: Warzone Earth. If you like Anomaly: Warzone Earth, then you'll probably like this game."

,Recommended,236730,19141083,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,[GM]StarletteRai,"A puzzle tower defense, in reverse-role.Pros and Cons:-its simple, thrilling and most important, challenging. Though potential, new ideas are usually are to come by in this game.-The game shines most in being challenging which pushes player to think quickly for strategy as their units continue onward their path without stopping (unless theres a path loop, you get to plan for the next). In multiplayer, the speed and timing is your best modus operandi, as one surprise may overlaps the other. Chess? Too much time.-Certain item drops CHANCE seems fixed from enemy turrets, allowing each chapter to have its balance of power through item use.-Single player is pretty short, although chapter in the latter prove to be time taking (especially on hardest difficulty), you can usually speed up in-game. (Which most games usually does by teaching you all the relevant stuff in following chapters and leave you the next 3/4 parts of the chapter to your own with a specific condition or a sort)-Multiplayer introduce further stuff that reveal more different combination of strategic gameplay for players to compete on each other with, unfortunately the population is not that many to play with since the online queue takes ages.it could be a casual browser, it could even be a sort of custom map on some game engine, but Anomaly series prioritize its awesome graphic heavily to have its own, and when I say custom, I view this game as a mini-game genre. Overall, although many of its features are still limited in for different strategical elements, I'd still recommend it for people to play the thrill of quickpace planning with their friends together."

I love everything about it other than the fact that it has constant glitches in Ubuntu that makes it unplayable after a certain level.  This is very strange because it works perfectly on my Android but not on my desktop that is a lot more powerful.  I don't understand why they can't fix this bug on the Ubuntu Linux desktop.

The ability to swap your units into different forms is good, although I always have to bring up the menu to do it.  Since a basic click moves your commander, trying to double-click to transform your guys in the heat of battle never seemed to work well.More units and tower types are welcome additions.  I like that they added in some specific counters for certain types of builds, but it does still wind up being a little shallow.Main campaign is good, but I don't have much desire to go back and replay it on the higher difficulties.  The multiplayer sounds cool, but I don't know for sure, since I've never been able to play an actual game.  There never seems to be a single person on.  I have my doubts about the balance, since it seems like they gave the towers player some abilities that would make it near-impossible to lose.Nonetheless a fun experience."

The core gameplay of guiding your units around maze-like streets, while using abilities to help defeat enemy towers, remains intact. There are new units, each of which can morph between two different forms at will. For example, the artillery unit can either fire straight ahead at long range, or 360 degrees at medium range. This adds more depth and makes it easier to adjust tactics mid-mission, to take advantage of the new enemy towers' weaknesses. The presentation of graphics, music, voice acting and story is all very good. The campaign took me around 6.5 hours, and although I'm disappointed there's no singleplayer skirmish mode, there is multiplayer to add replayability. The controls work great with mouse and I didn't notice any bugs. I think this developer deserves to be rewarded for their efforts with a full price purchase."

It's a bit like an anti-tower defense where there are multiple paths to take and you can shoot at the towers, but also a bit like a tower defense game where your enemies can go wherever the hell they want and shoot at your towers.

Anomaly 2 is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games.With that said, I do miss the voice acting in Anomaly: Warzone Earth and the distinct British accent. However, in Anomaly 2, it is replaced by an American accent. For the Anomaly Franchise, I would prefer a British accent, as that was the voice acting style in Anomaly: Warzone Earth and Anomaly Korea, and I felt that the American accent in Anomaly 2 made the gameplay inconsistent with the overall gameplay of the entire Anomaly Series and the American accent does not live up to the original style of the Anomaly Franchise. I would also like to mention that I had only played the Single Player Campaign. However, the overall visual experience of the game is still great and I would still recommend this game to my friends.+  For graphics and overall visual experience-   For inconsistent voice acting throughout the Anomaly Series"

I heard someone say that they believe this game could be an E-sport and I damn near laughed out loud. This game is awful.Mind you, the game itself is fun, but offers so little content and is so samey compared to the first one that it's well below 50. The best features are the graphics. Gameplay is decent, until you realize there's only two units worth even morphing in combat and more so that the game is so overly hectic that things just lose their fun value.So yeah, get it while it's on sale for like 5 bucks, but it isn't worth it's current price of 15 or whatever.

,Recommended,236730,19820749,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,kschang77,"Anomaly 2 is one of those games that has a hard act to follow, by redefining a genre. It's sometimes called ""tower attack"", in that you control a military attack column attacking enemy towers. Most games have you control the towers and destroy attacking enemies, thus ""tower defense"". This game is the other way around: you're attacking. You are the commander with ability to call in special abilities like heal, decoy, frenzy, and so on to enhance the column at key times, as well as plot a route that would hopefully give you enough time to defeat the enemy towers en route.What makes Anomaly 2 different is the vehicles now are morphable. That's right, each vehicle now has two modes: vehicle mode, and mecha mode, with different speed, and weapon capabilities. So morphing at the right time is also very important. Some weapons also ""charge up"" and does more damage the more time it shoots, so it's usable against a tight cluster of targets, while others are more suitable for spread-out targets.Otherwise, the game is still the same: you are rated for ruthlessness (how many towers did you destroy), speed (how fast did you finish the mission) and so on. The idea is not to lose units on a mission but often it can't be avoided. You need the currency to upgrade the vehicles for better armor and better weapons.Altering route is recommended can the game is pausable to go into commander mode and there are checkpoints you have to navigate as your objective. Enemy towers get really tricky, as some towers simply assist other towers and make you more vulnerable, while at other times, overhead cover prevents you from using the commander abilities.The missions are as intricate as ever, but otherwise it didn't change much. The background is extrapolated from the previous games, assuming we had mostly lost the war against the invading aliens in Anomaly 1 (and the other campaigns), but as you can guess, this gives us some new hope against the invaders.To master the game you have to learn the best time to use each vehicle in its respective modes, and have enough abilities on standby to proper execute the attack plan.The graphics ain't the best but it's meant to be somewhat reminiscent of satellite view, slightly off color, not quite photographic, but with a lot of details like ruined buildings, ruined vehicles, and so on.All in all, those who buy Anomaly 2 knows exactly that they are getting MOTS: More of the same, with a subtle interesting tactical variation of morphing vehicles and its different tactical implications. If it's what you dig, then this will deliver exactly what you're looking for... a different type of RTS challenge."

Its fun, thats what I look for more, the details can really become unimportant. There is ONE thing I dont like. Its the fact that you issue orders and follow your squad around as a dude just walking the ♥♥♥♥ around in the middle of skull melting madness, filled with light and sound and explosions! Youre very weak, and the fact that your orders will have a delay because you have to walk to the place you want to an issue, can be very frustrating. But it's truly not that big a deal. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes tower defense and taking a different role in the history of gaming."
76561198020506980,Recommended,236730,31035410,Posted: 9 April,all,Oybluz,"tl;dr : Good and original game. Very quick campaign so you might want to wait for a sale if you don't plan on playing in multiplayer mode.Interesting concept of a reversed TD where you are the attacker. This plays more as a tactical objective taking game, where you build your squad, upgrade it and reorganize it in real time, while choosing the most effective path to your objectives and checkpoints. You also have some abilities that you an use and each unit can switch anytime between two forms that serve distinct purposes. Good gameplay overall, despite some minor flaws.There is a bug where in rare cases a checkpoint does not save when you cross it, it's very annoying but occurred only twice in my whole play through, so it's not a game breaker.The whole campaign can be easily finished in less than ten hours, but can be very challenging at higher difficulty, although there is no replayability at all and no incentive to replay the game at a higher difficulty (nothing to gain from it apart from personal satisfaction).If you're not interested in the multiplayer mode (where you can play either as the attacker like in campaign mode or as the defender by placing towers and using abilities), I would not recommend buying it at full price as there isn't much content in the campaign mode."
