BUT.......... No support from the developers and the fact that you cannot even start a new game makes this product unuseable. It's too bad that this has happened to this game because I enjoyed it very much up until I was unable to play due to the developer abandoning us here on Steam. I cannot give this game a good reveiw at all. Purchase Farming Simulator 2013 instead.

The developer Actalogic is just not up to par to develop quality games, since they use an outdated and broken game engine that has so many holes you'd think it was Fallout New Vegas' Hoover Dam being fought over by the NCR and Ceasar's Legion.For 1 whole month a number of players and the CEO of Actalogic tried to work together to debug the game by testing over and over to make a list of reproducable errors (not all that easy to do for some).  Each little 'patch' would end up plugging one hole to only create 3 new holes in the 'Hoover Dam' that is AG2013.  In the end Mr. CeO just left for vacation and never returned leaving us with a long list of promises and upcoming updates.IF you're lucky to get it to work on your PC and think all is smooth sailing, just wait...you just wait.   Play the game using the same save file for 20+hrs using the equipment to build your own farm up.  Then, you'll know what we already know."

As someone who has played and enjoyed many hours of Farming Simulator 2013 but found certain aspects lacking I saw Agricltural Simulator 2013 to be the answer my wants. With the ability to reshape fields, hire workers and manage them in all aspects it seemed to have all the features I was looking for. Unfortunately, while those features are present, the game itself is a horrible pile of bugs which make it unplayable even at lowest settings. I cannot recommend that anyone spend actual money on this game."

Too bad that the developers didn't have time/money to finish making the game. The game is so buggy you cant even play it. I have a brand new gaming computer wich can run BF4 on Ultra settings with no lag (and many other demanding games) but this game is so badly optimized it's not even playable. I bought it on the release day for over a year ago and the devs has not made anything to make it more playable since then. So DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

I have no severe lag or studdering as I've seen mentioned, nothing really out of the ordinary given that I know the game has a few problems.  I also haven't gone looking for problems either.I did follow the advice of a couple of posts about adjusting the some settings using the command window, don't know if that helped or not but the game runs fine.  As long as you're not expecting to aquire a polished and completely stable game and you don't mind the occasional/frequent glitches you should be able to enjoy the game.  Be advised, it is a true farming sim unlike Farming Simulator (which I own) or the new Pro Farmer (I've tried the demo).  You have to do everything manually and it takes time.I hate to be the oddball posting a positive review amongst the overwhelming negative but given I know it has problems, it's not that bad.  Maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones but then again if you think about it most product reviews are reviews written by people that had problems with the item.  Many people who like the item never post anything.  Just my opinion."

Sheep you can't shear even though there is wool in the game, cows you can't milk. A clumsy and cryptic interface, no instructions outside of the tuturial for plowing a field. To cap it off, unfortunate spelling errors such as 'bredding' the chickens in the coop. Ooops!The nice thing I will say is that it's always fun to drive tractors and I like the range you can buy, I enjoyed the mechanics of using the 'extensions' i.e. using the plow etc. But it feels like this was what they spent all their time on and nothing else. Graphics are also sub par.Shame when a game is released that isn't finished and the makers don't appear to have wanted to come back and finish the job either. This game looked to have a lot of potential with some polishing."
,Not Recommended,236790,33212044,Posted: 3 July,all,Karl Pilkington,"***Disclaimer*** I refunded this title after less than one hour of playtimeI gave it a fair chance, with intention to put a lot of hours into this. Unfortunately it has a quirky issue with sound (there is none unless you make a change in your PC audio device settings)The steam achievements are not synced with the game. I read that it has to do with the removal of their DRM or some related update to that nature. They unlock in game, but do not unlock on steam. 134 achievements are now impossible to get, it seems.The game itself is very simple, and easy. The physics are a bit wonky though. There are times where it feels like the ground is pushing the tractor around instead of the other way around.The sound design is alright but they decided to sprinkle free range chickens that roam all over your farm, and those little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are loud and annoying.It doesn't look good, graphically. In motion, everything has a weird look to it and your own player model is just a generic bald male with no detail or personality to speak of. The grass effects are nice, and it does look good when you tear into the grass with your tractor tires, or start plowing a field. I turned off all the blur effects and i'm running the game on a gtx titan x 12gb and it just looks ""ok"" at its best.I will be looking elsewhere for a good farming simulator type game.The final caveat is that the game freezes/crashes constantly. This also corrupts your save file.I made it through the tuturial and it crashed at least 3-4 times in a matter of 20 minutes. I assume its a tutorial issue but its still really bad. This is the only title i decided to try playing that was developed by ""Actalogic"" and looking at their catalogue, this will also be the last. Seems everything they make is terrible.I'll be looking for another game like this, but with better execution and fully functioning steam achievements."

In other words, it definitely has wonderful realistic features that other farming simulators do not offer, but it is a horrible buggy software that basically does not run.Pro:- It has tasks like attaching detaching implements to the tractor and filling up seeds in the sower manually which is realistic. Like you have to manually drage sacks of grain in first person instead of just pressing keys from inside the tractor.- Animal husbandry is elaborate and complicated. Again manual feeding tasks and also gathering of milk and eggs in a realistic way.- Good landscapes- Lots of different crop optionsCons:- Glitchy, slow, low fps- Will crash several times- Impossible to continue having patience with it- Bad graphics optimizationSo in spite of having great interest in it, I had to basically abandon trying to play this.

The combination of bugs and horriblie coding of this game makes it unplayable. Not to mention it's hard to find video tutorials online and forums about the game since Farming Simulator gets mistaken for it on Google, making it hard to find out what to do in the game to get started.

And two, It lacks direction, you have to frustrate yourself by trying to figure out how to do everything. I'm not saying it needs a four hour tutorial before you spawn in but it would be nice to have some sort of system in place to not only get the player obvious information, but to make sure that the information is suficient and not just one or two sentences unless necessary.I played it some on my older computer but when I downloaded and installed the game on my new very capable computer the game couldn't even complete the initial boot of the game. I can't even get to the main screen of the game. For that, I am not going to recommend this game to others."

There are alot of problems with this game. For starters, like the sims 3, it'll set the graphics on the lowest possible setting. Second of all, the game crashed while I was looking for a trailer to tow with my truck (i don't know if trailers can be towed with trucks but i tried anyway) And by the way, the truck is the ONLY good thing about this game. And for the graphics, my Alienware can't even handle them. Last but not least, there are so many little bugs as well. Like when I clicked on the icon next to my cellar, the camera locked up and I could only look forward for the entire time. And why can the truck only fo 20mph on cruise level 3? Overall, this game SUCKS and I don't recommend it to anyone. And no, unlike the screenshots, there are no John Deere tractors in this game, except that one that appered to be over 80 years old.UPDATE - Now the game won't open at all."

The game was not that bad, but it had some major issues with gameplay. So I was waiting and during that I was able to play it.. more or less.... and after some patch or what.... it was even more broken than before. I couldnt play it anymore. I decided to wait for some patches ? Fixes ? Now after a very loooong time I upgraded my PC. This is compare for games recommended HW configuration and my HW configuration:Recommended HWMy HWWindows 7Windows 7 64bit2.6 GHz Quad Core (Intel Core i5, AMD Phenom X4)4.00GHz Intel Core i7 4790k4GB RAM16GB RAMGeforce GTX 560 or Radeon HD 7790GTX 980 4GBDx 9.0Dx 11.1And the result ? So I'm forced to lower my Graphic setting to medium (to make game run at + - 60FPS 1080p) and my game runs at 1080p with very unstable FPS (18FPS is the lowest I had). I drive around map and my FPS jumping like some bunny.... 18, 40, 30, 50, 60, 40, 30.... LOLz. Very badly optimized game and what is even more sad..... the game developers obviously decided to leave this game as it is and dont bother to come up with some patch to fix this.... nice.Other than that... I think this game have some good potential.... it could be one of the best farming sim games there ever was.... agrar sim 2011 is just one empty boring game.... this game could have been so much better.... there are so many things you can do.... seed, harvest, have animals like sheeps, cows, bulls, horses, feed them, sell them, sell their products, manage your greenhouses, water crops there and much more. I think that those greenhouses in this game are so much more fun to play with than in any other farming sim game.... I was really enjoying it until that patch they once released completely made my game to not run slightly playable anymore.So my rating for this game is like 4/10 - I DO NOT recommend. If you cant play it properly, you cant enjoy it and if you cant enjoy it, there is no reason to buy this game. Right now with my PC I'm slightly able to play it again and it makes it even more sad that developers decided to dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. At the start they seem that they really care about this game... they were actively responding to players in discussion section, were giving some tips on how to make the game run.If you are some game developer and want to release game in beta with bugs and other problems... trust me... it can NEVER end well. Your game will be always the game that was buggy and horrible even when you release patches and fixes to repair it... or if you not... then it will end up like this game. Total disaster. So sad..."

,Not Recommended,236790,14397198,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,Blambloski,Bought the steam edition of this game for $2.43 on the summer sale and it was terrible. I had it running on the highest graphics setting and it looked like a early 2000s computer game. The vechicle variety is good but expensive. I found it impossibe to earn money. DO NOT BUY!!! Even if on sale.

You can't even drive 10 meters before the whole game crashes and you can never start it again. A total waste of money and time. Although i can tell you 1 plus in this game. It will never make it far (that's a good thing)"

This game is not a bad simulator, but if you are going to spend your money on a farm sim, go with FS15. Every task in Agri Sim is just a little more complicated than it needs to be."

I really wanted to like this game. As someone who has played and enjoyed many hours of Farming Simulator 2013 but found certain aspects lacking I saw Agricltural Simulator 2013 to be the answer my wants."

It runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥even on high end hardware and has too many bugs to be considered a fully released product.I made the mistake of buying this game before steam refunds and even now I can say that whilst writing this review the game isn't worth the $0.99Don't waste your money. Go buy Farming Sim 2017."

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
