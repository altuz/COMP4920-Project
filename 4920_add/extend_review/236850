Once I get bored from ousting the filthy Turkomans from Constantinople (not giving it back to Byzantium because ♥♥♥♥ orthodoxy Pope #1 forever get rekt bearded priests) I can turn my furious and just gaze across the atlantic and kill lots of savages (not my fault those filthy natives were living on Burgundian Florida). Soon the whole world will be swathed in burgundian colors, or all thats actually worth ruling (not ruling africa because africa and lots of zulu rebellions plus mosquitos).This game is best played with a warm cup of Folger's coffee in your hands, so you can actually smell the oppression while you relive the greatest period of time of all time.

The relief you feel, after a long term plan of yours is finally set into successful motion, is not describable.One of the few games where careful planning and thinking is actually rewarded. No simplerock-paper-scissorsbattles like in other strategy games.

,Recommended,236850,17934462,"Posted: 7 September, 2015",all,★ Galaxy ★,"Ah yes, Europa Universalis IV, what is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said? History becomes your plaything as you choose among any country that existed in the year 1444 and until 1821, not just in Europe in spite of what the name suggests, but also in Asia, Africa and the Americas. You can play as one of the big boys or you can opt to play as a smaller country and try to carve out an empire as you tangle with the big fish.Be advised that the game has a steep learning curve. Even I, in spite of my several hundreds of hours of playing this game, still do not fully understand certain aspects. The game just keeps throwing new things into your face, and considering how often Paradox releases expansion packs and update patches, the game will continue to have enough stuff to interest you for a long time to come. Whether you're an achievement hunter, a master strategist or just a casual with an interest in history, this game has something to offer you if you're willing to invest the time to learn it.The choices you can make in this game are nearly limitless; create the world's largest land-based empire or rule the seas (or both). Control the flow of trade, or ignore it and focus on the production of goods in your lands (or both). Colonize the Americas, or play as a Native American tribe and crush the colonialists. Conquer India as a European power, or conquer Europe as an Indian power. Wage holy war against the heathens and heretics of the world, or leave them be. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you feel really daring you can do some truly ludicrous stuff. Play as an islamic Papal State, or create a Catholic Arabian empire. Or relocate your country to another part of the world entirely (Portugal in India, Norway in Canada, Ireland in New York, Georgia in Georgia, if you can imagine it, it is probably possible).In Europa Universalis IV you are a painter and the entire world is your canvas. So go on, and paint the world your color."
,Not Recommended,236850,32189617,Posted: 4 June,all,sp1nnak3r,"I bought this game at release in 2013 and have since then logged more than 2000 hours in this game.While this game was great fun for the first couple of years, it has since waned in my opinion, especially the last year and a half. The initial expansions added substance to the game, and fleshed out mechanics, thereby giving a more in depth experience to the player. It felt as if you got value for your money.Unfortunately it seems that Paradox has lost the plot since then, now they add half baked - unwanted mechanics - which is more frustrating to use than fun, or the DLC is bare bones, say for a couple of extra buttons and models and then they have the audacity to charge you $20+ for it. I can only describe it as a money grab.Of course you aren't ""forced"" to buy any of the DLCs, however Paradox has been adding mechanics to the base game with each patch, which normally can only be influenced/controlled if you  buy the accompanying $20 DLC, and by not having the ability to influence/control the mechanic can sometimes have a negative on your game play. So you are subtly forced, in certain cases, to buy some DLCs. Which in my opinion is dishonest on the part of Paradox.Sadly in my good conscience I cannot recommend this game to anyone, anymore."

,Recommended,236850,12807238,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Crater,"In Europa Universalis IV you play a powerful sorcerer that acts as the ""guiding hand"" for the nation.  The spells you cast draw on three mana pools: Paper Mana, Bird Mana, and Sword Mana.  Bird mana is used to make peace deals, genocide cultures, and stop your people from whining about war weariness.  Paper mana, in combination with a gold sacrifice, can be used to cast construction spells, in addition to making a province you gained two years ago a core part of your nation somehow.  Sword mana is used for enchanting rebel factions to keep them in line.  You generate mana for these pools by sucking the life essence from your monarch and his cabinet of advisors.  Be careful, though, as the ones that generate the most mana tend to die rather quickly.  You'll frequently see your 6/4/5 monarch die by age 30.You'll notice that most of the spells are involved with either war or keeping your people from whining about war.  Don't worry, that's by design.  There's nothing to do if you aren't at war.10/10 it's okay"
,Recommended,236850,3723053,"Posted: 24 August, 2013",all,[IRL]Kevin,One of the best games I played. Europa Universalis IV is meant for thousands of hour of play time and the amount of replayability available is incredible. You could just add thousands of hours into just by the vanllia version but no it doesn't stop there.There is even a bigger mod community in Europa Universalis IV then the predecessor (Europa Unversalis III) so be prepared to play until the next Europa Universalis game.+ all the expansions they could make for Europa Universalis IV will be even a better game then now.My rating 10/10I would advise you to buy it if you're into Strategy and history and *What if scenarios*Edit: A new expansion is coming out called Conquest Of Pardise which will give us more land to and more native tribes to conquer+ A new system will be input for when you conquer or when you are colonising. New nations will appear for example if you are playing as England when you are colonising Mexico English Mexico will appear.+ New colonial countries will be enable to reble against you if there liberty is high enough and if they have all the requirements they might be able to form the USA or Mexico+ You will have a option to randomize North American and South American as a option which is very strange for Paradox because they usually try and make everything historically accurate but it's a nice twist for players that are sick of the same old continent of North American and South American

Just under 2,500 hrs of my life enjoying it.But, Paradox....you need to listen to your community. It is wrong to make the base game unplayable without paying for ever-increasing DLCs.  At best, you'll make a little $ now but lose a generation of gamers.What I wish for Paradox:Stay lean, efficient and nimble.  Your DLC pricing and practice indicate a bloated structure spending too much time counting the money.Think ahead.  Too many DLCs and cost drives away the best community of gamers.  It can be an expensive game - there's clearly a lot of work in it - but your marketing and accounting executives have no place in product development.Be brave.  Given the overwhelming review sentiment, take a brave action.  Do something radical that recognizes the dissatisfaction of your existing community (and for heaven's sake, DON'T. CHARGE. THEM. for whatever you decide to do).  Try to be developers first, and corporate faces second.I'm recommending the game on the condition that Paradox listens to its community.

The amount of options can be overwhelming for new players, but the satisfaction of mastering the system and understanding why things happen is much more gratifying.An important factor everyone sees when they hear about EU4 is the amount of DLC / expansions the game has. So i figure i'll point out what's useful.All of the unit packs are entirely optional, but the larger DLCs range from game changing to near pointless (depending on your choice of country)Group A - Must have, game changing.1. Art of War - The single most important DLC, transfer seiges and more peace deals options. Every war is different if you have this DLC.2. Common Sense - This DLC is to peace-time as Art of War is to War-time. Develop your provinces, more government and subject options. National Focus.Group B - Noticeable, not 100% necessary1. El Dorado - If custom nations is huge point for you, this could be moved to Group A (I'd aruge the game gives plenty of options, but custom nations are super fun too!) Colonization is made much better and randomised world.2. Wealth of Nations -  Trade companies, National Focus ( if you don't have Common Sense), Privateers, Extra Religion Options3. Rights of Man - Great Power options, improves the late game.4. The Cossacks - Estates, Horde UnityGroup C - Rarely impactful but still can change the game under certain conditions.1.  Mare Nostrum - Sailors, Espionage2. Conquest of Paradise - Getting to play as a Colonial Nation3. Res Publica - The netherlands and Poland DLCI undertand how people play the game can change which DLCs are important to them, so everyone wont agree with this list, but for a new player this is what i would recommend.The game and DLCs go on sale often, no strategy fan will regret the purchase."

You will feel challenged many times throughout the game.-You will have immense empires yet you will feel weak, you will own only a small town yet you will feel strong-You will start to question the essence of power in history throughout this game whether it is military, trade, diplomacy, administration, navy, technology, religion or any other concept.-There are nearly infinite scenarios that you can come up with, but you will see that the game will converge to a certain point where today's strong nations yield a hefty source of power, and the game allows you to interfere into history by enabling you to come up with an alternative one; if you are capable of it.-You will never be satisfied with what you have done so far in the game, because there is always going to be another way of doing things right-The game is evolving, and it is hard to keep up with the pace of changes in the hardcoded AI strategies, the AI is as powerful as if it is cheating. Forget about the insane bots in fps games, these bots will crush you so bad you will want to delete this game.-Some recent minor changes in the structure of the game mechanics is disabling you to overexpand quickly, if you are a player that has aggressive strategies, you will have a hard time playing this game; it is a game that requires patience.Cons:-The Pope is never reasonable.-The Holy Roman Emperor is always demanding. And he just marries consorts.-Turks don't care about anyone, they just right click on you and declare war and suddenly you find yourself preparing for higher technology to flee to Mars.-Franks always start the matches 1-0 ahead.-Italians never unify, they just build lots of ships and play a monopoly game of trade.-You can ignore the Commonwealth region as if it is a huge grassland with lots of horses-The horses are selected through a breeding process, therefore they tend to be old and experienced and legitimate.-Russians love to colonize frozen land, they just love to make the circumnavigation through land.-Spaniards enjoy discovering poor natives. But they are good catholics.-The British is unpredictable as usual. Lots of ships and pride all over the world, attention to the Royal Navy though, just kite around it. They are so Royal they will never split so you can always escape from those 500 ships somehow.-The Dutch is the Pandora Box of the EuIV.-The German Princes are angry.-Plus they like upsetting the pope.-The Scandinavians butcher each other for 500 years.-No one know what happens in India.-Same stands for China.-Same stands for Middle Asia.-Same stands for inner Africa.-Ulm has joined a coalition against us.WORRISOME!Overall, I recommend this game; even though how try-hard it might get, it is still challenging and fun."

I don't know how long, a few weeks. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, eating between wars, literally dreaming about my kingdom and after about 200 hours playing I haven't got tired of it yet.But perhaps you'd like to hear a story. Maybe a tale of woe, of blood and vengeance...Austria, 1653. IronMan mode.My King was yet another re*ard in a long line of mentally challenged Habsburgs. Administration was difficult, for he didn't know how to count from 0 to 10 by the age of 46. Pen and paper were alien artifacts for this man, who considered burping after a meal with international envoys a diplomatic act. I was proud once, when I learned he loved guns. And forever ashamed when I found out he couldn't fathom how to work a trigger. He became a General as soon as he turned 15 and then, for the first time, he was good at something... no, I'm  kidding, he was terrible. I'm sure his kind mother put that one star over his head. She didn't fool anyone. Well... no one but the king himself, of course... silly kid...So, as a good christian overlord, I was patient-- and spent 30 years trying to kill him, spearheading the ""special"" monarch into the most challenging battles. Soon I started to fear he had been blessed with immortality to compensate for his almighty uselessness. The damned French on my western border had a 6/4/6 sadist on their throne. My neighbor's lawn was greener than mine. I was desperate.Hence came the time when I, the Holy Roman Emperor, accidentally enacted a cursed reform that wouldn't allow me to wage war against the Empire's members anymore, bringing my struggle towards unifying the HRE almost to a halt. But I had hope in my heart, for if no tragedy happened and I managed to keep peace, the 170 years left to play should be enough for me to gather 150 Imperial Autorithy points to fulfill my objective. I had 3 provinces left under foreign rule waiting for the taking and that should guarantee my success-- so I demanded what was rightfully mine.I went to war against my oldest friend and ally, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Again. They were so scared that even with their half-russian-size territory they didn't put up a fight-- literally not one, while I went on rampaging through their territory. I needed one more point for them to accept my peace offer and return the Empire's provinces when it happened...They sent forth a 62 regiments army against me, a 3 star general leading it. They didn't stand a chance against my 130 invading regiments, of course, which was about half my army at that time. But they were brave, and chose to forfeit their lives for the sake of their homeland. So a massive battle began-- and it unraveled quickly. The fight went on for less than a month when... my f****** s** of a b**** piece of s*** excuse for a King died in it. Yeah, sure, I was euphoric for a moment. But no, it turns out those weren't good news because...With his demise I lost the elections to be the next Emperor-- for the first time, mind you-- so I didn't get the 10 Imperial Authority bonus. A few days (or seconds) later, after the previously mentioned battle was won and so was the war, the Empire's territories were proudly returned by me. And then I learned you can only gain Authority if you are the current Emperor. The new guy at the office, the Holy chairman of the ancient Roman Empire, the 15 year old King of a useless single-province kingdom, laughed at me. I felt it, I swear. I'll remember that moment until the day I die... possibly even longer than that...So after about 10 minutes screaming at my computer and one more hour cursing inside my head, I recovered my sanity once again, kept it cool, and decided to wipe the Holy Roman Empire from the face of the Earth. I'm halfway there, but the more than a million rebel soldiers spawning everywhere across my kingdom are delaying my war efforts. Still, I shall have my vengeance.Sorry, I had to put that out there. A 15 year old Saxe-Lauenburgian kid as the Holy Emperor... what a joke. I'll give him his first shave with a flying cannonball.EDIT:With inhuman effort and, of course, the help of God himself (thank you, Pope) I reverted my situation and finally managed to unify the HRE. Now, in 1753, from the edges of a long-gone Hungary to the borders of Spain, Europe is under my rule.But you wonder: ""Why does that matter?"" And I tell you: because it means if I had been born in 1444 there would have been no World War I, this review would be written in Deutsche (or maybe I would have brought latin back, who knows?), and my grandson¹³² would rule Earth. Knowing that, I can finally sleep in peace. I feel my entire life had a meaning, and now a whole new purpose... to play Castile next. (After becoming a junior partner in a Personal Union under Spain, winning my independence alone against them and England, vassalizing the Ottomans and succumbing to a Civil War caused by the sudden, premature death of my first independent king made me give up on returning my westernized Byzantium to it's former glory-- by the 17th century again, obviously the worst hundred of years in human history)"

Paradox will program in some basic changes that any modder can do, and they will charge as much as they can for it. The patches then steer the game toward owning these new DLCs. I play 1.11.4 and have up to El Dorado; I don't even recognize the game anymore. I haven't bought any of it since 2014. There are so many DLCs that I reckon no two players have the same game. The community is splintered like dry plywood snapped in two with a good kick. To top it off, sales now never go 75% off but stop at 50% off, and they just doubled their prices in a number of countries. I'll quote a post from the comment section that sums up the current situation: ""It's all about the money now.""Update July 6, 2017: The Steam Summer Sale is over and Paradox has rolled back their price increase after huge backlash from the majority of their playerbase. As far as I am concerned, it's too little, too late. Paradox has been behaving in a greedy, shady manner for several years already. With Common Sense they removed the old building system and disabled you from developing your provinces like you had in the past unless you bought the new DLC. Because of this I stopped following the game for a couple of years. I only recently started following development again after many new DLCs and patches had come out. I was positively disposed toward the game again and so would look to pick up some of the newer DLCs when the usual 75% sales came up.I quickly found out that those days are over--no more 75% sales--and then they hiked their prices (doubling them in Russia, for example) because they thought they could get away with it. They had been getting away with so many anti-consumer practices for so long that it was only rational to try such a move. So what if some Russians and Indians get squeezed. They're not Americans. They're gaming in countries with low incomes and grim prospects. Let's exploit them as much as we can and if they complain our legion of fanboy defenders will call them poorfaqs. Well, they were wrong in their calculation--there are more decent people who care about EUIV players in poorer countries than they had expected--and Paradox was rightly kicked in the teeth for such a greedy move. PC games don't go up in price over time. These are digital goods, not Manhattan real estate.So what does the future look like for Paradox's business practices? They are on the Nasdaq First North exchange now and are likely going to move toward becoming more like Ubisoft and EA, not less. The games are going to get dumber and more colorful. Remember the glory days of Civilization? Take a look at Civ VI. Next take a look at HOI4. If you think the bugs are bad now, just think about all the AAA titles that come out broken as hell. Now think about the way Paradox has been releasing broken products for years now. This is only going to get worse. Time to move on. I don't need your games, Paradox. I just spent $60 during the Steam Summer Sale and not a thought was given to any of your lame offerings. Maybe I'll take a look at your games again in a year or two, but probably not."

This game is really amazing BUT... Paradox's DLC policy has ruined it because it continues updating a game which was perfect right from the start. Now the DLC policy consists of giving a free patch along with a new DLC almost every two months, forcing us to invest more and more money to have a complete game, because THE FREE PATCH BREAKS THE GAME AND MAKES IT UNPLAYABLE IN SOME AREAS OR TOTALLY BREAKS SOME MECHANICS UNLESS YOU BUY THE DLC COMING WITH IT wich costs 15 to 20 Euros. I'm really getting sick of this since the developers announced that they ""have a lot of ideas"" for at least the upcoming two years and they want to release more DLCs"". Really, I spent around 40 Euros simply to buy the game with 3 DLCs and I am truly convinced that it was not worth it. 20 Euros for a DLC that adds so few content is really a shame and I hope that the developers will make a step back selling those DLCs for 5 Euros (I'm not saying free, because I want to evaluate their job, but 20 or 15 Euros are seriously an insult) because they are doing a scam towards the people who are trying to have the complete game that they like and played a lot."

These features were held back and put behind paywalls so you'd be more willing pay the full price (over 200 dollars) after having already sunk money into the game. Furthermore, they include aspects of the expansions into the base game in free patches not out of generosity but to make it uplayable without shelling out the extra 20 dollars. Want to play anything outside of Western Europe without the Common Sense DLC? Good luck.This is a fun game, but nothing justifies charging as much as they do. They've decided it doesn't matter if high prices put off new players, so long as they can exploit the loyalty of their devoted fanbase. I don't like that. The policy needs to change."
76561198043518746,Recommended,236850,23404650,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,OpenSheep,"I have written this review to negate some of the unfair reviews that give this game a negative score. I do admit the last couple of dlcs have been lackluster (Mare Nostrum, and The Cossacks specifically), however if the dlcs are not giving enough content for their price do not buy it. It is your choice if you decided to pay fifteen dollars for a lackluster dlc and the opinon of the dlc should not be the determination for the base game's score. There are many excellent expanions released for eu4, that in my opinon would negate any negativity from the last two expansions .The base game in itself is a game that I would reccomend playing. I have played many hours in vanilla itself. The game is a grand strategey with much more depth than games like the civ series. You play a nation of your choosing, and attempt to do as best as you can with it. Some nations are easier than other due to this game being based on history ( France is stronger than a Native American nation). The game is like a puzzle, many hours will be spent figuring out alliances, truces, aggressive expansion opinon modifiers, religion to be able to conquer the world without destroying yourself in the process. There are national ideas and events which make many nations unique in their playstyle, and there are idea groups which you unlock which give you various bonuses that can further specalize your nation. One thing that is amazing about this game is whenever something happens that could ruin my game it is always my fault, and it is something that you can learn from and choose to never make the same mistake again.The DLC is one thing that is essential to review, there are a lot of dlc for this game. Don't judge the game on the the price of every dlc combined, many DLC are just cosmetic and music addition packs. There are a few dlcs that are expansions to the game ( Res Publica, Wealth of Nations, Conquest of Paradise, Art of War, and Common Sense) which in my opinon are all essential and worth every penny spent on them. If you are scared of the hefty base price of these dlc combined, don't be scared as they frequently go for sale up to 75% off, so you can get all these expansions for less than 10 dollars if you wait for good sales. If you wait long enough the recent dlc (Cossacks and Mare Nostrum) will probably be given huge sales as well.I would not reccomend this game who are looking for quick fun, this is a game you sit down for hours at a time to plan and fail, and then restart the game over, and then fail but do a little better, then fail fail fail, and then you may finally perfect your game and do way better. A single playthrough can take around two weeks to get through, while it may take a lot of time it is really satisfying when all goes to plan and you acheive your goals. I would reccomend this to people who enjoyed civ games but are unsatisfied by the lack of depth or strategey in those games, I would reccomend this to people to have enjoyed playing Risk. In fact I reccomend this to most people I have met.tl:drA lot of reviews are being unfairly negative about this game to their opinon that the recent two expansions are overpriced for the content they delivir (I share this sentiment). However this game has a lot of other expansions that are really good that balance this out. The vanilla game is in itself really good. Don't expect a fast game, or something that you can just pick up and play I have played around 700 hours and am considered a intermediate player. While a bit diffcult to start it is an amazingly satisfying game when your plans come to fruitation.10/10"

,Recommended,236850,20008645,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,Plaz,"Just as a warning, I own every DLC (Costs a lot of $$$ but this studio deserves the support) and have played this game pretty extensively.Europa Universalis IV is a game focused around war, trade, and exploration.  What it really excels in is war, the other two 'focuses' of the game have been improved over time, but the game still revolves around war.  This wouldn't be a problem if with every patch they wouldn't make conquest more tedious.  From the 1.7 to the 1.8 patch (Art of War, released in November 2014), conquest was made much, much easier, and completing World Conquests (A particular feat, being the only independent nation left in the world) was made much easier.  From there, Paradox has been adding roadblock after roadblock to conquest.  This is okay, though.  If conquest was as easy as point and click, and no thought has to be put into it, then this game wouldn't be such an engaging, addicting, and fun experience.This game's learning curve is interesting.  I can't remember much of my early experience but you're given a complex yet simple interface, tooltips that don't mean much (which has been helped with some semi-recent patches), tutorials that also don't help much, and, of course, the shock of ""What am I supposed to do?  Is there a goal?""  The answer to those questions is both simple and intimidating, and it slaps you in the face rather abruptly.  It depends.  You do whatever it is you like, there is a score system but it doesn't really mean much.  That means that short of being in 1st place at the end of the game (which is rather easy for most nations), there is no goal.  You take control of your nation, you embody it.  That nation is you.  It took me about 4-6 hours to understand how to play the game, and another ~100 to 'git good'.  I stopped improving as a player (much) at about 1500 hours.In short, this game is about entering the renaissance, takes a huge time investment, is super fun, and hard to learn.10/10 -IGN."

I don't know why everyone lets Paradox get away with how they price their DLC, but it's ridiculous at this point. If you want all the DLC you are looking at upwards of $200, upwards of $100 for the main expansions. They have the ebook common sense by Thomas Paine listed on here for $1.99, something you can get for free anywhere on the internet, they literally just copied and pasted the book in, they at least have the decency to say it is in the public domain.There are so many skins and music DLC's that could really be combined into one pack each for $10-20, instead of god knows what it costs to buy it individually. I'd actually be willing to pay that. The same goes for the DLC, they could probably combine two of them and charge the same price, that might be somewhat more reasonable. I'd love to play with the main expansion DLC's, i just cannot justify paying over $100. This game is desperately in need of some bundles or DLC pricing revision. Who is buying this stuff I don't know, but they've got money to throw away, I can tell you that.So I'd love to tell you about how great the game is and why you should get it, but I cannot recommend it because of the blatant and greedy DLC gouging. I don't want this to be the norm, and it shouldn't be. I like hearts of iron too, but I know it will be the same story with that. I like to get the full experience, but I won't be duped into paying that much, and it honestly has me thinking about quitting Paradox games all together.

However, you cannot actually raise the development level of a region, unless you buy another dlc called ""Common Sense""... Really!?! Why are you forcing this feature onto the vanilla version, if you need a dlc to fully play it? Pardon the pun, but it makes no sense.Paradox is essentially going back, and making a game you bought in the past, unplayable.

Many times conquering or in other ways dominating the world can be a repetitive and somewhat boring process. The Europa Universalis-series have been one out of a very few games delivering and with the latest version the team over at Paradox has made it easier than ever for new players to jump in. That said, this isn't a game for the casual player and the amount of information clearly surpasses games like Civilization. But for me, who don't mind some learning, planning and strategic thinking, it's as close to a PC-game blessing as is possible.

When I bought the game, it was around the time that conquest of paradise was released, but I told myself that, no, I wouldn't buy the DLC, or any DLC for that matter. I saw the achievements in this game as interesting attempts and dedicated myself to conquering the list, showing everyone that they can, in fact, be obtained without any DLC (minus stars and moons). I've obtained a lot of DLC, and have had a lot of fun in this game.At this point in time, I know not whether it's my lack of skill or lack of DLC that's failed me. Ever since institutions, when I got back into the game, I have had no luck with any of the harder achievements, such as the African Power, where you conquer Africa as Kongo, or the Third Way, where you unite Islam as an Ibadi nation. Suffice to say, I can't win.Without the ability to develop provinces, my income is always shot and, worse than that, I can't get institutions. Considering the fact African nations don't get Feudalism, that's a near eternal 50% higher cost for technology, putting me behind everyone. Now, I hear you say, that's fair, after all, they're supposed to be less developed, and you'd be right... if not for the simple fact that, if you have the DLC, you can get around this by just spending monarch points to get the institutions.Now, I hear you say, that can't be too bad, right? I mean, sure, it sucks, but that doesn't seem too too bad, just higher tech cost, you can get around that. And you're right, I am able to get around that, but what I can't get around is money. Nearly ever single African province that you can conuqer early on as Kongo is Tropical, if not some other negative effect like coast or mountain, or steppes. This means that your tax income for that province is -1.5 ducats a year, meaning, unless you've got good production, you ain't gonna be getting money from those.But, I hear you say, every other nation has to deal with that, what's so bad? And the simple answer is Europe doesn't. The only way for the Kongo to get ahead is for them to, literally, conquer so rapidly and save up enough money that the moment they can, they embrace feduelism really early on. But if you think that's all I will be complaining about, please, sit back down.As the Kongo, you have two vassals, Ndongo, and Loango. It's a common strategy to conquer land and sell it to your vassals so you don't waste admin points. Now, if I have DLC, I can give them land in a war, and basically spread and conquer. Another DLC mechanic is being able to go to war for your vassal, such as if they have a piece of land they have a claim on, you can declare war for them, and grow them that way, since you requrie a casus belli. Without the DLC, you can do neither. Instead, you must take the land for yourself and sell it back to your vassals, at a -10 prestige hit per province, meaning, if I conquer my neighbors and sell the land to Loango, it'll cost me 100 prestige, lowering my legitimacy, and hurting me in the long run. And, since I don't have DLC, I can't declare wars on behalf of my vassal, meaning, if I misclicked or forgot to get a claim before selling the land, I'm out of luck and will need to wait 10 years to gain anything more.Now, this might not be so bad, you think, as there is a feature in the game that would allow you to give land to vassals, and you're right... but what about being a vassal? There's an achievement for Butua, where you overthrow your overlord and conquer them. Since your a vassal, you can't have allies, you can't be independant, you give up some money, etc. etc.. Since I don't have DLC, I basically save-scum, reload and reload a bunch, and pray to god that I get lucky. If I had the DLC, I could befriend a big neighbor, like Kilwa, and have them support my independence, giving me their strength when I inevitably declare an independence war and overtake my overlord. But, because I don't, it's a big F-U. And, let us not forget about treasure fleets and privateers, as those abilities mock me. The Sunni nations of north africa all get bonuses to privateer fleets, but, because I lack the DLC, I can't even make privateering fleets, meaning they are weaker by comparison.Don't even get me started on your heir. With DLC, if I have a horrible, god awful, heir, I could disown and pick a new one, name then what I want, and have a good ruler most of the time. Without the DLC, have fun playing RNGesus patented Ruler Roulette, where France and Ottomans get 6-5-6 rulers, and you get 1-2-1.And this isn't even mentioning the quality of life improvements, or the storyline! Because I don't have the DLC, the french revolution doesn't send Europe into a frenzy, the major religious war doesn't kick off (to my knowledge), and, this is probably the worst part, everything is less convenient. Do I want to have my diplomats maintain my relationships? Without the DLC, I gotta do it manually. I need an army of 10,000, and want them all to build automatically and meet up here, nope, can't do that, do it yourself. It's infuriating that these quality of life features are just non-existant in the base game, as it does nothing but add enjoyability.So, I must conclude that there are simply some achievements that require DLC to be even remotely possible. It is sad, but I will continue trying in futility to take these achievements and overcome the game's stupidity. I can only pray Paradox learns something soon."

,Recommended,236850,26803761,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Riko,"I originally wrote an EU4 over 2 years ago, but I feel like a new review is appropriate since ive played it much more since then. The following is the original review, but edited to account for changes since version 1.7 when I originally played it, to version 1.18 it is on now. Additions are in bold, subtractions/edits are with strikethrough.""I'm sure everyone has at one point had that power fantasy of wanting to be some supreme ruler of a country, whether that means you are a kind and benevolent, or a cruel-hearted demon of a ruler is a different story(Rulers now actually have personalities now, so you can have a cruel or kind leader which is appropriate). Well withEuropa Universalis IV(EU4), you can be either of them if you so desire. In fact, it is more than just that, much much more, with expanding your borders, and crushing your enemies, the game comes alive to the player in numerous ways.Well the first, and most obvious way is the aforementioned power fantasy fulfillment. Play as anysovereignnation state, and see the rise (and possibly fall) of your empire over a span of over 350 years. Play a diplomatic, a heavily military game, or a trade heavy game, and begin to cut out your own little slice of the world. Play upon alliances, and take down common threats, then come back and backstab your previous allies when you want their land. Customise how your nation focuses it's tech, and use that to push your nation's strengths to new limits, allowing you to potentially be an empire worth fearing.Turn a backwater into a thriving metapolis the envy of the world, be the origin of the the world's greatest advances in civilization and guide history in the direction you desire.This does not come at the expense of player accessability although. The game falls into that simple mantra of easy to learn, hard to master. With its relatively simple and watered down mechanics (compared to the other paradox strategy games of course), it provides great depth with a minimum of actual work in any one area. Within a few hours, you will understand how to run your nation (probably through trial and error, but still useful), and even if you fail, it is not the end. One lost battle or war is no reason to quit, besides lost troops or land, there is always room to come back and defeat those who beat you. The game is not cruel, it is fair to the player.Except in one area I have noticed. The game has a problem with making the AI cheat, and when I say cheat, I mean really cheat. No fog of war, more manpower, no loan penalties, more money, a lot less aggressive expansion penalties, and war happy. So you will find them declaring war out of the blue, just because they feel like it, even if you far outmatch them in some cases. This is very notable with one nation, France. France is, without a doubt, the most powerful nation in the game, with the highest concentration of high wealth provinces, and with excellent starting armies, generals, manpower, and position. In addition to unique french events, and traditions, france is an absolute powerhouse in the early, mid, and late game unless you can form a more powerful nation and can manage to crush them.AI, outside a few minor things the AI can't properly assess (fog of war, and naval attrition), doesn't cheat. Some nation positions and minor differences in regional troop types can give vastly different outcomes in terms of things such as war.EU4 really excells in many areas and mechanics, two of which are it's ideas system and war system. Ideas are essentially specialisations for your nation you can take over time, and will guide your nation state's direction of how it approaches the world. It can give you a vastly better military, or be geared to making you more money to just buy friends (or troops from other nations to fight for you). It makes every nation feel and play uniquely in their situation, so it is never boring playing as two different nations and using the same ""build order"". War is also incredibly in depth, with dozens of small factors and things that can be used to optimised fighting and tweaking troop's fighting ability. It is incredibly easy to understand, but as ive said before, takes a while to master all the intricate details that influence how well troops fight. The satisfaction of setting up a perfect situation, executing that military plan, and crushing your opponent into the ground, is second to none.Despite that major gripe, it is does not detract from the positives that EU4 has.Seeing your nation which you have been through hundreds of years of war and technological advances, slowlygrow larger in most casesgrow in influence, as well as the social changes that happen over one of the most important parts of human history, is very satisfying to see. But after all that, it is sad to say goodbye to your nation which you, in some cases, raised from infancy all the way to adulthood. But in the end, that is something that must happen, and there will always be other nations you can rule over to perpetrate the cycle anew.See more reviews by following this group -http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JSJaRG"""

In most strategy games of this scope, say the Civilization or Empire series, you have control an economy dictated by resourses collection and expenditure and diplomacy that involves little more than trade deals and defensive pacts. What makes EU4 the grandest of all the strategy games is the depth of control you are given in virtually every aspect of gameplay.If you like trading, you can get to the nitty gritty of trade steering, production management, and manipulating node control to yield far more money than otherwise possible. Perhaps you just like to smash stuff with a massive army; you can even tactically manage your fighting armies through precisely timed reinforcements or through careful manipulation of combat width. The level of diplomacy available is exemplar as well, allowing for everything from royal marriages, to trade embargoes, to papal excommunication, to building spy networks and destroying an enemy's reputation.The bottom line of EU4 is that it is what you make it. Everything is there - everything. So this can be a game of world conquest or it can be a game of financial domination or it can be a game of influence and family. There are so many possible play styles and nations to mix and match that the 500+ hours I have logged have only scratched the surface of what is possible in this game.Not only is EU4 my favorite of grand strategy games, it is one that has brought many bonds into my life.

There simply isn't any alternative to what Europa Universalis IV offers.However, beware of the leaning curve. My story began back in 2013, I read about it somewhere and was so hyped and the moment it came out in local game store, I bought it. It is worth mentioning that this was my first Paradox Interactive game and that I really had no clue what to expect. So I installed it, chose Teutonic Order for my first playthrough (guess knights seemed cool enough), and got destroyed by Poland. So I restarted it several more times to no avail. It really felt like I was playing with Microsoft Excel compared to Total War games I have been actively playing before. So I chose France then as it was highlighted as a beginner nation, and I failed miserably again. After that I rage quit and uninstalled the game.It wasn't until year later that I installed the game again and decided to actually do my best to understand the basics. And I started as Castille which greatly helped me learn a thing or two about EU4. Ever since then, I am an avid fan of this game, it's by far the best strategy game there is, in my opinion.Pros:1. You get to pick any country which existed during this period and that includes a vast amount of countries. I guess the most obvious choice is to start with your own country if it exists and try to bring it to its greatest historical extent.2. You pick your own goals. There really is not predefined goal. Sure if you start as Byzantium, you are bound to face Ottomans or if you are one of Irish nations, England is not going to make your life easy. But what I mean is that there is a vast array of choices you can make in this game and change the history. Make Ottomans convert to Christianity, conquer all of Russia as let's say The Golden Horde, become the biggest colonizator as Songhai etc. Anything is really possible.3. Achievements. Unlike most of other new games, this game has some quite tricky achievements. And they give you a sense of direction should you not make your own goal. Also that way, you are being encouraged to learn about new countries by playing them - you might find your favorite this way. Some are ridiculously hard and might require several restarts but that feeling when you manage not only to survive as Tabaristan but to from into formidable Persia and challenge Ottomans, priceless. I managed to pull few tough ones but my favorite is definitely A Kaiser not just in name.4. This argument is direclty linked to the previous one. You should get this game for HRE mechanics, if for nothing else. I have always disregarded these features until few months ago when I decided to try to unify Holy Roman Empire which I did. Now simply put, you feel like you are in Game of Thrones itself,  that vibe is incredible. There are so many ways you can lose but once you push through the reforms, you are pretty much unstoppable.5. Always learning something new. There is always a room for improvement and this game greatly depicts that.6. Soundtrack. It is awesome. However I have to say Sabaton is beyond awesome. When The Lion From The North song popps up, you know it's time to wage a war. Honestly, I found out about Sabaton from this game and even managed to go to concert this month, so I am very grateful.Cons:1. The game has too many DLCs. Now I am not bringing that argument, it is too expensive etc. With enough waiting  you can get it for a good price, just like anything on steam. What I mean is that the game has been greatly changed. In its current state it resembles little to its original vanilla form.2. It keeps adding more complexity which in my opinion greatly limits your options of expanding, especially as OPM or any small nation. If you miss DLCs you are still affected by new game mechanics but have no way of influencing them back.3. It is too Eurocentric. Granted, its name is Europa and I am European myself but there simply aren't enough reasons to play or be remotely interested in Asia for example, whereas in Europe, many countries get unique events.

The game is played in real time but with the ability to pause at any time and the need to pause often it does have the feel of a turn based game.There is no first person view like in Total War games and this is not an entry level strategy game like CIV5. So if your looking for eye candy, cool action scenes or a game that you can easily get into and learn you will not find it here. That being said EU4 has an easier learning curve than most Paradox games and that's due to it's top notch informative and slick UI. Information is easy to find and the Wiki is kept updated by it's devoted fanbase.The difficulty levels can be changed in the settings but difficulty is mostly based on what starting country you choose. Also, the AI is well done and will give you headaches so expect a harsh learning curve. Patience and learning from your mistakes will be needed but once you get going you will fall in love for months if not years.This is not a world conquest type game. Sure it can be done but that's for the elitists and die hards and is not what the game is built for. EU4 is a sandbox historical simulator of sorts. Historical events and themes influence playthroughs enriching the gaming experience for history buffs. This is a game where you set your own goals and make your own path. Don't expect the game to tell you where or what to do because it won't.Paradox is a good Swedish company that is always putting out free updates and patches but on the flip side their major updates and expansions can be rough around the edges filled with bugs which can drive players mad. That being said they are very good at patching and improving their games. It just requires some patience from us beta testers err I mean gamers occasionally.If you're a board game enthusiast, history buff and/or just wanting to step up to a more challenging but rewarding grand strategy game than I highly recommend EU4.

Instead of improving the AI in order to make the game more interesting, Paradox continues to introduce handicaps into the game; handicaps that make it no longer fun and and introduces more and more micromanagement aspects into the game.EU4 has changed from an interesting and fun alternate history game into a chore.Complaints that I have:- The AI is never affected by money or monarch power problems- Because the AI is never affected by money or monarch power problems, their ability to stay in a war is stupid good. The AI ran out of manpower? No problem, just buy more and more mercenaries- The AI is too dumb to effectively wage war against players? No problem, just give them arbitrary bonuses against the player- Small AI nations are able to field way too many troops; an example of this is Burgundy's vassal swarm providing them with nearly 20,000 troops- Estates are pointless and useless micromanagement features that don't make the game more indepth or fun- The amount of aggressive expansion you can earn for taking a province in Western Europe is ridiculous and it's even worse if it's a province that's in the HRE- Truce timers take way too long. Basically, if you go to war with a nation, you're not going to be able to go to war with them again for another ten years at least- Rebels pop up CONSTANTLY if you take a province from another country it's not even a question of ""if"" anymore but a question of ""when"". In order to prevent rebels from popping up, you have to sink monarch points into preventing rebels, slowing you down.It's like playing Monopoly with only one dice while everyone else gets to use two.

In the game, one is able to create armies and navies, invade and conquer your neighbors, and colonize the world. It has no real end goal, however world domination is nice. With a felxible starting date of anywhere between 1453 and 1800, there are centuries of history to play through, as historical countries, even though keeping to their set history is up to you. Europa Universalis 4 provides a platform to do the impossible, to conquer Europe as China, to maintain colonies accross the world, to destroy the largest empires, to invade Russia in the winter.However, Europa Universalis 4 is a game riddled with challenge. It is not easy, and players hoping to start off as the tiniest nation they see are almost certainly going to have a difficult road ahead of them if they wish to succeed. There are also other nations like France, Austria, Portugal, and Castille if you are in the mood for an evening of steamrolling the weak nations and conquering the world in one fell swoop.Micromanagement is also a crucial aspect to gameplay, and it can pose to be difficult, but also rewarding, to fully manage an economy, organize military forces, mitigate crises, and handle diplomacy. However this amount of micromanagement provides a sense of immersion into the game, and allows a greater sense of pride in tasks like maintaining a surplus and such.Europa Universalis IV is a great game for strategy gamers, who have no doubt at least heard of other Paradox titles, but for those looking for a walk in the park as they see every nation fall to them may not be able to enjoy the game."

The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Nation designer! Also you dirty unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously The Cossack’s cost is 50% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just slight mechanic tweaks, not anything ""expansive"". It’s sad when mods offer more content then official expansions and also happen to be free. I love the concept of a game developing after its release, but don’t make me pay for every slight tweak. Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For “The Cossacks”, that's roughly 7 dollars off still leaving me roughly $13 dollar left to pay, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial ""deal"" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a tiny proportion of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next ""grand"" expansion for EU4 because oh well, right?UPDATE 4/10/16:With the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their comunity streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanision then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.P.S. 5/28/16:Europa Universalis 4 has become a convoluted piece of crap that is hardly playable. It stifles the player every step of the way and fumbles on offering a challeging and engaging experience. Paradox is becoming a disappointment, if they aren't already."

By gating some rather large game-changing systems behind DLC and refusing to incorporate them into the game -- even years after the release of the DLC -- the game has some serious problems.For example the ""Estates"" system was introduced with the Cossacks expansion in 2015. The Cossacks still costs $20 -- the cost of an entire game like Factorio (highly recommended!) -- and its Estates function is so fundamental to gameplay that it should be something that is incorporated into the core of the game. Instead Paradox is theoretically supporting the base game with no expansions, plus 11 expansions, and any combination thereof so hundreds of variations, some of which have core changing functionality. Removing it from being gated behind the DLC, and reducing the price of the Cossacks DLC for new comers, would help solidify the game.At work someone asked me about this game and I told him the same thing: don't buy the game. It's a giant money sink. Yes, I have many hours in the game, but at this point in development an EUIV 2.0 should be considered that incorporates much of the existing DLC. The DLC in turn should be severely reduced in price after that, or better yet, consolidated."

Patrick picked denmark, and daniel went for orissa a city state on the eastern coast of india. 3 months later the year is 1586 and the world is a very different place.

To my east is the ottomans a massive all powerfull sunni nation who have succeded in taking a large chunk of eastern europe. Relations are tense and the only thing preventing war is my alliance with the timurids a technolgically backward horde that controls vast swathes of asia minor and india. Nikoli and tim made the mistake early on of attacking russia in the winter :D. The war lasted 15 years and nearly bankrupted both crimea and the golden horde. However they scraped a win and over the next hundred years fought off the ottomans and the united commonwealth of poland and lithuania on multiple occasions. Despite succesfully reforming his goverment and westernising nikoli's crimea was eventually overrun and he switched to play as the shogunate of japan. Tim's golden horde succesfully managed to take over the remnants of muscovy and he remains a major power in the region. Patrick managed to unite scandinavia into an empire, but grew bored and switched to playing as the papal state in italy.

But when new DLCs come out every couple of months and each DLC is about 15 to 20 € then you seriously start to wonder wether you really need those.But that's not really your decision at all.The problem here is that the last couple of DLCs completely changed how the game is played. From little aesthetic changes to changes to core mechanics, the game as it is now is very much different to how it started out. You can argue about the necessity or usefulness of all the new mechanics, but the implementation is terrible.And the changes affect the AI regardless wether you bought the DLCs. So even though you didn't buy that DLC and can't use X yourself, the AI can and will use X (and likely have another advatage because of it).All those changes and all those ""updates"" also mean you have to start a new campaign because save games will most likely not be compatible.(Yes, you can roll back your version number but then you couldn't use your mods anymore - they update as well)It's sad to see this great game become just a way to milk the players.Paradox should stop mucking about with EU4 and simply start with EU5.And instead of all those AI boni, maybe try and just make the AI smarter.I wouldn't buy it anymore, and the way Paradox handles EU4 you shouldn't either."

Playing with and without dlc is so major, -and they recently increased the price of the game- I felt like I had to protest it.I get that they need to sell expansions to get this 4-year-old game going. Yet they do it in such a money draining way, especially to the newer players, although I like the company, their general attitude and their games I really think they could and should do it through a more moderate marketing policy."

76561198059008088,Recommended,236850,9914344,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,Leximoor,"Hello Steam Community.Well... what can I say about this game that has not been said a hundred times already? Other than its worth its purchase on how you see it.Firstly to start this review, this game will take your way of strategy in managing a country in a good diplomatic and expanding style. It is not the Crusader Kings 2, but that is not necessary a bad thing, quite the opposite in some ways. If you want to play a game that focuses on managing a country through pretty much basic but a variety of ways which focus around diplomacy, colonies and expanding. This is the game to get.Pro Aspects about the game:The Game by itself with its historical starts and able to play pretty much almost over hundreds of different nations from start to finish with many having their own ideas and historical events coming up is just fantastic. This game does show that if you make certain decisions that would have happened in real history it affects your game in the long run. Also its fun to learn about a little history about nations in a game without having to read a book about them at the same time.Another apart from being very addictive is to make you focus rather on brute force but rather using deception strategies when managing your country. Ironically when playing later on with smaller nations I had more enjoyment in making them survive in the shadow of bigger powers and then during the end making them into large empires of their own with the former enemies now in fear. You get a sense of feeling like a proper leader focusing on expansion.Cons about the game:This might be just a little pick of some stuff but firstly the tutorial to get into the game does not really support fresh gamers to a new strategy style of game. But this is not fully a bad thing since Paradox games usually are kinda daunting to get into so, if you want to play this game (Which I still recommend strongly you try it out) Look online for guides for this is a very meaty and large in content in game. So be prepared to have moments of mass confusion though over time this comes in practise.Over a large amount of time if not managed properly your save data will pile up and start eating up your storage so if you have limited storage be sure to remove saves you don't want to keep. At one point I managed to aquire over 45 Gb of storage from just saves alone. Then again if this is taking the date of hundreds of nations and yours as well then I'm not surprised.Also this game is not a game to focus around and command armies or navies around the world in the battles so don't expect the game to focus around that which is not really a bad thing but should not be mistaken for being so.Conclusion:Although this game is daunting to take in at first and can be difficult in managing countries even on Iron Man Mode which makes you have 1 save on the go, this is for me as a strategy lover my most played, appreciated, loved and enjoyed game I've ever played. If you are a strategy player, this deserves a place in your game library or at the very least for you to try out the demo now and take a nation in a historical way, or change the world map forever."

The base game without DLCs doesnt really feel incomplete and lacks quite a few options, yet the base game is about as expensive as Witcher 3. And the DLCS, dont get me stated on the trainwreck of DLCs. Most DLCs feel quite inadequate, sometimes when playing the game you dont feel them, as they only modify a minor feature, yet most of them are expensive as hell You can see this for the size of the dlc. most come in the size under 10Mb. So perhaps all of the dlc published combine work as 1 or 1.5 normal expansion in the past. Yet the total price of the DLC now is over CNY1k.The other thing aside from this greedy money grab policy, most paradox games/dlcs are not meant to be played on release, as they are often bugged as hell. People who played their games/dlcs on release actually functioned as unpayed alpha/beta test player. Even if I have purchased some of the dlcs/games on release day, I was just supporting the developers. I think many PDX game players share this sentiment. Now, to repay this loyal fan, PDX decide to raise the price of most of their games by around 20% - 50% to matching their ""potential new purchasing power"". The economy has stagnant if not in full recession for the past few years, for God's sake.Yes, you might see the absurd time I spent in this game. I did spend a large amount of time playing it, however much of the 2000hrs game time is run in background. Perhaps only half or less is actually playing. And I have bought most of the essential DLCs, and some at release just to support this studio.TL; DR: Don't buy into this expensive game. The game might be good, but it's just too ♥♥♥♥ing expensive at the moment, with its constant strain of overpriced DLC it would be hard to keep up.兄弟，别支持贪婪的公司。"

Add to that the price of the DLC seem a bit high for what you are getting. I'm fine with Paradox continuing to make new content for EU4, but they have to take their time and make it worth the investment. We in the community also need time, the campaigns can eat up dozens of hours at a time, releasing save-breaking patches and DLC every month is not a model I like. So until Paradox gets their act together regarding DLC I can't recommend this game to new players and Third Rome will be the last DLC I buy.

Just like Microsoft is doing with Skype (seriously what the hell?). Common Sense locks out people who don't have it, so I have several friends who cannot play the full game unless me or another person who has the DLC hosts a multiplayer game so they can enjoy the full game. Utterly ridiculous. I have long enjoyed the game, but I have occasionally disagreed with the changes throughout the game's development. The Fort system is ludicrous because the AI ignores the forts and goes right past to destroy your army while you cannot get past their forts. The AI also will destroy you utterly after being an ally for a long period for no reason other than, ""Well, I suddenly want all your land, dear ally! Sorry!""Then there's also playing moderate to small sized countries where every country around you will hate you and declare six simultaneous wars on you and destroy you before you can even do anything. I attempted a Venice playthrough three times. Hungary, Milan, Austria, Ottomans, Serbia, Bosnia, and Mamluks all declare war on you nearly simultaneously each time. Once I gotten close to destroying both the Mamluk and Ottoman navy as well as taking the Pelopponese, but then you have the issue of NO ONE wanting to ally you. Not even France and every nation dogpiling on you until there's nothing left. So, in this scenario after nearly defeating the Ottomans I am reduced to nothing and Ottomans kills everyone else. Great work everyone! Oh and more recently Ottomans have been able to ally Bohemia and Aragon with regularity. Is this an intended change to AI behavior? I do not know, but it's rather silly! Similar story with an Oman playthrough. Yemen, Haasa, Hejaz all ally and kill everyone else. Yemen gets allied to Adal who takes Somalia and Mamluks as well. Everyone else is allied against you and there's nothing you can do about it! No one will ally you and the AI make it a certainly that they will crush you for what appears to simply be existing as a player country.I haven't had any major issues since before Common Sense, but it has just been getting more aggravating. Even colonizing is stupid because even if you are a strong country, they will all revolt simultaneously every twenty years, which makes owning them not worth it unless they deliver gold builllion every few months. So, that's yet another feature that isn't fun anymore. I hope AI behavior, colonial nation behavior, development regarding people who don't own Common Sense, and the fort system being cheated by AI is fixed at some point. Otherwise, I'll just be waiting for Stellaris I suppose."

The paradox team has very actively updated, and improved this game since launch, and the state it is in now is glorious.It is an extremely complex game upon initial playing, but the learning curve is much better than it used to be, and the tooltips in game are incredibly detailed. I've had friends who have never played ask me if it is anything like the Civilization series, and the best response I have to that is Civilization is the equivelant of playing with legos as a child, where as EU4 is like building your dream house to live in. There really is no good comparison though, as the only way they are alike IMO is that both are nation builder games.Eu4 is not for everyone of course, but if you even think you might have an interest in it, chances are you will love it.I recomend a Brandenburg playthrough, and a muscovy playthrough at some point.As for a good nation to get your feet under you, and learn the game, Ottomans is definitely the easiest, and I doubt anyone would argue that. France is another great nation for learning the game in every aspect, and Spain is awesome for learning a well rounded game with a focus on colonizing. Playing any nation in Japan is a blast, but you'll want to have a firm understanding of the game before trying that.The modding community is incredible, and some of the mods out there are like getting a whole new game for free. There are mods to simplify the game, and ease the burdens of monotonous tasks, as well as mods to make the game more complicated, realistic, historical, and difficult if that's your thing.The initial purchase of $39.99 is a fair price, the only bad thing is if you do buy it there is a great deal of DLC that is very important, but not needed to play the game.

Especially the French.Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ them.Also stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥happens all the time. You've been looking at central Europe for a few hours. You pan the map to the west and notice that Haiti now owns half of America. You declare a war to claim ONE PROVINCE and before you know it the whole damn world is fighting against itself in every single continent.You feed your ally provinces from your wars and laugh manically as you watch their kingdom crumble to 200 stacks of rebels.The game seriously plays down all the opression and ethnic cleansing that goes on. It makes it seem that all you're doing by hitting that convert button is changing a few percentage values, but deep down inside you know whats really going on.When you hit the harsh treatment button to lower your peasant revolt risk, you don't realize that your soldiers are storming into peasants homes and executing them just for having an opinion on how to better their lives.I mean, i didn't even notice that all of my african provinces were producing slaves until i got an event that abolished slavery. The only reason i even cared about that was because it made my monthly income go down...Don't even think about trying to be a tolerant, peace loving society. Either all the countries next to you will kill you, or the boredom will kill you, because there is literally nothing to do in this game besides wage war and find new ways to ♥♥♥♥ the common man in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.It really opened my eyes to how terrible white people are.Overall 10/10 best opression simulator.

Keep in mind the same thing does not happen to France or Austria.2. Austria is now freaking insane, the programmerfs do not want the player to blob the map, so they make the big country AI's blob and get away with it. This steals the fun out of the game. Look I do not play this game the way you demand I play it I guess. If you are going to hit players this hard, say so. Dont take our money then force to invest time into multiple failed games.3. Cant block straits with your navy now. WTF not? Again you should tell returning players in one screen what you have changed since so and so patch in order to screw over the player.So insummary if you start small, and try to expand at a rate that will allow you to compete with Austria or France in say 200 years, the game bends you over and flushes 8 to 15 hours of game play down the toilet.

,Not Recommended,236850,32442324,Posted: 15 June,all,handsoap,"Europa Universalis 4 is my most played game on Steam by a wide margin.  This game has given me more hours of combined satisfaction and frustration than any game I've ever played.  It's hard to give a game I love so much a negative review.  To elaborate:is EU4 worth your time?Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.Is EU4 worth your money?As of right now, no.With all of its DLC, EU4 boasts a fantastic, ever-expanding experience in all areas of the world.  It's got less of a learning curve and more of a learning sheer cliff face (as do most Paradox games), but as ever, the limitless rewards of achievements, new strategies, and absolute historical absurdities await you once you learn enough to make them happen by your own hands.  There's one caveat here, though:this is only true with all of its DLC.  And this is where we run into problems.I own all of the DLC (aside from music/content packs, anywway).  I bought most of them piecemeal, one by one as they were released.  While some of them were arguably overpriced, I never once thought to myself they were too steep a cost to sink into a game I loved.  Unfortunately, EU4 is at an all-time high in popularity, which means incoming players don't have the luxuries of already loving the game or buying the DLCs one by one.  They're presented with an enormous paywall to receiving the complete EU4 experience, which is one I strongly believe hinges on buying most of the DLC.This is what I mean by EU4 not being worth your money, and it pains me to admit such a thing as I will no doubt start the game up after writing this review.  It's not that the game lacks for something--in fact, it's that it hastoo much... that's hidden behind a paywall.  Until Paradox changes their DLC policy, I just can't condone paying upwards of hundreds of dollars for a complete experience.  Not everyone can afford that kind of money, much less for a game they'll also have to sink hundreds of hours into to learn properly.With luck, Paradox will read some of these recent reviews and perhaps change their ways--offering older DLC for free, and perhaps only necessitating the purchase of the recent DLCs--but I won't hold my breath, as EU4 is at an all-time popularity high and I'm sure the money they're earning speaks more than the mountain of recent negative reviews.  Regardless, for any incoming player aspiring to join the Paradox strategy hype train: wait.  Wait either for a major sale, or preferably for the game to be made more accessible with a change in DLC policy."

The cost to get the complete game is just too high. Contrary to what some may say, the base game without DLC is playable, however, you face significant handicaps. This is made worse through the fact that you often have to watch videos online to figure out how to play the game, which makes you realize everything you are missing by not having the DLC. Paradox's DLC policy can pretty much be summed up in this: They release a free patch for everyone, which does often have some nice features, but far more noticeable, it introduces some significant handicap that makes playing the game either more difficult (not necessarily bad) and/or more tedious and punishing. But just wait! Pay $20 (American) and you can get a DLC which convienently has a feature which compensates for that handicap!If this game would bundle all but the latest 3 DLC with the base game and sell that for, say, $60, then I would highly recommend this game. But in it's current state, with it's current prices, I simply cannot, despite considering it one of the most fun games I have ever played."

Horrible DLC Policy - Buyer Beware !!I bought EU4 back in 2013 and paid for only the game changing DLCs, never bought anything in 2016 or 2017. So many people are getting confused about the high price of DLC, as opposed to the lack of value in the DLC to justify the price. I would pay $20.00+ for DLC if it had enough content to justify the price point. The current DLC coming out the wood work is just garbage for the amount they're asking for.Paradox needs to be careful because loyal customers will continue to buy DLC under the proper circumstances, but if someone is looking at getting started with EU4, it has a very high price point overall, confusing DLC options which are not obvious to new players, and a lack of good game changing content on new DLCs.They really need to bundle the old DLC at a reduced rate if they're going to continue to charge high amounts for new DLC.I would still say EU4 is a great game, but doesn't hold my vote until they revise their DLC pricing policy."

Unfortunately, this game is now about $250 more expensive than when I bought it (and it's still rising).  I expect a few DLC at this point, it's a common market item nowadays.  You'll notice a price trend though, on the many, many, major DLC releases.  It goes from 5-10 -> 15 -> 20.  I'm sorry, but $20 for some feature tweak DLC's?  Not to mention, these DLC's tend to come with a patch that likes breaking a portion of a game without the DLC present. Problems and balance issues introduced with new patches / DLC are ignored in favor of making the next cash grab DLC.  I love Paradox games, but with the direction their company is taking, I really can't support them anymore.  I encourage those looking at this product not to buy it until the company decides to show a more reasonable approach to it's game life maintinence & DLC programs."

All the other mechanics added to most of the newer ""expansions"" are just filler, and dont really add much to the game.

To explain that a little more clearly: I arrived at this game relatively late, so I cant say for sure, but EU4 seems to follow paradox's trademark pattern of starting off promising and ambitious, improving with a few early updates to work out some kinks, and then enduring a succession of hideously awful updates which, in huge and decisive steps, utterly mutilate what a few days ago was an awesome game. It was already suffering a mild case of paradox-update cancer when I got to it; filled to the brim with an overwhelming array of impenetrable, counterintuitive, and overly fiddly interfaces and easily misunderstood and incredibly important gameplay mechanics. This gave the game a bit of a learning cliff, but at least it was playable and everything worked.I was in the middle of my first competent game when the new update destroyed it. Playing as feudal Japan, I had successfully united all the islands of my country under one government, eliminating the squabbling daimyos with a mix of diplomacy and brute force. I made some rookie mistakes, overcame them, and finally got the hang of things and it was really cool. Then I decided to screw with history a little bit and focus on developing ""advanced"" technology, which I used to explore and colonize the new world, west coast first. Then the update happened, and the entire world got covered in fog of war, screwing up my trade income (nobody knew where anyone was, so who could I trade with?), forcing me to painstakingly restart the process of uncovering it all (an intentionally slow and obtrusive process), introduced some more new micro-mechanics which predictibly add absolutely nothing to the game, and then, every financial exense associated with maintaining my empire quadrupled overnight, making it completely impossible to avoid bankrupting at terminal velocity. Makes me wonder how the other countries are doing (not that I can check, because the update erased my world map). This is extremely not cool. I spent hours on that game and then the update took a big, steaming, dump on it."

DLCs + a great Community.You need a little time to understand the whole game mechanics if you are new (like me) to this series. But it pays off, because for other game's you need much time like for the story. Here you make your own story. The mechanics are deep and get deeper with every (major) DLC.I'm sorry I can't compare it with other grand strategy video games, but I think it's safe to say that EU IV stands out from the crowd. The amount of possibilities which country you play, how you play it (defensive or aggressiv, both has disadvantages), the time period you play it and with 'El Dorado' the customization is fantastic and so much you can't even describe it with a few sentences.So in conclusion: Even for new and non-specialist this game should be an option. It has a great replay-value, a nice community and a growing 'supply' of DLCs.Edit:Hit the 3k hours and it's still good. The newest DLC's gets more customization and the replay-factor is going through the roof."

The game was basic, but the idea was mindblowing at the time. So when EU2 came out, after i had like 1000h of EU1, i bought the game. There where no major changes, just a tweek here and there on the game mechanics and its AI, but the rendering was still the same. Anyway +3000h coloniziing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out the new world as Portugal (and yes, in the first 2 versions i kinda only played Portugal, well, cuz im portuguese and i just love our history, and guess what, i now study history at the university). Anyway, back in 2007 i read online (on my pc, no smarphones back then) that EU3 was coming out soon, and that looked freaking awsome, for the the 1st time a 3D rendering and huge improvement to the AI, so i was counting the minutes and bought my copy the day it was released in FNAC at the Colombo shopping centre in Lisbon. Oh boy did i waste my life on this game. It wasnt yet needed to have a steam account to play it. Just when i thought it couldnt get any better, EU4 came out. I bought it again, and on CD (but yes i already had steam cuz i played a lot of Football manager, hence i created an account). Anyway, i play mostly offline so im pretty much sure i got over 4000h of this game, but meh, whos counting. I confess that was only in late 2013 that i found out this had an huge multiplayer community (holy ♥♥♥♥ yeah i was living under a rock). So i divide my time now between multiplayer and single player sessions. I love both.A quick overview of the game:In sum, EU4 is a game where you get the world map begining in 1444 spwaning till 1821 (i.e. kinda since the fall of Constantinople till the Liberal turmoil in Europe.) You got all countries that existed in 1444 and each countries with they historical provinces. The countries's borders change depending on the date you choose to start playing and new countries may or not appear on such date in time depending if it did exist or not, and are all historically correct. Then just pick a country and start managing all matters of state, economy, territorial, diplomacy, army, navy, etc. The game mechanic may seem difficult at start but trust me it will grow easy on you. The AI on this game is awsome idc what the haters say, single player at hard level will challange you a lot. The multiplayer mode its all fun specially if you in a lobby with 60 players i.e. 60 countries. If you want to play Portugal, Castille or England and colonize the world and go to Africa, India and Indonesia and build a massive trade empire, do it. If you want to play Austria and form the HRE, do it. If you want France and blob everyone, do it. If you want to play Brandenburg and form Prussia, do it. Theres arround 200 countries, and you can play them all. The sky is the limit with Europa Universalis 4.Warning:Dont play this game without all the DLCs. The game grew like 100000% since its vanilla. Ill keep paying gladly for the DLCs, cuz i prefer to have an active game being developed then having a new game being released every 2 years with little improvement.9.5/10"

With a setting that begins at the tail end of the 'Hundred Years War' and continuing on past the final defeat of Napoleon, Europa Universalis IV offers players the chance to take the helm of any country that existed in that 377 year period and bring honours and glory to your realm. You can play as a great land power such as Austria, Prussia, France, or Russia, or try your hand and carving out a vast colonial empire with the Spanish, Dutch, or British. You can begin in the far east, and attempt to fight the tide of European colonial adventures into your lands, or play as an American Indian tribe and unite your neighbouring tribes into a powerful confederacy to halt the Europeans in their march westward. I cannot stress this enough, EUIV is MASSIVE and will provide you with hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of enjoyable gameplay. You will experience the dawn of gunpower, the Dash and Glory of Musket and Horse, founding and expanding colonies in the furthest regions possible. You will gain provinces, and you will lose them, but it is always possible to come back from the darkest defeat and restore the glory rightly owed to your nation!EUIV has brought out several major DLC's that add major game play improvements and additional content that genuinely allow the game to grow into a fantastic piece of art. From interesting and challenging colonial mechanics to giving the player the opportunity to create a trade empire, and from improving the combat mechanics to making religion play the major role it did in the period, the EUIV team has consistently updated the game released in 2013 to keep it challenging and in line with what the people who play the game want it to be.Some people may balk at the DLC structure in use, however with each paid DLC released the developers provide a free content pack. I think the major DLC's worth purchasing, but should you not want to do so you can rest easy knowing that you will still get free updates.In short, put on your Tricorne, mount your horse, and prepare to fight for your God, your King, and your Country!"

OTHERWISE, STAY AWAY!tl;dr: This a great game, but only with all the variety of features that the DLC unlock. Unfortunately these all cost quite the fortune. Stay away.---(OLD REVIEW)This game. This game is the grandest of all the grand strategy games existing today. This review could easily be considered as a comparison between the two games Civilization V and Europa Universalis IV.To compare it to the game ""Civilization V"",Europa Universalis IV focuses on more complexity with expansion and conquest, as well as more resources to limit your aggression. The strategy in Europa Universalis IV is much deeper. The historical connection is stronger. The AI is better.Civ 5 however lets you play over a very long time period. It lets you take over the entire world and stomp on the AI. It is easier to learn and master so requires less patience and persistence.The DLC & PricesIn Europa Universalis IV, the DLC is not mandatory but is fun to play with. I don't recommend buying it unless you have money to throw around.Whereas in Civilization V, major DLC is mandatory for gameplay, and is considered an essential for any hardcore Civ player.To summarize this with math; discluding sales,Europa Universalis IV gives more content for its price and more gameplay as well.$39.99 (Game)+$9.99 + $14.99 + $4.99 (Optional, Non-mandatory DLCs)=$70.00 TotalCivilization V alone isn't much fun to play, and is also pricy however it has fairly pricy DLCs to add to the game.$29.99 (Game)+$29.99 (BNW) +$19.99 (G&K) +$4.99x5 (Per other Civilization)=$80 Min. -- $100.00 TotalI also often see the two games on sale, so I recommend snagging them up for cheap. I got Europa Universalis IV for $14.99 and DLC for $19.99, only spending about 35 dollars.In summary, I like them both. EUIV as a historical grand strategy game and Civ 5 as a build, expand, and conquer arcade strategy game. Now many people will usually choose one and stick to one game. Those differences determine whether you prefer / favor either of the two games. But in my opinion, if you have the money, you're better off buying Europa Universalis IV."

The amount of time me and other players have spent playing this game is a testament to how great it is, with many players that I have played multiplayer with currently sitting on 2-3k hours.In the beggining major patches were very spaced apart, but they were rich in fun and meaningful content, and so was all the DLC. However as Europa progressed Paradox has started releasing patches and DLC with a much higher frequency but a much lower quality. New major game mechanics are added in what feels like a monthly basis, which would be great if they weren't absolute garbage.I mean let's be honest, everyone hates the States/Territories system, the Sailor system is nearly arbitrary, the new intrigue system is alright but changing it had no real effect on the game, nobody knows what Revanchism is, and the list goes on an on. If they kept releasing amazing DLC like the Art of War I would bend over with my credit card in between my cheeks, but unfortunately thats not the case.At this point I think Paradox has given up on the game, and is flooding the market with DLC to make as much profit as possible. The patches clearly lack effort and desire to please those who still enjoy this game, and it makes me sad to leave a negative review on something thats kept me entertained for as long as this has.This is a negative review, because I hate what Europa has become, however it used to be a great game. I can only currently enjoy it by playing multiplayer, which makes some of the patches bearable because the competition is inherently fun, or by rolling back to an older version of the game.If Grand Strategy is your cup of tea, then I would storngly suggest waiting untill this is on sale, then buying it alongside some of the major DLC, and rolling back to around patch 1.14 or so. But I cannot reccomend buying this game at full price, or playing on patch 1.17 ."

Please pass on buying until they start selling their products for a reasonable prices.Also, their DLC's keep are now making the game worse, the game keeps getting more restricted and less fun to play. For example, the mechanics for the new world is just horrible in my opinion. Colonizing used to be fun and benificial, now it is only a burden where your colonies declare war on other nations for you. Damn colonials! Also, they keep making the two most powerful nations, the Ottomans and France, even more powerful. Even fact they even ally each other. Furthermore, the Europa series had a lot of randomness in their games, you could expect a different political landscape with each game session, but this keeps getting less possible with all the restrictions they make (i.e. making the ottomans near invincible).

As soon as they address this and start treating the consumer ethically, pick this game up immediately, but until then, don't reward developers who withhold core content behind a pay wall."

Europa Universalis IV is a truly masterful strategy game and if you're a history buff like me you'll absolutely love it.-However-The price of the game, including all of the DLC's that make it such a complex and wonderful experience, is FAR over what any sane person should charge for any game.About every three months, Paradox, the developer, puts out two DLCs normally priced at $20 and $5 or your regional equivalent.What are in these DLCs? Usually one has a new game mechanic that completely unbalances the game (and takes a few weeks for Paradox to fix) and the other has two sets of sprites for two completely different regions (Italy and east africa, for instance) that forces players that favor one region to buy new duds for one minor state in the horn of africa or India to get the sprites (with varying degrees of historical accuracy) for their favorite European or east asian nation.I would only recommend this game to strategy gamers that are huge fans of history BUT wait for a big sale and EVEN THEN get only the Art of War and Common Sense DLCs to see how much moolah you'd like to spend after playing with those two.If you have an addictive personality DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - PARADOX WILL SUCK YOU DRY!EDIT: fixed grammar errors"

Ontop of this, Paradox Iincreased the price of their products in dozens of countries and has been resistant to lowering the price on games and DLC as they age.

Having played multiplayer matches with a friend who owns all DLC before, I know exactly what I'm missing, and I'll tell you what, EU4 is a sad and shallow game without its ridiculously overpriced DLC. It is as if with every free update they release along with their DLCs, they try to make the vanilla game more and more unplayable, forcing you to resort to the DLC in order to fix these problems.After months of waiting, I could finally get my hands on the Art of War DLC. The game was significantly better. However, I was met with a disgusting barrier that pretty much crippled my experience: development increases. I had to buy the Common Sense DLC if I wanted to have access to such a crucial feature like this. It was a huge design decision that made no sense other than split the playerbase and ♥♥♥♥ with us. Anyway, I went to my wishlist today looking to get me some Common Sense and almost fell out of my freaking chair. The DLC prices were already horrendous before, but after this increase of almost 90% (this was the increase for Brazil, at least), the prices are straight up nightmarish. I had to ♥♥♥♥ing back off and completely give up on buying Common Sense.Paradox ♥♥♥♥ing sucks with it's shady as ♥♥♥♥ DLC practices.Not only they have released tons of barebones, situational (meaning that some DLC only benefits certain playstyles instead of improving the game overall), overpriced, unbalanced and downright broken DLC (I'm looking at you, Mandate of Heaven), they now have increased ALL of their prices by at least 33% on pretty much every region that isn't the US.Keep in mind that all of this was without notifying us loyal costumers previously.Once again we get backstabbed by those freaking greedy asshoIes.I dunno how much the price has increased in other regions, but here in Brazil, the prices are out of this world. The price has increased tremendously, not only for the DLCs but also for the base game. And the worst of it all?Their ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for this was that the purchasing power throughout those regions has increased a lot, and in order to create a more equal price point for our products across the globe, they increased their prices. Note that the decision is final.♥♥♥♥ING WHAT?!I'm 100% sure that most of the regions that have met with a price increase, if not all of them, were at least facing a stagnant economy. Here in Brazil, we are undergoing one of our most ♥♥♥♥ed up economical crisis ever. And yet you come and ♥♥♥♥ing increase the price of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC by almost 90%? Is that supposed to be the more equal price point you were talking about, you ♥♥♥♥ing pig dog? Does that mean that the folks at Para♥♥♥♥s Interactive understand more about my own purchasing power than MYSELF? Umm, no.Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, Paracunts, please.And to top it all off, they do this disgrace weeks before the STEAM SUMMER SALE?! The discounts we'll get are pretty much going to be the same as the prices before this increase.Just to give you some more context, if you want to buy the game plus all of its DLC upfront, it'll cost you around R$823 reais (~$251USD), at least. The minimum wage here is R$937,00 (~$286USD). Just to give you an idea. At this point, I really don't know if PDX is actively trying to compete with Train Simulator 2017 as the game with the most expensive DLC in the Steam Market or they are just being the slithery snakes they always were.And before you come at me with your ""HURR DURR IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT BUY IT I HAVE DlCK CANCER"", that is precisely what I'm going to do.

I don't care what the ♥♥♥♥ you think about it, but I'm definitely PIRATING THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THIS GAME. Torrents, here I come. Call me a cheap ♥♥♥♥ for all I care.

Province development is a great example of this.When simple patches are released as DLC, over and over again, that you need to shell out more and more money for (even though you've loyally bought all there overpriced wee texture and unit packs over the years), then you've been done over.- The whole EU4 collection will now set you back an astonishing and completely indefensible £165.When working systems are replaced by half-baked and often totally illogical mechanics that make no sense at all, then you've been done over.A great example of my last point is the ""zone of control"" farce that forts now exert. Although a garrisoned fort/castle has never in human history stopped an army from simply ignoring it and walking round it to its destination, it could've been an interesting mechanic, had Paradox spent more than ten minutes implementing it. As it turns out, in EU4, since the Common Sense forced-DLC, a tiny fort 400 miles to the south can stop a full army moving 10 miles to the north, even if said fort is under seige by a second army. I've even seen an army having to loop round from the east Chinese coast, all the way to the Hungarian Steppes and back again, just to move one province (or about 50miles) north. It is the most appalling and ridiculous inclusion any game has ever had.Furthermore, just about EVERYTHING that\'s been added requires monarch points to some degree. This in itself wouldn't be a problem. But Paradox didn't actually increase the number of monarch points you generate each month to compensate for everything that now needs them. So you're left unable to do half the things you want/need to do.The game has also been made harder and harder as time has gone on, with player choice being nerfed with every DLC. This in turn leads to lots and lots of time where you are left doing nothing, just waiting, with the game speed turned up. Any change that reduces ""stuff to do"" in a game can only be bad.Enormously crippling Over-Extension mechanics, which have been ramped up with each passing patch, has put paid to any ideas you may have had of creating a sprawling Empire-style nation. You simply won't have the monarch points to do it. So the alternative is to create a One-province nation, which, believe me, is no fun at all, as you spend 90% of the game at the highest speed level, waiting for something interesting to happen.Don\'t get me wrong, i enjoy a challenge, but not one that getsartificiallyadded with each passing patch and reduces my ""up-time"". The result of all this is that half the achievements are now completely beyond being achievable (unless you use a cheat engine or similar, which deats the purpose).But for me, by far the saddest thing about the horrible direction this once-great game has taken, is the effect it has had on public opinion about Paradox. Paradox were (once) a much-loved developer who enjoyed a lot of goodwill internationally from gamers. Now, they are close to being reviled world-wide by all of PCdom. Their bizarre decisions to change things that were working fine and locking offabsolutely key mechanicsbehind more and more ridiculous paywalls has relegated them into the same leagues as EA and co. I just cannot take them seriously anymore, and this seems to be a stance i share with many, many others.It is a great shame then, that, being a proud owner of half a dozen different Paradox strategy games, EU4 will sadly be my last. I will not be taken for a mug anymore by a company who have lost their way in every way imaginable, and have managed to alienate themselves from the gaming world.If you want to play this game, then do so, but roll it back to the patch before Common Sense, and switch off auto-updating. That way, you can enjoy what it once was, and not the money-swindling and unbalanced monster it has sadly become."

It’s truly magnificent. It’s a historical grand strategy, which is fully real time and has all aspects, from Churches to Governments. Half of this, however, it is locked behind a huge paywall of DLC. Very, very pricey DLC. Half of that DLC is just simple additions, such as being able to make your provinces more powerful, by adding to their development, effectively upgrading them. This made nations which were low in development have a good chance of survival, shall the player be able to steer it that way.What does this mean to you?Are you an individual who earns over $60,000 $USD annually? Likely not. If so, this DLC will be an investment not worth buying into. If you do have too much cash to spare, I don’t see why not. Apart from the fact that Paradox has a terrible business practice of adding to the game or DLCs price, just before a sale. So, you are very effectively, paying full price for what the game or DLC is worth. They are worth a huge amount of cash for such a shady business tactic, and this is just what Rockstar did with GTA V on a Steam Summer Sale a while back."

It’s been a joyride for the most part, its peak with EUII. Now, the best bit about this history simulator (a much more suitable definition than 4X or simply strategy game) was the huge amount of historical events thrown at you through time. Historical characters, wars, religious events, economic, trade and administration advances. You could actually learn a lot about history of unknown and mostly forgotten countries.Most of that is now gone, substituted by an easier “mission” system that allows you to pick and choose what your country is going to be. Sure the game is still fun, but it has become a lot more generic, losing that “grounded in history” feel it used to have in earlier versions, while the game engine is pretty much still the same old one.So, is this a good game per se? Yes it is.Would I recommend it? No, as it is a huge step back from previous releases.PROS:-	The whole world is up for grabs, and there’s almost infinite replayability-	The UI is nice and easy-	The game has depth and width as most Paradox games doCONS-	35 DLCs and counting, seriously??Considering most of the DLCs are utterly useless (most add songs (!!!) or tiny graphical improvements or ebooks (!!!!)). Some are meant to be meaningful (like Art of War, Wealth of Nations) but these cost 20USD a piece and add very little content.-	The updating policy is ridiculous and offensive: sure, patches are “free” but updating the game without getting the latest DLC (which you’d dearly pay for) the game becomes very unbalanced and clunky.-	Getting the game and all the DCL’s at full price costs more than 200 USD (two hundred) for a game that runs on a 15 years old engine. I got the game on a huge sale with several DLCs and still I regret spending about 25 USD for it.-	The historical flavour, with the tons of events that were there in previous versions is gone, making it another faceless 4X strategy game."

I've played most turnbased strategy games (and a number of real-time), and used litterally months of gametime on the Civ-series alone. And months played time on Heroes of M&M etc. This is better!It's more complex, have far greater replay-value than any other strategy game I've com across, and the not-really-turnbased-not-really-real-time concept is perfect. Even most of the DLC's are good.Why NOT recommended then?1) It's fast becoming one of the worst DLC exploiting games. (2nd only to their own CKII wich is litteraly insane!)2) Every time there's a DLC, the game without the DLC also changes (mapchanges, interactionchanges etc.), and often makes it real hard to play decent without the DLC. So you either get a worse gaming-experience or have to pay up more.3) If you like to play for acheivement, save yourself hours of anger-management treatment and don't ever touch this game. Example: You try several times to get one of the hard acheivements, and then in 4th try its there. You start as a minor Irish county and manage to outsmart England and are close to conquering the British Isles. You've got 30 hours playtime on this campaign, and in just a few more the achievement is there. You save and go to bed. You start the game next morning and load it ready for the sweet victory. Only problem is there's an update. You begin to sweat, knowing this might be a horrible gaming-day. You get into the game, and see that the game isn't under saved games. In horror you click on ""load outdated savegames"", and load your game. It seems fine. Phew! The day is your! The time is now! You finish conquering the isles! BUT? Theres no ach-pop-up?!? You can't see anywhere that anything is wrong, but the minor bug-fixing-update that morning, changed your savefile enough that achs doesn't count from it.... When this happens for the 3rd time, and you write Paradox if theres anything to be done about it, you recieve something along the lines of you could either (*haha*) just start over, stop playing the game (since we allrdy got your money), or simply just go f... yourself...A year later the bitterness is a distant memory, and the thrill of those sweet moment when a really hard ach is achieved begs you back. You even buy one or two of the DLC's thats come in between. The first few easy-mode games go (too) well, and you go Iron-man-mode (the setting needed for achs) and get one of the new easy or medium achs. You start one of those ""play-for-weeks"" campaigns for a hard achievement, and when closing in on it: there's a minor bug-fixing-update. The horror. The bitterness. The promise of never to give Paradox a dime again... Untill a year later, when the bitterness is a distant memory.....This cicle has repeated itself untill im closing in on 1600 hours gameplay (and thats only on number 4 in the series).So if you're willing to pay for every DLC they come with, to the point where they might as well have subscribtion, and you don't care for achievements, or getting save-games ruined (also non-ach games) every few months, and want a game you can play again and again and again and forever, this is the game you want.If you havn't allrdy been tricked into giving one of the gaming companies that gives absolutely 0 f...s about their costumers money - save it (and your frustrations) for those deserving it :)"

I just couldn't justify it to myself yet I kept defending them. The decisions they have taken in terms of their pricing are just outrageous. Their games are good but simply not worth paying 40 euro for the vanilla because playing with locked features who often really impact the game hugely, is not fun. Futhermore the DLC have now become 20 euro, that's half the price of the game!!!! If this DLC would be like half a whole new game then oke but they're not, they're simply some new feature here and there. I've bought the Guild collection (1 + 2 + DLC) and darksiders collection (1 + 2) on a THQ nordic sale for 25 euro, that's 1 DLC without even the ♥♥♥♥ing costemic add-on (who are overpriced as hell too for some new skins).All this is living in a well off western country, I cannot imagine what the guys in Russia, Brazil, etc.. must think when their price have increased up to 50%!!!!

As a rabid 4X player since the Civ2 days, I understand. I have spent 2/3 of my life loving these types of games.But one thing angered me so much that I'm just going to come down on saying I don't recommend this to an average gamer. It's that the base game has trouble standing on its own merits. A cursory google search will show how many rules have altered, which is fine, but the problem is the backwards-implementation into the base game.  For example, playing Native nations will get a mission to migrate. Except Native nations cannot migrate in the base game. The game doesn't tell you this, you need to hunt for this information. This is poor design. So I'm not up to recommend somone drop 100 or 200 dollars just to find out if they want to play the game. Thats a TCG strategy. You're better off finding a different, complete, 4X game. for 1/4 the price."

So the actual cost of the game is 134,93€ plus Mare Nostrum 14,99€ if you want it.However I would recommend to revert back to patch 1.15.1 with all the DLC up till Mare Nostrum installed. That was the most fun I have ever had with the game. It was more in-depth than ever before, there was finally meaningful content between the wars, estates are a nice addition, the development and building of provinces is great.A lot of people praise Paradox for their DLC policy, because of the ""extensive"" free content with all major DLC and the ability to roll back to previous patches. But for a game like this the ability to roll back to previous patches is mandatory as play troughs, at least for me, easily last for 50+ even I have never played through the entire timeline from 1444 to 1820. These long games would not be an issue, but most major patches brake previous saves and as I play on Ironman (1 save & 1 backup only) I would never be able to finish any campaigns if I would live a normal life outside of the game and I would play other games than this.Most major patches such as Common Sense and now Mare Nostrum introduce new major features or change existing core features in such a way that you either become handicapped if you want to play the current version without the DLC or also the AI is handicapped to make the game fair, but it feels like you are playing in the Paralympics while the normal Olympics would be constantly dangled in front of your face as a reminder to buy the DLC. In Common Sense this feature was the province development which locked the amount of buildings you could construct in each province. This meant that if you didn´t buy the DLC and wanted to survive any wars as a small nation the majority of your buildings were forts which crippled your economy.Even though I very much enjoy the game as it is in 1.15.1 I would not say that it is worth 134,93€ unless you have nowhere better to spend that kind of money. On sale the price might be reasonable or if you find the game somewhere else for less.Fanboys will give a thumbs down for any negative reviews, but I am just stating the negative sides of the game, because most reviews seem to only focus on parsing the game and the developers.Mare NostrumAs a Finn I find the cultural changes related to my culture group absolutely idiotic. Karelian is now part of the Russian culture group, Finnis are now Nordic, Estonian is part of the Baltic culture group and Finno-Ugric culture group is now just Ugric.This would be the same as making the whole Scandinavian culture group part of Germanic and renaming the mess to German.I cannot see any reason to make these terrible changes as the cultures were accurate before. I would like to know who was the idiot who came up with this idea and why it was allowed in the game.As a Finn I simply cannot recommend this patch as the cultural inaccuracy is appalling.Feelings right after Common Sense. I was not happy.The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because of Common Sense.If you buy the game you should downgrade it to Art of War or Eldorado.This used to be my favorite game but Common Sense broke the whole thing and sucked all the enjoyment out of it.It changed core gameplay features and made it so that you have a severe handicap if you do not own the DLC.Paradox why u do this to us?ConclusionBuy the game and all major DLC until Mare Nostrum on !SALE!, roll back to patch 1.15.1 and prepare for the best historical grand strategy game you have ever played."

,Not Recommended,236850,32139555,Posted: 2 June,all,Random name,"So let me start off by saying I am in the USD pricing zone for Paradox games, and as such my prices have not increased as many other countries have, and considering I own almost all the DLCs (mins Mare Noestrum, by far the worst) this price increase does not affect me. That being said, I absolutely can not recommend this game to anyone based on this exploitive price increase, in combination with the ludicrous DLC policy. When GOTY Witcher 3 costs less than Vanilla EUIV in some countries such as Brazil or Russia, you know consumer manipulation has gone too far.The game itself is fun, combining all Paradox games I have 2k+ hours in the short few years I've used steam, but I can't support a company that would outright exploit countries where purchasing power has decreased or stagnated. Nor can I support a company where their DLC policy is to publish DLCs with essential features for a price comparable to the base game itself. Mare Noestrum is a great example of this, in which you get very mediocre features and ""should be free"" GUI buffs for $20. The Mandate of Heaven also has a noticable teaser with the Ages banner at the top, and providing negative buffs like Devastation free but positive buffs like Prosperity that only come in the DLC, putting players with a smaller wallet at a significant disadvantage.Until Paradox changes course and commits to changing course, don't buy this game unless it is on sale, and if you're really committed to pro-consumer advocacy I advise not buying paradox games period.Edited to fix a few typos I noticed"

They have introduced the Immersion Pack: It's like a DLC, but instead of add content to all the game, they add content for only ONE! nation ( Russia in this case ).CONCLUSION:- The game is good, very very good, and very addictive ! But Paradox DLC policy, and what worst the new introduction of Immersion Pack, make this game NOT worth for the purchase.

The DLC policy has officially gone too far.First, it's slowly creating tons of clutter in the game UI. It's filling the screen with values and buttons. This detracts from gameplay and often developers have to go back and find better ways to display information in game.Second, the barrier for entry is high for new players. There's a mountain of mechanics in the game and they're not nearly as intuitive as they should be. I'm currently in a MPer with a new player and I'm showing him the ropes and the game is already daunting... but then when I explain that all the features he's been using in our MP game (I own all the DLC currently) doesn't work when he boots up his vanilla version, because it's locked behind several hundred dollars of DLC... is going to drive him away.It's becoming more and more difficult for players to complete a save. The suggestion from developers is to simlpy not update their game unti they're complete with their run. That's unaccepable.  A game takes a long time to play and on top of, it can take players who have strict schedules ages to finish the game.The also have a lot of unintuitive mechanics now. For example, Technology, Instiutions and Ages. They each represent a similar basket of mechanics that represent change over time for your nation and they're all sort of like tech trees.Then the like dozen revamps to older system like the idea trees. How many new mechanics are they going to cram into the available trees?TLDR: The very high cost of entry and very high learning curve is not worth the time or the effort. Go play something that doesn't require you to plop down cash every few months while simultaneously destroying your saved games."

There are so many DLCs that you're going to spend a small fortune to enjoy the game at full.

The game is awesome, there is no denying that.Then why the negative review?Because behind this heavenly game lies the devil: Paradox Games. They used to be  a small studio which made games for its own little fanbase. Today, however, they are even more greedy than EA (this is my opinion though). They have released unnecessary amounts of unnecessary DLCs, mostly for EU4. Mare Nostrum, Common Sense and the Cossacks are just a few of them. What is worse is that fundamental game mechanics are sold with these shallow DLCs. For example, if you don't own the Common Sense DLC, you cannot improve your provinces; thus the base tax, manpower and the amount of buildings you can place into a provnice stays the same of 400 years in the game.These problems existed for some time however. What really tipped me of was how they have changed their pricing policy. NOW IT COSTS 50% MORE TO BUY A GAME THAT WAS RELEASED 4 GODDAMN YEARS AGO! HOW ♥♥♥♥ING IDIOTIC IS THIS? As if the DLCs haven't already came with little content compared to their price, now we have to pay even more. I don't care how great Paradox's games may be, this is pure extortion.Unless you really, really want the game, I reccomend you to not to buy any Paradox games anymore, especially EU4.The Game: 11/10The Company: ♥♥♥♥ you/10"

To date I've purchased ~$55 worth of content for EU4. Again, that was all on good sales, the base game only cost me like $26 because I bought it in the 2013 Christmas sale. I've picked up most of the expansion packs that add game content when they were cheap since. To buy the rest today with a decent sale on (64% off for the rest of the content) it'll cost me an additional $90.22.In my opinion, once a game is 4 years old it should easily cost less than $100 for a complete edition, regardless of how much content has been made. The game is currently $200 for new people to pick up in its entirety, which is entirely too much.So do yourself a favor and don't get it. If you hate it, you'll have spent too much. And if you love it that'll be even worse, because you'll be locked into a bad relationship where you have to keep on giving and not getting much back in return."

However, the purpose of reviews is to help people deside should they buy this game or not. At this point of the game's development, and the pricing of the important, game changing DLCs, I must give a negative reccomendation.When I bought this game, there were only a handfull of important DLCs. Within a few months and a couple of sales, I managed to buy them all at a reasonable cost. There were many more DLCs which came out afterwards, and I bough all of them, many of them at release. Most of the DLCs were good, but somewhat overpriced. However, I treated this game almost as subscribtion based: the developers keep my game interesting throughout the years, and I give them $20 every few months.The problem for a new buyer is that he/she cannot take this subscription based approach, and has to pay a outrageous lump sum upfront for the full game experience. I am ok with spending $150 - $200 on this game throughout the years, but I cannot in good concience suggest a new player spending this much money at once.One might say that a new player does not need DLCs to start playing. That is true. But the new patches almost assumme that you have all the major DLCs and balance the game on that assumption. The consequence of this is that the base game is highly unbalanced. The biggest example of this is trying to play a non-western nation without the common sense DLC. It is borderline impossible to be successfull now, while it was possible to do well in one of the previous patches.If you are looking for a minimal set of DLCs to buy, I'd suggest the forementioned common sence, and art of war.If you are willing to spend an exoberant amount of money, or if you are fine with glaring imbalances, then you will probably enjoy this game very much. The centuries long time scale of the game allow you to truly feel your nation developing and evolving. The alliances suddenly breaking or standing the test of time lead to an emergent storytelling of which paradox studio is the master.Most of the reasons forsing me to give this lovely game a negative review would be eliminated if paradox would introduce most of the major DLCs in the base game itself, or a reasonably priced collection. It is mind boggling that the EUIV collection contains only the DLCs up to 2014!!!"

If you want to play it with full integrity, you'll have to pay over 150$. The normal game, which is very old, costs 40$, and I wouldn't rate it a complete game at all because so many basic things are lacking and can only be acquired from dlcs. Seriously, is upgrading ships so important that you need to make it a paid feature? The main game is almost crippled without dlcs, unbalanced, and so empty. It's probably not even close to a game experience...I do agree, some dlcs have some great features like art of war, and I can see why its priced that way. But goddamn, 3/4 of the others are just pure overpice. I could buy GTA V, a game with possibly hundreds of hours of entertainement, instead of 2 dlcs that will probably just give 10hours max. With Third Rome out, I have to say this is by far the worst of all dlcs. I get that its not meant to be a full dlc, its just to add flavour to the area.

However look at the cost of the DLC, all the major DLC costs half the total price of the game. Take it from me you do not get even close to 50% more content to the base game. In fact I would say you get an increase of about between 10-12% in content.Is that worth it most certainly not, even in a big sale it is probably not worth it.I love Paradox games especially the EU series.Though I want at this point at least to know/feel that I am playing a full game. Instead I get this horrible feeling every time they release a new set of DLC that they are taking advantage of me and others like me that support this game.So my advice to anyone that wants this game is.If you buy this game, don’t buy any additional or continued new releases of DLC.If you don’t buy, well congratulations you have almost certainly saved a huge amount of money and can buy entire games for what it would cost you to add a little to this one.Don’t support this DLC policy paradox have or it will get worse, if that is possible (just look at CK2, its getting stupid at this stage EU4 is heading the same way. People don’t expect a full new base game when Paradox can release a fraction of the content at half the price of the base game.)"

Wasting your hard-earned cash only encourages more games in the industry to introduce either completely unecessasary DLCs or DLCs that should have been in the game from the start. Not to mention, Paradox blows the prices of their games and DLCs out of proportion in order to ""meet inflation."" That is NOT how it works, someone needs to tell them this. I could name you a plethora of old strategy games way more deep and tactical than Europa Universalis IV that do not cost the same amount they did at launch. This should be an easy enough concept to understand.But these points have already been mentioned and beat to death by others, yet it is frustrating it has all fallen on deaf ears. The game itself is not great, it is not terrible or bad per se, but it is not the amazing grand strategy game I believed it would be. I blame myself for setting EU IV to such a high standard that it failed to hit any of my expectations. I had recently come out of playing Victoria II, another grand strategy by Paradox, and I loved the game's political depth. I loved tacking on smaller nations into my sphere of influence, I loved the Scramble for Africa, I loved the Opium Wars, because behind all of that was a political purpose. Every nation had an interest to act a certain way, a political motivation behind every move. Even behind the wars of Victoria II, there was deep and meaningful political purpose. In EU IV, it is about expansion, that is the only driving force behind every nation and conflict. And it gets stale after a while.I understand that the premise of Victoria and EU is different, but to me I felt that EU IV had little reason behind everything. Your cabinet feels unecessary, only a point booster, never rendering advice like actual cabinets. Diplomacy is there, but the game is focused more on war for expansion, so your options for diplomacy are limited compared to most other grand strategies. The economy is shallow, relying on you sending merchants to certain trade hubs. Though this was before the industrial revolution, there was still industry during the time spanning EU IV, but you see nothing develop. You see nothing grow. You see no infrastructure being built across your dominion. It comes to the point where you ask why you are expanding in the first place when you see nothing prosper. It feels empty.The only way to make your regions more productive is to get points and spend them. There are also buildings you can charter. But the economic and infrastructural depth in this game remains disappointingly shallow. I would not recommend you buy this game, for the broken DLC model and the shallowness of all other strategy not relating to war."

But with the advent of Common Sense, ever more ""essential"" features are in the DLC, and now with 1.18 the base game is just unplayable without it.I understand that Paradox needs to earn money somehow, and the development poored into this game is definitely laudable.

,Not Recommended,236850,32461309,Posted: 15 June,all,M E X A D D O N,"TL;DR: Paradox is like a merchant that sells you the box of a puzzle containing only the 4 corner pieces, and then procedes to tell you that if you want to see the rest of the puzzle, you need to pay individually for each one. In exchange, they promise you to work hard each week for a new puzzle piece, ensuring you they are hard to create and time-consuming. Each week, you pay the price for the new piece. At first, you are excited to see how they fit and what will it look like. Then some weeks pass and you start feeling like this wasn't such a thrill after all, playing with an incomplete puzzle. By the time you don't enjoy the game anymore, you're already hooked and can't stop paying the price of each piece until you can finally have all of it, all under the promise that it will get better once it's complete. By the time the final pieces start arriving, you've already assembled the puzzle multiple times with the pieces you had. It's at this point you realize this felt very much like a scam and feel extremely stupid for trusting someone that sells you a game in pieces.Let me put you in my personal perspective about Paradox's marketing ways:Mount and Blade: Warband, a game created by Taleworlds on a very poor engine and featuring a very poor campaign in it's release state, is nothing more than a base for the community to use it to create the best thing imaginable within the boundaries of what the engine lets them create. Taleworlds, being a tiny studio with a mediocre budget, successfully ensured that the core mechanics of every M&B worked as best as possible and that the game was ridden of bugs to ensure that not only multiplayer worked but also that content-creators would perfect the game byletting the community decide what was the best direction for it.There's only so much a dev can do to a game before it becomes too expensive to create, thus reflecting it in the final price. This in turn results in rising developers creating projects for their portfolio to help them in their future careers.[Grand Strategy game name placeholder], created by Paradox, is a game made on an engine that, after 4 years of development, still struggles to accept/run mods, can't run multiplayer without crashing or desynching constantly from other players (and don't even think on mp rounds using mods), until last year still lagged a lot when played at full speed and was prone to crashes. It took almost a year for it to even have decent loading times on an HDD. Paradox believes that they should be the only ones to decide what direction to take in a mostly-singleplayer game, and their unwanted/unexpected changes come to a heavy cost to your wallet. Paradox is a company that releases a game in a state that could easily be called ""alpha"" due to the lack of any noteworthy mechanics, and charges the player base every 6 months which is when a major patch is released, all while hiding behind a mask of underfunded, indie devs who need their fans' support to keep developing the game. They lie straight to your face by claiming these are ""expansion packs"", ignore your suggestions and delete your complaints on the forums, ruin every mod that is ever developed by constantly changing the version of the game and ultimately dismiss you as a customer. They won't even let you roll back to a previous version of the game because they releasedan extremely useful/required mechanic contained in their newest expansion pack, instead of within the patch that contains a bug/balance-fix, to play the game the way it was meant to be played from the start.In resume: don't buy from those that promise fullfillment at the end of an expensive road. Buy from those that give you that fulfillment since the beginning, or let YOU tune their product to reach that fulfillment."

If you want an opinion on just the game, you will not find that here, go read someone elses review for that, however, this is still an important read as the game is worthless without the DLC.New Content:The game has grown significantly since it’s release, the game is much, much better and more complex than it was then.  This is part of the reason that the game has been kept so alive as well, if you’re finally getting bored of the game, they drop new features on you and you feel like you’re playing through a whole new experience.  Yet, there is a con to this, and that is when you're going for achievements, there's many that because of the changes to the game are much more difficult to unlock than they were before.Free Content:Every DLC, free content in a patch is dropped alongside it.  This one SHOULD be an argument for the DLC rather than against, but sadly it cannot be.  While you are locked out of DLC features, the AI in your game is not, adding a disadvantage and annoyance to the game.  On top of that, sometimes features are essentailly replaced with a new paid feature, meaing sometimes you are essentially locked out of the ability to do things that you could before.Content Packs:This part is pretty BS, so when they drop a DLC instead of dropping the content packs as part of the DLC, they charge you separately at a pretty large price, now this isn’t as bull as the Total War franchise as this does not lock you out of playing as any countries and this stuff is a hundred percent aesthetic.  Also, you can download mods to do the same exact thing as the content packs, replacing the look of troops, portraits or adding new music.DLC In Multiplayer:This feature is great, when you are in a multiplayer game only the host has to own the DLC and then everyone playing in that lobby has access to it.  This means that if you have any friends with all the DLC and plan to play with them, you only need to purchase the base game and that’s it.Still Getting A Bang For Your Buck:As you’ll see looking through these reviews, lots of people have hundreds or thousands of hours in the game, so even after spending 154.91 USD you still come out positive in a dollar per hour system.Constantly On Sale:The base game and dlc all go on sale very often, so I’d recommend picking them up then, you can easily cut that 154.91 USD into about 50 USD, however, this still does not excuse the game, as when a new DLC drops you have to wait months if you want to pick it up at a discounted price.I highly recommend this game, especially if you have friends who are into it.  The DLC model is BS, but not enough for me to NOT recommend this game, it does not ruin the game like Total War’s DLC does."

Pricing a 4 year old game at 39.95 is bold. tons of DLC expansions priced at 15-20 euro's a pop is just crazy. If you want the whole thing... get ready to spend 200 euro+- The fact that in many cases the playability of the game actually reduces with the patch accompanying a new DLC release...if you don't buy the DLC expansion.- There are just too many expansions. And while they do add fun new dimensions to the existing games. They are just not worth the high prices they ask for it. Now even more than before since they increased the prices on them (a lot).So... in short. Paradox games are fun, and worth the investment... if you can get the game at like 5-10 euro and DLC at 1-3 euro a pop."

This is because of a few things.1) Balance2) DLC3) Stupid leave game system4) Botched alliance and favour system5) CoalitionsFirst of all the balance, this game has the entire world for you to play as but most of time will be in europe. Why? Well faster gameplay stronger units on average as well as more and bigger events than anywhere else. This leads to the balance complaint. First of all if Castille decides to it can easily conquer most of Northern Africa then inherit Aragon and possible Naples very early game. Meaning they can quickly expand into Italy and lower parts of Africa. This then leads to the alliances complaint as it is entirely possible for Castille to have both Austria and France as allies meaning the main defence for Africa (Ottoman Empire) is not going to last very long especially with Poland and Lithuania glaring at them as well. A united India would struggle to push back a European power as well.The DLC in this game while it did come out very slowly and only the host needs it is a gauling ammount. Another complaint with this is the unbalancing that Common Sense originally brought with it which if not purchased allowed the AI to develop their provinces making them much better while you couldn't without the DLC. The alliance system in the Cossacks was a step in the right direction for curbing the use of powerful nations for rapid expansion but it does not seem to have an option for 'I am attacking your rival, please help me curb their power', which I have found it to be rather annoying. Some of the features do feel like they should have been in the base game anyway such as the ability to swap occupations which came with the art of war DLC.More of an annoyance than an actual complaint but the game shuts down briefly and reloads if you quit the game you were in. At least it is a step forward from the previous method of locking you out of multiplayer if you were going to go play with a friend.The alliance system as mentioned before does need some work still. This because you can have all the powerful nations in the same area all allied with each other which basically means game over. I have seen this with Scandanavia - France - Commonwealth which was proberly the most annoying, Russia - Ottomans - Austria - Papal State, this one was daft. Britain - Austria - Castille - Aragon, is a more recent one I have seen. I would say this makes it interesting but they will quickly become immortal and just keep expanding everywhere.The coalition system, now this is a huge pain. Largely because the AI never seem to get them. I have seen France take over huge portions of land in Germany in single wars and not have any back lash for it. Normally it is measured through development but since it is Germany the average values are quite high and can easily cause a coalition. I have taken 3 provinces and caused a world war to kick off over it."

76561198026250470,Recommended,236850,34939459,Posted: 13 September,all,Dorander,"There's a bit of a difficulty with reviewing a game like this, because its DLC has changed its functionality immensely, and while I absolutely love the base concept of the game I do not recommend all DLC... even though most of it is in fact pretty good.It is worth noting that at the time of writing I have over 1600 hours of playtime in this game. Actual playtime. This is the game I can't leave lying around. If I have nothing else that I can think of doing, I start another game of EU4. If I have other things to consider doing, sometimes I still start another round of EU4. Whilst in setup quite similar to the Total War games, this game beats them for me by a mile because I *don't* have to do each battle manually for good results. I've played various Total War games as well and while it's awesome being able to outmaneuver the AI it also gets boring having to do that same trick over and over again. This game does not bother with the battle micromanagement and some will consider that a bonus, some a malus.Comparison aside for those unfamiliar with either the Europa Universalis or Total War series: you play a country on the map of (at the start of the gameplay anyway) Europe, starting in 1444 and ending in 1821. So, your time is limited, and your goal is to generate as a high a score as possible by turning your country into an economic, diplomatic and military powerhouse. Enter the main problem: this is not immediately obvious. In fact, I don't even recall exactly when I finally realized the game had a scoring system. I played it the way I imagine everyone plays who sees a strategy game like this: What are we going to do tonight? The same thing we do every night Pinky... trying to take over the world.And here's the immediate issue with the otherwise good DLC additions: much of the DLCs and patches that came with them, seem focused on making it more difficult for you to take over the world, but provide other methods by which you can increase the in-game scoring system. And I am not ashamed to say it was at this point that I actually realized that the game had this scoring system at all.I will touch on the eternal DLC release that Paradox obviously employs to make money in a simple statement. Yes, they aim to make money by providing ever more DLC to improve the gameplay and add more functionality, most of which is quite enjoyable. However they also provide the simple ability to play earlier release versions which work just fine, don't bother with the new changes/additions, and leave you entirely able to play an awesomely entertaining game without buying all the DLC. I never felt like the game's DLC provided functions that it absolutely needed in the first place to be fun. It was always a fun game for me.So, what's the game actually about? Well you pick a country on the map that existed in historic 1444 (or create your own if you have the DLC for it), that country has certain national bonuses that match its history, and you play through the next 400 or so years. The game follows historical patterns, in that some historical events have chances of happening, countries will generally behave as they did historically towards allies/enemies, the historical powerhouses tend to be just that... and in the middle there's you. The player. The wild card. The one who has the greatest impact on how the game will NOT follow the course of history.It is worth mentioning that I never fully appreciated the brilliance of this game until I started playing in Ironman mode. Ironman mode gives you ONE save file. You declare a war, it saves. You negotiate a peace, it saves. A month passes, it saves. You quit the game, it saves. And every time it overwrites the same file, so no backsies (unless you alt+F4 the game, a trick known as ""Save scumming""). Ironman mode teaches you that your actions have consequences, and it means your playthrough can get ruined.... but that also means it's ever so much more exciting. When you don't get savepoints, when you don't get to undo things, everything you do in your playthrough just matters so much more.The basics of the gameplay is simple. You are a country (or part of one), you have an income based upon the taxes, production value and trade value your provinces generate. With this money you can field an army, improve the wealth (and thus income) of your provinces, hire advisors that help you generate monarch points (a ""currency"" required to improve your nation, develop technological advancements and national ideas that provide tangible bonuses), bribe allies (or enemies!) and as a result of all that expand the territory of your fledgeling empire... but beware, because expanding will anger your neighbours, their allies, their friends and their cat.At the end, Europa Universalis IV is a game that is easy to start with but hard to master. Beyond the mechanics of running your nation there's the historical mechanics, mechanics of how AI typically behaves as each country values different things/territories, a trade system that's impossible to wrap your head around in actual playthrough there is a host of other details that I am forgetting, some of which I realized far too late and left me with a sense of ""Ooooh, is THAT how that works!"" even after my first few hundred hours. And that is disregarding the additions the DLC parts will bring.The only downside worth noting is that you may not want to install the latest version if you don't own the DLC to make use of it. The game has the annoying tendency to introduce new features in the latest patch that you can't make use of unless you have the DLC but will affect your game as the AI can make use of the mechanics. It's a bit of a hamfisted way of encouraging people to pay, but the game lets you install earlier versions easily enough and I would recommand doing that if you do not like some of the newer systems. I will say it again, DLC brought some improvements and made some things harder but the base game is worth it either way."

For a game that is 4 years old. Shame on you, Paradox.TLDR: Developers drown the game in insane amounts of (mostly) overpriced DLCs, then they decides to double the price of both the game and DLCs. Avoid like plague."

,Not Recommended,236850,32503148,Posted: 17 June,all,Rapier NCC1701E,"Ok, look. This game is actually really good. It exels in certain elements, such as the actual strategy of playing the game. if I were gonna rate it just on the factor of it's appeal to a grand strategy gamer alone, it would be an 8/10. But I can't do that. Let's go more in-depth.First off, some of the pros. Like I said, EU4 exels in playability-well, in some areas. If you play as a country like England, France, Castille, or Muscovy, you may have a really good time, conquering your neighbors and building up a great economy. It provides an interesting challenge, however, to start off in 1444 as, say Brandenburg. It was much harder than playing as a major, but actually alot more fun.Second in the pros is the time period. You can play from the mid-1400s to the early 1800s, covering a massive amount of time and giving you enough in game to conquer all of eurasia, and, if you decide to be a colonial power, the americas, africa, and oceania.Third is the challenge presented in the game. Like I said, you can play over a massive perioud of time, but, however, unlike certian Paradox games, it is very likely you may die very quickly if you are too aggressive too early. The AI, of course, isn't the best, but it works pretty well.Now, time to rain on the parade. This con I think will be able to overshadow nearly every upside I just listed. It is....THE $300+ OF DLC.Paradox is well known for having insanely overpriced DLC for insanely watered down content. Now, don't get me wrong, after seeing some reviews, I actually found that several of the DLCs were good. IT IS JUST THE INSANE OVERPRICING OF THEM THAT RUINS IT. More than 75% of it, if not ALL the DLC, should just be included in the base game via an update. It really ruins the experience for gamers who 1) see YouTubers playing it and then realizing they cant ave the same experience as them unless the blow $70 or 2) People who want the ""full experience"" yet cannot afford to pay $150 for unit reskins and diplomatic options. It's sad.Paradox is very obviously just trying to make a quick buck with all of this DLC. Some of them may be bugged to hell, some of them may add cool features, but don't expect anything grand from EU4 DLC. The majority of them are watered downed troop reskins, diplomatic options, and govvernment types, something I can find on the workshop, with the click of a mouse.Hopefully this will help new buyers to not get sucked into the money-pit that is purchasing DLC, I think the base game itself is pretty good, but it almost seems now that DLC is required for a good experience.I rate 6.5/10."

Easy to learn, difficult to master. On its own, it's a great game. I will probably play it after writing this.HOWEVER, Paradox's business practices regarding price points and its absurd volume of DLC are Exhibit A of the cynicism of the game industry at large in our times and should not be supported with fresh cash.

As a devoted fan to the EU franchise I find myself more and more disenchated with the course Paradox has chosen to take with its games. The problem is that Paradox creates a game that becomes fundementally incomplete due to the overwhelming amounts of DLC that add hundereds of dollars to an already expensive game. I'd much rather pay 80$ from release for a video game that is guarunteeing me future content, rather than the uncertainty that Paradox supplies to their dedicated consumer base. The company lures you into the game by enforcing limited chunks of the paid-for exclusive features of their games and in the end makes this massive, complex video game shrink with each patch. So, as a hardcore strategy fan, EU4 player and gamer I find myself forced to tell my friends to turn away from the game so as not to be trapped like the rest of us in a pool of greed and corporate baiting.

I looked into what was happening, it turns out that Rights of Man ruler traits were causing my ruler to cost more points, however it didn't show me the traits as I didn't have that DLC, thus meaning I would have to close and reopen the nation designer as there is no complete randomisation of your ruler.

Over time however, too many ingredients were added to the pot. For every good step we got, there were 2 steps back. At some point past El dorado, it was all downhill from there.*peers down at the dlc list*$368.63 Canadian monies currently (Rainbow maple money i know). SOME OF THOSE DLCS HAVE INCREASED IN PRICE SINCE LAUNCH!? WHAT!? (0/0/1 leader at paradox confirmed).No you don't have to buy them all, there's optional stuff...but come on. 368 monies. Come on Sweden, i need that money to fund diversity in my country to destroy my culture and replace my people!Remember when France was actually terrifying like it actually was in history? It was fun trying to survive this boss like entity throughout the years in earlier versions. Now it is super cucked and weak, just like its modern counterpart.This applies to many of the nations in this game. Throughout Paradox's dlc spamming, almost everyone became same strength tier. Everyone and their mom became westernized 1/3rd of a campaign in. Through Swedish multicultural revisionism- Africans, american natives, chinese, indians became same strength of western european nations, or even stronger with almost no effort. Even without westernization, in newer patches nations are hilariously close in tech level.This makes the game's name completely hollow. Westernization used to be a considerable and lengthy process, to ensure your spear chuckers could survive invaders with guns. Now its laughable easy with no consequences or hardships in doing so.  ""I survived french/english/portugese/spanish colonization"" is nothing now.When you colonized some barren wasteland with your people, and made a functional society out of this land, It would be your people's culture...because they live there and built everything. But post diversity patch its now native people land! You have to spend already non existent point mana to change it! YOU SPENT THE TIME AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ♥♥♥♥ING CITIES AND NEW COUNTRIES OUT OF NOTHING WITH YOUR PEOPLE! Now your colonial nation has 10+ cultures that arent yours by default, despite all your work.Core costs out the wazoo, the devs encouraged ""building tall"". Punishing you for your evil expansionist ways! They'd rather you put the game on speed 4-5 and click a button when money gets high enough to make more money. Unless you play a certain nation of a certain religion, then you can bring enrichment to europe for almost no cost...just like modern times!Eventually there was enough austistic screeching for a dlc for china after years of not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only to realize the bland truth about playing with mings....which lead to more screeching.There was the fort zone debacle, making ai even dumber, and taking ages to make it work properly. whether you liked it or not This slowed the game down considerably.The eras of no common sense and cash hacks were equally frustrating, As was art of waaagh and rights of (wo)men. Each one was a mixed bag of joys and sorrows.Third rome aka slav dome, is the newest barebones wallet puncher. As per the store page its the ""FIRST"" immersion pack! They're going to make more....I can hear their hands rubbing together from across the atlantic!Good luck getting some of the achievements unless you cheat and game your way to get it. What used to be possible gets locked out with further patches.Once proud and mighty, now pathetic and weak. This game represents what happens when Sweden shoves a terrible ideology into everything, and then tries to make everyone else fund their suicide pact."

First let's talk about the product itself, it's a grand strategy game situated betwen the years 1444 and 1821, and it has everything you'll want on a game of this characteristics. Now, on to the real issue that kills this game, the DLC's.Europa Universalis IV has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of DLC's for something as basic as developing your provinces, making your ruler abdicate or beign able to see the timelapse of your game when it ends or create your custom nation. There are tinnier DLC's that are cosmetic changes and music changes, like the Sabaton Soundtrack, but those are cheap and do not affect in the gameplay mechanics themselves. In short, by buying EU4 without any DLC's is like buying half a game, and the DLC's that complete it are not cheap. A triple AAA game costs 60/70€, this game if you want to get the full experience will cost you  204.99€ and it's still going up.As a business point of view this is perfect, specially for the type of game they are creating, Europa Universalis is a game that new players won't come constantly, so by giving a half finished game and then adding new content by DLC's worth 20€ and then giving the cosmetic content pack that it should come with separately you milk the veteran player's wallet and your game becomes profitable for a long time. But, for a consumers perspective this is awfull. I personally would preffer to pay 60€, even 100€ for the full game than having to pay 20€ every time a new DLC comes out, because it's not a DLC that adds new content, it adds mechanics for certain countries that should already be in the game like the Mandate of Heaven for China and different mechanics for religions already in the game or things as simple as developing your provinces.For a new player that has a lot of money and is willing to spend it on a grand strategy game, I recomend EU4. For a new player that does not have that ammount of money, do not even buy it there are more cheap options than this one."

,Not Recommended,236850,33259420,Posted: 4 July,all,Pixel,"Once upon a time I pre-ordered this game and set aside time on the day of its release to play it for hours. I had loved EU3 before and sunk a lot of time into it. And as you can see, I sunk a lot of time in EU4 as well. As much as the constant DLC annoyed me, I liked the game enough to tag along.EU4 offers something many other games don't. It touches on an underappreciated period in human history, it has deeply fleshed out mechanics for non-Europeans making it fun to play in Africa, Asia, or the Americas - and even if it were just Europe there is hundreds of hours of gameplay sitting here. That is, if you're willing to pay for the game and a handful of DLCs just to make it playable. But honestly, if DLC was my only problem with this game then I would have recommended it inspite of them.Maybe what I say here doesn't make much sense given my 470 hours in the game - but I think it should be understood that the game has changed SO MUCH over those 470 hours, spread over several years, that it's nothing similar anymore. I don't feel like I can recommend EU4 in its current state. Which is sad, honestly.EU4 is just a frustrating experience for me. I noticed it when I first played, wrote it off as just me not being good at the game, and kept going. But then recently, I went back to play EU3, and I had a much more enjoyable (less frustrating) experience. I'll break down why.- EU4 has so many arbitrary limits to everything you do that have little or no relation to something in real life. Despite its depth and complexity it is hardly a realistic game. Because of these arbitrary limits, diplomacy makes no sense. Combat makes no sense. Furthermore, it does a horrible job of explaining to you why you lost a battle (seriously the most common question that often has no answer) why the AI won't accept your offer, and why marrying someone is the same thing as controlling their government. Now I don't need a game to be realistic to enjoy it, but it needs to have reasons for things and explain itself to you. I don't think its unfair to play a game about history and try to use a thought process based on what you know about history to try and achieve your goals in a world that's created to be as close to history as possible while still playable. You can't do this in EU4 - you have to think around the game's arbitrary terms.- EU4 has a large number of luck-based mechanics that make huge impacts. Luck and random chance are totally okay in a video game, but in EU4 they are not just minor things you have to adapt for once in a while - they are major consequences or rewards that completely change the way you have to play the game. Chances are that if you lost a battle, it's because you got bad dice rolls. There's nothing you can do to influence those rolls, you just gotta hope your general is good and pretty much never attack without outnumbering the enemy several times over and in favorable terrain. I also can't say I like the 'you rolled poorly' excuse for making me lose. Tell me a good reason why I lost. This is what I mean, the game doesn't explain itself to you. The worst of all has to be the monarch power system however. In CK2 you can have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ king but its okay because you can actually influence his skills and abilities and he will change and grow with time. This is not the case in EU4 - he is born with a set of randomly-generated stats and that's (most likely, there are some unusual circumstances) how he will be until he dies. Or, you can play a republic and be overpowered because you can upgrade your king's stats every few years. Now to be fair this situation is a little bit better now than it was at EU4's launch but the features that alleviate it are behind DLC paywalls. I have those DLCs and it's still stupid.- Meanwhile, things that in real-life made huge impacts on the success or failure of a country matter very little in EU4.This leads to every action, big or small, in EU4 being risky and stressful with little to no payoff, and as a result I don't enjoy it anymore. Every now and then I get the urge to play EU4 - I read about a cool country or a cool historical event or period in that country and EU4 is the only game that would let me experience it. But every time I try again I only get about 20 minutes out of it until I remember why I stopped playing and put the game down again for another few months - in the meantime another DLC has come out and all my saves and mods are outdated and it feels even more pointless to keep playing.Some minor nitpicks:- EU3 was immersive in a way, you felt like the king of a country in the 1600s that was expanding in the Americas (or whatever). Eu4 feels very distinctively like a game, and at that point I might as well go play Civ6. Part of the reason for this I think is the ""improved"" graphics (that require mods in order to look less disgusting)- There is little to do in the game besides constantly wage war. All the ""peaceful"" mechanics are pretty much just busywork and tedious micromanagement. To be honest, I don't find warfare in these games compelling enough to be the only thing I should be focusing on. Especially when it's such a frustrating and tedious affair in these games.- You can succeed on Very Hard. You can do the Three Mountains achievement on Very Hard. But what all those runs have in common is they, to some extent, take advantage of some gamey exploit or break the game in some fashion.EDIT: Despite these things, if you like strategy games and you like history, you would probably like EU4. Like I said, it has something unique about it. You can play as any country and they all at least maintain the illusion of being unique and well-researched, with their own event chains and unique idea groups and cultural/religious groups. And for a while this illusion will work and you'll think of how awesome it is that this game lets you play as Songhai and relive the golden age of Timbuktu one session and then learn about medieval Vietnam the next. But eventually you realize that every country pretty much plays the same, the 'unique' aspects are formulaic and feel artificial. The most interesting, unique, and natural moments in this game come from the event chains unique to each country. So yeah. You can play hundreds of countries in EU4, but they're all pretty much clones of each other with the exception of those that got their own 20 dollar expansion, like Russia and the Far East."

I referenced starting on day 1 with 100% base game. now we may be around 50% base game.DLC's should be *optional* and *add* to the game, not take features from the game, rebrand them then resell them to us.I paid for 100% base game, not 50%.If you want EU4 to be a subscription model game, then set a monthly fee Paradox."

This is espcially prevalent for a game that seems to overtime get updated only to become worse and less playable.

You can tell they have a lot of respect for the historical material, and there's quite a lot to learn from the game about how Europe became the center of the world by the 19th century. I'm still impressed every time I fire up the game. Anyone with an interest in history and grand strategy will really enjoy it.Now, the dlc policy must be addressed:It's disgraceful, and strains the otherwise excellent relationship between the publisher and the community.

A huge discouragement from getting any of them or really getting into the game in general mostly because key features that you would need to play or an optimal exeperince are locked behind paywalls. For example institutions have a modifier slowing down or speeding up spread speed depending on the levels of development present in an area. However the ability to raise your devolpment levels is locked behind DLC forcing the player to slog through at a disadvantage all because of this. Features  that are staples in other Paradox games are also locked away such as kill counts in wars.Overall making the game very hard to recommend for new players as much fun as it is because the DLC policy is so horrible. Even if you were to buy all the current DLC there is NO guranntee that an update would come along with some ground breaking mechanic that would be severly crippled and the only way to remove the handicap would be another DLC.

I dont know who has more DLCs: this or the sims series. Just like EA the creators of EU IV have created a TON of overpriced DLC that either 1. should have been included in the base game or 2. been inlcuded with more content and cheaper price. I paid $40 for an imcomplete game, and i am not going to throw more money at this company just so I can get it.Reason 2: the updates. buyer beware for the updates WILL make your last save unplayable. I had spent about 20 hours on a game, and had conquered Novgorod and my neighbors and became A powerhouse Russia. I tried to open up my game but it pretty much said that i couldnt continue ( forgive me for not remembering what it said, this happened some time ago, but long story short I couldnt continue that game) and it ruined the exsperience for me. I had spent HOURS on this one game, watched my world develop, and have it all end because of an update. and guess what? the update was because of a new DLC you could throw away money for. Now their may have ( or may not) have been a way for me to continue that game but still, this is a FULLY RELEASED game. NOT an early access game where that sort of thing is common place and somewhat exspected. The devs could have found some workaround for this but they dont seem to really care.Reason 3: some aspects need polishing and fixing. Like the combat system. The game gives absolutely no exsplanation for how it works, so get ready to rely on others through youtube videos or forums on how to learn this game, because the devs could care less to put a legitimate tutorial in their game. Combat is just a numbers and luck game. its unintuitive and feels more like a game of risk. The AI will also jump around all over the place avoiding combat and being a real pain. Some people give this off as ""Guirella Warfare"", which could be understandable if it was a rebellion or weaker ai, but powerull invaders will do this too. They will run off and avoid combat if it knows it will most likely lose, and there is no way to tell an army of yours to pursue them, so you will have to constanly micormanage them to follow and hopefully intercept them, or else the small (or large) army with be a pain and go try to capture territories far from the battle in places where it is pointless. There are many other problems that I have encountered, but this is getting a little longReason 4: as somewhat mentioned above the tutorials are majorly lacking and their are no guides at all ( they should of had something like in civilization IV, where their was a catalog of everything ingame with stats, instruction, and even some historical info. I remember sometimes just reading this history book in a game for hours at a time. This is an example of a grand strategy game at its finest). Some people might say that the game is meant to be learned while you play but no. that is for games that arent so complex and that guide you along the way some. This game just throws you in a lake and exspects you to do backstrokes right off. Its sad when you half to rely on the games community to teach you how to play because the actual devs couldnt be bothered to put anything toghether to help the player.Final verdict:5/10I would reccomend buying this game on sale ( if it ever is cheap) or not at all unless you plan on spending a fortune and playing in larger sessions since these updates can break your save game"

Also, most of the features that are required to actually play the game well are behind a paywall, with the negatives for not using them added in a free (required to play) patch.

But PDX's move with increasing prices compelled me to do so - to stand with the community and voice my protest.My model with purchasing DLCs was: when DLC comes out, watch youtubers play it and decide if I want it myself, wait until 2 more DLC come out, buy the one I want with a discount.I was really looking forward to Rights of Man as this was one of the DLCs that I liked as opposed to Mare Nostrum, Cossacks, Mandate of Heaven or Third Rome. So I patiently waited until Third Rome and then learned that PDX decided to sneakily increase prices on their games.True, in Ukraine we still get one of the cheapest prices so I can't complain too much. But google ""list of European countries by average wage"" and take a look at the map. So I do not know what ""purchasing power increase"" PDX is talking about if full-priced RoM costs 10% of an average monthly income. To address the claim that the price changed because of currency devaluation - we have games priced in USD, so this does not apply. Regardless of a national currency value it will still be $15.And this is all in a country where piracy is considered normal and is a common occurance. Great move there PDX to stimulate people actually buying games.CEO said on forums that they'll be reverting the prices after Steam Summer Sale, but for now I'll leave this review here to see how things develop."

However as the release version progressed to here, the game has been utterly ripped out of features included in free patches with paid DLC.Now it wouldn't be a problem if the DLC were rich with ocntent and a great price for the content. It used to be that way. The game used to be playable without most of the DLC. That is no longer the case sadly. It all really started during the ""development scheme"" in EU4. The DLC ""Common Sense"" Ironically named as such, introduced a feature of developing provinces. Now the DLC itself was a good addition, but the way it was implemented was the beginning.Basically if you had the DLC you could develop provinces using Monarch Points like the AI. If you didin't, you were out of luck, while the AI could build high; you weren't given that option without forking over the money.Now afterwards, the DLC content began to decrease in overall value. And subsequently, Paradox began to raise DLC prices as well. So it was a double whammy to devoted fans of the company.By this point their reputation is ruined. ESPECIALLY with HOI4 DLC, but that's for another review. Now the CEO, apparently(his name is Fred something), has stated that they will be rolling back DLC prices. That's all well and good, but he said nothing about increasing the content of those DLC. It's all good to decrease the prices, but I'd pay even $60 if the DLC went above and beyond the call price. But sadly, the DLC being released is worth about 2-3 dollars now adays. There are some cool features added, but they're not worth 10$ for two simply added features, like Siberian expansion and finally Orthodox Religion reworks.Now I'm not bashing the game, as I enjoy it to death. It truly is worth the money. But if the company is going to jack up prices and then cover their butts afterwards, at least just admit you're trying to be greedy. I'd actually have a hell of a lot of respect if they just admitted it.I'm sick of companies trying to hide that they are. We all know they are, some are just less greedy than others, or actually make respectable prices. Paradox is neither now. They used to be both, but now they're neither. And they can't even admit it. The CEO has to hide behind words of a ""Mob mentality"" for blatant mistakes he's made about DLC policies. It's a shame, because I used to like Paradox a lot, but $270 for a game, and increasing is just too much.DLC to get:Everything before Cossacks, Common Sense is arguable. Get those DLCs, only when they're on sale, and you're golden. The game is extremely fun in that state.Sadly, the review is for the whole game, and for $270, the content is not enough. It used to be, but Paradox, you've failed. You let Greed get to your heads, and you can't even admit it.If you just admit that you were wrong, and you got too greedy, a lot of people will respect you more(of course after you rectify your blatant greediness). But, you'll probably just continue down the path.So Fred, this is for you. Fix your company, or your stocks will become useless."

It takes historical entities from 1444 - 1820 and puts them locked in a battle to shape the history of the world. The game is more about empire management than combat. Combat is mostly dice rolls between two competing armies. But when it comes to how detailed the empire management portion is, you can't get much better.There's a lot of depth in the game with diplomacy (forming/breaking alliances, wars, assisting the enemies of your enemies, etc.), you can colonize the new world, spread your religion around the world, turn all of France into a Moorish paradise, or one of hundreds of different things.The game gets really interesting when you play one of the non-European nations and you struggle with lagging technology late-game and have to try to make up for the deficiencies of your culture when Western colonialists come knocking at your door. It's a game with endless possibilities and lots of challenge for the player who is willing to invest the dozens (sometimes hundreds) of hours into a single game.All of this goodness is offset by Paradox's DLC/content policy. It has recently begun carving up its newer games into unfinished products and selling off nice little added chunks as DLC and content packs. Some of the items are as simple as unit models (many of which the modding community do themselves as well), some with more complex gameplay changes. EUIV has lagged behind Crusader Kings II in implementing a system of allowing you to choose which aspects of the DLCs you buy you want to incorporate into the game. For example, I hate colonial nations, but I'm locked into them, even if I turn off the DLC that supposedly contains that particular content. Parts of the DLC get patched in for free, but the meat of it gets locked behind the DLC content. It's a shame that such a good game, and what was previously such a great company, has started to act more and more like a AAA company. If they are truly worried about cost, they should charge more up front for a more finished game and add substantial changes to the game that alter its course more efficiently. Games like Crusader Kings II and Hearts of Iron IV are also starting to feel this policy. Stellaris, being a new IP, will probably follow suit on its second iteration (if it ever gets one).While I enjoy the game, I cannot recommend it until Paradox stops behaving in a way that takes its customer base for granted. Using its loyal fanbase to churn out money for DLC/content that should be in the game already or given for free (considering the whole point of the game is historical accuracy) is starting to wear on me. I didn't even buy HoI 4 because I waited for the reviews and lot of them said it was carved up quite a bit. Please, Paradox, stop doing this. Let your games sell themselves. Go back to being a company of quality entertainment instead of a company of greed. EUIV deserves better, for us fans and for yourself."

(Wasn't increased for me but it was still a♥♥♥♥♥♥move)I'm still leaving a negative review because of their DLC policy. With every major DLC release they accompany it with a free update containing the basic version of the features found in the DLC, this however completely breaks the game until you, you guessed it, buy said DLC. So you end up with either an empty wallet because you have to keep up with all the DLC's, or you have to keep playing on an older version of the game.If you would ask me how I would tackle this issue, I wouldn't have a slightest clue.

I also have over 1,000 hours into Crusader Kings 2. They're both INCREDIBLE games that if judged independently of all other factors are my favorite games of all time.With that out of the way, the ENTIRE reason I'm writing this review now, is because I can no longer recommended it due to what seems to be a -STUPID- corporate cash grab. The DLC policy and their refusal to reduce prices. Beyond that, they've just given a price INCREASE to the expansions by bundling them the ALREADY over priced content packs. Not to say that the expansions were reasonable either.This game should come in at a base cost of 19.99 considering how old it is. With how unplayable the base game is without their expansions? It should, without joking, be 4.99. No more. That's even a stretch. Selling unusable products isn't anything new to Paradox though, as get this. One of the DLCs they sold for Crusader Kings 2, was the save game converter which allowed you to bring your CK2 save to EU4. Well, at one expansion, many years ago, the functionality broke. Has it been patched yet? I have no idea! It's been so long I've given up hope of even trying it again. The kicker? YOU HAVE TO BUY THE CONVERTER. You can STILL buy it. It DOESN'T WORK by a patch Paradox introduced to break it.Totally. Unacceptable.While EU4 has it's hooks in me, and I'll keep buying their garbage, overpriced DLCs chalked full of content that should be included for free. This very policy is replicated in game after game for Paradox. From Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron, Stellaris, Victoria. Each and every one of these titles has this broken DLC strategy, and terrible pricing. The games are released with key features PURPOSESLY stripped out to feed you with later in the form of overpriced DLCs. Because the base game is lacking features, it's ALSO over priced at release, and only changes when it's on sale. The DLC has a key feature for improving the game buried in it and a bunch of garbage to force you to buy the game at the price they tell it, not the price it's worth.Paradox is as reasonable as the Democratic Party in the US. Cheating their own supporters and then telling them to shut up and fall in line. Paradox, you saw what that got the Democrats last year, you want to suffer the same backlash? As a long term player of your games starting with Hearts of Iron 2, I'm now sick of this strategy and about to leave your future titles to the dust bin of history."

(Where most 4-year old games start having deep discounts to them.)  Where the wheels -really- start falling off is with the DLC: the general trend over time is to make it harder and harder (or slower and slower) to expand.While some DLC add 'ease of play', many start making the game unbearable unless you buy them to make the 'free' changes that are implimented with the patch workable.  (Examples: if you aren't in Europe, don't load the Rights of man patch!  If you don't own Mandate of Heaven, you might want to stay away from Asia because there is a 1000dev giant there in 1444.)Bottom Line: it is a great game if you bought into it a couple years ago.  Now?  Way overpriced, especially if you want to 'catch up' to all the DLC (then 'way overpriced' is a huge understatement)."

Paradox: If it's not broken, don't fix it. And better yet, stop creating 250 dollars worth of DLC that addsso little for so much.

,Recommended,236850,10879239,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,Captain Butthurt,"Well, where to begin... It's a rather complicated task to explain what this game is to somebody, who never touched any other Paradox Grand Strategy game. It's probably better to begin with most popular tags:- Grand Strategy : Grand - for there's whole world to play with ( both explored and uncolonized ) - several hundreds of provinces with their cultures, taxes, production, trade power, etc. Strategy - well, because it is one. It's Real Time Strategy, pausable by hitting space or by tinkering ""smart pause"" options - game will automatically pause when specified by you or default ""trigger"" events fire (like another country declaring war on you, etc).- Historic : Game covers time period from 1444 to 1821, possibility to start playing any day between. Default ""timemarks"", offered to player are rather historically accurate, with actual leaders in charge of their nations, pre-existing alliances and other diplomatic relations, etc. Amount of research done by Paradox is impressive. But once you start your game and unpause it, weirdest stuff can happen, like AI-controlled Poland taking over Europe, lol.- Simulation : Game engine takes into consideration MASSIVE amount of data and processes it simultaneously ( diplomacy, economics, religion, stability, rebels, trade, research, national ideas, terrain, army commander skill, etc,etc ). What is pleasantly surprising, and frankly - shocking - is how despite having so much information to work with, player is saved from micromanagement by smart UI design ( which only is getting better with updates ). You don't have to babysit every province or army (unless there is serious battle nearing, in which case it's only natural to pay more attention to your soldiers, lol), observe multiple tradenodes or dig into complicated UI for some basic info. Everything you need can be accessed by 1-2 LMB clicks, and UI itself can be easily configured to suit your needs. Gameplay is actually relaxing, once you understand basic concepts.- Sandbox : Because nothing restrict your moves and imagination by handicapping you. You just start a new game, pick a nation ( btw, you can pick ANY nation on map - from giants like France to smallest african tribes) and voila - you are completely free in your actions. IMO best example for this would be playing as Irish lord : you can go ""classic"" way of forming Kingdom of Ireland first, Great Britain - later, or pull off crazy stunts like rushing exploration national ideas, exploring and colonizing Americas way before other European nations and moving your capital there.There is some kind of ""missions"" which you can go after - but nothing MAKES you complete them. They are mostly aimed at ""historically accurate"" playthroughs for those new to that nation\EU4 and are there to hold hands of newbs who are usually shocked by lack of any kind of ""corridor"" they are used to.For those who want to compare EU4 to other games:- Crusader Kings 2 : EU4 is overall more complicated, mostly centered on country simulation instead of that semi-RPG gameplay of CK2. Leaders here are placeholders with 3 basic stats, and you don't get attached to them like you do in CK2 (I still remember my afro-Tzar Putiata of Russia from my 2013 playthrough, lol)- Total War series : It's RTS, less graphooney and combat is calculated in the background, and player has no way to influence the outcome, other than deciding initial army composition, hiring high-skill commander, choosing battles wisely and rushing additional armies into provinces, where battle occurs.It may seem dumb at first, but there are a LOT of charming underwater stones that you HAVE to consider : different optimal army composition that depends on tech group of your nation, your current military technology level, etc; picking right terrain to fight on - countless options.All in all:PROS- Everything stated in ""tags"" part- Huge replayability- Huge amount of content to discover and learn.- Fair DLC policy : they are well worth the money, big part of them gets patched into game for free for everyone else, multiplayer game host can be the only one with all DLCs - game counts everyone who connected as if they had same DLCs as host has.- Almost bugless (unless new DLCs\patches are introduced - even those are fixed pretty quick)- ModsCONS- Tutorial is... lacking. But paradox strategies are well know for that, so it might turn into a feature one day, lol. Seriously, read the wiki or watch letsplays. Learning curve is steep.- It's sometimes hard to establish a good multiplayer game with pub strangers - most are leaving pretty quickly.P.SIf you need any guidance on this game - feel free to add me and ask questionsUPDATE 25.11.16Still a solid thumb's up - every DLC they introduced added something significant and fun to play with. This game is as lively as it was on release, and aged really well into fall 2016."

In my opinion the game is one of the best strategy games of all time.Gameplaywise it is quite unique.I still can't recommend buying it...____________________________________________DLC:Yes, I know that this is a review for the base game. However I think it is important to know about dlc and dlc-politics before buying a game.important note:Till now  8 major dlcs have been released for the game. Those dlcs are usually accompanied by a patch, which brings changes for everyone. But if u want to have access to all possible gameplay elements, if you dont want to stumble accross something like 'need to own XXX dlc to YYY', if you want the game to feel truly complete, you will have to buy atleast those (debatable). All other dlcs solely add new music and unit modells to the game, which do NOT influence gameplay. See eu4wiki for details.Allthough the release of a new dlc every few months means that the game gets more content,it has its downsides besides the need of cash:Bugs and unbalance. Usually every major dlc brings new gameplay mechanics or radical changes. With them bugs come; the new mechanics are rarely balanced. Therefore one or two hotfixes follow every patch. Which can give you the feeling of having bought something incomplete or not fully tested.Savegames. Whenever (or mostly) new dlc is released you will have to take special actions, if you want to continue a game and not start over again. You probably will have to do this before starting the game, otherwise your savefiles will be corrupted and your savegames will be lost. It will NOT matter, if you buy the new dlc or not, because the patch that accompanies the dlc will break the savefiles. A single run in this game takes many hours, therefore this is very important to know.features. Be aware that features added in dlc, may later be changed, moved to available for all or even completely removed.____________________________________________What kind of game it is?The game itself is a sandboxy grand strategy wargame set between 1444 and 1821. Your job is to take over the role of the ruler/rulers of one of the countless nations of that time period and lead said nation to glory. Besides 'glory' there is no fixed goal. You choose your own goal. You can play as Spain and explore and conquer the (or a random (dlc required)) new world. You can play as China and colonize America or conquer Asia. You can play as Austria and reform the Holy Roman Empire into one state. In case you are good enough, you can even conquer the whole world. The choice is yours!pro:overall deep and interessting gameplaynearly infinite amounts of content and not completeable game (or atleast thousads of hours)sandbox gameinteressting periodcontra:verydifficult to learn for new playersgameplay mechanics are not always explained in the game and tooltips are often misleading or wrongai gets bonuses (more diplomats, more money, ...)ai sometimes behaves unforseeable or just weird (allies may 'betray' you without any warning)bugs stay around for a long time while constantly new bugs turn up and others get fixedsavegames get corrupted by patches/are incompatible with new patchesmultiplayer (unstable). Many players seem to have problems with connection in mp.luck based. For example there are random events throughout the game. While many of them add flavor to certain nations, they are all random and you can get screwed by them. Battles partly include luck.The Gameplay is considerable poorer in times of peace. Which is a problem, because bad luck (for example with events) can force you to stay at peace for a long time.(Dlc can be viewed as good or bad based on what I wrote before.)At this moment I have played the game for nearly 1000 hours and will most likely still play it for hundreds of hours. Like I said in the beginning I love it. I bought all of the major dlc at or close to realease, except the latest (Mare Nostrum, out 3 days, I will probably buy it at some point). Which means I spent about 140€. At this point, after almost 2 and a half year, this game feels like an early access title.That feeling and the sum led me to the insight that i canNOT recommendbuying the game, allthough I love it and buying dlc now or at sale would be way cheaper. Sure it is possible to enjoy the base game, but it will feel incomplete.There is literally no other game where I could tolerate said things."

I mean, sure, it may take some trial and error to develop an understanding of the game mechanics, but once you can grasp the basic gameplay components, this game is really, really enjoyable, especially when playing with other people. The multiplayer aspect of things makes the longevity of this game that much brighter, since you can make deals and forge alliances with countries that would otherwise never be interested in what you have to say. Even without human interaction, it's an enjoyable experience to stretch your brain to find the logical course of action to increase your influence and power.This game also puts theGrandin Grand Strategy Gaming. The fact that you can play as literallyany country in the worldis simply mindboggling. Not only that, but you have complete control over every aspect of your country: finances, advisors, military affairs, trade policies and embargoes, royal marriages, claims on other monarchs' thrones, fabricating claims and supporting rebels in rival countries, establishing colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas...the list is endless. This is also a great example of ""great power, great responsibility"", too, since you have to make every action count in order to avoid setbacks for your nation. Want to go to war? You should look at who that nation's allies are, how powerful they are, how close they are and how many troops they can afford to send. Good foresight can help win this game for any strategist, whether they are rookies or veterans.And another thing, ""winning"" the game. What is ""winning"" the game? Is it establishing diplomatic ties with major powers to bolster your nation's security? Is it colonizing all of South/North America and ousting any foreign competition? Is it taking over all of your main rivals by force and establishing local superiority? That's just it, though: although the game can stretch from 1444 to 1821, the game doesn't always have to be that long.Youdecide when you've won at any time by setting goals for yourself. It doesn't always have to be about world domination or anything that intensive. You could consider yourself the victor within 50 years if you so desire. Playing as France, I completely wiped out and took over Great Britain through military dominance over England, and vassalizing and diplomatically annexing Scotland and the Irish factions. I then took over the Austrian lands ceded from Burgundy early on, and had them weak enough that they couldn't take me down. At that point, I declared myself the victor, because there wasn't much more I could do besides world domination, steamrolling through Europe and travelling to the Americas, Asia and Africa.Every game is so unique, too; you will never have a game play the same, year-by-year or even day-by-day. That also makes the experience so fresh every single time, and that sense of uncertainty really forces you to take a step back and wait, see what happens first. If everything works out in your favor, that's great. If not, there's still a chance that you will end up with that stroke of luck in maybe five years, or fifty years. Who knows?I would give this game a 9/10, because it's absolutely amazing for what it is, and the epic gameplay mechanics can easily make up for those frustrating moments in your game, or for lag or disconnections in multiplayer, and even then, that's not a very common occurrence (well, the disconnections, anyway). This game is very deserving of a $40 pricetag, and if that's a little too steep, you can always get a good taste of the game from the demo. Hell, I would be willing to pay twice as much if it offered Twitch live streaming integration. But, that's just my own opinion. I can leave you now to try this out on your own."

War score and military acess rules make the war more realistic. It's much more friendly for achievement players in this sense and only drives you mad in rare occasions.Comparing with VICII, the learning curve is shorter. As long as you know how to manage your national ideas and understand all those modifiers, you can just get through it quickly.For the new players, starting without ironman is a nice choice. A castilian compaign will let you understand the general mechanism of the game including vassals, personal unions, crusades and colonization.

But the updates have made this completely impossible, not playing as an already large nation is asking for a screwjob. I'd like to compare that frustration to Dark Souls (I have it on console) but at least Dark Souls has a strategy too it that can help you overcome the odds, this is just asinine. Worst off I've tried to reset the game to versions such as 1.11.4 and 1.12.2, the earliest versions that supported the El Dorado DLC and not the recent updates, they crashed every time I started a game. Uninstalled, no question about it I have no reason to continue playing this game. I'm just happy I got my moneys worth out of it before all this happened.If you want details about the updates themselves they go as follows:Provinces instantly fall if they do not have a fort, putting a strain on your forces to constantly recapture them if you are doing anything more than chasing down one enemy army.Buildings (such as forts) have over doubled in costs, costs micronations I like to play as cannot afford. There seems to be no boost to cash flow.Each province with a fort costs 1 gold to maintain, in large nations that adds up quickly in small nations that puts you in debt.I'm not honestly sure what else they added, I saw this and I was pretty much done.

The DLC policy, while greedy and questionable with the features that they hide behind a pay wall, (I'm looking at you Common Sense, Art of War, Cossaks ect.) It was at least tollerable since all someone had to do was wait for the 50%- 75% sale and pick it up then, but this, raising the base price of a 4 year old game and then put it on sale immediatly after to try and hide it? As well as the weak justification of keeping up with inflation? Your game isn't a fine wine, its a piece of software and like every piece of software, it will show its age eventually. I just got done laughing at the $800 Assassins Creed preorder pack from Ubisoft and thinking to myself, ""wow, im glad that I play the games of a company that isn't that money grubby,"" and then I log into steam and see this. I should have seen this coming, from the way the HoI 4 cluster has been going, but never have I seen something this blatently greedy as this. If you already own the game and you have stuck with Paradox this long, play mods, seriously.

If you are new to the series, and you want to jump in, don't waste your valuable time and money for this game, it is not worth it. The base price is just an entry fee for a demo. You need at least Art of War and a few others to even get the full experience of this game.

In many ways, I'd have to recommend this game however at the buyers peril. You will almost undoubtedly buy the DLC, bit by bit, and you will be dissapointed with the diminishing returns. I feel obligated in this regard to review the product negatively as the marketing strategy of the publisher preys on it's loyal customers.Ps.Please Paradox, just open a pateon account or something, it feels more honest that way."
,Not Recommended,236850,33613514,Posted: 17 July,all,Digital Cake Productions,"My first few hours were full of joy, but after that things started to turn south. First off, unless you are buying all the DLC, which costs 5 times the current cost of the game, you'll miss key features such as being able to change occupation of land to your allies during war. Next, unless you play in Europe, you'll quickly lack behind in technology without most of the DLC. This DLC policy locks key features which should be part of the base game behind pay walls. This game can be compared to mobile games in which you need to shell out money for most of your enjoyment. Finally, Paradox has plans on releasing more DLC at the price of the base game a few more times... When your DLC costs over 5 times the cost of your game, you know you have a problem."

It'll take time to learn everything and get good, but after that this game is really really fun. You can play any nation you want and even add your own in with a DLC. Many of the better and useful things are locked behind a paywall, like the very necessary development feature in the Common Sense expansion, which is $15, or the Art of War expansion, which is just loaded with nearly everything you'd ever need, is $20, but the game itself is  definitely worth the money. It's just once you get the expansions you'll never want to go back to the normal version of the game.It's rather complicated, but that's only because there is so much to learn and the proper way to learn it all is different for everyone, but I think the best way to learn for beginners is to just watch someone play the game itself. One of the things you will need to actively find how to's for is the trade system. Don't worry though, it's not difficult. It's just that it is blunt and doesn't tell you much of how it works from just looking at it. Trades important, for it can get you from the red, to the green, and even fund your armies sometimes if it gets high enough. The military combat is rather difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but if you play as a nation that's not in Europe, or one of the more separated European nations, then it won't be a problem and you can learn how to do war yourself. I recommend being England as a European nation to play as. They can't get invaded easily because of their navy, so you wouldn't have to worry about dealing with war too much as you figure out how to play. The Diplomacy is fine, easy to do, and you can figure it out just by looking at it, but it can be your best friend for getting land or avoiding war if you plan things out just right. It'll even help you win the war, before you even start it. It's best to play with a friend that knows how to play as they will help you from dying if you plan to play in Europe, or out of Europe as the Europeans will colonize.Modding is really easy to learn, if someone's teaching you, although figuring out how to upload the mods is really difficult if you don't know how. I've started to mod not to long ago, and I've developed a very well crafted and balanced nation with no experience with programming when I started. It even has a set list of what it will do when it becomes an A.I. There also a good chunk of mods that can satisfy your distastes with the game like there being no Secularism, enough music, or the game length being too short. It's really not short, but if you want it to last forever you can do that. ^-^I say that even with some faults the games has many great things that balance those faults out. The faults aren't that bad, but the good is great. If you wanted to make a mod that adds a new country that's specific to you, you can do that, and all it would do is take time. Modding this game isn't hard, but it is very time consuming. As the wise and powerful Egoraptor said, ""It gives the illusion of difficulty because it takes up your time."" Have fun playing!"

,Recommended,236850,9787331,"Posted: 11 April, 2014",all,TornadoWatch,"Who actually writes a -review- for something off steam? It's a total waste of time, isn't it? Who wants to provide free marketing to a videogame company?For Europa Universalis IV... No, it isn't a waste of time. EU4 deserves a review. This game is a masterpiece.If you've ever played risk, Civilization, or any of the Total War games, EU4 is all of those games ramped up to eleven. This game is one of the most deep, complex, and engaging strategy experiences you will ever encounter, putting you in the shoes of any nation in the world you can think of between the years 1444-1820.One of EU4's most interesting elements that defines the franchise is that there is not any clear goal; you decide what you want to achieve. It's a sandbox in every meaning of the word; the sky is the limit in terms of goals here. Do you want to be the most powerful nation in the world, ruling the seas from Britain with a mighty fleet? Or perhaps play as France, the terror of Europe and scourge of Austria? Or maybe you just want to play as a Native American tribe and attempt to survive the onslaught of European colonizers, hungry for land and gold. It's all possible. Some people even make a hobby out of taking the most doomed nations possible that are literally meant to just die, and making them into superpowers. Who would've thought it was possible for the Knights Hospitaller, reduced to a single island in the Meditarranean, to conquer all of India and the Middle East?The real pleasure in EU4, however, lies in its sheer depth. Nothing is cookie-cut. Every aspect of running a nation, from staffing the government with suitable advisors to waging war on rivals (with realistic attrition - don't invade Russia in winter, you nitwit) is covered. Rich events and choices flesh out the environment of the time, simulating things such as the French Revolution and unification of Spain, and even though the game is almost 400 years long, things don't get TOO off course historically. Impressive, considering the timespan. It's a game for history buffs, but everything is well-explained enough so the layman can understand what's going on too.The graphics and user-interface are above average, really. The map is usually crisp and clean, providing information on current events for the player's benefit. The UI is complex, but understandable over time.Multiplayer with friends is an outstanding experience, and something that everyone playing this game should try at least once.No review's complete without mentioning the bad and ugly, however, and there's certainly that in EU4. The learning curve, for one, is absolutely murderous - And this is Paradox Interactive's easiest title. The sheer amount of things to do will absolutely overwhelm any beginner for about the first week of gameplay. There's a few design flaws with the game itself, such as the game becoming too easy if you're really good at it or just start in a strong position - Starting as the Ottoman Empire and smacking around your inferior Eastern neighbors with outdated technology, then turning to your Western neighbors with the might of India behind you is not a challenge at all. There's the occasional bug or thing that'll happen that is absolute nonsense, but it's understandable in a game of this size; the AI can be a bit patchy at times too.In conclusion - If you consider yourself to be a fan of strategy games, you need to at least take a look at Europa Universalis IV. It's a different kind of game that looks at things on a huge scale. It's not politically correct, and doesn't apologize for this. It's deep. It's fun, once you get into it! It's a cut above most gaming products on the market right now, and it at least deserves your consideration.Give EU4 a try - And maybe shoot me a message if you have a question or two about the game, I'd love to help. Strongly recommended."

Things like Estates (Cossacks DLC) are mechanics that I really detest. Sure you can just not buy that particular DLC or disable it if you own it, but the problem comes when Paradox change the fundamental features of the core game and hinder your access through DLC. Prime example being Common Sense DLC (ironic name) players can only invest in development of provinces and make buildings if they have this DLC. Without it, a player cannot invest their monarch points and so can only build so much.It's aggressive tactics like this that feel like a massive slap in the face for a loyal supporter such as myself. Paradox need to seriously reconsider their DLC position.Until then, I recommend staying away and voting with your feet. If you REALLY must purchase the game or any of its DLC, do so only in a steam summer or winter sale.

In a nutshell this is easily one of the best strategy games available at any point in the history of gaming.Still reading? Ok. Thanks...let me make it worth your while.I've played EU, EU3 and EU4 and this is the best of the series. The other games engaged me for 30, 50 or 60 hours. That's not bad but they never entirely grabbed me. This one is simply a better game than anything Paradox has ever released. The new Clausewitz engine renders this game beautifully. For those worried about the multitude of DLC packs, don't be. The base game plays beautifully and it feels complete. I only purchased the DLC well after I had 100 hours into it. Some may find the DLC worth it. I certainly did. But if you don't get it you're still buying a complete game.So what makes this game good? Options and choice without complexity. EU4 is the epitome of ""every action has an equal and opposite reaction"". Sure, you can play as a massive warmonger and try to gobble up everyone. But then you'll have to deal with the internal unrest and your neighbors banding together to take you down a peg. You can play as a nice neighbor and not attack anyone but then you'll have to deal with keeping major allies happy in order to watch over you. You'll have scenarios where lifelong allies of yours attack each other and you'll have to decide which one to back.Do you build up? Do you build out? It's all up to you. You can take France or the Ottomans and try to dominate the world. Or you can take a tiny country and just try to survive. And there's no ""victory"" in the game. Whether or not you won or lost is your call, not some arbitrary game decision. Meanwhile, you're balancing military, political ramifications, gold, your provinces, technologies and a host of other factors. It's a lot to juggle but it's not overwhelming.There's a learning curve here, but the new engine makes everything more accessible than ever. Thus while some people have been put off by the complexity of this series in the past, this one is actually fairly easy to get into. Now for someone who is entirely new to the engine it's going to take some time to learn your way around. It's not a typical strategy game where you can rush your actions. You have to take your time, plan your actions perhaps decades in advance and then be ready to strike at a moment's notice. It's wonderful fun.There aren't any large flaws with EU4, which is one of the highest compliments I can pay a game. It is highly recommended for any strategy gamer's library."

,Recommended,236850,2432127,"Posted: 24 August, 2013",all,Mauno,"Updated on 23.12.2014. In short, the three major expansion have fixed most of the issues with the game, and added a massive amount of extra content and flavour.Review:An improvement over the already excellent 'EU3: Divine Wind' in almost every way imaginable.- For those interested in the genre, this is probably the best place to start: Excellent tutorials (by Paradox's standards, at least), less unnecessary abstraction, but all the depth of a PDS game. You'll still fail miserably a few times before fully figuring the game out, but that's always been part of the fun in these titles.So ye, if you're new to grand strategy, get this.- As for 'us' veterans? Improved mechanics across the board, trading that makes sense, more challenging AI and Ironman mode make this a worthy sequel to EU3.The biggest change from EU3DW is the monarch point system that replaces the budget sliders and magistrates. A welcome change, in my opinion, as now you can't just adjust your sliders a bit in the early game for high stability and fast military tech. Monarch points are used for national ideas, tech, buildings, national decisions, even peace treaties.The highly limited amount of monarch points earned per month force the player to really think about his actions. No more spamming buildings at max magistrates and never touching the sliders.This system does have slight balance issues: military tech is always a better investment than military ideas, for example, and the fact that your ruler's skills play a major part in your monarch point income can screw over large portions of a playthrough. Fall behind in military tech because of an idiot king?lol ok, Prussia is going  to eat you now.Other small problems include the infrequent revolutions and apparent ultra-stability of large AI nations. In my three finished campaigns, [strikethrough]only a handful of American nations ever managed to gain independence, and I've never seen a Revolutionary France. Small sample size, yes, but it does seem like large empires are a bit too stable at the moment.[/strikethrough] These happen far more often now. Colonial nations revolt quite often and the revolution mechanic makes seeing revolutionary nations far more common.The UI is much better this time, being closer to CK2's than EU3's, but the panels and the font are still far too small at 1920x1080. Fortunately, there is a fix to this in the Steam workshop, another great addition to the game.AI has seen quite a few improvements as well, especially in diplomacy. Every nation now has a limited amount of diplomatic relations they can maintain, and the AI does seem to understand the mechanic quite well, cutting ties with nations because of shifting interests, and seeking new allies as the game progresses (instead of picking 3 allies at the start of the game and sticking with them, like in EU3).Cascading alliances are not a problem anymore, as infamy was replaced by an aggressive expansion relations hit to all nearby nations. AE going too high leads to the AI forming coalitions: defensive alliances that do what cascading alliances were supposed to.Overall, the AI nations seem far better at waging war; effectively pursuing hostile armies, splitting up to siege multiple provinces at a time, exploiting river crossings to crush larger forces, etc.EU4 > EU3  Divine Wind. [strikethrough]Only thing I actually miss from EU3 are the overseas territory names (ie. Portuguese Africa, British Caribbean)[/strikethrough] Conquest of Paradise adds this back in.- How is it as a standalone title?A bloody brilliant game, and miles above any non-PDS strategy game in depth, scale and complexity. It also looks very pretty, so that's good.I was a long-time Total War fan, before being introduced to EU3. Now, even Empire: Total War feels far to simplistic.Expansions:The Conquest of Paradise- Colonial nations form when you have enough colonies in an overseas region. Similar to vassals, but pay tariffs instead of taxes. A pretty cool mechanic, though I do miss being able to micromanage every single colony.- Randomized New World. Not too exciting. Terrain generation is really odd, and looks like a random map seed from Age of Empires 2.The Wealth of Nations- Revamped trade system is great.- Trade companies are like colonial nations in the East. Cool system, but has the same problems CN's have.- New diplomacy options are great. Transfering trade power, new casus belli. Great additions.Res Publica- More flavour for Poland and the Dutch. Not too exciting, but highly recommended if you want to play those nations.Art of War- More diplomacy options again. Excellent additions like supporting rebel CB, fight for subject CB, war reparations.- Autonomy system added in the patch is great, as is the new revolution mechanic."

The AI will get access to these mechanics, but you won't without paying full price. The current full price is $248.63 Canadian. The full bundle currently costs $115.82 Canadian on sale.So, before buying this game you should ask yourself two questions:1) Is the full experience of Eu4 worth $115.82? Not to me it isn't.

If so, then absokutely buy it, this is a big game that will keep you busy for a long time.2) Are you comfortable feeling like you paid good money for a good game which is 20% of an truly amazing strategy game?

The new DLC ""Common Sense"" In my Opinion has changed the game in a way that it will never be the same, Let me explain. Whenever I siege and occupy a province and move my men out it will un-siege itself and I have to re-siege it. I was at a war with Ottomans and I was about to win till my Objective province got un-sieged and I lost an army stack because while I was re-siegeing it his main armies came and destroyed everything I had. I could have won and could have peaced out if I had that province but that fact that this DLC has made it so it un-sieges the provinces I take over makes me mad and it costs manpower to re-siege and manpower is something that is valued in this game. Not to mention the new Outrages Admin points you have to spend just to core one province, I full annex Wallachia under Hungary, it costs over 400 Admin and I am saying, ""Good Job Paradox you have ruined my game!"" Also this is not the only bad thing Common Sense has done to our beloved game, it made it so when AI fight their armies go crazy around the map, and thats not even the worst part! I mean the fort system is so bad I just want to use cheats to full annex a nation because of the anger and madness I have of the fort system. Though if you have made it this far into my paragraph you might want to listean even more. The value of sieging a province that a country owns is worthless! I siege all the balkans under Ottomans Control and it is only 6% Warscore, what the actually heck. The only fun thing for me in this DLC is the new re-shaped Provinces, the new nations, the 1490 Italian's leaving the HRE which makes invading them more fun for outside HRE nations, and the last good thing about Common Sense is the devolpment system, I love how you can make your nation strong. Let's say I play as Hungary, I can develop my country to be as strong as Castile,Aragon,France, and Poland. The new DLC in all is worthless and I suggest you do not get it. Other then that Europa Universalis IV is a fun, Stragetic game and I would suggest you get the game but not Common Sense. If you have read this paragraph I hope you agree with me and Paradox, if you are reading this please fix these things to make the fun come back to the game. I put to many hours and fun into this for you to turn it into a non-exciting game! Thank you all for your time of reading this Review."

,Not Recommended,236850,29435078,Posted: 22 January,all,[F2P]xx420noscopeWEEDsnip3rx,"I recently picked this game up again after a year long haitus. The game has been improved on every level since I last paid, however since I am not a muppet I will not pay for a bunch of DLCs which come to a price higher than the base game itself and which should have been patches anyway.Like how can you patch the game so that you can build fewer buildings, then release a DLC for over £10 which lets you build provinces up to the amount of buildings you could build before the patch and think that's acceptable? Who is buying these DLCs? I understand why people want them, I want them myself, but only because they change the game's base mechanics back to the level they were at at release. I refuse to pay for them though. I don't understand who would pay for them.It's not even as if grand strategy is a niche market anymore and Paradox need every penny. In that case I might be able to justify it. Paradox is doing this because they can, with their stranglehold on the grand strategy market. I'm not gonna enable them though. If you're thinking of buying this game, please don't, do not enable shameful business tactics."

But I've been disappointed every single time I load it up and give it another try. It could be so much better.Here's something to understand if you're thinking about trying it: It's more like Risk than Civilization. It's a game about conquering territory, not building an empire. War is the only practical thing there is to do. If you're not at war, you're just gonna be staring at the screen for hours waiting for numbers to go up.Nothing will make sense to you the first time you play this game. The amount of help provided is very limited, and the UI is very confusing. Icons without meaning abound. Numbers and modifiers are given without explanation of what they actually do.If you stick with it, you'll discover that fighting and conquering land is kinda fun. Troops are moved around in real-time, which makes it feel realistic. I'm sure I would have more to say on combat if I knew more about how it worked, but of course, it isn't explained very well. 90% of the fun in this game comes from looking at the territory you own and thinking ""Ahh, look at all the land I own now.""The massive amount of provinces and nations in this game is really, really cool. There are hundreds of nations, and every one is playable, from the biggest to the smallest, from Europe to Africa to Indonesia to America. However, nations outside Europe receive crippling penalties that end up making them much more boring to play than they should be. Different regions of the world have different technology penalties. East Asia, for instance, has technology 60% more expensive, and certain regions of America have technology 250% more expensive. You can remove this penalty through an extremely painful ""westernization"" process. I dislike this system immensely. I wish there had instead been a set of technologies the more primitive nations would have to go through before getting caught up. This would still have kept them behind the Europeans, but it would have given the player something to do. Instead, my native tribe seems to consist of a bunch of morons who can't learn.Most things in this game require a resource called monarch power to perform. This comes in three types: administrative, diplomatic, and military. You get a base amount of monarch power per month, and then the rest is determined by your advisors (which you can hire for gold, if you have enough) and your ruler. If your nation isn't a republic, you can't control who your ruler is...and your ruler massively influences how much you can do in this game. If you have a good ruler, you can do all sorts of fun things, but if your ruler sucks, you're stuck sitting and waiting for decades of game time and hours of real time to do anything at all. Waiting seems to be a common theme in this game's play.You can build buildings in your provinces if you happen to have lots of gold, but it's not very interesting to do so. The buildings have only a small effect individually. Like I said, this game is more about taking land than developing a nation.Exploration and colonization was something I was excited to try, but it turns out you can't do either until you take very specific policies...I wish every nation could expand to unoccupied territory from the very beginning, but this is not the case.I find that most of the strategies I try this game are...cheesy. For instance, if I'm a weaker nation and I want to bully some of my neighbors out of their land, I will attempt to ally with a strong nation, get them into my war...and then make sure my armies land on the provinces I want to take before theirs do, because whoever starts a siege on a province first gets claim to that territory. This doesn't make me feel like I'm winning, it just makes me feel like I'm gaming the system.There are more things I could complain about, but the gist is that this game seems awesome yet constantly disappoints me. If you like maps and war, you'll probably like this game. If you like SimCity or you're the kind of person who prefers peaceful victories in Civilization, you probably won't."

This has blown all other strategy games I have played way out of the water. Normally with strategy games I am downloading mods for them after about 150 hours but I am currently over 400 and I don't plan on getting any for another few hundred. Although I have heard the timeline mod is awesome I am going to play the vanilla game to its fullest.This game may take a long time but its full of things to keep you busy. From plotting your next conquest to being cought completely off guard by a declaration of war. You can take the smallest nations and turn them into glorious empires. You can also be utterly crushed under the boot of jealous neighbours.I have only been able to complete 4 campians (Who knows how many I have failed XD) and my favorite was forming Italy as Naples. It was extreamly hard as Austria desided to take Milan but I finally formed Italy in 1700. Shortly after that France and me had to fight off the Commonblob. It was a long and bloody war but we came out on top (and low on money and manpower). That war was the most enjoyable one I have fought thus far.Note: There are people who don't like thier DLC system and I cannot blame them. But this game (and all of their others) is just so awesome I am willing to buy them all to support Paradox and help them develop more awesome games in the future.In conclusion, if you are a lover of strategy games and have loads of free time this game is perfect for you!!!"

Making sure to keep your expansion in check and powerful allies placated will have you forming decisions well well into the hundreds of years. Most nations (even smaller ones) have unique sets of ideas that will radically alter your playstyle - will you conquer massive swaths of land as the Ottoman Empire, diplomatically unite the Holy Roman Empire as Austria, build trade dominance with Venice, or play as a little-known minor country in Africa, India, or Asia?

The thrill every time you start a new game playing as one of over 300 diferent countries in one of 377 unique starting times (you can start playing during any year between 1444 and 1821). These are not even a fraction of the reasons why this game is possibly the greatest game i've ever played, and by far the greatest strategy game out there.

While we somewhat knows where is continental America, this is somewhat fixed in a New World DLC.(+) Great simulation of Europe technologies. The technologies are also explained in a historical context.(+) Good simulation of warfare. In addition of tactical battles, one can also won by engaging naval blockades, trade embargoes, and such.(+) Good simulation on politics. Declaration of war is not that simple, you have to obtain a reason : whether it is a different religion, reconquest, etc. The mechanics of War Exhaustion, Stability, and Aggresive Expansion enable careful warfare and not all out map painting.(+) Each big nation have their own ambition and mission. For example : Brandenburg to form up Prussia, and later Germany.Cons :(-) Sometimes your allies make such bad decision. Such as waging a 20-years war with a HRE/France for one pitiful province. Or wage 10+ years war that consumes manpower and increase war exhaustion for one tiny land.This game is a historical simulator, not 100% accurate but still put history in context."

,Not Recommended,236850,7586646,"Posted: 6 November, 2013",all,rudwayn,"After playing this game for almost 4 years, I feel the need to write a proper review from my view of the game. I've been into strategy games since I can remember, started playing the basic strategy games as a little kid. When I got older I discovered the grand strategy genre including games like Total War, EU 3, the old HOI and even Victoria. There were also some less popular games published by Paradox (Knights of Honor) that I've really enjoyed.Now to get back at EU IV and Paradox's current business model. I really understand what Paradox is trying to do. They want to support the game as long as possible, don't get me wrong, I really like the idea of keeping a game alive. I understand this is only possible by improving and expanding the game mechanics and content. This resulted in some of the best grand strategy DLC's I have ever bought in my life. Common Sense and Art of War are really amazing DLC's that will greatly increase the replay value and extend the current hours you have in the game.The content packs that get released with every DLC(sometimes even without any major expansion) are not that valuable as all the expansions themselves. And now again, I don't mind paying the money just for some textures, I think it's a great way to support the game designers, and even Paradox in general. You should only buy the content packs if you can actually spare the money, since it will only change some in-game models. So the content packs are not in any kind of way an issue for me, I even like the idea of it. It's just some extra money to support the developers even more.To get to the point of what is really bothering me and some other players that have a lot of hours in this game, and like me, supported this game for years. The quality of the expansions is really starting to drop. Don't get me wrong, there were some lack lusting DLC's already, but you don't have to pay 10-15 euros for those. DLC's like Res Publica, Conquest of Paradise and even Wealth of Nations don't add that much of necessary content. The last of these 2 (CoP and WoN) are pretty big, but still not that necessary to make the game fair to play. The top tier DLC's are without any doubt: Common Sense and Art of War, you will need these 2 for almost every playthrough. Some major game changing mechanics are only available for the player if he/she owns these 2 DLC's. The only 2 DLC's that are REALLY worth the 15-20 euro price tag if you ask me.For the past year and a half Paradox only released some low valuable DLC's. I am talking about the Cossacks, Mare Nostrum, Rights of Man, Mandate of Heaven and recently Third Rome. Of these five DLC's I only bought the first 4, if I have to choose one that is really worth the money, I would go for the Cossacks. That is the FIRST one that got released of the what i categorize, 'low valuable' DLC's. So from there on, the value of DLC's really started to decrease. I don't know what got into Paradox their mind, but it really started to bother me. I have the money to buy the music packs, content packs and even less valuable DLC's(Res Publica, CoP and WoN) that got released years ago. But I am not someone that will just keep buying non-valuable stuff every 3 months.If Paradox will ever read this review. Please, improve the quality of the upcoming DLC's and lower the price of the DLC's I(and a lot of other players that put thousands of hours in this game) rate as less valuable. It's not acceptable that we still need to pay the big price for these DLC a year after they got released, even though they didn't deserve that big price tag to begin with. Until then, I WILL NOT recommend this game."

You can play with >260 natioms.It also has got a dynamic economic system that you can manipulate with trade ships or owned land in the certain trading node. I also enjoy the military and geopolitical factor in EU4 because its the best part in my opinion.The actual combat is pretty unique because unlike in the Total War series, it is like a board game. You have to pay a lot of attention to various factors: you have to pay attetion on your tech level, the terrain (NEVER underestimate the terrain), the morale of your troops and their discipline, if you play smart you can kill a larger army by simply having high morale, good tech, disciplin and a terrain advantage on the other side if you act stupid and attack an enemy that has got these advantages you'll possibly send your loyal troops into a deathtrap. This can be frustrating but it isn't the games fault your decision your fate.However, this is just one way annexing it in a peace deal there are more ways to get your empire to grow: gain territory through a personal union (royal marriges pay of) or vassilize the country and integrate it into your grandé nation.Another important game mechanic tool is the diplomacy you can ally, sabotage, create/join a coalition , support your allies. There's a lot more you can do it's just an insane amount of opportunities in order to make histroy as YOU like it.Now I'll come to the best part of that this game has to offer: the community, the community is smart, backstabbing :) and very into EU4.In addition to that there's also the genius modding community creating ahistoric mods, game improvements, essentially everthing that you search in the mods you'll find it!Now to the negative parts:There are not a lot of negative parts so i'll keep it as short as possible.- Not very stable multiplayer- localization issues with non english versionsWell thats all i have to complain about at the moment.I would totally recommend you buying EU4 if you're into history or/and strategy games because it will suck you in and steal all your free time.Thats it, if you dis/liked this review please comment it and I apoligize for spelling/grammar failures as I'm no native english speaker."

For those of you who haven’t played a video game in about 10 years or so, allow me to explain what DLC is.To do that, we have to examine what a game was like in the 90s. In the 90s, most games on console were a full product. There were usually no addons, no expansions and since the internet wasn’t used on console at the time, no updates. On the PC, it was a whole different story. Many games had updates or patches, there was online multiplayer in games like Quake 3 and many games had an early form of DLC, known as expansion packs, which were large pieces of content which would add hours of new playing time and were usually installed via a disc.Flash forward to the Xbox 360/PS3 Era and we would see games on console start to have addons, as internet became more accessible and online multiplayer on console became mainstream. An early piece of DLC which has become a running joke today was Horse Armor in the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It didn’t add much and costed 2 dollars on the PC. DLC, short for downloadable content, became slowly common as the 7th generation of consoles aged. Now, DLC in 2017 mirrors mostly that of Horse Armor: Usually added a few maps or skins or a weapon pack and released in chunks, only now DLC is sometimes content from the base game that was taken and sold for extra day 1.Now, let's talk about Paradox Interactive, specifically, EU4. EU4, short for Europa Universalis 4, was released in August 2013 and costs about 39.99 on Steam. That alone is overpriced as Paradox Interactive has already launched two big new games since and even older games such as Crusader Kings 2 are priced at 39.99. Doom costed about 60 dollars at launch and now you can get it for 10-15 dollars on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a steam sale. That was released a year ago but EU4 was released 4 years ago and still costs 39.99. Not only that but check out the DLC.If you are going to play EU4, there are 4 pieces of DLC which are considered the best. I will list them in order of priority: Art of War, Common Sense, Rights of Man and the Cossacks. I have all of these except the Cossacks and allow me to explain each DLC’s most important add ons. Art of War is important because it drastically overhauls warfare to the point where you MUST buy it. Common Sense allows you to develop provinces with Administrative, Diplomacy and Military points and lets you deal with your vassals a lot better. Rights of Man gives your ruler traits, which can help or hurt your nation, along with 8 great powers, which if you’re on the list, will give you special diplomatic powers such as convincing smallers nations to break alliances or to intervene in war and finally, allows your ruler or heir to abdicate, which if you’re playing a nation with an awful ruler such as Castille, is quite important as it allows you to get more ruler points if you get a new and better ruler. Finally, the Cossacks improves playing as hordes and gives you espionage, which allows you to study other nations who have higher tech levels than you, which is essential for playing non-western or Chinese Nations, or people who want to save their ruler points. Now, there is much more DLC than that but these four DLCS in total cost 75 dollars. There is a sale right now on EU4, which has the base game at 75% off and the DLC at 50% off but even still, that's 105 dollars regularly and nearly 50 dollars when on sale for a four year old game.I do recommend this game but it's overpriced. In my experience, you will appreciate this game SOO much more if you buy it as a key on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.net, along with it's DLC. Basically, get this, Art of War, Common Sense, Rights of Man and if you want the Cossacks and do it on a sale to get the full experience. Don't be cheap, it's tempting but you will regret it."

No more policy sliders, more confusing (now much simpler after getting used to it) trade, more historical constraints and no ""minting"".  However...EUIV is by far, a fantastic game.  Many of the problems EUIII had have been fixed, such as a better way of forming personal unions.  Yes, it isn't as easy to destroy the Ottamans with the remenants of the Roman Empire like in EUIII, but by the pentriach it is much more satisfying for being so.  Every nation feels a little more unique due to ideas and the game flows beautifully.  Even colonization doesn't feel as much as a hassle, though changing religions is a pain in my imperial breeches.  To any EUIII fans that have not played IV yet, get it.

Strategies will come into your head even when your not playing it.2) This is nothing like Civ.  You won't get anywhere by comparing the two, except for realising you would have more spare time if you played Civ.  A civ game is a few seconds long compared to this.3) You will most likely live the rest of your life alone due to points 1 and 2 and only just remember to feed yourself.So good luck and have fun!10/10, can't wait for the new expansion."

76561198077964942,Not Recommended,236850,34312384,Posted: 17 August,all,Kaptain.Presidente,"The initial veneer of historical strategy is quickly rubbed away to reveal a bloated, unwieldy mess of a game that publisher behaviour indicates is more of a platform for DLC than an actual game to be played. With every new DLC purchased, all one gains are another collection of modifiers, menus, and tabs with a negligible impact on actual gameplay, which when actually analysed reveals itself to be nothing more than a series of loaded dice rolls.The game uses a pretense of random chance to justify bottlenecking players into a universal playstyle: Opportunistic conquest of small countries to snowball beyond the reach of the dice rolls. Any strategy other than this, such as attempts to ""play tall"" or diplomatically are functionally impossible due to both constant random events that kneecap smaller nations, and, as repeated games have highlighted, that the game is not a series of countries interacting in a strategy simulation, but instead much more like 4X games such as Civilization: the player against an entire world of exploitable AIs working together against them. Whether in warfare, diplomacy, or trade, countries consistently make decisions that target the player even at their own expense, such as allowing their entire homeland to be occupied in order to deploy troops against the player a world away, and dice rolls will always favour the AI, as a glance at province and national modifiers or the combat screen illustrate. Unfortunately, this method of loading dice and aligning the world against the player, along with blatant AI cheats, seem to be the only way non-RTS strategy developers choose to induce difficulty in their games, see also the Civilization series.Unlike the Civilization series, however, Europa Universalis IV does not induce a ""just one more turn"" cycle of feedback due to how many tabs and menus one routinely sifts through in an ultimately pointless attempt to find the reason for the most recent stat malus the game has given their country, as the menus and modifiers typically convey inconsistent information. An example of this being the Economy tab showing a tax income of X while the provinces' tabs show tax income adding up to Y. In my games, I have frequently spent so much time clicking through tabs and menus I lost track of the game being paused when I finally closed them all. This bloat causes the game to crawl through time, which, considering how much of it there is between a start date of 1444 and end date of 1821, there is a lot of to slog through. It also means that even if one places the game on its highest speed, which is not recommended as it induces some lingering glitches and typically causes pop-ups/diplomatic options to pass before one can react, the history files get so encumbered with the endless flood of ultimately pointless modifiers and notations the game itself begins to lag.For those who remember EUIV's launch, it was very obvious that the game was a direct continuation of EUIII at the end of its lifecycle. The original EUIV achievements are all even recycled from a failed attempt to introduce in-game achievements to EUIII. This means that everything in the subsequent DLCs and Patches (which routinely render savegames incompatible) have been layering more and more on top of an already complete game. This is not an inherently bad thing, but when what is being added amounts to nothing but bloat and tiny fractions of difference in modifiers, it leads one to question why they're even bothering."

Ultimately I (probably) got a positive return on my time investment in terms of hours, but I can't say how many of those hours in this game were entertaining. It's odd to think that - so many DLC and patches into EU IV's lifecycle - I think the game was better earlier. The fundamental problem is the DLC, and I'm not talking about the pricing. Please allow me to explain:Each DLC adds new mechanics to the games. Everything from new vassal interactions to ""estates"" which you can ""interact"" with (i.e. click a few buttons) that attempt to add some flavor to the internal management of your chosen nation (an aspect of the game which is decidely weak). You might be seeing the problem already. If each DLC adds a new ""feature de jure"" but Paradox can never be certain who has what DLC and what combination of paid addons they may be playing, each DLC is essentialy its own little island.The game has become a monstrous patchwork. An inelegant frankenstein of DLC features that were sold for prime in their day and are rarely touched again. The game stops looking like a cohesive whole and instead appears more as a checklist of which features you've bought and paid for and those you have yet to purchase.It's a shame, really. However, just like with so many things in life, simplicity does not necessarily mean spartan, brevity is not always pithy. EU IV exchanges holistic gameplay structures for something cobbled together out of some very expensive bricks."

LOTS of dlc. I just wish paradox would release a ""fixed all the lag"" dlc or a ""fixed the AI"" dlc or a ""less paradox math"" dlc. To put plainly, paradox isn't making it hard to complain."
,Recommended,236850,32559245,Posted: 19 June,all,Kindness,"Well, well, well. I went to the store page as I saw Europa was on sale again and I considered buying it for a friend of mine. I must say, I was surprised. As it stands, the reviews have plummeted to 26%. People complaining about too many overpriced, destabilising, and underperforming dlcs. And you know what? I agree.The final straw for me was back in 2015. When Paradox finished adding the features I wanted and then added a whole lot I didn't want all in one go. I was distraught. I had already spent a couple of hundred hours at that stage, but by now, I think I can safely give my five cents worth.All the reviews I have read so far point towards Paradox taking the wrong path (which has been said time and time again, mind), and to be honest, I support that claim. However, what I gather that most people don't realise, or simply choose to ignore, or maybe aren't aware of, etc. is that when you buy Europa, you buy the twenty-something previous versions of it. And, since you own a copy of the game, you have the power to choose how you want to play it.I, personally, was very happy with the state of the game by 1.14, but by 1.16-17 was very disillusioned. So I simply switched back to 1.14, stopped the auto updates, and have had a very, very happy 1000(ish) hours since. The bonus with that too is I do not need to keep up with the 'new' dlc. The downside is the achievements but that does not bother me.So to sum up I guess what I am saying is keep protesting guys, and hopefully they will listen to you. Unfortunately, the game is too far gone for me to catch up but I would recommend for players new to the Europa franchise to start with an earlier patch where it's a little less complicated, and then after about 50 hours when you should have a solid grasp of the mechanics move forward and experiment to find the one you like the best.Now that that's out of the way, Europa Universalis IV (in 1.14) is a grand strategy game where you take control of a city or small country from the end of the medieval age through to the beginnings of the industrial era. A tough game, you will learn all about the intricacies of diplomacy, how much a healthy amount of luck really is, and hopefully, acquire an extensive if somewhat unnecessary archive of the geography of Europe and then the rest of the world. My favourite part is the AI interaction is a two way street, where you both need to maintain good relations (unlike most other games where it is just the human appeasing the AI players (yes Civ, that's you!)) and work together in a sense although once you are big enough, you will ultimately backstab them at some stage as you spread across the world.And no, there are no victory conditions - the game is open-ended so you set your own goals and execute them and your enemies which obviously isn't for everyone (especially not your enemies) but I find it refreshing and it adds replayability. The Ironman feature is also a bonus as it prevents save scumming (although I've heard rumours that people have broken it - and if you have, I don't want to know) it adds a sense of realism and weight to the decisions you make, which I haven't encountered before in a pc game.So to really sum up, sorry for the amount of writing, and thanks Paradox for the game you finished two years ago. It truly is one of best in my library and I will choose to keep it that way. Also, for those experienced and those new alike, Good Luck!!"

It'll involve lots of fabricated claims and eventually turn into routine expanision followed by certain landmark decisions or tech ups to ensure your armies are as op as possible. It gets to the point where you begin to memorize what nations will rise and which will fall so when you're bored there's something the look at while your aggresive expansion goes down. I'm not gonna review like the entire game cuz I'm really lazy and there's some parts of the game I really don't know much about but I'll conclude by looking over the two nations I've finished a game with.Muscovite Cub/Russian Bear: Probably one of the more entertaining nations out there, their traditions and ideas make it easy to build up huge armies and expand right out of the get go. The real problem that could stop the bear in his early expansion is a nomad gang bang or poland-lithuania but once those are out of the way, you'll be on the path to shreking everything from eastern europe to the open fields of Mongolia.Timurids/Mughals: The strongest of all the nomads in the middle east and has the potential of being a great power.They used to be even better when you didn't need to reform your government to become the mughals. A thing that many may not know is nomads are extremely powerful early game and can easily make a empire as they can declare on anyone they border as well. So combined with the Timurid's ability to form a ""civilized"" muslim tech nation bordering the indian tech group is pretty great (also the fact you get claims on all of India). Once all of india is taken pushing into the middle-east and the gold mine that is china becomes easy.I recommend this to people willing to try new things. Sure it's fun to play as england and crucify some irish but, creating an irish empire through brutal wars of survival just feels like something you'd read in a textbook and go ""holy crap that actually happened"". One the most amzaing things this game gives me is a way to use my imagination and create a story about the empire I made.P.S. ty paradox for buffing Ming, The Middle Kingdom shall endure and the western dogs will be nothing except dirt beneath our celestial feet. #asainpower"

It is epic in scale and depth, with literally an entire world to explore over three of the most dynamic centuries in history. It manages to create a completely believable world that pays homage to the forces that have shaped history while simultaneously giving you the opportunity and tools to reshape it in anyway you please.The sheer number of features and mechanics at work can be a bit overwhelming. The interface certainly takes some getting used to as you are inundated with bewildering amounts of information. However, as you gradually learn to master these features and mechanics, you crave every bit of scrumptious data as your actions both affact and are dictated by then. This is a refreshing stand against the plethora of games that continously dumb down in order to appeal to mass audiences.The real weakness in this game is suggested in the name. While the European playthroughs are as fleshed out and fun as you would expect, those in other regions of the world are noticeably less so. Certainly, the developer is slowly working to address this problem. Through patches and expansions, places like East Asia and the Americas will become more fully developed with more nations and features. Still, the general focus on Europe hurts the otherwise immersive game experience.Completely recomended for strategy gamers, cartophiles, and lovers of history. 9/10"

As someone new to the Europa series yet a lover of Crusader Kings II, this game improves and adds upon what Crusader Kings had. It no longer features the intrinsic and complex balancing of nobles, ministers, and agents but instead takes the complexity of balancing people and changes it to balancing a nation. This time, the entire world is the map and the player has the ability to choose between 1444 and when it ends in 1821 for a timeframe.Civilizations range from Portugal, England, Denmark, Bohemia, Venice, Ottomans, in Europe (plus many, many minor factions like Brunswick, Aragon, Hesse, Burgundy, Utrecht, etc.) to the Ming Dynasty in China or the Date, Shimazu, Uesugi, and other clans in Japan to the Aztec, Maya, Iroqouis, Inca, or Huron tribes of the Americas. Now there is the ability to research technologies and form ideologies which help to shape the focus of your empire. Do you want to have a small, yet qualified military to protect your trading empire? Or a massive military with no desire for colonization? Do you want to create spies to infliltrate and sabotage relations of other nations, ending alliances? Or maybe cause a rebellion to rise before declaring war?The world is in your hand in this game, it is still just as complex and beautifully deep as other Paradox strategy games, but now it is mastered. I would heartily recommend this game to anybody who likes deep strategy and does not care just about explosions, Star Craft or Total War styled battles."

Next to EUIV, the arguably most popular strategy game around, Civ V, is strategy for 4-year olds.Having played this after investing hundreds of hours in Crusader Kings II, it really feels ""right"". While CK2 focused more on the individual characters, with a lot of rich RPG-like elements and a lot of intrigue and diplomacy, EUIV takes a more high-level approach, that really works to its benefit.It's not an extremely easy game to get into to, but it's not as difficult to ""learn as you go"" as you might think. Overall, I think it's the more accessible of the EU series thus far.The sheer amount of content and possibilities in this game makes it worth to play again and again, in ever more challenging scenarios and starting nations. No two games will ever be alike, even with the same starting conditions.In terms of actual gameplay, success hangs in managing the fine balance of resources, diplomacy and opportunities that arise. It's tough, but fair. It never really feels like you're losing for no good reason. The AI is aggressive and will exploit your weaknesses, but there's always a way around it, even if you only realize it when it's already too late. It feels real, like something that would've happened in real life.To sum it up, buy it and play the heck out of it. Get CK2 while you're at it, too.

Europa Universalis IV gives you a chance to rewrite and map out your favourite alternate histories and run your own experiment in perverse Machiavellian politics. So If you're the sort of person who doesn't have the patience to go through the grind that an average bill takes to get past the senate or if you're a Sith then you'd best look away, because this game most certainly does not deal in absolutes.Winning isn't really winning. Actually I really haven't figured out how to win in this. It's rather vague, since there are no victory conditions just the end of time or the demise of your empire whichever comes first.Playing as Muscovy I decided that it was my duty to defeat my rival Novograd who'd slighted me and showed the temerity of boasting a trade hub which from the tutorial I gathered was an important thing. I managed to capture each province, but when it came to negotiate it turned out that I'd have to give most of their land back else face crushing penalties, revolts and frantic red flags on my console.It did take me nearly as many hours as agreed upon by Nato's  latest report as to how long it would take Vladimir Putin to march through the Baltics. After which I turned my attention to the growing threat of the Lithuania who seemed to have allied with Poland and harboured a delicious looking Kiev. But, there rose another threat in the form of the Ottomans to the South and I decided it'd be best to go east for the next few…hours or decades.To colonies the vast expanses of Siberia I had to turn to the tech tree which lets the player spend points garnered in Administration, Military and Diplomacy. Some of the abilities that each trait unlocks takes a leap of faith, but take it with a pinch of salt, the system seems balanced enough and each decision is a tough call. So despite the rather vague relations I enjoyed the tech trees as it put me in the place of the fictional Chancellor who'd have to sigh and raise his hands and say 'If only…' and 'for the greater good.' Another great though frustrating thing about the points is that you can decide between the short term and the long term uses. The short term allows you to hire generals, boost stability to prevent rebellions and drive down inflation and boost coffers. The long terms affects the tech advances and lets you keep an even footing with your neighbours and rivals.Religion and culture aspects are easy to understand, trade less so. At times it does feel like it's getting too anal but hey remember the process of that bill? It's going to be a long haul for incremental gains.At least the UI is easy to manage, A large button gives you a panel dropdown of almost anything you need. You can pause, slow down and speed up while you consider important decisions. And you can hover buildings around different provinces and quickly figure out where best to place them for maximum effect from the main panel rather than going to each territory separately.The UI looks good but could feel better, it does take forever to load, doubtless cramming up all those tiny details. Directing trade is a steep learning curve with little feedback. Culture and religion could easily have been merged into a single entity. The detailed tech tree is well still a mystery after 100 hours of playing but hey that could be a good thing. Someone will probably figure it all out in another 900 hours of gameplay.Despite all that I'm still intent continuing on in my noble attempts to invade Poland."

In this game you paint out your own history in an ever so detailed fasion.  Either creating a grand colonial empire, be a war mongering country, or a simple trade company.  Sure, it may be a little intimidating to get into the game at first, but if you have a friend or watch some videos on it, you should be fine.  I would give the game a 9/10, good content, but there are some small bugs here and there and the dlc is kind of expensive.  You can share dlc with people though in multiplayer if they host it.Cheers :)EDIT: Would still recommend the game but the more I play the it, the more bs i see in the AI and how Paradox is pretty lazy in properly handling them.  AI get more ally slots, more general slots, no attrition for units, no fort maintenance on borders, lower agressive expansion, less base unrest.... you get the idea.  The thing is you can still beat them, I was able to form Italy and dismantle the HRE with a Poland, austria, massive bohemia, lithuania pu group stacked against me that was allied to russia and the ottomans.  So ey, sometimes it comes down to luck.RE EDIT: My notes above are tad bit salty but yes their AI is still fairly trash.

,Recommended,236850,15549631,"Posted: 25 April, 2015",all,Xdevo,"EUIV is a very well designed game, but the entry cost is a bit high. The tutoral isn't as helpful or as in-depth as it needed to be to serve as a strong introduction to the game; it also was apparently unupdated for patches and DLC/Expansions. After the initial time investment (I spent around 8 hours actually learning how to do various things in the game) and a trip to the wiki (eu4wiki), the massive depth of the game really shines through. The randomness of the game allows for a massive amount of replayability, which combines well with the sheer size of the game to create an experience that can last for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours. There are a few nitpicks, especially when the game refuses to say why something can't be done. There are certain moments when very unrealistic things can really break the immersion and tone of the game which is both a flaw and a testament to how well the rest of the game handles realism.While this certainly isn't something that everyone would like, and there is a good deal of time and effort input required to glean any experience from the game, the reward is an immensely deep and lengthy, yet enjoyable experience.EDIT: A note on the DLC policy of the game: The game is constantly being updated (both with improvements and some poorly thought-out mechanics) and DLC is intended to fund this. The different DLC have very different value-to-cost ratios (Art of War-good, Mare Nostrum-bad), so it's definitely better to buy the DLC on sales, since the total overall cost is a bit absurd. Some of the changes that come with the free patches can be quite divisive, and the reviews for the accompanying DLC often reflect this. The patches also have pretty bad Quality Assurance and often times bugs can remain for months after being added and reported."

,Recommended,236850,21503819,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,GamerMan7799,"Love, love, love this game. I've always loved games where you can conquer the world, Civ 5 being one of my favorites, but it also felt too simplified for me. But then I found this game, and it is wonderful. EU 4 is easily the closest to real life Conquest Simulation game I've played. And its difficult. This is not an easy game, by any means. There is a TON of stuff going on and many smaller things people don't realize they need. For example you can't just declare war whenever you want (not without a huge penalty anyways) if you want to conquer lands you first need to fabricate a claim on the lands. I would recommend that if you are coming from Civ 5 or something similar you should watch some YouTubers play the game first to get a handle on what you are expected to do, that really helped me. The game is of course not without issues, and I'll give a list of pros and cons below.Pros~ Realistic~ History is of your choosing (You want to conquer the British Isles as Scotland, you can do that. You want Norway to be the first to have colonies in Africa, you can do that, etc...)~ Challenging~ Tons of Mods (Basically if its not in Vanilla there is a pretty good chance its a mod)Cons~ World always starts out the same, and usually follows a similar path every time.~ All the DLC (I mean $150 for all the DLC, really?)~ Massive Learning Curve (Don't expect to pick up this game and have an empire spanning China to France as you could in Civ 5. At the same time don't give up if you lose a couple wars and lose a good chunk of your empire, its still possible to come back)~ Play throughs feel the same (Due to how the game sets you up, every play-through ends up feeling pretty similar, especially in the beginning. Picking a different nation to start with can change this but you can pretty much predict the first 50 years or so)Edit:So after playing several more games, and playing different countries with different goals, I can say that the same is not as ""samey"" as it initially felt it to be. Usually each game starts out with similar Alliances and stuff, but after maybe the first 5 years things can get pretty crazy."

It has many scripted events early in the game to give you the real historical feeling which stretches all the way into the late game. Although sometimes Ahistorical events happen as well as some historical events not happening on occasion which I really like because it makes every playthrough different. sometimes I start a game and I see austria fall under a union with france and other similar events happening which always make a new game interesting. Especially later in the game when it starts to really deviate from history. I feel that this game is fair in that the large nations are extremely powerful and can sometimes cause havoc throughout the world like the ottomans and france can so often do, but it is always possible no matter your size if you play smart enough to get the right alliances use the right tactics and take the right idea groups to fight back against these powers and see your little one provence minor in germany cover half of europe by 1812. All in all this is a great game with a medium-small learning curve to become decent at the game, but has tons of room for improvement untill you become truely great at the game.I will also like to note that with the new DLC soon coming out that looks amazing and I love the fact that paradox keeps this game alive by constantly pushing out updates and DLC. Now I understand that people are upset with having to buy so much DLC, but the DLC they put out truely adds much more to the game, and its not like the BS DLC you see in other games where they release the game and have DLC at the beginning for ""extra"" stuff that was already developed before the release. The DLC they make in this game is new stuff, new ideas as this game is a living game and is constantly having more and more add ons and that is one thing I really love about this game, and why I have the most hours on this game than any other game.Oh and the hundreds of mods that give so much more shelf life to the game."

I have played the older EU games and the total war series... Man was i wrong when i thought that.Firstly i played the tutorial, i'm someone that always plays it no matter what game, well the tutorial itself was already hard because the whole UI was different, after a few hours i got the UI in my head. So yeah that was a piece of cake.The game itself was really hard for me, i was so used to the total war series and its warfare and diplomacy.After a long time reading the EU4 wiki i began to understand how the game worked. Diplomacy was not like just doing it you had to think ahead in time.Warfare was different too like a siege, you just need a general to get a better siege, also attacking the stronghold while the walls were still standing was a bad idea. Well i learned that.Best of all you can pick all the countries, this gave me so much freedom that i sometimes still abuse till this very day.Even passing through any new reforms, and new technologies really feel like they do something to your country as a whole and its people.The game itself doesn't provide any turnbased gameplay, no it's all realtime even the multiplayer.You think you can be powerfull as Germany, France, England or Russia or any other country? Well forget it, if you're too agressive other countries will go in a pact against you, i mean come on man the AI feels so smart in this game, yes sometimes it's bad but hey it's a game.ModdingAfter playing this game for a while i wanted some different gameplay so i installed mods, like the Extended Timeline Mod, which really recommend,but only after you've played the original game first!After installing some music, graphical and other mods that change gameplay, the game felt even more differently!ImmersiveDon't get me wrong, this game is not immersive like Battlefield, Call of Duty or Red Orchestra (2).This game is more immersive like you're really feeling that you belong to the country and it's ""digital"" people. If something happens in your land that has any influence to your land and its people you really have the feeling to do something about it, well you better do it otherwise you get ♥♥♥♥ed in the **** later on.But i mean, man my country is devided by its religion, the other side is catholic. Meanwhile the protestant part wants a reform.Netherlands! ^^.Even forming the Netherlands as Utrecht in IronMan mode was a ♥♥♥♥♥, i had luck  that France was willing to help me fight against Burgundy. Even though if the king died i would have to face Austria.Yes the game can be confusing, but also very very simplistic.So many shiny buttons yet so few.OverallI recommend this game to anyone even you haven't played any EU series, i promise you this game provides a totally different gameplay then most other strategy games.This game is a grand stratagy game not just any ordinary strategy game. so what are you waiting for!start throwing money at your screen, just freaking now.

If you have a thirst for world domination and do not like people to tell you how to get there, then this game is for you!You get so many avenues of approach it will become a whole thesis just to list them all. It's about building your country, keeping your friends close and enemies closer, its about building up your army and staying ahead in technology, so that your armies get that edge they deserve! Its about the buildup to the perfect coup de gras.One thing this game does well if to present choices without dumming down the mechanics, in fact it is my experience that with new expansions they ad or expand on gamemechanics making the game more and more immersive, and thus giving the player even more ways to move ahead. This means however that the game has a steep learning curve for new players. You can expect to spend the first 10 or so hours to get a good grip of the basics and still have trouble beating your larger neighours. But the satifaction when you first manage to take down France is immense!To help you, there is a very good and fleshed out wikipage, that for the most part gets updated almost instantly after new expansions gets released.For me, and this is the reason ive reached this many hours on the game, is multiplayer. Going into multiplayer with friends or finding players through the paradox forums, will add a whole new game experience to the mix. Every area of the game gets improved, war, diplomacy etc. The multiplayer part does have a few problems though, as with most paradox games, the game can get unstable after a while, and out of sync problems can and will happen. Slower computers or computers with unstable or slow internetconnection will also present a problem, but can for the most part be solved with slowing down gametime.I recommend this game because there are so many fun hours to be had. Because the way you want to play it, is entirely left up to the player, and because Paradox seens genuinly interested in improving upon this game with its now many expansions."

Interesting mechanics, a huge array of choices as who to play, great fun even if you're playing as some minor Asian nation and a brilliant modding community and randomness to each game that provides unlimited replayability. If you want a grand strategy that provides challenge, immersion and depth then this is the game for you.It's not without it's faults, namely it's worryingly large number of bugs, but Paradox is constantly patching and updating the game on an almot monthly basis fixing most as the pop up. Multiplayer can be a bit funny, but I've had great fun playing it online with a few friends, conquering entire continents between us.Furthermore, many nations provide a very interesting situation where you must tread carefully and take risks to advance, which is something I feel lacking in many strategy games. I often find many games lackjing any real sense of risk, more often a simple pattern holding true to each game. EU4 overcomes this rather well. Nations like Najd, Songhai or any of the Infian nations provide great interesting events and challenges, with even more round the corner when the Europeans turn up at your door!Overall I'd rate this an 8/10. I've personally never encountered a single bug, but I'm aware other in the community have to great extent and so it would be foolish to pretend they don't exist. Certainly this game is playable and most of all, fun. If you enjoy any paradox game, you'll enjoy this."

What one would dismiss as simple flavor (unit graphics, etc.) is actually an integral part of EU IV, the latest game using the Clausewitz engine, which basically freed this genre from its old horrible graphics. The GUI could use a little bit more work, and it's as clunky as it has always been with Paradox games, but it does the job well and there are major improvements nonetheless.Historical accuracy is also fascinating, although one could have some problems with how some historical events are translated into the game's language (modifiers, rewards, etc. sometimes may not exactly reflect the impact some of these events had in the history of the Empire that the player chooses to play.It still is a fascinating piece of art, with an engaging gameplay that can glue one to the chair for hours end.

I'm not willing to spend another £22 pounds on top of the piles of money already wasted on a game - Everyone else has already gone into detail on why the DLC policy is awful and how extortianate it is. You don't get the full game experience unless you keep on buying the DLC as they come out, and even then you'll never know when they will just drop the game straight up. Some DLC are way overpriced and some DLC shouldn't even cost, being £5 and adding all of two features whilst simultaneously REMOVING features from the game that were in there previously pretty much forcing you to keep on buying their stuff. Until they change their ridicolous policies across ALL OF THEIR GAMES I will not continue to buy any more from Paradox and neither should anyone else - the only way to prevent distuistging trade practices such as these is to hit them at their wallet. Paradox does not care about their community at all, and take negative critisicim awfully - it often feels like it's run by a bunch of children, not business professionals.

Rather, it is also a history simulator.In your usual strategy game franchises like Civilization and Age of Empires, you start equally from zero: a first city, a few citizens / worker, no significant military power, no obvious technological advantages, and sometimes randomized map. Things are quite different in EUIV, since it's really asymmetric. Big nations like Ottoman or Austria have a powerful military, rich provinces and strong diplomatic influence from start, while small nations like one-province Albania or Irish nations have a few number of army and frightening neighbors. Technology starts almost the same, but from time to time European powers will almost always have a big technological advantages against Asian, African and Native American nations.This game don't shy away from the fact of European hegemony in 1444-1821. However, that doesn't mean the European power will always ""win"" the game. In fact, most of the satisfying experience is turning the tide of history: trample the Iberian shores as Aztec, invade British isles as an Indian nation, prevent European from getting a foothold in the Spice Islands as South East Asian nations, or, if you are crazy enough, try to conquer the world as Ryukyu, a Japanese one-province nation in nowadays Okinawa. Playing smart with intricate network of diplomacy is the key here, as waging war is not only the solution.EUIV is also sometimes an overwhelming game for many people. It is complex, have a steep learning curve and the in-game tutorial is not really helping. It's best to read the wiki and watch other people's play to learn and refine your playing skill, as many nations have very different playing strategy, style and even gameplay mechanics. The number of DLC is also overwhelming, but actually the essential ones aren't that many.There are many gameplay elements that I didn't cover here, like economy and trade, religion, rebel, colony, diplomatic relations, justification of war (Casus Belli), military and battle mechanics, internal factions, etc. But that's another topic for another day."

,Recommended,236850,14680294,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Petrosin,"One of the best Paradox creations of all time. While for experienced in RTS games players it is noob-friendly, it can be actually quite confusing and complicated for new comers to understand the concept and purpose of all the factors included. As the name of the game says, it's mainly concentrated in Europe as the timeline in the game goes from the years 1444-1821. The game adapts many features and it's very comfortable for the user to actually control everything, the simulation of economy, war and diplomacy is really well done and there are many unique features and events that could help you even more. While there is a tutorial, for the new-comers it won't be the best of help. The game is purely built on historical map (almost entirely correct) and after you pick a date and begin with a country, you can change the concept of history entirely.Although mentioned that the war mechanics were good, they aren't exactly ideal. or sometimes realistic. There aren't any really factors that influence the combat other than the terrain, manpower and.. some rolling dice. You can accept it as a kind of a chance game or even gambling. The diplomacy branch is good on the other side. There are special points - Administrative, Military and Diplomatic points and each of them have their sole purpose. I won't go exactly in detail about them, but there are special 'people' - Diplomats, Merchants, Missionaries and so on. This is the mechanic I really like, as it's a defining point of the game and it can perform many actions. Another factor is the monarch (or the ruler), and he's a pretty valuable in the game too. There are many skipped parts but this is the main look of the game and its welcoming to the people.TL;DR: Like Strategy? Like History? This is the game for you. Give it a go!9/10"

Having spent hours in the game by now I can safely say it's one of the best things I've ever bought even at full price. In this game, the world is truly your playground and you decide how to write your country's history. Do you form a greater union through diplomacy? Do you decide to be the explorer and become the colonial superpower? Do you rather become an economical and trade-focused nation or will you be known for your military domination and conquest of the world? The choices are yours. The chance to play as any country and to steer it in your way really makes this game a lot of fun and not a single playthrough, even if choosing the same country, will end up the same.While the normal singleplayer is quite fun (do mind however that on the easier and normal difficulties most nations' AI won't prove to be all that challenging for the more experienced player), I've gotten most of my fun so far out of the multiplayer and the Ironman mode. The latter required to obtain achievements in this game, it really ups the difficulty from a more casual playthrough. The multiplayer itself is also very user-friendly, it is easy to find and join games or to create your own and play with your friends. While playing against one another you might expect the toughest challenges to come in the game, playing cooperatively can also prove to be very entertaining. (As well as I like to just watch how the larger historical nations such as France and England can be torn apart through well-coordinated warfare) However in multiplayer you must pay heed that you will most likely not play at the same speed as you're used to in singleplayer games, while it might just increase the time you spend on it, it won't be a burden in the long run however.If you're a fan of grand yet real time strategy games this is a true recommendation for you if you haven't yet played it.Also if you think the price is too high? Just pick it up on a sale, this game is on sale quite often. If you want even more fun you can also of course add some of the DLC which adds even more content to the game for you to enjoy! Although a lot of the DLC also is purely cosmetic, so the choice is yours. In its entirity the game itself is a good game without any added content."

Ok, for starters: if you're not into strategy games (yet), you can stop reading now. This game is not going to get you into the genre. If you already like your Total War, your Civilization and your Age of Empires and you want something bigger, harder and more complex: Paradox Interactive has you covered. They have grand strategy games in just about any historical time where people liked to kill other people in a somewhat orderly fashion. And they're all good. Hell, some of them are great, and especially Crusader Kings II is a gem which you should definitely check out. But Europa Universalis IV is the best of the lot, and far easier to get into. The UI is better, the visuals and soundtrack are pretty, and the modding community is large and awesome. The updates and DLC are also still coming out regularly. The price combined with the DLC's may seem quite pricey, and perhaps it's best to wait for a sale, but most of the updates have always been free, and the DLC is never absolutely required for a full experience - *angry glare at CK II*. I still think it's worth it, though: You can pour hundreds of hours into the base game, and hundreds more into the mods.Of course, the game isn't perfect. Paradox's Multiplayer tends to be as stable as your relationship with your girlfriend after they just released a new game. Europa Universalis IV doesn't quite go down to the usual♥♥♥♥♥♥drinkingly bad level, but the regular desync or bug which requires everyone to restart their ****** game again (which also takes ages) before you can continue again can become an annoyance fairly quickly. The Tutorial is also a pile of garbage, and I recommend to just watch a let's play on youtube instead.But all in all, watching my Etheopian Empire stretch from Egypt to South Africa, holding off the English an the Portuguese colonists, and winning that crucial battle against the ottomans... There is no greater feeling in this world.9/10 recommended."

I have spent so many long hours playing this and I can always come back and expect a completely different experience. No nation plays out another, and even starting a new game as the same nation will turn out drastically different than the last. There is even good variance in difficulty, proving a challenge for those new, and to more experienced players. All in all, definately pick this game up if you are into strategy games, and if you aren't then wait for it to go on sale and grab it. Bit of a learning curve attached but once you overcome it, expect hours upon hours of enjoyment."

For me, EU-IV is the first Paradox game I've played that is both highly-detailed as well as accessible. Hearts of Iron III, set in a more interesting time period personally, often came up short because the details were interesting but not exactly well-presented or described. And the AI is actually quite competent at determining how weak or strong you are and when to attack.EU-IV's strengths:+ Diplomacy has many, many options+ Single-player is strong because of how well the AI tends to be+ DLC model is not absurd (DLCs add mechanics, features, etc... each nation comes with the base game).+ Replayability is high (especially with the New World DLC or whatever than randomizes the Western Hemisphere).EU-IV's weaknesses:- Still a little obtuse, at times (info isn't always readily at hand or understandable, but better than HoI3).- Music for the base game is very repetative even after just a couple hours (buying music DLC helps, or listening to an I-pod)- Settings for gameplay are nowhere near as detailed as Civ V's (Ironman mode enforces most options, no other maps but the one).- If you managed to learn HoI3 and really enjoyed it, there's the issue of military strategy in this game being a little thread-bare in comparison.The strengths, though, are in much more important areas than the weaknesses. Since I don't play multiplayer, I can't speak to that, although from what I gather the multiplayer tends to have the same flaws of most large strategy games (connection issues, de-syncs, bugs, etc.). But as far as single-player strategy games go, EU-IV is the best in a long time.I truly prefer Total War games because of the way those games combine tactics and strategy, but after the mess that Rome 2 became, I picked up EU-IV and put a good chunk of time into it. So, coming from a Total War player who played HoI3 and was sort of mixed about it because of how badly it sometimes conveyed important information to you, I have to say, EU-IV is a phenomenal game.Really, despite it not being my normal style, I have to say EU-IV is fantastic. It's just the right mixture of simplicity (Crusader Kings 2 was ultimately too simplistic for me outside of the personality traits and all the characters in your kingdoms) and complexity (HoI3 was highly detailed, but sometimes lost cohesion because of this).I'd recommend EU-IV any day, and right now (11/28/2014, Black Friday), it's $9.99."

A single playthrough can take 20 hours or more if you go slow and pause frequently so be prepared to dedicate a ton of time sitting watching manpower recover and provinces getting cored.

,Recommended,236850,17107944,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,kgambit,"Europa Universalis IV is a global grand strategy game covering the period from 1444 to 1820.  The game is complex and rich in detail.  It offers extensive replayability not only in the choice of nations (from the great nations of Europe or Asia, a small merchant state or a american / meso-american tribe) but the strategic path you take to build your empire. You can start with a great power such as France or England and carve a path of conquest thru Europe, or start  with a small merchant state and expand thru trade. Choose Spain and build an empire by colonizing the New World (and Africa and Asia), or perhaps start as the Incas and conquer meso-america.  The gameplay choices are endless.The game does have a fairly steep learning curve and requires a fair amount of micro managing to build and maintain your empire.  You'll need to build relations, create alliances, establish colonies, protect your trade, create vassals, suppress revolts, arrange royal marriages, research different techologies, establish national policies and embark on military conquests while calling on your allies for support (and cursing them when they tell you to get lost).  And that's just a small sample of the myriad of decisions.There is a lot of DLC available for the game.  Each expansion release coincides with a game update that introduces free new mechanics while the expansion expands those mechanics with additional features.  While the base game remains playable without the expansions, the full impact of the new mechanics is lost without the expansions.  That's  subjective and a matter of personal taste.  Additional DLC in the form of unit, portrait and song packs are simply a matter of choice.Of all of Paradox's strategy games, this one is probably my favorite.  The incredible detail and broad range of options make this a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy games.   If micro-managing isn't your cup of tea, then give the game a wide berth.As you can see from my accumulated playtime (1,288 hrs) the game can be really addictive"

Just about every nation and every game will give you a very unique experience. For instance: playing with Songhai is very different from playing with Granada, Portugal or one of the daimyos (in Japan). Even if you start two new games with the same nation, you're likely to experience some very different challenges as relationships with other nations can easily turn the table to your advantage or disadvantage. Big empires can crumble like a deck of cards or they can shine and get virtually unstoppable. An obvious tip: Pick your allies carefully. Having some very powerful allies can definitely guarantee an unlikely survival (as my game with Granada taught me).As for complexity, I think EU IV is complex enough to be a turn off for many players who prefer simplistic mechanics, without all the strategy that's inherent to a game like EU IV.It's not a game for those who want a ton of action. It's not that type of game, it's not fast-paced, it's a game for those who are patient and enjoy using their intelligence. It's not about how fast you move your mouse or how fast you press your keys. It's about how smart and lucky you are during each new decision. Poorly planned wars, economy, diplomacy, technology or bad national policies can lead to catastrophic results for your nation.It's a rather difficult game to play unless you pick one of the big empires (France, Spain, Ottomans). And even then there's a learning curve if you don't want to get ruined quickly.Replayability is great, since each new game you start produces some very different outcomes and challenges. Oh and I almost forgot: Objectives. There are no fixed objectives, you set your own personal objectives or you can try to get the Steam achievements, some of them are pretty challenging such as the ""Re-Reconquista"", in which you have to conquer the whole Iberian Peninsula with Granada. Achievements are available only in the ""Iron Man"" mode, which is basically a ""hardcore mode"" (very difficult) since you can't use multiple save games, you're stuck with a unique save game per game that gets automatically updated with everything you do, there's no way to go back and so you ""can't fix stupid"". :)I totally recommended this game for many hours of gameplay."

All elements of this game have pretty good depth so that you really feel that you manage a whole country with will all its aspects including colonization, trade, diplomacy, and warfare. The game is pretty huge but the learning curve it's not that big as it may seem in the beginning, doing the tutorials and alt+tab-ing in the wiki whenever you don't understand something should have you covered as long as you're not in too much of a hurry. This game is like a more in depth Civilization game with more focused mechanics for elements of that era, also the combat system is net superior.Regarding the DLC practices, on which there are some heated debates, I'm going to say a couple of things. First is that I love that the game is being made better and developed continuously, and active development would very difficult without more money pouring in. That being said, I do agree with many people that the pricing is less than ideal at this moment. Also, understanding what the main DLCs are, and what they do, is probably not very obvious for the average person (again, check the wiki, it's invaluable). The second thing that I would like to mention is that the DLCs make the game richer, breath wise, but they don't necessarily improve already existing mechanics. People can enjoy the game even without all the DLCs.This is a really great game that has a ton to offer; you even have the option to have custom countries as opposed to the rigid, but historically accurate, starting world. But I do have a couple complaints. First one and the most painful is the AI. It's not bad, but for a game that is centered on a single player experience and that has been under constant development for so much time, the AI is just not all that good. And to add to my pain, the difficulty level where the AI plays best, is a difficulty level where the AI also has some bonuses, so there is no difficulty setting where there is a leveled play field and the AI just plays its best. Another problem that I have is that the ""estates"" idea (implemented in The Cossacks DLC) is a very good one but I find its implementation lazy and uninspired. There are a few other things that I would like improved, but going too much into details will make this article too long. The game has a great moding scene and there are some overhaul mods that are very appreciated, there are even mods for the AI.Rating: 3 DLCsRecommendation: Do you have too much money and time on your hands?

76561198009552056,Recommended,236850,17011947,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,Tharmas,"I would overall describe Europa Universalis 4 as a deeply engaging strategy game, rich in detail, with complex and intelligently designed game mechanics, and boasting a high degree of replayability. It is well deserving of the title Grand Strategy Game, both in terms of the sheer time invested in a single playthrough, in terms of depth of gameplay, the strategic elements, and the amount of freedom you as a player has to take your nation in different directions either through military conquest, exploration, diplomacy or trade.You start out in 1444 playing as one of the world's roughly 300 (?) starting nations (although the colloquial term 'nation' might not be entirely appropriate here, since you can also play as a variety of american and meso-american indian tribes, central asian nomadic steppe hordes, and so on). The game runs in real time all the way to 1820, which takes a while to get to even with the game running at highest speed (my recent Great Britain campaign gave me roughly two weeks solid of gameplay, although my gamepace may be quite slow compared to the young and healthy gamers of today).In the allotted space of time that consists the Early Modern Period in history you are free to decide whether you want to expand your nation's borders through conquest (perhaps playing as one of the superpowers of the day like France, Austria, England or the Ottomans), or explore the world with ships and eventually colonizing parts of it, or whether you want to pick a more peaceful route as a small but wealthy merchant state, play a tactical diplomacy game or just trying to survive as as a small nation and perhaps one day even growing into a superpower yourself. The game in short offers a lot of variability in playstyle, and also a lot of entertainment for the counterfactual history nerds out there (what do you mean Norway didn't colonize California and Hawaii in the 1600s?)Having not played any earlier iterations of the game (I am somewhat familiar with Hearts of Iron 3, another of Paradox's flagship titles) I feel as if I picked the very best time to enter into this series. Not only is it Paradox's most polished and well-designed games to date, it is also the game that seems to have brought them to a much broader (if perhaps not exactly a mainstream) audience. While I am ill placed to give a detailed comparison of EU4's gameplay to the gameplay of earlier titles, it does seem that this is the first time they've managed to combine all the gameplay elements in such a well-designed, overall consistent and appealing package. The game is by no means easy to get into for the uninitiated to deep strategy games (and it doesn't help that the tutorial feels a bit lackluster), but once you get an understanding of the basic elements of play it quickly draws you in - even if all of the possible strategic decisions you can make in the interest of your nation's welfare may seem overwhelming at first.In summary, I would heartily recommend EU4 to anyone interested in strategy games of any sort, and especially if you appreciate complex gameplay and strategic decision making over graphic fidelity and fast-paced action.A final warning/disclaimer: There is a danger of turning autistic from playing this game. If you are susceptible to forgetting basic necessities in life because you are busy crunching numbers, turning dials, figuring out army composition ratios and all in all paying extraordinary amounts of attention to very minute details, then this game may not be for you."

By playing as the recommended nations at the beginning and limping your way through the game, it is very easy to figure out the basic mechanics of the game. By watching channels such as Arumba, Quill18, Shenyyr2 and others, you can get an a good taste of what is going to be in the game. Watching the most recent videos is a must because the game updates frequently and changes are constantly made to the game to help improve the playability for new and experienced players. The game also offers a lot of different paths in which you can take your country. I personality have played 5 Brandenburg->Prussia-> Germany games and three Russia games courtesy of this. The game also makes you want to achieve more the next time you play and each time you play you will learn a lot more about the games properties that you can take into the next game.In comparison to other strategy games such as the Civilization Series and others, this game offers a lot more to newer, and more experienced players. In Europa, the game makes it very hard for you to ""lose"". In Civilization, there are cases in which your entire civ can be eaten at once because of the broken happiness mechanics. In Europa, game mechanics such as over-extension prevent other countries from eating you in one gulp. Keeping this in mind, it is important to select countries that cannot be annexed in one war so you have wiggle room. Castile, Portugal, England are prime examples. All have relatively stable borders and have relatively easy neighbors to conquer. This makes it easy for you to first learn the basic mechanics. The game includes more in depth methods of controlling income, trade, military and diplomacy among others. One thing about the game that puts it above others is that the game is epic without DLC's. Civilization falls into the trap that it is completely necessary for you to spend $90+ dollars on expansions to make the game balanced. In Europa, the expansions that come out are accompanied by giant updates that add the core elements of the expansions into the base game. The game also has tons of music packs and lots of unit reskins to help customize the game.There are some problems with the game however. The game has a very long play time. In a game as France, a country that requires a small amount of micromanaging because of it's god troops, it took me five hours to go from the standard 1444 start to the 1495 with wars against England and Burgundy. The game also has some broken mechanics as well. The French get really good troops, early on in the game when historically, they only had really good troops towards the end of the captain. France can take on half of Europe in a war and win because of there national ideas. Prussia and Sweden also have really good ideas but they start in precious positions, on has three provinces and on with low force limit and manpower respectively. There is still a lot changes in the game being made and some should be addressed eventually however. The game also suffers from graphical glitches as well when zoomed out and late game it also has performance issues for people with the minimal requirements.If you get this game, you are in for a lot of fun. The community is really good. Paradise Plaza has hundreds of posts that explain how people made there country into powerhouses.

,Recommended,236850,8867337,"Posted: 27 January, 2014",all,Jonas,"This is one of the greatest grand strategy games out there along with CK2. Basically you pick any country (that exists) in the world from near the end of the Middle Ages in 1444 A.D. to 1821 A.D. at the end of the Napoleonic age and you play them until the game ends at 1821. Everything is historically based and of course there are hundreds of countries to pick from meaning you'll spend hours and hours of this game just playing a new and different country each time. Each game length varies, but I'd say at least a full twenty four hours each if you really immerse yourself. Every single experience for each country is not the same, as most countries have unique ideas that affect the way you play each country, and they all aren't equally powerful, meaning different approaches and strategies have to be used in order to be successful. Want to change history? You could save Constantinople from the Turks and restore the Roman Empire, or you could even take over Britain as Ireland. The possibilities are endless. Downsides? Not much, however the game and UI can be overwhelming to some at first."

I now understand just how simple Civ V is compared to this game. It's extremely indepth, you practically choose what your citizens eat for dinner*. If you're a hardcore strategy gamer, this game is possibly one of the best you can find in the store, offering a wide range of abilities to any player.Based in the renaissance era, you can control any country within Eurasia, North America, Central America and even some of Africa and the Middle East. Most of these countries are thoroughly fleshed out, offering different kinds of gameplay depending on whom you border etc. Specific areas of history allow the player to change the course entirely. For instance, the British can defeat the Americans in the War of Independence, or the French Royalists can defeat the Republicans. It's totally up to you.Do not go into this game thinking it has some sort of Total War battles, as it's very different. The success of battles are dependant on the morale of your troops, numbers, terrain, defenses. Over time the enemy (or you!) will be worn down and eventually rout. It's a very different system that contrasts nicely with the standard Total War battle system that I'm so used to.In summary, this game is extremely bloody complicated! But so damn good!"

A lot of these DLCs are merely fixing the broken vanilla mechanics, or adding tiny features which should have been included in the first release (Muslim portraits). Even in this age of paid addons, most companies would issue small patches and tweaks where Paradox have instead released US$15 DLC packs. This is a great game, by all means.

Nevertheless I won't recommend it to anyone curious to buy it.First of all, the pricing of the base game and DLC's is ridiculous. All content is still the same price as when it was released. For the base game that is almost 4 years ago. Paradox only lowers their prices during sales. This makes it €100 - €200 for just buying the base game and some DLC's during non-sales. If the base game was decently playable without DLC, this wouldn't be that big of a deal. But it has become increasingly dependent on some gameplay mechanics that DLC's have brought over the years.The question thus arises why one shouldn't just buy those ""mandatory"" DLC's. This is where the horrible DLC-packaging comes in. For example, the development mechanic in provinces has become one of the most important aspects of EU4. Playing the game without it has become increasingly harder over the years because patches and other DLC's are being made with players having access to this feature in mind. The DLC that provides this feature, Common Sense, is €20. All other features of this DLC are minor and very situational. This makes it €20 for one very crucial game mechanic. The same goes for Art of War, that made war times much easier to manage with new features. However, it again provided redundant situational features that one doesn't need. But having those features in the DLC still keeps the price at €20. This makes the bare minimum to get baseline enjoyment out of the game already €80, with just two DLC's and the base game.The big problem with EU4 therefore is that the DLC's are massively overpriced and won't go down in price, yet provide a gameplay mechanic that is crucial to get a decent game experience. Furthermore, because all new developments are being made with the access to these mechanics in mind, the base game gets increasingly harder and more frustrating to play without DLC's. To get a decent enjoyment out of EU4, one will feel compelled to buy these overpriced DLC's and this will only increase with new expansions that bring more of these mechanics. How can I ever recommend a game that can't stand on it's own anymore without DLC's  and is so overpriced that you have to wait for a sale to buy it!?"

(Just in case you thought it was like Rise of Nations where you start from the 'Ancient Age')I played through the Spanish tutorial where the cheap infantry build in 10 days and then picked Gujarat, where all my units took 60+ days to build (presumably because no westernization yet). Then, all my provinces start out Hindu, but it starts Gujarat out as Muslim. There is no option to change state religion directly. I wanted to change it to Hindu rather than convert every one of my provinces to Islam. Apparently, you can do it by inciting a Hindu rebellion and agreeing to change religion, but I started losing a war against Mewar and stopped playing after that. I probably should have learned the game using a European country first, but I didn't really want to anymore.Non-western countries are completely gimped because they have to ""Westernize"". It would have been very easy to just call that option ""Modernize"". Yes, Europe ended up dominating historically, and I know it's called *EUROPA* Universalis, but in games like this history always unfolds slightly differently each playthrough. It's easy to act contrary to history as a European country, but not as most others (people say Ming is really strong?). As others may have mentioned, technological feats of non-Western cultures are barely acknowledged if at all. Also portraits for advisors for Gujarat are of Europeans. That didn't bother me as much as being forced into hard mode, but for those who want to know, the further you get from Europe, the more the country feels like an afterthought (It's EUROPA Universalis, okay, but it also has Universal(is) in the name).If you're a Western history buff, I guess you'll like this game despite the narrow historical focus. If you were looking to play as your own country and have fun, be aware that your country might be really hard to play.The graphics are alright; it's a menu driven game so I base that on the details on the different map views and how the interface looks overall.I paid $25 for the game with a bunch of bundled DLC/expansions or whatever during June 2015's summer sale.

Also even if you have the DLC the constant ""Patches"" they release break your previous games making them un-compatible and unusable preventing you from having a fufilling and satisfying game. There is no way to stay up to date while keeping your saves yet but I am sure a DLC will be made eventually allowing to use this. Parodox I have to say this I loved you as a brother I looked foward to playing your game but now you have turned into a money whoring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have decided to ♥♥♥♥ your loyal fan base, and I just have to ask why? You make boatloads of money already without forcing your players to buy the DLC that has become over-priced as well. You are not suffering for cash clearly as you have released so many updates and DLCs recenetly so why? is it a twisted enjoyment? Is it because you finally fought France? Did the Dirkas tickle your pickle? I just want to know and I want you to fix this before you lose your fan base and what is left hides out in the older versions of the game hoping you do not take that away too and make it a DLC, and now that I gave you the idea I hope you at least give me credit for it when you make the DLC and give it to me for free. The best part about it though is you put the game on sale for less than the DLC, clearly showing the DLC is more valuable and more precous to you than your own game and your own pride. Fallout 4 while still riding its wave of hype offered a better sale price than you I mean come on that game was out for a week or two before and already lowered prices while you keep your prices for stuff you released over a year ago. So to wrap up I loved you paradox but you went to the dark side and ♥♥♥♥ed me and your entire community in the but with what you have done.                                                                                                                                                                              0/10  (♥♥♥♥♥♥)""Common sense"" ruined your game GG -IGN"

Well, for everyone who can't pull 200+ €  out their♥♥♥♥♥for a single full game.The DLCs add crucial game mechanics and not extra, fun content that is not crucial to the game. The Leviathans pack for stellaris is a great example of a good DLC. It just adds giant boss space monsters. The DLC doesn't feel like a paid patch unlike 99% of paradox's DLCs. Furthermore, it doesn't cost HALF THE ♥♥♥♥ING PRICE OF THE GAME. Most of DLCs for eu4 are shoddy and most likely put together in a max of 1 business week.Yet you charge 20€ for it.

76561198050453884,Not Recommended,236850,33978491,Posted: 2 August,all,tommytcizzle,"I'll start by saying two things.First, I almost never, EVER, write a review for anything. Cafes, food, movies, books, games, whatever. Even when I'm dissatisfied, I understand how oftentimes people are doing their best to put a product out and not everyone will like it. I respect the game in that way. Secondly, I'll say that when I first got this game, I absolutely loved it. Such a blast, I have a ton of hours logged.However, with all of that being said, as patient of a person as I am and as much as I appreciate the struggle of running a business model and maximizing profits, the DLC stuff is beyond absurd. I don't really have any words for it. I click on the drop down bar for DLC and it's a million miles long, with most of the important DLC priced upwards of $20, and even small things like unit packs priced at $10. Dudes...What. The. Heck.I understand and appreciate that your team and Paradox in general need to be successful to turn a profit and make/improve games. I get it, really, we all do here. That's why we buy them, because the fun of the game is worth the price. And that's why many, many good and loyal customers have bought DLC upon DLC upon DLC, trying to support and give back to a game and company that has provided excellent games like HOI, EU, and CK. But there comes time when eventually, we cannot walk this path with you any further. Like an alcoholic friend yea it used to be fun going out drinking with you in college, but now it's just sad to see how far you've taken it later in life. These recent reviews, all trending negative, are an intervention for you to WAKE UP! I mean it's endless: I feel like every other month theres new content. Which would be fantastic if it didn't bump the game cost to HUNDREDS of dollars. There's only so much that loyal customers can take before they don't see it as worth and need to move on. And good luck getting new people to buy the game when it costs over $200 just to be up to speed on the modern version of it. It's going to hurt you in the end, its bad for both us and you, but you just don't seem to realize the ""you"" part yet.If the game needs this much updating and patching, maybe there's a problem with your model. if people are giving negative reviews for what was once an AWESOME game, then maybe theres a freaking problem with your business model. SO much of this should have been in the base game, or bundled as couple of large expansions instead of the multitude that are out there. Please, listen to your customers and either make DLC content less frequent or free! Hey here's an idea: if you feel like it's necessary to change EU IV into a totally different game through patching and DLC, why not just take the time to make EU V and roll it out when you feel like IV has had its run? It would be way more cost effective.I don't know who's decision to become a DLC addict it was, and I don't care. None of us care. What we care about is the game we all loved to once play, but no longer want to because it's become buggy, unaffordable, and overloaded with uneccessary changes that seem to be made just for the sake of making changes. You can turn a profit, but please, not like this. Not like this.It hurts me to write a negative review for this game, it really does. I loved conquering, developing, trading and colonizing my way to the top. I want to tell my friends to play it. But I've stopped playing the game because of this. I can't afford it, I can't deal with it and I can't subject my friends to in good conscience. I see you're starting to do the same thing with HOI IV as well...another game I love but soon fear I'll be unable to keep up with. Goodbye Paradox. Until you fix this, you will have lost many loyal followers. I'll miss the game, but you know what won't? My wallet."
76561198018656240,Recommended,236850,32986048,Posted: 29 June,all,Sartheron,"A great game which gives a very satisfying experience making your own way as a country of the past trough the ages.Now on the whole dlc discussion all I have to say is. I don't think the dlc policy right now is that bad, the prices are a bit steep. so they could certainly be lower. But I would like to see more ""beginner"" packs where you can get the base game + huge chunks of dlc for a considerable sale. Now one such pack already exists but it does not have everything you would want. And also offering a ""major"" gameplay dlc pack which have all the expansions bundled together into one for a reasonable price. and possibly another with all the cosmetic and extra dlc (unit packs, music etc). These are just some ideas I have which would allow them to keep making dlcs like this albeit overpriced somewhat, but still make it much more welcoming to new players to get up to date with the expansions without waiting for a Big sale.And what I don't understand all the uproar about is the price increase for certain regions. this is a regular company intervention everyone does it. and they are supposed to. inflation and general wealth of the country decides the pricing for that region and since the original price for these dlc's existed the affected regions have in most cases became wealthier. and thus has to have their prices risen up .Now consider the rest of the world has already been paying these high prices that many other regions now have gotten. Now I understand this will upset many people. as many are still in the same economical state as they were years ago. and as such these prices will be way too high. but well that is the sad facts. Looking at it generally comparing a country's general wealth and economical state if they are very similar, there is no reason to keep one of them at a much lower price. it would simply be unfair.Note: I do feel paradox have gotten very lazy in their development. instead of releasing a complete experience with the base game. they have started to rely too much on their dlcs. You can't say ah we will fix this or balance this or improve this later down the line with a dlc. No it does not work that way. develop and polish your game and once it is masterly done. then you can start thinking about expanding it with greater flavor and deeper mechanics. Don't release an unfinished game.Thanks for reading."

Engage in large scale diplomacy, conquest and trade while still maintaining a historical flair with flavoured events and descisions, but you can do whatever you like. Want to conquer Africa as Denmark, or play the Aztecs and bring the fight to the Europeans with a sunset invavion? No problem, though it may take you some time and effort. If you go into the game and feel overwhelmed by the detail, don't worry. The game makes sure that you learn as you play and there are plently of useful guides out there, not to mention the very good tutorial present in the game.Overall, if you enjoy strategy, history and conquering the world to your heart's content, this game is a must have. While it isn't the kind of thing that you can just dip into for ten minutes, the time commitment really is worth it for the amount of satisfaction and enjoyment that a great game like this can bring you. The DLCs are great, but the base game itself is worth the money many times over and the devs are still adding more content to the already richly detailed world."

The game features complex (but not overly complicated) diplomatic and military systems like relations, colonization, trade, devlopement (or cores), and many things that can be accomplished through diplomacy or war like vassalization, establishment of protectorates, releasing nations, and claiming the crown of another nation. There are 3 different government types and further subdivision that offer unique bonuses like promoting of being more accepting of foreign cultures, electing leaders  with [x number of years] long terms so you can choose the leaders skillset more than one can in a monarchy. There is 4 currencies, the treasury and monarch points: Diplomatic, Administrative, and Military. You can play almost every nation that existed from 1444 to 1820 and choose whether to because a colonial trade power with enormous colonies is the Americas, Africa, and south east asia (playing tall) or establish a sprawling empire by annexing your neighbors through personal unions, conquest, or vassalization (blobbing). The game is a ton of fun with huge replayability with the only setbacks being the mass amount of DLC and a bit of Eurocentrism which can be expected by simply reading the game titles."

In all of my games I am a medium power, and I do not feel like not having Common Sense has put me at a disadvantage.

Of course, it still is far more approachable than most other Paradox titles. But I felt that the tutorial is lackluster. I learned more from the loading screens than I did from the tutorial and tooltips. It's like; the tutorial teaches you all the basics which are pretty obvious and/or already explained via tooltips - but if you want some of the more hidden factors or components explained, you might be lucky enough to hit a loading screen which explains it, or you learn it given time. (As an example I spent a long time before I learned what shock and fire modifiers did, besides from obviously being the higher, the better)Another annoying, but far more subjective part, is the timeline. I've personally installed a 58-9999 timemod, because I feel the main game is too short; and even though it likes to brag about its replayability, it quickly turns into ""something you have already done"".The nation-creator from El Dorado feels like it should've been in the basic game. Paradox releases far too much DLC, it's getting scary. While I do realise most of these are flavour packs, the basic game just feels too barebones to not buy most of it.With those things out of the way:When you really understand the game (and again, I mean REALLY like, find a collection of the loading screens and read them all, because the tutorial does the game no credit), and if you have enough flavour packs and expansions to keep it varied, this is by far one of the most time-consuming and entertaining games. This is a wealthy man's videogame, make no mistake. But it is by far worth all the money."

If you like slower paced, thoughtful strategy games (like Civilization), this game is for you.  And if you like the challenge of learning a game that does NOT hold your hand this game is for you.Be warned--incredibly high learning curve for people who have not played the series before.  Crusader Kings 2 might be a better entry point for people who have never played a Paradox title before, because it has a lower (but still daunting) complexity.  That being said...This game is one of the most rewarding and engrossing strategy games ever made.  It ranks, in my mind, alongside games like Civilization Series, which I consider the gold standard of thoughtful slower paced strategy titles for the thinking man.  And MAN does this game wrack your brain.What this game does incredibly well is provide you with a wealth of options that boil down to 3 primary concerns: Expansion, Stability, and Technology.  All 3 are linked, but are ultimately competing with each other for your resources.The single most intersting feature of EU4 is in the Leadership points mechanic that is new to the series.  Instead of having technlogy points (like in past titles), EU4 introduces Monarch power, divided into Military, Diplomatic, and Administrative points.These points are CENTRAL to everything that you do.  Want to advance your technology in Military, DIplomatic or Adminstrative trees?  It costs Monarch Power.  Want to suppress the possibility of rebellion in a newly conquered region?  Military points.  Want to negotiate a punitive treaty against an enemy you beat soundly in war taking vast tracks of territory?  Diplomatic points.  Want to restabilize your country after the death of the previous monarch caused turmoil?  Administrative points.This creates a fascinating contrast between short term goals and longterm investment.  You don't want to spend too much of your power on expansion that taxes your resources on stabilizing your newly conquered territories only to watch yourself fall behind your rivals in technology and get dominated on the battlefield.Yet expansion is kind of the point of the game, so finding that sweetspot, given other competing considerations and what transpires around you is an incredile exercise in short term and long term strategic balacing that is the hallmark of any great strategy title.Highly recommended."

The guys from Paradox have done a fabulous job and the player-community whether it be on the forums, wiki, reddit or youtube and twitch is as vast, friendly and supportive as in the best way possible.In my opinion every buck spent on EUIV is worthwile as you get superb value for money. The exhaustion you feel after playing an entire campaign, the satisfaction you gain out of completing a challenging achievement, the entertainment-factor you get from watching the AI building the craziest empires - all that and more, makes EUIV an unique game.

After being frustrated by the steep learning curve, I gave up on the game and didn't revisit it until a good two years later. The second time around I did my homework prior and boy did the game really open up. Ask me two years ago if I would put 500 hours into this game it would be a hard no. Ask me today and I'll tell you how surprised I am I haven't reached the 1000 hour mark yet.The beauty of the game lies in its complexity and choice. Once you master the basic mechanics its really up to you how you want your run from 1444-1821 to pan out. You can go with the historical route and try to recreate history, or do something radically different and watch the world adapt and become something that could've been. You can focus on expanding militarily, diplomatically, or not at all. You can build empires from conquest, colonialization or trade. Every aspect of the game is well fleshed out and continues to be refined, with each patch more exciting than the last.Not gonna lie, Eu4 will take a long time to master (if indeed that is possible) but in all honesty the game is so diverse in its offerings that you will feel a sense of accomplishment every step of the way, regardless of how many hours you put into it. But I can promise you if you can put in the first 5 hours, the next 500 will come soon enough."

You can play as any country you want from 1444 - 1820. There are many amazing features in this game. You can have royal marriages with other countries, and then maybe the other country's king dies without an heir, and you can claim their throne and annex them. Another amazing thing about the game is that you can explore, discover, and colonize places such as the Americas. The game is not always historically accurate, since other countries can make different decisions instead of decisions that they actually made in real life. For example, the Portuguese colonized the Eastern coust of North America and Aragon annexed or conquered Castile instead of the other way around. But with different decisions it can make the game interesting, and YOU can make your own history."

Unlike Total War, Civilization, Men of War or Wargame, Paradox Interactive crafted a game that can be likened to a virtual and in depth form of RISK. There is little graphics to speak of, as you don't command armies and battle enemy forces on the battlefield, rather than use a map to guide your country to success through political and economic changes through various tabs and charts. Boring? For some that may be the case but Europa is for the true empire building player that goes beyond 3D castles and fortifications. Take control of a nation and guide it through five centuries of warfare, diplomacy and expansion to become a large military empire or a peaceful colonial power. Though this game doesn't only shine in an in depth single player that allows users to try and beat nearly 300 AI opponents, but truly adds something no other RTS game can provide in the real-time multiplayer.The game has the ability to allow players to craft their nation from 1444 to mid-1800s, wittling their own country out of the European mold in either a historical or personal fashion. Recreate the French empire or conquer all of England!The learning curve, like most complex RTS games, is incredibly difficult, but the payoff gives players virtually hundreds of hours of play time in both single player (trying to get those illusive achievements) and a diverse multiplayer in trying to stop other aggressive players from expanding while doing so on your own. For the price, I recommend anyone who is looking for a time consumer to pick up EU4 and get lost in it's vast replayability, or even join various communities through Paradox themselves to play around with other users."

After some time ingame i started to call myslef 'your majesty'. After some time i really started to care about history. After some time i decided to study history. For those who doubt games having an influence on someone's life, well this one had, a huge one.To the actual point:I think this is the best game to start with when it comes to paradox games, i think that CKII or Victoria are harder to cope with than this one. It took me about a day to get myself along with the game and one month to be able to fully understand it (i clearly remeber that time when i first had a mission to annex Silesia, small one-provincial state, i had no clue about how to annex vassals, so i attacked silesi and they've scattered my 25k army with only 3k men, just telling you this so you won't quit after failing horribly).I think that the trade system in the game is a bit too sophisticated for someone like me, i prefer military intervention and slaughter, but smarter guys than me will surely enjoy the trade system, tho.This game gets 15/10 becuase it will really take you in and turn you into a mad monarchist! time ingame = time spent wisely!"

Prone to be pushovers at times however.Verdict: Definute improvement from EU 3 and if your a fan of the series and Paradox's games in general I would get this...Just wait for a sale though otherwise you might get a tad of buyers remorseFor getting this in the sale I think was a great buy for it's price. It doesnt have the same deep, technical nature as its sibling Crusader Kings but that adds to its charm. You can make any country in any form and with the bustling community available you can see all types of ways games have turned out. No game is the same, not even the same load is the same when reloaded. It's a quick paced game that opens up the true nature of strategy on the world stage and is a good buy for anyone who loves a strong sense of competition that you gain even between your rival neighbours. There are numerous bugs however such as the dreaded trade power bug that can stop expansion entirely, but hopefully this can be changed through patching."

The good thing about the game is; it's more realistic than the 3rd game of the series, for an example you can make an alliance with your enemy's enemy which is really good. I highly recommend this game if you're into diplomatic strategy games, it's easy to play (not like Hearts of Iron) but if you wanna see the battlefield like in Total War Series you shouldn't waste your money.

,Recommended,236850,28369118,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,[RSU] teedee007,"After many, many hours of playing this, I thought I should give a review of the best game I've ever played. Don't mind the playtime, it's actually 3 times more, just played offline a lot.So, for starters: if you have a hard time getting into a game, don't buy this. You need at least 30 hours of playtime to not die in the first 50 years, no matter if it's rebels, alliances you didn't know about or simply a coalition against you. You fail in every way possible. It's just something you have to get through. I personally played tons of Castile games over like 2 months, because I got bored after a while. I still came back every time, because I could see what this game had to offer when you put time in it.The next country I played was Ottomans, because in one of my first games, when I finally got past the year 1500, I declared war on Ottomans because there was a crusade against them, but that made me realise how strong they are because it didn't take them long to destroy me. Especially when they are allied with Commonwealth (unbelievable but true). Ottomans is one of the easiest, maybe the easiest, country in the game, but still I needed many games before I understood how the gameplay worked.Furthermore I've played Holland, England, France, Portugal, Poland, Japan, Hamburg (realised it was a republic, so I couldn't become HRE emperor, which means that game was useless af) and Austria (why is Spain getting the Netherlands when I'm playing Austria, and Austria getting the Netherlands when I'm playing Spain?). All of these countries had a different gameplay. It was so different, that most of the time you play a country, you notice the standard events that happen and the gameplay and you think of a good way to reach your goals, then you start over, but this time for real.And this was all in normal mode, kind of the 'easy' mode. When I played this game for like 250-300 hours, I had played all these countries. Some were a succes, some weren't. At this point I could at least say that I'm decent at the game. I knew the basics, I knew how the HRE system works, trading, colonizing, but still there were many things to learn. Right now I'm in an Ironmode game, which is the other gamemode this game offers. In this gamemode, you can't go back to your last save, instead you have to go on, no matter if you're losing or not. This is where you get the achievements. This is my first Ironmode game, playing as Austria.I guess that instead of telling you what I all played, I should tell you if you should buy this game or not. Well, all of the above was done in 300+ hours of gaming. In addition, there is probably 500+ more hours of gameplay with other interesting countries, times 2 because you want to play countries more than once (trust me, once you're addicted, you do). That means there is at least 1600+ hours of gameplay in this game without getting bored one second, for only €44,99 (yes, you should buy the extreme edition. Not many dlc's are needed, though these are a few dlc's that come in really handy).So, you there: if you like history, strategy games, endless possibilities, real time singleplayer and multiplayer and murdering your unwanted heirs by putting them in the front line of your armies, I say WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? GO BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!"

Your ultimate goal is whatever you would like to shape your nation into within that timeframe. Warfare, trade, colonization, religion and diplomacy are the main highlights of the game. You will quickly find out all those things are pretty much intertwined.This game may at first seem overwhelming and complicated for the uninitiated, but that will soon fade as, generally, the mechanics do have some reasoning or logic behind them which makes it easy to understand. That is not to say it will be easy nor quick to master the game as it has a ton of variables. But does that really matter when time flies by as you lead your nation to greatness and are having fun?"
76561198055447330,Recommended,236850,11043927,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,VoidedWarranty,"NOTE- As of the writing of this review, I have only 12 hours in the game, may update the review if my feelings change. Would have ~3 times the amount but I acquired the game during the summer sale at almost the exact same time as Kerbal Space Program and Bastion, both also incredibly good games in completely different ways.Beginning stuff: Europa Universalis IV is one of the best games I have had the pleasure of playing. If you are willing to take my word for it, just go buy it. Otherwise, read the rest of the review, and I'll be reviewing a number of its aspects separately and offering some advice.Music stuff : Starting off with the basics, the music in this game is very good. It is rarely intrusive, but always seems to fit what you are doing in the game. The war theme in particular is stuck in my head forever.Depth stuff: This is the area that I feel makes EUIV shine the brightest. To the best of my knowledge, the depth this game offers is only rivaled by other paradox grand strategy games such as Crusader Kings, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron. The game holds a massive complexity that lends a feeling of weight to every decision you make. For instance, in my second, first non-newb game, I played the Ming (basically china circa 1450). Now, as the Ming, you have a number of unique modifiers to your country. First, there is your unique system of government, called the Celestial Empire, which basically means you NEVER have to worry about rebellions within your borders so long as the people believe in you, but as soon as your ruler's legitimacy or your country's stability drop, the people believe you have lost the mandate of heaven and must be overthrown, leading to a far greater level of importance of these facets than in, say France. Second, you have a very VERY irritating country modifier called Inward Perfection, which leads to everything good in your empire being dropped by large amounts, keeping you static. However, lastly you have various factions, each of which more than offsets one part of Inward Perfection. However, only one faction can be in power at a time, leading, at least in my game, to a play style where you can outclass your neighbors in one area, like technology, but as soon as you go to war you have to support a different faction, which crashed your economy until you have your old faction back, or requires that you cut spending in the old area and focus on the one supported by your current faction. This then leads me directly to my next point,Variety stuff: This game has an IMMENSE amount. Instead of having the Ming system, you might choose to become a horde, which gets massive armies and army bonuses, but a ticking drain of other countries opinions of you, or you might play a member of the Holy Roman Empire (Which is, amusingly, not holy in the least, with only the most tangential connection to Rome, and is not in fact an empire), tangling you in a web of diplomacy and allowing you to potentially accrue massive power through alliances and espionage, or maybe playing as England, a country getting wrecked by France in the hundred years war but capable of becoming the largest naval and colonial power on the planet as Great Britain with a bit of shrewd play.Sandboxyness stuff: There is no win condition. You play to achieve whatever goals you would like, and have no restriction in fulfilling them. Want to start a game as Portugal with the sole goal of annihilating all African nations? Convert the Pope to animism? Start as a tiny insignificant one province island with no military or navy and conquer the entire world in 400 years? Go ahead! There is no reason not to!Bad Stuff: Now, despite what my gushing for the past ~ 600 words may have lead you to believe, this game has its fair share of problems. Bugs and glitches abound, with one in particular where having a laptop with an external mouse will cause minor graphics glitches whenever click-and –dragging to select multiple units. None I have encountered are game-breaking, but bear in mind you are not purchasing a bug free game. Another is UI and tutorial. Although I believe the UI is actually quite good, there is just SO much information you have to know how to read that it is often insufficient to the task of filling you in on what you need to know unless you have a few hours experience with it. This would not really be an issue were it not for the tutorial. From what I saw in the tutorial, it is nowhere near adequate to show you how to play properly, and most of your first game is going to be trial and error, and error, and more error. However, sandbox, so that is fine. Quick note, if I convince any steam friends (Or anyone else for that matter) to buy the game, feel free to ask me if you have any questions about the game. If you ask me soon, we can learn together!Other stuff: DLC. There is a lot of it, and it is expensive, especially when added to the $40 price tag of the main game. However, the only ones which you need to worry about are the Wealth of Nations, Conquest of Paradise, and Res Publica when it comes out. The rest are entirely or mostly cosmetics, with some game alteration that won’t affect you at all unless you play the specific nation and won’t affect you much even if you are.Final stuff: Really good game, you should buy it if you are willing to have a steep learning curve and very complex game. The learning curve should be no problem for my Dungeon Crawl and Dwarf Fortress playing friends; it is way smaller than those games. If this review hasn’t convinced you, go try the demo, or maybe wait till it comes on sale, which it will probably be doing in the next couple of months for the Res Publica expansion. Hope you enjoyed the review!EDIT: Holy crap, that is over a thousand words. I was not expecting that…"

There are a lot of different things that it does excellently, like making diplomacy and trade meaningful alternatives to war, having a system of national ideas that you can choose from for a unique style of nation, and most of all: Replayability.There are countless nations from LITERALLY the entire world map from a time period of 1444 as the earliest start date to... not sure exactly but I think it's around 1800 something. Anyways, there's a ton of different things you can do.There are also some things you can't do: Change government type manually in any significant way. You can only go from one type of monarchy to another, for instance.Change religion of state. Unless you are one Christian nation converting to another, you can't do this.Finish most of the achievements. First off, you have to be in ironman mode, which is hard enough normally. Second, have you seen these things? They are completely ridiculous. Oh well.Luckily, the game's text files are easily edited to make small mods such as allowing religion conversion or changing what the different government types' bonusses are. However, you can't play ironman mode if you do this and thus no achievements.The worst part of the game is warfare, bar none. Wars are won by making alliances and building up armies, not by actually fighting wars. Ok, you have to fight wars, but it's basically a couple of right clicks once the war has actually started and it just isn't satisfying and it is very frustrating how little you can actually do to change the fate of wars. It's also not intuitive at all what factors actually do in warfare. The game is complicated in just about everything, but in battle it doesn't even offer an explanation. That's ok, though, because changing these factors doesn't seem to do anything anyways unless it's increasing army morale or the number of troops. Honestly, 100k+ decent soldiers against 30k marginally better ones (same infantry type, just different modifiers) and you will still end up losing battles, and there isn't really anything you can do.Despite the unsatisfying warfare, there's a lot of great things about this game.

Every country has it's limits and it's benefits, you just need to find what one fits more to you. You can, i.e, start a game with Naples, get independence from Aragon, and find your way over the entire peninsula by wars and diplomacy, to form the italian nation, or even start a war against Novgorod as Muscovy to form the Russian nation.

Not just talking about the game itself, but also all the mods. Because of this my review is from a person who has only played this game for 200 hours.Gameplay:The gameplay of EUIV is half luckbased and half skillbased. Some people don't like this, but in the time i've played this game i've learnt that if you don't ♥♥♥♥ over the game, the game ♥♥♥♥s over you. So what i'm saying is that i have no problem with the luckbased gameplay. If something really unlucky happens, then how are you going to deal with it? How are other countries going to deal with their problems (if they spring up)? I feel it adds a lot to the gameplay, though some people can get... Mad. Including myself (i've ragequit about 5 times). Other than that the gameplay is best expirienced by playing the game itself. Many of my friends have said that it looks boring, only to play it and get hooked.Graphics:There's not much to say here, for me personally I don't care about graphics that much. The interface is a whole other story though. I feel this game is the most accesable (though still not very accesable) Paradox game.Replayability:The replayability of this game CAN be very long, if you get hooked by it. If not, then you may end up only playing through one game before laying this game down. Mods help a lot with the replayability, dlc not as much.DLC:There's a lot of DLC in this game. Like, a lot a lot of DLC. And I don't like that. Some of the DLC i think should be free. But the ""DLC Price"" is set off by how, everytime a new big DLC comes around, new stuff is added for free. This offsets the DLC costs. In the end i don't really like the price of the DLC for how little you get, but I really like how they add free stuff to off-set the price of the DLC. I see DLC as more of a ""donation"" as you will.Verdict:I really like this game. I've played it with my friends, and it's lots fun (I'm still waiting for them to become good at the game though). You shouldn't buy the game of my expirience soely because other people have problems which you may not like. So that is it."
76561198118607970,Recommended,236850,24640484,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,scotsoe,"Most of the complaints about this game are the shoddy DLC strategy, which are somewhat true. At launch the DLC are very overpriced, considering the few features they bring. However, the main reason they have so few features is that most of their content is completely free. The game is almost completely unaffected by not purchacing the expansions (with a few exceptions, like development), and if they add a feature you don't like it's incredibly easy to revert to a previous patch. The expansions go on sale all the time, so if someone's whining about the price, they only have themselves to blame. I have 5 of the 8 expansions and I still haven't spent the $40 this game costs when not on sale, including the 10 spent on the game itself.Now that I'm done with the rant, on to the game itself. EU4 can be very unwieldy at first, but the menus aren't really as daunting as they first seem. If you first play as an easy nation like the Ottomans or Castille and get a solid ally or two, you can just play at your own pace, and learn the various systems like war, overextension, relations, trade, colonisation (depending on your country), religion, etc. Google is your friend! Hitting shift+tab while ingame brings up a steam menu which includes their internet browserI can't tell you if you'll enjoy the game or not, but if you want a game to take over the world it can't be beat. Civilization, Age of Empires, even Crusader Kings never really piqued my interest, but I can get lost in EU4 for hours.10/10, would crush the BBB again"

If you don't want the DLC, then don't buy it.  The vanilla game is still quite fun and will give you hours and hours of enjoyment.  Don't like one of the patches with FREE content the developers push out?  Simply roll your Steam install back to an earlier patch.  Personally, I have stayed at patch 1.11 for the last year or so because that was the sweet spot for me...to each their own.  How many other developers would bother to even keep patching a game 3 years after release?My advice - play the game on vanilla for a little while.  Get a feel for the game before you decide which new features in the DLCs suit your interest and style of play.  EUIV is more  than worth the time/money investment."

You may rule a country of your choice from 1444 to around 1820, and if that doesn't sound like very long, that's probably 25 or so hours for one full playthrough.  Yes, they take a long time, but you want it to take a long time!  Facing diplomacy, trade, wars, and rebellions, among many other things, always leaves you wanting more.  Who will be the next nation to conquer part of?  Can you hold off from the pesky Spanish and Portuguese set on conquering the entirety of the world for profit?  Will you colonize the New World?Although the amount of units and the economy start to seem out of control in the lategame, I would certainly recommend EU4 to any lovers of strategy games as well as friends.  The AI can be enjoyable, but that could never match up to human players.If $40 is too much for you, it usually drops to $20 or even $10 in some sales.  And for $10, I would definitely recommend you pick this up and play it for a bit.  It's worth every cent."

Nearly every nation has individual qualities that give the player a sizeable edge in different areas like trade, infantry, cavalry or taxes. Move from a minor state to an empire or even restore the Byzantine Empire, you can achieve it but, there are limits to how far other nations will let you expand in a short space of time. Upset enough people and you might have a large and powerful coalition trying to take you down a notch. Some nations are better in early games than later, based on historical technological developments Western nations are able to develop faster and when the arrive in the new world or the far east, that massive army you built up can be wiped out in a single battle. A major plus of this game are peace treaties that you can craft and bring about the fall of other nations. Have you vanquished the enemy army and control most of their territory? Order them to release their vassals, turn over half of their trade, take lands for yourself, return lands to their neighbours, release claims, force your religion and empty their bank accounts.One last thing I must mention, it is highly recommended that you at the very least purchase the Conquest of Paradise DLC.

I mean very deep, in a sense that it has so many variables you need to calculate during your playtime, that at one point you either ignore them or you go crazy. Yet it will always pull you back. Rewriting history has never been easier. During the 400-year periode where you play through every single day, you have more than enough time to shape the world as you like it. Want to discover America as Russia? No problem. What do you mean the Ottomans never conquered Paris? I my world they did. The British still holding the colonies and George Washington never became president? Well your british wet dreams can come true if your pruchase this game.So do yourself a favour: Buy this game, learn how to play it and make the country you choose great again (even if it never was)."

The Mod community also adds a lot, and there are a lot of good mods out there.

I have seen Ming go into debt by 1500, without celestial empire falling, I have seen even the Ottoman Empire itself unfold into chaos because of corruption, and that alone. This new mechanic drains the money and the life out of a once glorious empire creator. In addition to this, there are now even MORE dlc's! And guess what? They're all, in total, more than 200$!

Kids could use a game like this to learn history."" Now, while that is a totally valid point - it is really, really good for learning history - there's an unfortunate reason that Europa Universalis will never be used in schools.You see, this game teaches you the way the world works. It isn't one of those games that pretends everything's bright and peachy, and that you should always be fair to everyone regardless of race, religion or social standing. That isn't how this game works. Instead, lies, extortion, racism, genocide and just generally being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are what guarantees success in this game; and most of those are also generally true for real life, though perhaps more four hundred years ago than today.I'm gonna launch into an extended metaphor now. This is what I imagine would happen if Europa Universalis was used to teach you moral values in school. So you're in suburbia, leaning over the fence and eyeing up a patch of your neighbour's land, maybe with some nice flowers on it, that your innocent and friendly neighbour waters every day, and you're claiming that this land is yours and you can use deadly force to get it.So you invade. You hop over the border fence, calling in your allies - those big bruisers from the ghetto suburbs - and, after sadistically beating your neighbour to a pulp and smashing all his stuff you demand that he give you the land. But even that isn't enough. You've done too much toonlydemand the land. So, after a nonchalant browse through your options you decide to take all his money too, and to demand a monthly payment of half his salary. Classic extortion, but how are you going to fund your conquests without the cash?But there's a problem. This new land, remember it has flowers on it? Well, those flowers happen to be hydrangeas. You don't like hydrangeas. They don't mesh well with the lavender in the rest of your garden. You'll need to employ some, er,drastic measures. So you get the gardener in for a low cost of a dozen diplo points, and he rips out the hydrangeas, digging deep to find the roots and piling it all in the street. Then he burns the lot of it, and you spread the ashes on the rest of your garden to help your gloriously superior lavender grow taller and stronger.Several years later, you've done the same to your other neighbours. Your personal lands are now tripled in size, with lavender growing everywhere. You've made your immediate neighbours bow to your will; they're paying you extortion money weekly now, and you've forced them to abandon their original cultures and join the lavender master race. You are the undisputed ruler of your street. Slowly, you're integrating the neighbours to make your street into one large plot of land with you at its head. Your past neighbours live in the cellar, serving you food and massaging your feet. And now it's time to move on to the next street. They must learn of the glory of your house.That is how Europa Universalis works. Lying, stealing, beating up defenceless innocents, discrimination based on race and religion. But that's what makes this game great. It doesn't matter who you play as, the path to glory will be the same. Be it a great European power, or a minor noble in India, or a North American tribe. Oppress your neighbours, take their land and money, and become a player on the world stage."

The aim of the game is set by yourself, you can choose to try and follow history and build a great world spanning empire as England, or you can choose to conquer the whole of South America as the Inca's (after forming this mation) and kicking out the colonial powers and maybe even conquer Europe.A great feature is the Ironman mode, this is basically a feature where only one save is allowed and every month and after importent events (like declarations of war) progress is saved. This is the only game mode in which achievements can be earned, and should be considered as taking the training wheels off.personally for me the Ironman mode is a must, without Ironman I always end up using the console, even though though it is really not needed. Playing a normal game for beginning players is great to learn the basics of the game, while Ironman really adds the challenge to the game since mistakes will cost you.All in all a great game that you can sink a lot of hours into.

Personally I think most if not all have improved the game substantially.There's so much depth in choice although if you're not interested in expansion through war then you're missing about 60% of the gameplay.It also runs reasonably well on what was a high-end laptop five years ago (i.e. no longer so good)."

However, I also have to warn other consumers that the game is probably not worth the full price for most players because Paradox's DLC policy has ended up making the game far more expensive than it has any right to be. Key features which should have been included in the game are instead hidden behind DLC. The base game is technically $40 (though you can get it for $10 on sale) and even for $40 you don't get a complete game. I think that the game can't be considered complete unless you have the Art of War and Common Sense expansions.I got the base EU4 game and both of those expansions for under $25 on sale, so I'm giving the game a thumbs up because for $25 the game that I got is excellent. If you can get EU4 on sale, then I recommend picking up the base game, Art of War, and Common Sense. If you do that, you'll have a ton of fun with the highest quality grand strategy game on the market. Just beware that the game is extremely expensive if it's not on sale, and I wouldn't have purchased the game if I had to pay the full price for the base game and the two expansions which are necessary just to make it feature-complete."

You won't regret it.------------------------You can just look at my play-time to know how this review is going to go. I tend to shy away from making reviews until I feel I've thoroughly mastered a game, or completed its story, or whatever, which is why I don't have many reveiws even among my favorites. I almost hesitated to make a review for this even now, because honestly I still have so much to learn in this game. But I reasoned that I know a lot already, and frankly with EUIV I'll never be fully comfortable saying I've mastered it, even though it is easily one of my favorite games of all time.Because it really is one of my favorite games of all time. Before I got EUIV, I had never played a grand strategy game before. I loved Total War and Age of Empires and Civ, but none of them had the scale or depth that this game offered. 380 years where I could play as anyone, do anything, make my own goals and set my own boundaries. Where I could choose to conquer Western Europe as Spain, or overthrow the Habsburgs and form Germany as Brandenburg, or take the Hosokawa clan and unite Japan and create a Pan-Asian empire, or, yes, try to coqnuer Iberia as Portugal and get thoroughly destroyed by France when they decided they didn't like me anymore. This game has been unforgiving at times, and, yes, I've even ragequit a few times, though most times I went back to the campaign later on. But I have learned from my many mistakes, and my play is so much more polished than it was 2 1/2 years ago when I got the game, even as I say I've still only scratched the surface on some things. And that is exactly the kind of feeling you want to get from a game like this. You want challenge, you want complexity, and even a steep learning curve, but you also want to feel like you're getting better. And the better you get, the more confident and bold you get, and the more creative you get in your plans.I won't try to tell you how to play the game. There are others that can do that far better, and in less time. I strongly reccommend that you check out some youtube lets plays and the Paradox forums to learn more about the game. They will tell you all about monarch points, trade, religions, combat, and the always important not to overlook agressive expansion modifier, as well as so much more. I also recommend checking out the workshop for some of the finest mods I've seen or played.Remember that as a Paradox game it is constantly evolving with patches and DLC. The 1.3 I first picked up was a vaslty different game than the 1.17 we have now, and aside from a few small missteps the changes have largely been for the better. I strongly encourage people to get at least all of the main DLC, to make the game a far richer experience. It's the way the game is meant to be played.To close, I just want to say that I don't regret putting so much time into the game, and expect there will be many more hours logged in before I finally shelve the game for good. Maybe when EUV comes along."

However this game does have many downsides, the research system is poor, colonial wars are weak and the ai isn't always the smartest this combined with the fact that if you aren't playing as one of the more interesting nations you may struggle to get past 1600 or even 1500.

If you like grand strategy, or are flat out a history guy, this is a game for you.What's good:It actually wasn't that hard for me to pick up and understand. I don't believe that's just me, as it's pretty straightforward what stuff is good if you look at the tooltips (more green than red is good, if it's in something you want, and red is bad, unless it's in your goal.)I now know a lot more about Europe and stuff, if that's something you're a fan of.There is a wide variety in what you can play. I personally prefer to either play in Europe (because they get large-scale conflict early and often) or Japan (as it's pretty fun to watch your daimyo take power through a complex war plan and strong allies who you will have to deal with wanting your throne soon after, so you're on your toes.)While some better or more experienced players may tell me I'm stupid and this is wrong, you don't HAVE to do the whole complicated ""building optimization and development focusing"" thing on your provinces. I haven't truly completed a game (I've gotten far) but I've never really had to do that. The AI may or may not do that, so conquering land will get you the benefits for free.What's not so good:DLC. Paradox has a lot of DLC for this game, and it's not necessary, but good luck hosting an online game without it. DLC also addds features that you won't get in the base game. Some of it isn't necessary if you don't want to do certain things but it gets important and costly if you gotta have them all.Online is wierd. While I haven't played many games online, and most of those have been private games with one friend, I found more than my share of jerks while trying to find one. I guess many people just don't know what the ""private"" setting does or how to not be a jerk. Also online gets wierder when you don't have all the DLC.Balancing. While I'm sure it's being worked on or something blah blah blah, it's just more fun to play larger, more historically important nations, because if you're something like (insert small African nation that isn't on the border of the ocean here), you're gonna get rekt m8.Of course almost every one of those bad things you can say don't apply to you because (insert reason here like ""I'll just play Austria all day,"" ""I'll just buy the DLC,"" or ""I'm only playing offline/in a private game with friends""), and that's good.All in all, EU4 is a great strategy game from a great developer. I'd of course reccomend this game to anybody who wants a real-time pausable game like this. And mods only will add to your experience (I personally often play with the popular extended timeline mod, which I also reccomend alongside the game)."

Cross a River to start a battle, attack a foe holding rough terrain, fight on an open plain with cavalry, or leave a large force to push a winter assault? It will cost you in troops lives.

,Recommended,236850,29838526,Posted: 10 February,all,DT76,"This seems like an amazing game for people who like this sort of thing.   Not sure that's really me.It's super tough to get into.  Numbers everywhere, charts, displays, panels full of stats & settings.  'Dense' doesn't begin to describe it.  I had a friend help me learn it, but otherwise, I doubt I'd have bothered.The system they've got isn't bad, although some things feel kind of clunky.  First off, I've been endlessly annoyed by the failure of the army follow feature.  Your armies are represented by a single figure walking through a province.  They have a time listed that you can check, which shows you how long to the next one.  When that time runs out, he's in the next one.  You can easily see where your own troops are going, but not so much for allies'.  Let's say that you're facing a tough enemy who outnumbers you.  You and your ally are going to need to combine forces to have a chance.  But, you can't command his guys (in some cases).  He does what he wants, and you've got to tag along.  So, you can get your armies in the same space as his, and use the 'follow' command to have yours tail his automatically.  Then, you're spared the hassle of micromanaging him every time your AI commander changes direction, and the risk that your armies will have to fight separately.  Except half the time, your army will randomly lose track of the guy he's following, and just stand there.  Infuriating.The only other thing I can recall is that money/prices seem a little off.  The game lasts for some 400 years, and each province makes $1-15 each year.  (Lower-value ones are, of course, much more common than metropolises.)  One of the first buildings you can build is a temple.  Costs $50, increases your tax base in the province by 1.  So, it pays for itself after 1/8th of the game's gone by, and is a profit thereafter?  (Granted, that's a dollar base, you can get bonuses and modifiers that will make it more than that, but still..)  And that's the most sensible investment.  Next one's $150, and gives you an even smaller income gain.  The production workshops cost around $500, for a minuscule boost to your overall trade income.  Given how useful it is to have money to hire mercenaries in war and so on, just who is going to pay these exorbitant prices for such a tiny return?  [Maybe I'm wrong and it's per month.  That might make it actually viable.]It's very open-ended; basically a giant historical sandbox.  There are tough achievements to shoot for if you want, but mostly, you set your own goals.  Practically, this means I set it playing on the lowest speed, put out any fires that arise, and slowly fall asleep.  Yes, literally."

,Recommended,236850,10890701,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,"Bathory ""Bath Salts""","Europa Universalis 4 is a 4X, Grand Strategy game made by Paradox Interactive, the creators of Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, and Victoria. If you have played and enjoyed a Paradox game before, then stop reading my review and buy the damn game. If you haven't, then let me explain the level of complexity worked into Paradox Games. In EU4, as it is called by frequent players of the game, you rule a historical nation from the years 1444 A.D. to 1821 A.D. You must control the nations military ranging from strategic battle plans to researching new unit types to making sure that a certain province can sustain a force or if the force needs to be split into two. You must manage all this while controlling trade, maintaining diplomatic relations, researching new technologies, potentially colonizing, and depending on your nation dealing with the Pope and Holy Roman Empire. This makes the game very complex and stressful, but for those who can handle it this game is a joyride as you can shape the course of human history to your own liking and only predict what is to come. Overall, if you can handle this game get it and start out with a major faction to see what you like (I personally reccomend France, Muscovy, or the Ottomans for a mainland, militaristic game or Castille or Portugal for a naval, colonial game). After that you can take it from there. I personally give this game a 9/10 for its realism, depth, and freedom to do almost anything you want with any nation in the game, but I knock it down a bit for its extreme difficulty and overwhelmingness in the beginning."

Steam reviews unfortunately do not allow for a more differentiated ratingfor now.For players that are new to the grand strategy genre 'Europa Universalis IV' is a good starting point. For lovers of older Paradox grand strategy titles this game might be a step down in some respects.If you ever wanted to be Macchiavelli's prince, this game is quite possibly the best place. The player can pick any state in the early modern period. The UI is simple and quite accessible to newer players.The player has to determine whether the aim is to peaccefully govern a state or tribe and increase its economic prosperity or loot and pillage the neighbouring rivals. Apart from cash three different forms of political capital have to be spent wisely to support the chosen course. A set of temporary missions and permanent national, cultural or religious missions help guide the player through this historical period. Random events throughout the game challenge the player who has toi determine what to sacrifice in order to achieve the chosen goal.Unfortunately this aspect of the game also makes this title quite frustrating the longer the game goes on. Random events mostly offer a choice between two negative alternatives which feels particularly punitive since some negative events can occur at a particularly critical time, ultimately forcing the player to reload and hope that the game's rng is a little more generous.This is ultimately one of the game's biggest deterrents to some older lovers of the grand strategy genre. Random events stand in where intricate game mechanics should determine the flow of the game. It is in that respect that EUIV feels like a step down from older Paradox titles like Victoria 2 that really went to great lengths to simulate the world economy and the developement and preferences of the population.This makes EUIV feel more like a sandbox game than a history simulation. Trade in this game is only simulated as a flow of money that has to be redirected for maximum gain and the game's strong suite is much more in the diplomantic and military which can make for enjoyable and challenging conquests. Paradox has also undertaken great efforts to diversify each aspects of the game through extensive patching and DLC. The real detachment from older titles really is that the player now has several ways to govern one aspect of their chosen state or tribe where older titles often gave the players only indirect means to achieve their goals in domains other than the military.A player that seeks to increase the properity of their state through trade can do so through controlling trade notes or sending out pirate fleets to loosen an opponents grasp on the trade flow.The rebel mechanic in particular has seen improvement and events are now more of a mechanical component than a random one in this respect.However this still doesn't remedy the neglect of mechanics. The peasentry, the arguably largest social group of the period is only present through sparse random events and an indirect modifier that can be triggered if the nation is too unstable. Other than that the peasant is largely missing because the developer refrained from implementing social mechanics. Its strong suite is the geopolitical metagame, the relationship between military and economic incentives which ultimately makes in an historical sandbox game.That negative random events have to fill in for game mechanics increases a sense of frustration in as the game goes on. EUIV almost seems to punish skilled players because the game does not  impose limitations derived from intricate game mechanics but from artificial difficulty.It does not bode well for Paradox if the lead developer jokingly dismisses complaints of the game's turn to the casual. The community coined the term 'mana' for the game's secondary currency that sarcastically to as a way of criticizing the lack of simulation but it seems that  the developers haven't quite gotten the message. Only time will tell if Paradox listens to its older players to marry the intricate game mechanics of older games with its good looking, smooth new titles.Until then EUIV will be a decent way for new players to fall for the charmes of what grand strategy gamers lovingly call the 'map painting simulator'.(75/100)"

Although I love this game to absolute pieces, I can't in good faith recommend getting this game as it stands right now. The full game is amazing and the most fun I've had in a strategy game in maybe forever, especially when you get a handful of your friends to play it with and negotiate, threaten, strategize, and use actual diplomacy to strengthen your country. But the problem is that to get to the full game, you need to spend over 200$ on DLC if there's no sale. Paradox is amazing at developing games, but for the love of god let people enjoy the game without whipping out a few benjamins. It's a massive roadblock to anyone who might wanna buy the game, because once they see that to enjoy the full game you need to spend 5 times the amount of the original game on DLC. And some of the stuff that's locked away behind DLC is so absurd. Transfering occupied provinces to allies is such an essential part of making a peace deal, and the fact that it's locked behind DLC is so goddamn infuriating. It's so simple that it baffles me to why they feel the need to squeeze more money out of the player for something that basic. If Paradox changes their policy on DLC and makes the game accessible to everybody, I'll change my review. But as it stands now, you shouldn't buy this game and support the DLC policies that Paradox has chosen to implement on their consumers."

It is a excellent game,but there are some points which should be stressed.1) Due to the new DLCs and mechanics used in the game(adding much more depth on the story),some achievments,specially the ones related to the expansion and domination became extremely hard, the calssical ""follow the script"" strategy which makes everything very boring in my opinion. It seems that Paradox intended to make a Empire Building game based on the classical domination,but at some point they began to reshape the gameplay into something more inclined to diplomacy,internal affairs, politics and less military(a decision which i support),but at the same time it made extremely difficult to achieve some achievments and conquests.So,if you are a achievment hunter,think twice about this game.2) if you are someone very perfeccionist and with a deep knowledge of history, you will notice some serious historical mistakes out of the ""western Europe"" political system. They seem to care mostly(almost only) with the classic western europeans(i know,the name says it),but i see some players in paradox community that are having the same complaints that i have about these things. I believethat  they do not give enough attention to others political systems which were equally relevant to mankind.Byzantine Phillipines and the wedding alliance between the orthodox Persia and Byzantium destroyed Rome.

Just have a look at the average playtime of most of these people and ask yourself if its worth spending a couple hundred dollars on a game that can give you literally thousands of hours of playtime.Each new Expansion/DLC brings something new to the table, and all the cosmetic DLC's are entirely optional and just add flavour to the game for people like myself that have played for countless hours.Not only that but buying the DLC allows Paradox to pour more time/resources into expanding the game even further. They already support their games for a ridiculously long time instead of churning a new one out every year like most other AAA publishers that charge you in excess of $70.If you are still concerned over the price just wait until it goes on sale which it regularly does and grab all the DLC then.

Aztec Hahuatl must sacrifice for the gods.Global Trade: Steer all the money from all over the world into your coffers without firing a bullet (...or not)Internal politics: Fight rebels (religious, nationalistic, particularist, pretenders), Control Inflation, keep your legitimate claims, give concesions to the different estates in exchange for loyalty, manage local autonomy, overextension, colonies and trade companies.Different government types with different mechanics. Absolute Monarchy is awesome. Merchant Republics must manage elections. Parlamentary governments (like Constitutional Monarchy) must name parlamentary seats and handle parlament sessions. The Shogunate is unstable and must unify Japan.So many different mechanics take time to learn, however, so the barrier of entry is enormous. And it can be expensive to begin getting all the features. But it is worth the investment in time and money, and worth every single minute."

Even then there is a chance the enemy will just hold you in place while more enemy troops march across the continent in two weeks to join the fight.  Sometimes the AI will focus on you while their neighbor becomes immensly powerful.  Its always a crapshoot if France will become too powerful and ruin a game.  Coalitions are supposed to address this, but France can laugh off most of these.  If by chance you manage find enough allies to fight France, then they always have 6 stat generals.

For example with the recent instutions update people in North America can fall behind very fast and you can fix this by raising province development and you need a dlc for this simple feature.In conlusion I really like EU4 but it's amount of DLC is a bit slimy."

Conquering the world is an option too but you can play the game as a colonist or you can be trading nation or you can be a conqueror not on the battlefield but on the paper through diplomacy. Another factor is the game's complexity. It is as complex as a strategy game needs to be. No more no less. It seems that EU4 will stand as my favorite for a long time.

War is fun and most importantly Strategic! to win a difficult war you need plan around your borders, allies and strength failure to do so will see you to a short game, overcoming a tough enemy is one of the most satisfying moments in any game ive ever played before, Its addictive. Other mechanics such as religion, trade, colonisation, technology, culture and governments are all detailed and fantasticly crafted, you'll always think of improvements but for what the market has to offer they are all my top picks.If your looking for ""MOAR"" of conquest and a grand setting you should already be hitting purchase.Community - A very strong and friendly community, my personal favorite ishttps://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/the people here will help you out if your stuck or just want to show your empire off. Modding is fantastic on this game with mods frequently out its never short of fresh content, infact this was the first game i modded myself. With a very simple structure its easy to get the changes you want to make. Just make back ups! There are also thousnad of hours of Youtube videos and tutorials for you to pool over.Multiplayer - Thriving and arguably one of the best grand stratedgy multiplayers available, pleanty of players and if you dont decide to buy the DLC it doesnt bar you from playing with other like most games, you get access to whatever DLC the host is using. The multiplayer does have some cons, Crashing can turn into a nightmare some days, others you'll go through without any, this is an issue Paradox need to help out with more.The Developer - Paradox is activly involved with the community, with frequent developer games and updates the game changes every 3 month, They do have a controversial DLC policy but it doent hamper your ability to play the game, but you will feel ""left out"" if you dont get some of the features, DLC is overpriced 70% of the timetending towards the £20.00 mark for £15.00 value.Overall, By far my favorite game of all time.

I thought it was my new job. 9/10 would destroy my enemies every day.But on some more serious issues, the DLC policies are fine, every 6 months or so a DLC pops up and some pretty cool features are added. It's sort of like a MMO subscription if you ask me, except every 6 months instead of every month. I just wish some of the more ""core"" features weren't paywalled behind the DLC. And the unit packs weren't seperated from the main content.Desync errors are frusturating and I wish they would put some super-hardcore-effort into eliminating them, supposedly it's only if you are running cross-platform MP, but reading the threads online tell me that it's all over the place and no one knows why it screws up.With that being said, single player is solid, and while there are exploits here and there, the AI doesn't cheat (Unless you're running VERY HARD) so after a while you begin to learn how to properly play, it's a very rewarding grand strat.Sadly like all strat games it has the critical mass problem, where once you explode out of control it's very unlikely anything in the game will give you any challenge for the rest of the game. But unless you become a great player, the threshold for critical mass depends on your goal + starting country. About 1700 is when most players will start to feel OP, and that's the last quarter of the game, so that's pretty good if you ask me.On the + side though, this is one of the few games I've actually ""completed"" a playthrough, I can't even borther with Total War games because the end game gets hardcore boring.Even with almost 200 hours, I haven't even experienced 1/10th of what this game has to offer, so many more religions to learn, so many more factions to play, government types, and even multiplayer."

This serves the game very well as Paradox Interactive (the game's developer) has been working with the formula for over 15 years. And this game is as of yet without a shadow of a doubt their finest hour. If you like any type of stategy games you will certainly enjoy this title in one way or another.As for the gameplay, most European nations have very good gameplay and variety. The same however cannot be said for native american, african and most east asian nations as they lack an interesting early game and a challeging end game. However, with 400 hours in this game with 95% spent on Europe and Middle East centered nations speak volymes to what Paradox could do with the rest of the world in future expantions and dlc.I find great enjoyment in the difficulty in this game aswell, even though the AI can be very stupid at times there are still ways for it to keep the player in check without it feeling like the game is cheating you. About 50% of the games achivements are either hard or nations specific which makes going for them very fun since it gives you an excuse to pick these nations or in game decitions, so the semi challeging to impossible achivements in this game is just another reasons to spend countless hours on this title."

You can play fast and carelessly, or slow and carefel if that's your play style. I will say that it's pretty complicated for newcomers(it certainly was for me!), so make sur to watch some videos and/or read some guides, and even then, make sure to try the free demo before playing. I haven't had much of ahance to try multiplayer, but from what I've seen, it can get pretty full of chaos pretty quick, if that's somethng you like! Also, there's extensive mod support for this game, so make sure to try that out too!The one issue I have with this game is the over-priced ""expansions""; each one adds only a few new features(some of which you will probably never use) for $15 or even $20-and even then, they'll charge another $10 for extra skins and music! As of now, there are 7 DLCs released, with an 8th on the way. If you really want any of them. I'd personally get ""El Diablo"", ""The Cossacks"", ""Mare Nostrum"", and the yet to be named 8th expansion, as they seem to be the ones with the most content.Overall, I would buy this game if you have the money to spare, but if you don't, then wait for a Steam sale, as this game is usually put at half or even 75% off then."

I've bought pretty much every major DLC but now that they want to cost half the amount for a regular DLC for these new 'immersion packs' that change a single region or religion seems way too much. Maybe 5-8 bucks.Constant improvement to a game is lovely, and if we have to pay for DLC it's fine. But when you get this far down the timeline you start getting some real bad DLC bloat coupled with the fact that Paradox has put a lot of insanely important decisions/options behind a paywall. You'd have to buy all the DLC to actually get every single option to have in the game. There are others who have put the way DLC could be managed better in words better than my own. So I'll leave that to them.In the end, I believe it's time for a new engine and EUV. It was a good run with EUIV but it's getting to the point where you won't get more players with this insane paywall. Who cares if it goes on 75% sale when you don't include the three most recent DLC's? The problem will only get worse over the next couple of years. But I doubt anyone's reading this and I doubt even more that Paradox will change anything/start devloping a new game until at least another 4 years.I won't bother talking about the dramatic price shifts in other parts of the world because: 1.

,Recommended,236850,11139666,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,Postal Bread,"Once you get past the overwhelming amount of things to do and manage, this game's a great simulator regardless if you enjoy the historical context or not. If you do, though, then it's worth noting this is probably one of my favorite history-themed games I've ever played. It does a great job of letting you play out both historically accurate events as well as entertaining ""what if"" scenarios. On top of that it does a great job presenting the history as well as providing a ridiculous amount of choices in regards to the time period, what nation/province you select (you can just about play as anyone from the individual Native American tribes in North America to the provinces of Feudal Japan depending on the time period selected), and what direction you go in.With mechanics like papacy control, royal legitimacy, colonization, religious reform, crusading, trade and National ideas (most of which is handled on a much more customizable and fun level than just some slider), there's a lot you have to decide on and manage. No two playthroughs are ever the same even if you pick the same nation. One game as Castile you may end up crusading into North Africa, colonizing the northwestern coast while fighting over the throne of a vassal state with a rival bordering you all while attempting to unify as Spain; In another game you may very well end up allied with the rival, instead focusing on your long-time ally of Portugal or the rising threat of France. Eventually you'll most likely end up doing all of these things, but it's entirely up to the player how the game pans out and makes for a lot of replayability. Be warned, though, just like most games like this, it eats up an insane amount of time and ""campaigns"" are incredibly long. Thankfully the game does a great job of constantly introducing new things to keep you hooked.Europa has a lot to it behind the simplistic presentation of the overworld map. It can be difficult and it can also be frustrating with random events that aren't entirely in your favor or seemingly impossible-to-beat situations, but if you can get past the initial barrier of getting into the game and enjoy a decent challenge it becomes as addicting as any good city/nation simulator and is a great game to play both single-player as well as with friends."

One of the best things in this game is that once you learned the basics you will be able to play the game without problems, and you can still learn new things about the game. I can clearly see how Paradox cares about this game because they have been uploading new features to the game since the release of the game, some of this features is free and some of it you have to buy in the dlc's. But to be honest this game works fine without dlc's.This game starts in the 1444 and ends in 1821, which you will have a great amount of playtime.Of course no game is perfect but Europa universalis 4 is great game that is nice detalied and if you like strategy game's and has a will to learn the game you will love this game."

The game takes place in simultaneous turns updating every day, but it also tracks the month, and year. You pick a faction to play at any date and create your own goals. (edit) Technology is no longer based on your tech group, but based on institutions that spread.There are many missions and goals that you can take advantage of that reward you with money or permanent resource boosts. These can be anything from establishing a navy, forming a new nation or obtaining religious unity. It is a very complicated system with plenty of tooltips to help you along the way. (Some tooltips aren't entirely accurate technically, such as the trade power tooltip for trade ships. But that's nitpicky.) Whatever you choose to do the world constantly reacts to your choices, and the giant blobs of muscovy, france and the ottomans are frequent foes or competitors.Really a great game if you feel like dominating the world, spreading buddhism in europe or leading a small nation into greatness. Also, there are countless mods out there to improve or change things to your liking. The larger diplomacy screen and improved map graphics mod (which makes borders more defined) are very good.As far as DLC goes, don't bother if you're just trying out the game. Just the base game has a lot to learn and play around with. But if you want to expand the game's functionality I would suggest art of war, common sense (for development options), and el dorado for the nation designer.9/10"

It certainly has one the best ''AIs'' I've encountered The mechanics are very interesting and the game offers challenge even after hundreds of hours, and you can always get better. I find that arguments about the total price of the game plus DLCs don't concern the game itself, so they are hardly relevant to review the game per se. Not necessarily does one have to buy the whole package at first, and taking into consideration the prices practiced in the gaming market, the quality of the game, the continuing development since the game has been launched, I think it's def. worth it. The game has been developing for a long time and it always goes in interesting directions, certainly ones desired by a significant portion of the community, though they can never please everyone at the same and completely.

,Recommended,236850,11423686,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,Racaoma,"I think the word that best describes the game is COMPLEXITY. Without doubt it is the most complex strategy game ever created so far.Different from other strategy games every move must be thought over at least 3 times and war is not a crucial part of the gameplay.If you like leading troops, adjusting battle formations and waging war to anyone who oppose you, this is definetely not a game for you (you can't even command your troops in battle).In Europa Universalis you need to know that an enemy might be just as good as an ally if he is also a threat to one of your other rivals.You don't conquer territories just by force. When you win a siege you just ocuppy the province.In order to fully control it you must request it in a peace deal and for that you must prove to your enemy he has no chance against you.There are so many system interconnected that sometimes you have to stop and plan your strategy.  Below is a list of these systems.Interesting Systems:+ Complex Trade System. Sending merchants to center of trades to collect money or redirect the income of another center to one of your own.+ Casus Belli System. You can't just declare war against someone for no reason. In order to enter war you need a valid ""Casus Belly"" or ""Cause of War"". Each Casus Belli will have different effects on the peace deals.+ Claims. Each province belongs to one nation, but you can conquer them at war if you have a claim on the land. These claims can be forged or adquired ramdonly.+ Prestige/War Exaustion System. Every action affects the enemy. Winning battles will make your whole armies more efficient and your country more renowed, but the casualties make your economy weaker with War Exaustion.+ Realistic Time. Siege may take years to end. Battles last many days and it takes a lot of time to build a navy. A war may take 10 years without you noticing.+ Complex Diplomacy System. Other countries will have opinions about you, being from natural rivalry, hostility or friendship. This affect how efficiently you conduct diplomacy with them.+ Complex Expansion System. You can't simply annex whole countries by war at the same time. This will cause the other countries to perceive you as a conqueror and will try to stop you.+ National Ideas. You may choose national ideas to make your country stronger on that area. Defensive ideas are good for smaller countries, but this will cause revolt among the Aristocracy who craves for glory.Chosing the Humanism area on the other hand may have lesser bonuses, but will make your country more unified and thus people will love you.+ Random Events.  Random events affect your nation positevely or negatively. These events are changed by your ruler, your current advisor and your national ideas.+ Ruler System. You can choose how you want to rule. Absolute Monarchy, Republic, Democracy. Your ruler also affect your country. Sometimes your ruler will prove to be an unstopabble war machinewhile you are at times of peace or an excelent diplomat just when you required more allies.+ Power. In order to make some actions, power is required. There are 3 powers: Military, Diplomatic and Administrative. Your ruler provide power each month. You can also hire advisors to complement a weaker area of your ruler.+ Espionage. You can send your spies to other nation to create chaos or forge claims on their lands.+ Royal Marriages. You don't need to declare war to conquer territories. You can make royal marriages and take advantage of a weak heir to take over another country.+ Choose Your Country. The world is your gameboard. You can choose ANY country on planet earth: the mighty France, the Ming Empire on China, The Mongols, The Indians on the new World, the decaying Serbia, a minor nation on India or Africa. It's all up to you.+ Random New World. You can make the new world a place to explore. This option allows the game to generate a random New World (North and South Americas) so you don't know what to expect.+ Religion System. Each religion provide bonuses to your country, but other nation views you as Heretics should you pursue something different from them.+ MULTIPLAYER. YES!+ AND MORE...ALL these systems are interconnected so each simply decision may affect your whole nation. This is trully a game that required a lot of strategy. I highly recomend it to anyone who loves strategy games and have patience to play really long games (each game may take up to 60hrs depending on the speed you play). Here's an example of how a game may unfold:You declare war on France along with your large alliance (composed of Austria, Spain, Milan and other small countries) that you have been building for a long time. England take the oportunity and also declares war on France as they are life long rivals. While relying on the strenght of your alliance you refrain most of your troops from entering battles. You then start to subside Scotland and convince them to declare war on England. With their armies marching to Paris the northern borders of England prove to be defenseless and Scotland take a large portion of the country. With that in mind you make a peace deal with France. Then you wait for the current ruler of Scotland to die. With a weak heir, your royal marriage with them and your superior prestige this enables you to create a sucession war. After many years of battle you finally take up the throne of Scotland along with the recently conquered lands of England. With your military aimed on land combat you fail to notice your naval weakness. Shortly after Sweeden declares war on you and take over all Great Britain."

I suggest EU4 to anyone who enjoys complicated game play with infinite replay ability."

,Not Recommended,236850,8294877,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,seviro,"NOTE: I'm editing my old review to account for Paradox's new DLC policy, which makes it nearly impossible for new players to enter the community of this game and enjoy it for what it is at its fullest; instead, they are milking their current playerbase with constant releases of DLC and expansion packs that drastically change the gameplay.Many basic features are behind pay walls, so if you want to enjoy a campaign as it should be played, you need to buy DLC. DLC's that hardly do anything are still $20, and there are myriad DLC's required for you to even be able to enjoy the game.Below is my previous review about what I think of the game. If you don't care about the DLC policy and will pay anyways, then read that and make your decision. Just be advised that even me, someone with over 2,000 hours on this game and pre-ordered it and has been playing ever since, is disgusted with the route this game is taking.----------------------------Change history the way you see fit.Unlike most games of its kind, Europa doesn't focus only on world domination. Your nation can easily prosper from trade, technology, religion, or any number of factors.The diplomacy is something to be admired, considering it stops you from being a warmongering menace to the world. If you really want to conquer the world, expect complete resistance and harsh penalties for doing so.Even if this game was barebones and lacked good content (which it doesn't), it comes with Workshop. As with any Workshop game, there's endless possibilities on how you can modify your game to your heart's content.With easy-to-use multiplayer connection, play with your friends for just as long as you'd play alone.If the price is stopping you from buying this game, don't let it. If you love strategy, this will be one of your best purchases on Steam."
,Recommended,236850,34471651,Posted: 24 August,all,What Was Will Be,"The embodiment of strategy. From 1444-1821, there is an endless amount of possibilities to accomplish while you wither away in your room happily conquering everything. (Note: you can play anywhere, not just in your room. Bathrooms are fun too.) Take your place in history as Albania and either play historically and get eaten by your so called friends or go wild and attempt to take Serbia where you will fail miserably once you get bad rolls in the mountains. You can also play as large countries such as France or Austria. For some reason, every time I play, the game nerfs my country and all the otherHRE countries nibble away at me like ants that works to balance the game since a player can never be bad as those countries and cant possibly lose your entire army in Augsburg in a coalition war. Or, you can even go to the America's where you can... wh.. where you ca... Or go to Asia where you can be eaten by the Ming. (Note: also a balance in the game, when you play as the Ming, you tend to collapse much easier than the AI would. Again, its just balancing the game cause no one can be so bad as to lose their mandate 5 seconds into the game such as I have on multiple occasions. Finally, there is the African region where you can play in any part of Africa where you will experience riveting gameplay such as high amounts of attrition, being technologically behind everyone, even the Americas after a while, and a country called Luba... Yeah, that's really all Africa provides. So if you are looking for a game to play, EU4 is the game. Just be sure to have your cheat commands at the ready, someone next to you to vent out anger for rigged RNG, and a good Arumba video next to you so you can figure out what an Ulm is. (Note: a book also might be wanted for once regency councils hit).Seriouslly though, really fun game. Every game is different and even losing can be fun once you see the world you shaped. Once you get used to the game, it makes the experience much more fun. Good luck playing and remember, beware the Big Blue Blob"

,Recommended,236850,30047784,Posted: 19 February,all,XerxesTheUndead,"As a veteran of various grand strategy games (which include games such as Making History, Making History II, Hearts Of Iron IV, and Shin Gihren no Yabou), I can honestly say Europa Universalis IV is a perfect mix of being both a difficult challenge and a satisfying experience. There are so many ways you can play and succeed at this game, and, once you get a hang of the many game mechanics and gameplay aspects, you can literally do whatever your heart desires, whether it be conquering the world or changing the course of history itself.ProsOne of the great aspects of this game is that there are several different ways to play this game. While the game gives you missions that give you some direction in terms of expanding your nation, you can literally do whatever you want in terms of playstyle and, given enough practice and experience, make even the most obscure nation a global superpower. You can do things like recreate the great colonial empires of Spain or France, turn back the tide of history and do things like win the Hundred Years' War as England or #MakeByzantiumGreatAgain by restoring the Eastern Roman Empire to its former glory by pushing back the Ottoman Empire. And if you are truly skilled, you could aim for the Three Mountains achievement by conquering the entire world as the remote island nation of Ryukyu. The limitless possibilities give you many directions to go in and allows for infinite replayability.ConsThis game, while fun, can be a real challenge, especially if you are either new to grand strategy games or have just recently purchased the game. With all of the various numbers and statistics to look at, it can be incredibly intimidating for new players, however once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to navigate the game with ease. Outside of gameplay, the price of the game and the corresponding DLC can really be a nuisance, especially since some DLC (most notably Art of War and Common Sense) add key aspects to the game that can be deemed neccessary for gameplay. That's why it's recommended to wait for EU4 and its DLC to get on sale, when the game can easily be affordable at 75% off and the DLC being between 75% - 25% off. In general, patience is most definitely key.ConclusionOverall, Europa Universalis IV is definitely worthwhile and I would highly recommend that you purchase this game, especially if you are a fan of grand strategy games. While the initial learning curve can seem like a massive challenge, once you get the hang of it, you can easily succeed and discover new strategies on how to do well in the game. With limitless gameplay and a reasonable challenge ahead of you, you can definitely enjoy this gem of a game for hours on end."

Now that the prices are somewhat reasonable, you just have to use a little more money than for the base game to buy Art of War, Common Sense and Rights of Man! If I missed any must have DLCs please remind me. This game was among the best purchases of my life (right behind Minecraft which I used to play a lot when I was younger), and right now stands right about 5 cents per hour of playtime.OLD REVIEW WAS POSTED AS NOT RECOMMENDED:This is a great game for strategy game lovers, especially grand strategy game lovers. It has in depth mechanics, a steep learning curve and a lot of replayability. It is really fun and challenging to attempt achievement runs. However, the DLCs are too expensive. It was even too much before Paradox raised the price by 50% in some countries. If you want this game you should probably wait for a sale, and buy only the necessary DLCs. Currently the best DLCs are Art of War, Common Sense, Cossacks and Rights of Man, and all are a must in the current state of the game for an enjoyable experience.  Be smart, don't waste a lot of money on a game that probably isn't worth it (it was in my case, though).OLDER REVIEW, WAS POSTED AS RECOMMENDED:Finally finished first world conquest, can now consider myself an average player.But seriously, I only recommend this game if you are patient with learning curves, and have enough money to buy DLCs."
