I tried unsinstalling steam to reinstall it to see if that would fix it, the files for Gameguard refused to delete and I had to go through a long process of changing ownership of files, digging up files to delete them, removing seemingly random Regestries and then finally booting into safe mode to finally remove Gameguard and be able to use steam again.So yes, this game is good, but sadly it installs an anti cheat system that can basically act like a virus and is a massive headache to remove, so i'd recommend avoiding it."

This is because I have to go and use the other exe in Elswords folder because the steam one dosent work for me. Thats apart of my first topic. This game is buggy as hell for me and a lot of others. From downloads freezing to ""no response from server"" while all my other friends are playing, just hope you dont get these bugs. Secondly, this game can get boring. Unless you usually like replaying games, it can get repetitive and boring. Especially if you are not a pvper. PVP is a huge part of late game to the point of where PVE players are thrown under the bus. I recommend this game but know what you are getting yourself into."

Everything is completely Unbalanced, PvE, and PVP.  The newest character Ain is the most OP piece of crap ever added to this game, and the constant unbalancing Nerfs and Buffs KoG shoots out their asses only makes the problem worse.  They have trouble lending an ear to their players to see how they take to new characters and their skills, so they just throw out random nerfs and buffs and say ""Eh, maybe this'll do"" when in-fact it makes things worse (Most of the time at least.)  But! If you can get past the unbalanced gameplay, there is a lot of fun to have in this game.  That is if you can become a player with unreal amounts of ED (ED is in game money), be willing to spend thousands of hours in this game, and be willing to throw a few bucks out to the gods at KoG every now and again in order to fit in.  (Doesn't take much)"

It's nice: graphic, sound, but the effect of this game blow my eyes out. It's too effectious. Gameplay look good, nothing happend. I like this game. Play in free time is good. I had a very good experience with this game before see it on steam. Many different mode in this game that you can try for once. I review this game 8/10 for positive is good graphic, sound, model, texture and gameplay,  and negative is the effection."
,Not Recommended,237310,30112972,Posted: 22 February,all,basement_troll,"Ok, Firstly. The game is fun......for awhile. The game goes from challangely fun to lets rub your faces in deaths and rage inducing crap from zero to a thousand in a matter of days. Secondly, i have not once in my 20+ years of gaming seen anything more pay to play then this game. You want to stay in the challanging stages of the game well better toss in your CC and pay out the backside. cause frankly speaking, Gear drops sure easy enough to come by. Upgrading materials once again easy enough to come by. The rub is all that means lil to nothing cause if you dont have the ""pay to get"" costumes, pets etc. Well congratz your now reaching the rage part of the game cause your characters will all die in a matter of seconds. Want to buy those items from the player shops, well congratz your now gonna have to grind out all your stamina and days away on cash. Btw you wont be earning much each day maybe a few hundred thousand if you get lucky. ""Hint"" 1 constume item ""when theres 6 peaces basic"" costs 340million - 600million. have fun grinding your life away. Want more inv space skills to use or just simply put the ability to do much of anything outside of die 10 times a day and then log out cause well sry thats all your allowed to do before your considered useless. All in all. If you want around 15 days worth of decent game play sure go ahead install the game. If you want a bash your face into the keyboard rafe festing challange game. tada you've met your match. can't support this game. fun but not worth the stress of playing."

76561198065123909,Not Recommended,237310,29455984,Posted: 23 January,all,senselocke,"Absolutely unacceptable basic functionality failures.First, there is no way to access any options menu, so the game starts windowed in such a small resolution as to render text almost illegible, and you are forced to select character/class in this situation.Second, the game starts with no sound whatsoever.Third, you cannot access options to rectify either until the first ""town"". This was discovered through Internet searches.Fourth, the second enemy I came across stopped taking damage, and the game would not let me progress to said town.Finally, because I could not access any settings or menus because the game would not let me progress to the first town to do so, I had no way of exiting the game. The game doesn't have a dedicated program name in Task Manager, and the actual game process refused to close. Alt-F4 also failed to work. I had to look up how to exit the game, and the ""solution"" was to disable my NIC card until the game lost connection with the server and auto-terminated.Just... Holy crap, KOG, you failed on just about every level. Congratulations, not only do I not care if the game is enjoyable after all this, the basic functionality of your program was more akin to a malware popup. Just bloody awful."

I really love the art style, gameplay mechanics. and the many characters that you can choose from. Though, the bugs and glitches that never get patched annoy me...Especially the problems that involve my characters being able to continue playing. Nevertheless, this game has won my heart, and I hope it earns yours too."

It was awesome cuz back then there was more of a learning curve for combos and getting used the to controls and sht. Well forget all that becuase after the nerf update i dont even feel the game is fun or anything close to what it used to be. Plus they added ♥♥♥♥♥♥ english dubs that sound like garabage and new uncessary combos for new or casual players for what ever reason. would gave this game 5/10 olny because I like how they added more depth to the story/lore of game.Download the game if your new, you will probably like it. But if your returning to the game after a long hiatus like i did, dont even bother, its not worth it."

I love this game so far I highly recommend giving it a try even if you don't play this style of game normally (I usually do fps and rpg style games) it might just surprise you as it did me.

,Recommended,237310,29905106,Posted: 13 February,all,Alone,"Before Elsword was incorperated into Steam, I was a regular player who had been within the game since the Beta was officially released. The game itself is interesting, especially for a side-scroller, and the graphics are curiously-entertaining. As far as the community goes within the US servers, most people are polite (aside from those who, naturally, become irritated upon being defeated in PvP) and are willing to help you if you ask. On the negative side, as with any MMORPG, there are bots within every major city or town that spam the chat with their currency-scamming tactics, which makes for a rather annoying encounter.Game-wise, the controls are relatively easy to understand; the game gives you an approximation of how hard a character will be for you to play. Classes are also available within the game, and there are a few of them to choose from for each character. Hacking isn't really an issue from what I've seen; since the beginning, there hasn't really been many of them unless they make it blatantly obvious within PvP, such as non-draining Mana or never-ending HP. (Your only major ""concern"" are the currency-scamming bots, honestly).When it comes to their in-game currency, K-Ching, it is a bit over-the-top how much they make you pay for it. For example, if you purchase approximately 1500 K-Ching in game, that will get you maybe 4-5 items; give or take. The costume pieces are very expensive, and take a lot of KC to buy from their in-game store. They charge quite a bit. making it nearly useless to purchase K-Ching unless you're willing to spend a lot of money to get what you want.Overall, the game is fun to play and offers a unique side-scrolling experience. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a game that will take time to play, and anyone willing to invest a lot of time into their different characters."

In general this is a great gameReasons follow:Devs have been making game less grindy and providing the ""p2w benifits"" for free for 30 days ($8 for the only ""p2w"" item and thats just 4 skill slots game has to make money somehow)((also note the ""p2w item can be bought on player market but its pricey""The player market makes it so you have to grind less.The review below claims ""they can't balance so they randomly nerf and new characters are op"" The new character Ain is not overpowered at all in fact I push them around easily.with friends this is a blast more fun than smash brother ImoCharacters feel unquie and powerful once you learn themSelling on market and buying is easy.Issues:The one p2w item is not account shared to my knowledge (shared bank might work with it) and it can get pricey paying $8 per character after the 30 days but I simply only buy it for my mains.The ability to buy revives is stupid warframe fixed that hopefully this game does too.Costumes are Horribly overpriced DO NOT buy them (secret dungeon gear looks better than them tbh)Sorry for any spelling mistakes or bad grammar"
