I couldn't find anything outside of an emulator for a football type game. I researched Blood Bowl and while it seems cool, it just doesn't suit my style of strategy and sport simulation.I bought Frozen Synapse a year ago and had a lot of fun playing that title, so I felt this game could be a great mix of tactics and sports feel.With this game, I am able to release my inner coach mind into my team of 5....robot athletes. The visuals are really good, and the gameplay is good, for an early access title.The game modes for single player are AI skirmishes which are fun, and challenging but limited.No story or career mode, but I am sure there is one to tie in sooner or later.The multiplayer is wayoff....line?. No one on the servers.Correction: one player was on and invited me to a game, played 1 turn and went offline. I was so excited to play against a human, but never got the full blooded chance, yet.The best thing about this game is the strategy to fully control every robots pattern, without the Madden dogsheetery to come along with it. I am happy with the purchase, and will put in well over 17 hours (1$ an hr) to make this game worth my money and time.At it's current state it's a 7/10. With a story mode and more customization options it can easily be a 10/10 title.If you like Madden and/or FS you will enjoy this game."

It came down to the final play and as I committed my turn I thought I had it in the bag. As the play unfolded and I watched my enemy's robots effortlessly swat the ball from my runner, I realized there was a complexity here I hadn't appreciated. While the game came down to the final play, it wasn't really ever that close - my opponent had boxed me in and there was simply no way out.I love a game that makes you believe you can win until the final instant, only to realize that the depth of tactics ran far deeper than you had anticipated. Is this game for everyone? No, probably not. But it deserves more folks playing online and giving it some life online. It could use a bit more polish, but I'd rather have a great idea with good polish than a good idea with great polish."

How much time will you have in this turn? This is easier to determine as the posessing team since you have an advantage in dominating the course of the game, nonetheless the defending team may have good insight and read the game.This is a simulatenous-turn game with an abstract play field. The geometry of the field is your playground. A plan worth 5 - 10 of your minutes thinking about it is compressed into a 5 - 10 second exchange that will reveal your success.This is the tactical 1v1 game I have been looking for. One one hand, it has the benefits of being turn-based, like board games typically are. On the other hand, it's based on the advantages of being a computer game which is reflected in the wonderful UI as well as in the rules and in the mechanics.

How wrong was I.Basically, this is a game in which you are trying to get the ball to one side of the 'field' to the other, while your opponent is trying to stop you and get the ball to the opposite side. Sounds simple enough. The way you do this is quite unique. The game is split into turns. Every turn, you tell your robots (which look stunning, just like the rest of the game) to run or throw the ball. Your opponent does the same. When both are finished, you hit the 'play' button and see what happens. This is a great way to structure a game. Personally, I am a big fan of having a more chilled out, relaxed approach to the game.But there is more to the game.When it comes down to it, this is a strategy game. You need to work out where you think your opponent will move, try to intercept their throws, tackle them, and just generally get in their way. There is an extrordinary depth to the game, and is very easy to spend hours at a time trying to fine tune your tactic.There is only one very small issue I have with this game, and that is that even when you are playing against the computer, you have to wait for it to complete its turn. I don't know whether this is just to make the game seem like you are actually playing against another person or what, but I personally would prefer to not to have to wait. I want to see what happens next!It is a game which is very easy to get into, but very hard to master.A sports game on the surface, a strategy game at heart, an overall package that is, for me, very hard to beat. There is nothing like it, in a very good way."

During the 5 hours i played i encountered 2 game breaking bugs (AI players running through walls and players stuck in impossible situations where no move is legal). The team editor is broken so you cant change the nema or stats of your players. Some times the game fails to render icons during the matches. There is also no way to affect the starting positions of your players. That means that custum players are meaningless because you migh end up with your blockers on the end sides and runners on the scrimmage line.

With the fantastic artificial intelligence system and randomized playing fields, even single player games are constantly keeping me on my toes and learning more and more about the game systems.As someone who did not get very much into Frozen Synapse due to its complexity (facing / direction being vital elements), Cortex has instantly captured me by providing the same level of depth with simplified mechanics. As Ian Hardingham explained in a recent video, Cortex is based off a simple premise - ""If you are standing still, you control the space around you. If you are moving, you are vulnerable."" Mode 7 has done a fantastic job in creating a modern, fast-paced strategy game that keeps you guessing with every play.In addition, the music is fantastic. But I'm pretty sure everyone on this page knew that already.I would highly recommend this game to strategy lovers. It's an excellent take on the genre that provides a breath of  clarity many modern strategy games seem to lack. Frozen Cortex is clearly a labor of love from all involved, and in my opinion, surpasses and improves upon Frozen Synapse in every way."

,Recommended,237350,20317224,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,obliviondoll,"This game is excellent. It's a simultaneous turn-based sports strategy game. Which is to say, it's a lot like... NOPE, can't think of another one.It's more like Frozen Synapse or other simultaneous turn-based combat games than anything else. I see a lot of comparisons with Blood Bowl, which, given the rules of the game, is understandable, but the nature of gameplay is VERY different.In addition to the more visible difference of simultaneous turns, Frozen Cortex has no RNG involvement once gameplay starts. The fields are randomly generated, but everything in the game plays out consistently. If your player is in position to block an opponent, the opponent will be blocked. There are stats, but they don't apply as percentages, they're fixed modifiers.As much as the devs have added small touches to distance themselves from the real sport, the basic goal in a match is a lot like American Football. There's an endzone at each end of the field. Your team's endzone is behind the opposing team, and you want to get a player into the endzone with the ball. Along the way, you can also pick up additional points from lit-up ""score pads"" placed around the field. The score pads only give you 2 points each, while a ""goal"" (touchdown?) for reaching the endzone is a comparatively large 7 points. This makes goals the more important focus, but in close games, hitting an extra pad can tip the balance in your favour.The online community is relatively small, but the nature of the asynchronous gameplay allows for matches to be played over long periods of time. You don't need to be online at the same time as an opponent in order to play, and with options for email notifications, you don't even need to log in to check if your opponent made a play while you were at work (or playing something else). Most of the people I've met in-game have been friendly and helpful, and I've learned a lot from a few people more experienced than myself, as well as passing some of those lessons on to others."

I want to LIKE this game, but I can't.A deep, rich strategic experience in a novel format (i.e. future sportsball)?  Practically auto-sold on this game.  After playing through the tutorial, I get the basics of how to plan turns and such, so I move on to the Basic League.Here's the thing, though:  this game does a terrible job of explaining itself.  I know how to move my bots, but not why I should.  It takes me a couple games before I realize that the goal of the game is less ""get the ball in the end zone,"" and more ""figure out what your opponent isn't going to expect or counter, and do that,"" but I STILL don't know how to reliably gauge what are good options or plays.  Half the time it feels like whatever I simulated during the Planning Phase doesn't work out -- bots don't block like I expect them to, or (more importantly) chase the ball carrier like I expect them to.   The bots have half a dozen stats that aren't even mentioned in the game tutorial/help (nor shown in the tabular Free Agent view).  I still don't know what the hell ""Halt"" does.Undeterred, I move on to the regular League, hoping that will give me more options for managing my team between games.  But then I discover that I have the worst bots in the GCL, and my salary cap goes up by a paltry few hundred dollars per win while the free agents' ""expected"" salary shoots up by over a thousand dollars per game week.  So, I'm basically stuck with my starting lineup of losers and mostly-losers, facing off against teams with all green (positive) stats -- my bot tackled an enemy bot who literally shrugged it off and walked past because his RESIL was maxed.   I'm playing a game that appears to be about outmaneuvering/out-thinking an enemy when I am unable to estimate the outcome of a play and don't even really know which plays are good ones, AND my guys are the worst bots in the League?  The only way out appears to be to grind losses until I get better at understanding how to make the best plays possible with my awful lineup, and after 15 losses I don't think I want to play anymore.I think part of this could be made better if there was a better strategy guide to the game, but I didn't see anything like it online.  There was a section of Mode7's forums devoted to Frozen Cortex, but there was nothing useful there.  It's a shame, the game seems like it has a great depth of strategy to it, but it's too obfuscated and inaccessible to new players."

,Recommended,237350,14682356,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Token Why Boy,"tl;dr — Simultaneous-resolve turn-based sports game. If you like(d) either Blood Bowl or Frozen Synapse, check it out. If you're looking for a game that you can play with friends over long-distances that doesn't take a lot of time or emotional commitment, check it out. Mode 7 does great work, and nervous_testpilot's soundtracks are always top notch.If you hated FTL or Binding of Isaac (or any of the games I mentioned above), you may want to pass. And if you're on the fence, check out Northernlion's preview of it. He gives a good idea as to what the game is like.And now into the nitty gritty.All in all,I would recommend Frozen Cortex. It's highly addicting, really fun, and the games are short enough that you can play one on a break or with minimum time commitment. Bonus, it runs on my toaster of a laptop. The controls are snappy and responsive with no noticeable input delay, and the interface is simplistic and clean. The background designs are gorgeous, in that whole cyberpunk future kind of way, and it's fun to see my old friends from Frozen Synapse making a return as coach icons.That isn't to say I don't have my gripes with it, however. Overall, the game is not new player-friendly. That isn't to say it's notfun, however. It has a learning curve that is relatively short, but steep, and hopefully players will go looking for assistance when they confront their frustrations rather than making smear posts on the forums.Frozen Cortex can be absolutely rage-inducing at times. If you've ever watched (or played) sports, you should already be aware of the feeling of watching a good plan come crashing down. It'll happen. More than once. Get used to it.Once a match starts, there is no RNG. Let me repeat that:there iszero RNG. People will complain that the enemy blocks you more than you block them, but it's a matter of using the tools you have available. If you know what you're looking for, you will never be blocked the entire match. Plain and simple.However, thereareRNG elements to the game. The pitch design is randomly-generated from a seed. Feasibly speaking, half of the map may be cut off from passing routes; corners may be entirely sectioned off and unavailable. End zones may have only two available avenues of ingress—and both of them may be blocked by the other team's defenders, with no way to pass them other than by risking them intercepting a pass.The robots you have to choose from to upgrade your roster also appear to have randomly-generated stats; again, probably from a seed. In some modes, it appears that the opposing team's stats may also be randomly-generated, going from either junior varsity or the monsters from Space Jam.My main gripe about the game is that the ""standard"" difficulty should not at all be considered ""standard."" It's really ""hard"" mode. You're given a team of tired, limping robots and expected to pull wins out with them—with better robots available based on your performance. So if you can't pull out a lucky win, by the time you get to Week 4-5 of a Knockout season, you're in hot water, especially if (again) you get a pitch that the more maneuverable opposing team can better take advantage of.In a similar vein, why the developers consider Knockout mode to be the ""primary game mode"" puzzles me. The other teams in that mode are not single-elimination (they come up with some nonsense about how money's tight, so if you lose *at all* the season's over, GG no re).Meanwhile, one click over, there's a much more ""normal"" season of 14 weeks, then a two-week single-elimination playoffs.I highly recommend this mode over Knockout, especially for starting players.The teams are on a more even playing ground, you can manage your money and hire better robots in greater numbers if you know how to bet, and the game doesn't automatically send you back to square 1 if you make one mistake.I find the match length rather short, furthering the ""roguelike"" moniker that if you make one single mistake (which may come down to a coin flip, even in the best of situations, if RNG just happens to stack that way), you will likely find yourself in an unrecoverable disadvantage. Furthermore, since we're human and the AI is not, one error often leads to another made in haste and frustration, while if the AI makes a mistake, it coolly carries on. This is why I said if you hated FTL or Binding of Isaac (or similar games), this one may not be for you. There *will* be times that you're put up against overwhelming opposition with no way to counter and a pitch that hampers your every move while the other team goes trolloping around. And you will lose. And if you're on Knockout mode, that's the end of your season.But then there are the times you get it right. The times you land your blocker right in the runner's path and he kicks a robot in the gut, catches a pass, and lobs it back across the pitch to your runner on the far side, who squeaks out an easy and uncontested 11 points in a single run. There will be the times you'll punt it away only to run up and sucker punch the guy who claims it in the jaw. Those moments are priceless.Last but not least, I feel like the tutorial is incomplete. This may be intended. There are parts of the interface that go unmentioned that can take a lot of the mystery out of the game, for better or worse. For example, the movement node is filled with color if the intended move can be completed without risk of any other players coming to block them. Nowhere is this mentioned in any of the tutorials I have seen as of the time of writing this review. It means that new players are going to get frustrated because they don't know all of the tools available to them, and that's not even factoring in the simulation mode that Frozen Synapse players are already familiar with.But all that complaining aside,I still recommend the game.It takes a bit of figuring out what modes you enjoy most, but once you've got some practice down, you'll be throwing long passes with the best of them. Moments of rage pillowed by hours of fun.Bonus: You get two copies when you buy it, so do yourself a favor a bring a friend along for the ride."
,Recommended,237350,9415874,"Posted: 10 March, 2014",all,Pure Ferocity,"Highly recommended. This is Mode7's second game. It continues along the same path as their previous game: Frozen Synapse. It's a simultaneous turn-based strategy game, both players take their turns, then the game plays out their turns simultaneously, and they see the result. The previous game, Frozen Synapse, took this idea to warfare. It was a somewhat difficult to grasp, rather complex game that was also incredibly tense and rewarding.Frozen Endzone captializes on the lessons learned from Synapse and focuses. It doesn't quite dumb it down, though there are less options. It simplifies in the service of clarity, and provides players with a limited toolset that allows for a wide variety of strategems.Forget the aesthetic of sports, it is just that, aesthetic. It's a reason to present the tactics available. This is absolutely not a sports game. This is a strategy game, in the vein of Chess, digitized for the modern era in a way that's not possible with physical board pieces.Each player controls a team of robots, and each of those robots has a unique set of stats that govern how fast they can run, how widely from where they stand they can block, how widely they can intercept, etc. One team starts with the ball nearby, and must pick it up before the turn is over. A turn ending occurs at an event, such as picking up the ball, throwing the ball, catching the ball, turning the ball over, or when a specified length of time occurs. The rest of the offense (that didn't go for the ball), can wait in place, allowing their block radius to have meaning, or move as much or as little as desired (they can also wait, THEN move). The defense spreads out, or converges, or whatever they feel necessary. Their objective is to ""block"" the player with the ball, catch the ball instead of an intended receiver, or force the offense into ""punting"" by throwing it to the ground somewhere.The player with the ball has two choices, he can immediately pass the ball, anywhere not blocked by a ""high"" block. He can try to get it where another player can catch it, or throw to the ground, hopefully at an adventageous position for his team (or at least not too advantageous for the other team). He cannot pass backwards. Alternately, he can run, and if he does so, he cannot pass again until a turnover occurs. If he runs, he must go forward at least (3?) blocks in a specified time period. The rest of his team can block, if standing still. He either makes it to the end zone, a period of time elapses without making it, or he is tackled, and loses the ball.The period ends when a team moves the ball, held by their own player, into the opponent's endzone.What's thrilling about this is how quickly the tables can turn. I was cautiously moving my offense up the field, passing the ball. I saw an opening to ground the ball near the endzone and pick it up with another player. Unfortunately, I miscalculated the distance, I realized that player was about to get blocked, and saw an opponent near my endzone, unguarded. I scrambled a player there, but it was too late, one endzone to endzone pass later, I lost.This probably sounds complicated, it looks it, written out. But really, one 5 minute tutorial and it should all make sense.I have not yet played much, but I'm already hooked. Highly recommended."

You can start several games, which can last days, and just enter your move in when you feel like it and go away while you wait for the opponent to make their move.The problem with this is that inevitably people forget or get bored waiting, and I'd always start games with someone only to have them make one move and never be seen again. I get that the point of this game is that you can spend time carefully planning your move: but there needs to be a way to keep people online for the duration of the match because in my experience, once one player logs off, the game will never be finished.At least, this is what the game was like when I first got it. Now there are only ever a couple of people online at a time and they never accept game requests. Probably people got frustrated and just stopped playing the online version.Having said all that, the single player mode is good, there are options for single matches, tournaments and a career mode, and the AI is pretty good (at least compared to me). If I remember correctly, I got the game on sale, and I'm not sure its worth nearly £20, so maybe wait until its a little cheaper."

Frozen Cortex however is a cool idea of taking a turn based strategy style game and giving it a sports theme, which to my knowledge hasn't been done since Bloodbowl.It takes the notion of having many different ways to score ranging from super easy to complex, making you think out your moves even more than ever. Frozen Cortex also has a simulation mechanic that allows you to simulate plays before you commit your players moves.And random generating maps create different matches everytime, unlike other strategy games where veteran players memorize the maps and know where to plant characters everytime on that particular map.And it also has many Sports elements as well. You have team customization, individual player stats, season modes, even the ability to a create a pitch and play on it. and even better, it actually has a single player story. and its surprisingly good. I've never seen a story in a sports type game before.but my favorite feature is the cinematic camera, that makes things look so cool to see individual plays.

I actually was a fan of Frozen Synapse (despite not being particularly interested in a sports translation of that game) so the mechanics were a bit familiar.I'm trying to stick with it despite throwing my hands up repeatedly. AI seems frequently to (A) run straight in to your guys, thus giving up the ball or (B) hurling the ball in to some far distance of the arena (even straight in to the end zone quite frequently). This kind of nonsensical lack of actual strategy heavily impacts the game as you really have to constantly think about what bizarre things the AI will do to try and take advantage of the sport's lax rules. It's not even really the AI's fault; this is simply what the rules of the game lead to as it's better to take a chance flinging the ball towards your goal line when things get tough.In short, the sport they've invented here is missing some rules. Watching it isn't exciting, and playing it feels more like a test than a game as you're fighting to keep it from degrading in to just throwing the ball huge distances and seeing who picks it up first.You could do worse it seems - I think the team behind it probably worked very hard - but an element of fun seems to be mostly missing.

It has many same elements like simultaneous turns, arenas with walls, mind games etc, but the mechanics are very different. The limited options that the units have makes the game less about the individuals and more about how you work as a team. You need to have a game plan, not endless patience simulating every possible move the opponent might make.When you really get down to it, i don't think Cortex has as much depth as Synapse did, but it's okay - Cortex is a different kind of breed and requires different kind of thinking. And it still has that ""Yes!!! Just as planned!"" joy to it.Some may have wanted this to be Frozen Synapse 2. Why?

I liked Frozen Cortex a lot at first, but now I'm in the 'it's OK' camp.Pros:1. The tactics are subtle and excellent. A situation on the field can be completely turned upside down by a slight difference in movement from a player.2. The use of players in these tactics is also very good. It doesn't seem like there's too much difference between one player and another at first, but I start finding that I'll do something based on player matchups that I see. Again, the tactics are excellent. Just great, the way it's done.Cons:1. This sounds weird, but they used way more graphics than they needed to for this game. The 3-D field makes it hard sometimes to tell what kind of pass an opponent is capable of. Camera angles are awkward. Also there are a bunch of animations on and around the field that aren't needed at all other than for eye candy, and those things utterly destroy my framerate.2. You can't improve your 'robot' players, so there isn't the sense of developing a talent that you'd get with other management sims. When you can afford a better robot, buy it immediately and drop whoever. It's not a strategic, long term thinking game. It's strictly about tactics in individual games.* Edit - After a good deal of play, gotta add 3rd and 4th cons.3. The other commenters complaining that the AI teams are too strong proved correct for me, too. I'm in my 4th season, I have a decent team, I've won about 60-70% of my games since the beginning, but I still can spend only half of the money that the AI teams do. One of the opposing teams has three players (out of 5) who are literally maxed out in every attribute. None of my players would even make their starting lineup. It's tough to even stay in the game against them; beating them is impossible. Even if you outstrategize the other manager, it doesn't matter because their players are so fast, so strong, so everything, that they'll still beat you. Very frustrating because even after all this time, I simply cannot buy anything better than a decent player. And while I know I can grind my way past that, I'm not sure I want to anymore. I've put in the time, won some games... let me buy some players already. The salary cap setup in single player is BS.4. The college leagues look interesting but are really meaningless. You can't coach one. You can fill out a bracket, and bet on the games, but the winners are pretty much random. The money you win on betting isn't the same currency you actually use in-game. You use betting currency just to buy cosmetic crap... I don't get the point.Anyway, there is a draft of college players, but drafted players are nearly always awful... like 'Never use them in a game under any circumstances' awful. You don't even know their attributes until after you pick them. So you have to build via free agency, and you can't do that as much as you'd like because of issue number 3.I'm on the fence about this game now. I'm still recommending it, but it's a cautious 'recommend'. It's worth picking up in a sale but not for full price."

The only real problem I've encountered with the actual matches themselves is that sometimes very close running/tackling situations do not play out like they're supposed to, but that happens so infrequently that it's not that big a deal.It's the story/league, robot customization, etc. that could really stand to be fleshed out a lot.For instance, during the season mode, you can earn money by winning and betting on games. But there's so little to actually buy with it that money doesn't even matter after the end of your first season.You can buy a different robot model... but there's only one of them.You can buy different stadiums... but they're the signature stadiums that the other teams in your league already use.You can buy ""holograms"" that change the look of your robot... but they're extremely cheap and you can only use a few of them at a time.I think it'd add a lot of replayability to the game to be able to do more with your robots and stadiums. Let me buy unique stadiums, customize the endzone, switch out the actual parts on my robots, etc. In short, give me stuff to spend money on and upgrade. It doesn't have to change the entire game. Just cosmetic items that make me want to keep playing.Maybe even give small stat boosts for different items, so you can further cater your team to your playing style. For instance, legs that give your whole team +1 blocking but -1 speed.More importantly, I think the actually roster management, etc. could stand to be fleshed out. It's extremely barebones compared to any actual sports game on the market.Don't get me wrong... I wasn't expecting it to have the depth of franchises like NBA 2k or Madden, that have been around for decades.But the entire roster management just boils down to releasing inferior/injured players and signing better players every week. As you win games, your salary cap goes up, meaning you can afford to put together a roster with better stats.There's a ""draft"" but it makes absolutely no sense. It just shows you the players' college stats. You pick the guy with the best stats you can find, and he turns out to be terrible. And he's not just terrible... he's actually weakest in the areas his stats imply he should be good at. How did a player with -4 interception lead the college league in interceptions?Going back to the salary cap... it goes up, but not down (at least not that I've seen). So basically your team just gets better and better and better as time goes on. And you can cut and sign new players every week without any consequence.It's not like a traditional sports league where you're constantly having to manage the cap, resign players, and hope for a good draft. You could essentially change out your entire roster after every game. It takes away all of the weight from roster decisions.Overall, it'd be awesome to see brief scouting reports/combine numbers for the draft, trades, a fixed salary cap for all teams, etc.BUT don't misinterpret my suggestions as this being a bad game. It's a very good and unique game.Just as someone who's a fan of both strategy and sports games, I think they could do more with the non-gameplay aspects. It would help the replayability a lot since the game doesn't have much of an online community at the moment.I'm definitely glad I bought this game though and would recommend it 99.9%."

Only thing it needs is a solid single player mode and some more players online. I find myself logging in, taking my turns, and then quitting upon finding out no one else is online currently.This isn't always the case but it can be discouraging and it'd be great to have a single player campaign to play while waiting on a game."

,Recommended,237350,9494760,"Posted: 15 March, 2014",all,The Cassius of Narnia,"A surprisingly fun strategy game from Mode7 that takes a few steps to split from what one would normally expect in a strategy game.The big draw is the simultaneous turns, which really builds a new metagame and there is a lot of satisfaction in correctly reading your opponents moves, or mis-directing them of your intentions. Being able to sim out possible scenarios, it's possible spend 2 minutes setting one turn up, only to be deliberating for an hour about the next; the best part being that either is fine thanks to the multiplayer system.An elegant 'correspondence' style multiplayer means that you input your turns actions, commit and go check out any other active games you have and input turns for them whilst you wait. Notifications pop up to inform you when new turns are ready to be played and it's a very nice and relaxing approach to the format.Beyond that, the visuals are nice, soundtrack top notch and is made by talented developers, so I am looking forward to seeing the future life cycle of the game. Lets hope more people pick up on this and really get the community booming!"

It's turnbased, but you and your opponent execute your turns at the same time. So you have to try and predict what the opposing player will do and prepare accordingly.The presentation is the main sellingpoint for me. The grapics are simple, but crisp and beautiful. The camera angles and tactically placed slowmotion makes everything your little robots do seem so epic.If you are into techno/club/etc like me you will really REALLY enjoy the sound track.

Was apprehensive about the sports setting, but was very pleasantly surprised.This game is superior to Synapse in nearly every way. The simultaneous turn to play out in real time actually has an appropriate meaning and is built into the 'sport'. The presentation is all you could expect from a high budget AAA title, beautiful visuals, inspiring soundtrack. There is a simplicity to the game which really helps it, it doen't try to get complicated nor get lost in details. That said, there is full and in depth (albeit exclusively aesthetic) character and team customisation, which helps you become invested in your perfect team. A simple betting game runs behind the league progress, which you must use to your advantage (don't be afraid to bet against yourself once in a while :D) as well as swapping out players for better models with the funds you make through competition plus betting. The feeling of satisfaction as your bot scores a goal and does a victory dance in full cinematic glory, or the lesser fist pumping feeling you get from a succesful tackle or block are really something, and I am not a sports fan.At the price of an indie title, you get 2 copies one for yourself and one to gift to a friend or trade. For an engaging and yet easily time adjusted strategy game that allows you to play as serious and intensive as you like or not, with multiplayer modes and tournaments in asynchronous turn based, you really could do a lot worse than give this a try.9/10"

I didn't play it much, but I loved the concept and I loved the feel of the ""simultaneous turn-based"" gameplay.When I heard of this game awhile back I was definitely hyped.

This game is one of the few to meet my admittedly modest hype-bar.If you like strategy, you should be right at home here. There is somewhat of a learning curve, but it's the best possible type of learning curve. One that makes it easy to get the hang of the base game mechanics, but leaves you feeling like you've learned something new each time you play.The singleplayer mode was a welcome surprise and is definitely a lot of fun.

If you enjoyed Blood Bowl, and enjoy very slow turn-based strategy, this game might be for you.

Managing your team is very fun. You can release and sign players (who all have individual stats) and even bid on free agents.The only real downsides are that it is painful to play online because your oppenent either doesn't bother to take his turn or there is no one online.
