Then things started to get messy when I tried it on various games and started playing with the settings. The software gives error messages right from the start and it doesn't work with every game, while Fraps does.Sure, Fraps has a higher impact on performance but overall you can record anything (including the desktop) without having to worry about the result. Playclaw is far from perfect as of now, so for the price (and the fact that the Steam license will not be updated anymore after X years, as read in the official forums) I don't think this software is worth it. I'd recommend Fraps for now if you have a configuration that can handle the CPU/GPU stress. Playclaw has its pros (webcam display, separating audio files for editing,... and much more!) but it's way too unstable/unpredictable."
,Recommended,237370,7793677,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Jdoki,"The marketplace for screen capture tools is starting to get quite crowded, but PlayClaw stands out as it strikes a great balance between ease of use and quality.  The main competitors are Bandicam, Fraps, and Dxtory.  PlayClaw beats Fraps as it is much less resources intensive, and produces higher quality ouput than Bandicam in most cases.  Using PlayClaw usually results in nothing more than a 1 to 5 frame rate decrease and very few dropped frames during recording.  Dxtory, coupled with the Lagarith codec produces slightly better results, and is even less resource intensive, but takes a bit more effort to set it up; in contrast the PlayClaw UI is very easy to navigate.The main features are: Record in-game footage. Record the desktop. Buffer a period of footage (from 5 to 600seconds). Take screenshots. Configure input from multiple audio sources including mic. You can also stream to Twitch, YouTube and Customer Server (not tested yet)Recording desktop / in-game and activating recording to capture the buffered footage never show any interuption or performance hit.  I have tried streaming to a 10,000prm HDD, and also 5400.  As with all capture tools the faster the hard drive the better, but footage was still OK on the slower drive.  Being able to define the number of CPU threads the software utilises really helps performance.  Other essential options are the ability to define frame rate for capture and set the resolution (although I would recommend recording native and then scaling during editing).One thing I really like is the ability have PlayClaw write audio tracks in seperate files.  This makes it a lot more convenient if editing audio as each each source (in-game or mic) gets it's own file. So no bother with extracting audio from the video file, or having all audio streams mixed.Taking screenshots produces a nice overlay effect - it really lets you know a shot has been taken without being intrusive. Other overlays can be configured to show frame rate, recording duration, buffer, a clock and many other features. One of the most useful overlapys shows how large your recording is.The main area where PlayClaw could improve is around the MJPEG codec.  It appears they use their own custom codec and many have found it can be a pain finding editing software to support it. (Protip - If you have problems opening the files in your editor, try installing the free version of Bandicam - this will install / update the codecs - it certainly worked for Sony Movie Studio 12 and 13).  It spoils what is otherwise a very easy to use application.  It would be nice if they supported advanced options that allowed the user to install their own codecs.  Edit:  The developer has kindly clarified the MJPEG issue. But out of all the capture software I have tested over the years, PlayClaw is the only one that caused problems like this. So I am not changing my comment, as many people have found my 'pro tip' useful.Overall PlayClaw is a great piece of software.  I am using it exclusively to capture footage.  It does a great job.Edit: May 2015 - Slight changes to incorporate questions received below"
,Not Recommended,237370,7861985,"Posted: 1 December, 2013",all,Demanufacturer,"I have mixed feelings on this one. tl;dr I ended up buying Fraps to get my game captures.About me: I make a lot of fragshow/machinima movies and have about 10 years experience. This program didn't work out so well for that purpose. I also did some research on YouTube for reviews prior to my purchase, but unfortunately my mileage varied quite a bit.I found I had to alt tab a few times to get the overlays to appear - like it wouldn't select the open game for a while. Then, even when turning all overlays off in the settings, they still appeared in my recordings.. and yes, i had turned the overlay off from the active game prior to recording!Another problem I had was that I had to close and reopen the program a lot, and relaunch my games so PlayClaw would show up, which caused steam to go ""hold the phone! we're closing or opening something"" all the time [black Steam box in middle of screen.] I'd also get ""failed to launch app"" as PlayClaw or its ""hook"" which displays/hooks into games would get frozen in the background. I'd have to restart my games, steam and eventually my PC to try to get things going.Can't blame the dev for that though, as it appears to be how Steam handles licensing. However, I can blame the dev for this: I emailed explaining my issue, and asked for a license for the non-steam version (which is feature-same, does not have new features) and was refused saying to try the new beta.I don't want to try new betas. I want to have working software delivered through Steam if thats how I purchase it. But if one of my core issues is that I'm having problems LAUNCHING the app, I should be given a key for the non steam version as I had requested.I can see this argument.. if you buy a game on steam, and it has issues, would you get given a normal CD key for the game AS WELL? well, no. But this is a piece of software designed to run alongside games, and maybe Steam isn't built for that.The program also always prompts for admin rights (Win 8.1 x64) which, if you're reopening it multiple times, becomes quite the annoyance. Also each time I quit the program it would display a variable error.Then comes the quality. I found recording the same footage in Fraps vs in PlayClaw resulted in about a 60% smaller file in PlayClaw. Maybe this is good for some people, but it wasn't good for me as I wanted to retain as much quality as possible using this type of recording method.. meaning the reds got junked up a bit due to compression.I guess I'll close in saying that PlayClaw seems to have some cool features which I'll try to use eventually since I paid for it but it has some problems - which all software does. What wasn't cool for me was the developer refusing to let me use a non-steam version of the program I had bought a license for.If we buy on Steam, we shouldn't have to manually install things. In my opinion If we opt to do that, we should be granted the privilege."

Its so CPU and RAM light even though its packed with so much.10/10 I dare anyone not to like this. Files are saved as AVI but compressed in MJPEG (Moving Jpeg) so for my Half-Life 2 sries. 30 mins at 1080p is 10-15gb. Compress it to 720p in Sony Vegas and bang >1gbFor Assassins Creed 4 its more like 20GB but its Jpeg formatted so obviously the mpre colours used the bigger the file. Still... Its an EPIC peice of software. GET IT IF YOU PLAN ON RECORDING YOUTUBE VIDS!

After I tried to do anything more than capture gameplay this software gave me nothing but problems. I had issues with importing anything captured into video editing software, maintaining 60fps while capturing at 1080p, discolouration in the captured gameplay, as well as some audio/visual desynching that I have not experienced with other software. This program also (to my knowlege) lacks the ability to capture ingame and desktop within the same stream, the recording has to be stopped and the user must specify which mode they want to use.Overall this program only perfoms well when doing siple video capture that other free software can do just as well. If you are looking for something like that i recommend OBS; otherwise try Xsplit."

However, with each update, it seems to have gotten worse and worse for me & my set up of hard- & software.It started with audio & video getting out of synch the longer the video recording was, like it started on the same mark and then got progressively more and more askew. So I started to split up my recordings, since I can paste them together in post production anyway.Then it started to have every first recording of a session with the sound allright, but the frame of the game & cam freezed. So I started to either wait some minutes into the recording before I started actually playing & talking, or to do a ""bugged"" recording first, and followed up with a proper functional one.Now it seems to have gone on to have *every single recording* start of with an even longer period of freezed frame, plus the sound gets so badly out of synch it can't be played at all with some players.It has been some time since I tried out to record cam (new feature to be able to be recorded seperately at the time of writing this), audio & video in diffrent files, but the point is I shouldn't have to!Also, when trying to record the laptop it hasn't worked as of yet for me. And when setting to record everything, it doesn't record anything & makes the game currently running lag exensively. And it has never been able to get lower res game to be recorded, say ""Plants vs Zombies"" or original ""Doom"", when other software has been able to record both low res and high res games.With some games it clashes, so that the game won't start up if you have PlayClaw running (example ""The Wolf Among Us""). A possible solution to that though is to start the game first, alt tab and then start up PlayClaw when the game is allready running. But this of course only works with games that allow alt tabbing.I was looking forward to the added features, but at this point, I feel it's just getting worse and worse and I may resort back to not having face cam but just game footage but with another more stable software. I deeply wish the updates weren't required but rather released as DLC which you could individually untick in case they didn't work out for you.For the readers information, I have OS Win 7 (64 bit), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti graphics card & CreAtive Fatal1ty headset.Here's a video showcasing the sound synching issue: From 04:37 and onwardhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKNEdWQOhrM"

,Not Recommended,237370,32189298,Posted: 4 June,all,Marusame,"While with a few hours of tweaking you can get decent recordings, but if you have a recent pc with any newish nvidia GTX with shadowplay [NVENC] or any cpu thats i5 sandy bridge or later [Intel Quicksync] You can capture using hardware with nearly lossless video quality using shadowplay or OBS, which makes this program a tough sell.For starters, this software requires online activation EVERY LAUNCH, EVERY TIME. Your internet goes out and you want to record something to give you something to do? too bad.The best method for recording video using this program for me is mjpeg or motion jpeg. Works well even on lower end gaming rigs but it comes with a caveat if you use adobe premiere or adobe premiere elements (i use elements 13). You will need to buy a codec called Morgan M-Jpeg Codec 64 bit in my case.The support was decent, my mac pro pc was having problems because of its xenon processors and they made a special beta just for me! Now on my nice i5 1050ti gtx gaming rig there is almost no need. Using OBS I can capture 1080p 60fps using quicksync (onboard graphics processor IN the cpu) If your using a graphics card that onboard isnt used so it can be used to encode video making the cpu and graphics card not take any hit.Shadowplay with nvidia cards is also a very tiny hit since these cards come with hardware built specifically for this. This can also be accessed in OBS called Nvidia NVENC came out with the geforce 600 series in 2012.So the question you have to ask is do you have a sandy bridge intel quicksync (or amd equivalent if there is one)  or do you have an nvidia graphics card with shadowplay (or an amd equivalent)?If you dont have either, Such as an older AMD chip with an older AMD graphics card and OBS isnt working for you.. this ""could"" be an option. But the online DRM makes it impossible to recommend. Online DRM should never exist and I will never recommend a program using it.At 40$, its too much, I got the program for 25$ or so and still feel its too much. I say use MSI afterburner or OBS which are both free. Online DRM plus so many better alternatives makes this hard to recommend.At the time of this writing I cannot remember if you can record to a file that has both mic and game audio seperate but I think recording to .ts like obs and using ffmpeg to split out the audio and encode it is the only option."

So, you don't have to maintain massive files and cut them down to the funny parts, just hit the record key after something neat happens and blam there you go you got the last 10 seconds of video saved.It is easy to use, intuitive, and once you setup the options how you like them you don't have to fuss with it just load it up before you play a game that you'd want to record and you're all set.Note: this can work just as well for non-games and recording your desktop/all windows for instructional/tutorial purposesedit: updated wording about audio inputs and recording them"

,Recommended,237370,32913293,Posted: 27 June,all,brad_ry,"Very Fickle Recording software.Considering all the options I tried that were available. This one was the best. There's obviously plenty out there that are better. But your choices in recording software range in price. You either pay out enough money that what you have is a statement. Or you settle for the free option that limits you. PlayClaw 5 is the middle ground.This program does it job and it does it well. When it wants to. It's really a matter of what you're trying to record. What's great about this is that you don't have to do much in convuluted setups to get a recording going. And I like that. The GUI is rather simple and doesn't require you to ask people online for hours on end for an answer to a problem.  Startup PlayClaw 5, Boot up your game, and it's ready to record. Just press a simple Hotkey to start recording and go.It isn't a space hog either. A lot of people will bring up that it sucks that you have to have Steam open, along with this and your game open all at once. But at least this program isn't a total space hog. I can have things open in the background like Google Chrome, Skype, Discord, whatever, and not have issues. Does suck when PlayClaw 5 picks up the beeps from messenger programs though.IssuesThat's for games that PlayClaw 5 agrees with however. It agrees with most games...(Keyword: most).  Other games is where PlayClaw 5 starts to act like a diva. Depending on the game, the program will either crash, record nothing at all, stop itself from recording, or continue recording despite that you hit the hotkey to stop it. Other times I record a different screen, I'll see one of my overlays appear in the recording as a messed up pixel (Usually the FPS counter). Worst case is when I get slideshow recordings, That's where it'll record maybe a few frames then freeze, then maybe, MAYBE move to another frame. It really doesn't like dealing with certain games or programs.Give a few examples.Bluestacks Emulator - You'll record nothing but a screen that says Bluestacks.Alphadia Genesis - I have the FPS counter mess up. Then got where the video froze and gave me slideshow gameplay.Dragon: A Game about a Dragon - Random Black ScreensLeague of Legends - Play Claw recorded the startup screen. But not the gameplayThose are just a few examples. Some can be worked around. You can change the recording setting to not hunt for the window that has the game but just record the Desktop or Everything. Others I can't work around it and have to pray that a rerecording will fix the problem. Or just find a different recording software altogether. Not fun.Another issue that pops up and that's if you're recording a high end game for a very long time. You get no warning about your Hard Drive being full. Once it reaches it's peak that's it. PlayClaw5 will forcibly stop then. But you won't get any warnings except from maybe your PC itself that you're out of hard drive space.Customer ServiceCustomer Service is nice but not always helpful. They at least respond to your problems. I blame the program itself however. Cause when I ask for help from them they always tell me to send the crash dump file.  A lot of problems however aren't recorded by the crash dump file. So it leaves me in an SOL situation. Thankfully I haven't had any future problems in the recent few months but it's still a haunting memory that this could happen again.SteamingI only tried this out maybe once or twice. I don't really like it. I mean it's better than some alternatives out there that make you pay for a monthly service or just leave you hanging out to dry to solve problems. But PlayClaw 5 for streaming is meh. When I first tried it. It was trying to stream content to my viewers at 10,000kbs and I didn't know it. That's very problematic. So I had to cut that down.  I haven't really tried it again. Never found a reason to. I don't like livestreaming in the first place.OverallPlayClaw 5 for the price I got it for. Which was like 30 bucks due to a sale. Is worth it. It does it job right when it wants to. Doesn't interfere with my gameplaying too much. And that's generally what I like. Something can do its job and do it right. Even though it does get angry with me and fight me at times. It at least does better than many other screen recording software I tried out."

I was looking more for the pre-recording feature (which is an absolute desaster in this application) but I tested both the recording and pre-recording feature. If you get a slight spike in fps, it just stops pre-recording for a moment and everything before is just GONE. Means in tough and heavy in-game situations you just loose your pre-recorded material just because an explosion let your fps drop from 60 to 58 down for a  moment and goes up after a while. Besides that, uncompressed recording is hidden and only available if you unlock it in the profile.txt and even then it's pretty bad (~500mb per second), except mjpeg all the other codecs are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (really, h264, who the ♥♥♥♥ has enough power to even use that without in-game lag?) and even then you CAN NOT use the files in other programs (tried it out on sony vegas, it says it can't open or use the file) so it makes the whole recording useless for me. Recordings with mjpeg areo-kay but if I can't even edit my content then that file is pretty much useless for me.Also, it doesn't stay as a ""in-app"" feature on steam, it just uses my steam for logging into PlayClaw 5 and then lets it die, wow, now I've got 0.0 hours on PlayClaw 5 on steam, great!http://puu.sh/60MEk.pngVery funny, PlayClaw.Positive things for PlayClaw 5: Smooth fps lets your recording, even with a bit of lag while recording, look flawless, which is nice, it has a bunch of overlay options which is good I guess and it has a handful of setup options.In the end, it really lacks in the compability of proper recording and pre-recording with other codecs than mjpeg, it doesn't support the editing software I use, I've checked on the internet, a bunch of people were complaining a bad or no compability with sony vegas or their programs, in which the devs just replied with ""tested with free version, works fine"" which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t imo that they just leave that issue with such a rude comment and just looking at the months of development, it doesn't seem like it's living up to it's promised features at all.If you feel lucky, go ahead and try it.

When it works... after weeks of researching all of the other options and watching countless YouTube videos I finally made a decision to buy Playclaw. It had everything you could want in a program.- A variety of compression methods including H.264 hardware compression.- Cusomisable overlays from FPS to CPU and GPU monitoring- PiP webcam support- Ability to record multiple audio streams- Multiple profilesand much more.Where if falls down is its VERY inconsistant. I could record a gameplay with no problems at 60FPS then later the same day I could record another gameplay and Playclaw decides that it's not going to, well, play. Playclaw would then not record, and the game would freeze resulting in me having to force close the software and the game.I have endlessly trawled the forums for a solution and unfortunately there doesnt seem to be a definative answer for this issue, I have also disabled all other overlays such as 'Steam in game' and Origin in game' just to ensure there are no conflictsI must say that I really wanted to like this software and I love it when it works but its becoming more and more unreliable especially for a 'full relaease'I recently upgraded my GPU and decided to try nVidia Shadowplay (which is free) and so far it hasn't skipped a beat. It records full 1080p @60FPS with a manageable file size it also has an in built stream to Twich feature which is sadly lacking in Playclaw. Shadowplay doesnt have the ability to separate audio tracks at the time of writing this and the PiP webcam support is for Twich broadcast only but there are two main differences between Playclaw and Shadowplay.1)Playclaw is a paid program which still need work with its basic functions, Shadow play is in Beta and is FREE with nVidia GPu's 600 series and above.2)Playclaw is a 'full release' but has inconsistant performance. Shadowplay works first time EVERY TIME!!!!!!!!!!Summing up Playclaw should have been the beacon of shining light, the user friendly way of recording gameplay but unfortunately the performance is way too inconsistant for me to recommend it in its current form. which is a shame really. If you can get it to work consistantly well done and please let us all know how you did it.If you want something that works first time, every time without stressing your system too much and you think that not having PiP webcam in locally recorded video is an okay trade off for something that works all the time, get Shadowplay or MSI Afterburner if you can.Note: Steam says that I have used this software for 0 hours I can assure you this is NOT the case!!!!"

I am not the only person who has this problem, and the developers tell users to use their ""Fast Codec"" to work around this issue, but this codec is not very good.I would recommend using this software if they would fix the syncing issue, but I would strongly recommend Dxtory, which is a much better recording software with more options."

Sometimes the audio is slightly lagged in my recordings, but it does not happen frequently. When I use my webcam for a lets play video the software takes my 1080p quality webcam, and turns it into a 720p quality webcam in the recording. I'm not quite sure if it's a problem on my end, but I've messed around with the settings trying to fix it and I still have not found any solution.
