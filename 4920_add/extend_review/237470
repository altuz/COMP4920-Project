But once the first impression fades away, you realize that it plays worse than Battle Isle 1 or Battalion: Nemesis or even Advanced Strategic Command (these games are either significantly less expensive or even free), The biggest downside of this game for me is that the UI is sluggish and not as assistive as it could be. As you play the game, you realize that it takes quite long, because you wait for something all the time (UI to respond, animation to finish, CPU to make a move). Note that I have a 2.9GHz Haswell i5, so the sluggishness is not about weak HW.The story is not great, in-game popup story dialogs are not something you look forward to.The AI is OK, sometimes stupid, ignoring you while you move around and take an advantageous position, but you are going to be grateful for that.I don't recommend buying the game for more than $10 unless there is a significant patch fixing the issues above. The authors had such great examples to learn from, but they probably didn't play the game much. Otherwise they would have concentrated more on gameplay than on visuals.Patch 1.1 update:The developers have addressed some of the most painful issues, and the gameplay experience has improved considerably, but there is still room for improvements. What now stands out is the passivity of the AI The enemy has much more units at its disposal, but they basically just react to you when you start your offensive. Very sad when you compare it to Battle Isle 1.The game is IMO worth $15 after the patch and the Battle Isle series is well recommended prior to Battle worlds: Kronos"

Don't let the skill gap intimidate you. Every movement counts, but mistakes aren't fatal and learning the ropes is part of the fun.[1]The Battle Worlds: Kronos wiki[2]Map editor can be found here[3]You can't choose the tempo of the battle; the next move from your opponent might come in 10 mins or tomorrow (hotseat mode). Which is a feature, actually, but cuts both ways. Fortunately you can have up to three matches going on at the same time, in case some of your opponent goes afk for hours. This can lead to the opposite situation: having to fight several battles on the same day.[4]Coming from Advance Wars, this isn't really an issue for me, but it's worth mentioning. The two factions are the Invaders and the Residents. The Invaders have three subfactions, each one with a special unit."

Units gain veterancy which can be spent on new abilities, or to heal the unit for a good amount, and as you can only level up each unit twice you have to decide which is more useful in the long run.All resourses in game are area specific, so you'll need to transport ammo to artillery, fuel to airports, mines to the front lines and supplies to unit production buildings and repair units meaning that you need to keep supply lines open and hold on to buildings that produce these resourses (as they are quite rare).With a nice long campaign, and a good difficulty level this is a true ""just one more turn"" game for those who enjoy turn based strategy in a semi-futuristic setting."

And when I say steep, I mean you will fail the first mission over and over until you ""get it"".A few tips:* save often* You can call for reinforcements, once every 10 turns. Use this until you get the hang of the game.* Capturing buildings will often get you new units. You are probably doing better than you think.* Move your units first, then attack. You get a bonus for having multiple attackers ""flanking"" an enemy.* In the first mission, move North as quick as you can, taking the left path and ignore the South East base. Once you take the North East base, the rest of the mission is easy.Good luck!"

I am just on mission 4 and game is designed so far that the computer is not on an offensive - I am. I will see if this the case through the whole game but I doubt it. Still it feels epic long term entertainment to me.Grpahics is just right. Very detailed units and really nice map which you can zoom in and out.Sound - is there. Not annoying. Big plus.What it lacks is rally points so you can give the units to go on their own in certain direction. Perhaps developers could fulfill the need for this feature?I wish these people foocused on making remake of History Line 1914-1918.

Also, prepare yourself for restarting campaign missions quite often.

There are outstanding issues left such as achievements not working and numerous clunky UI issues. Multi-player died a long time ago, all that is left are the single player campaigns. The first campaign has a decent storyline and I have to say units and tactical strategies diversity makes this title not an entirely brain dead experience. However, the game relies on cheating far too much. The game play quickly becomes a question of knowing where it cheats, how to position units to avoid it and just grind each mission.Overall, the game is just too crippled to be recommendable.

76561198141519216,Recommended,237470,19202944,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,Butterkugel,"Even though I rarely finish turn-based strategy games because they're so time-consuming (and often insanely difficult) in late missions, I kinda enjoy them and played a few like Battle Isle series, History Line, Nectaris, ... New games in this genre are rare, so I gave Battle Worlds: Kronos a shot. Here's what I think of it:Singleplayer-------------Don't get fooled by the fact that the campaign only has 13 missions because they're quite long - I took me approximately 40 hours to get through them. That's not even counting the additional official and non-official singleplayer maps. I'd say there's enough value for your money.The first 3 missions aren't that interesting but then they start adding some new twists. In mission 6 for example you only get a few snipers and have to avoid open battles until you ""liberated"" enough units from depots. There's more than one right way to achieve your goals - In mission 7 I blew my way through a heavily defended base to capture a truck (the target) only to realize that the sea in the middle of the map froze after a few turns, opening up a shortcut... which was then used by the enemy to launch a massive attack while the bulk of my forces were tied up somewhere else.In another mission you have to sit back and try capturing units from two factions fighting each other until you're strong enough to destroy them both.Sounds difficult? Well, situations like that can get tricky but it's not as hard as the game itself claims to be. I'm not really an expert in this genre but had no problems to get all bonus objectives/achievements on the first try with far less turns than the game expects you to. As long as you don't blindly charge into the usually superior enemy forces, you're fine.Mechanics-----------Unfortunately, there's relatively little unit variety - Pretty much standard with few surprises. I like that units gain ranks and with them bonuses or new abilities though. A veteran Bandit (light artillery) for example, can get surface-air missiles. I was complaining that there aren't many tactical options like bonuses for encircling enemy units - turns out there are, it's just not explained very well. I was already in mission 10 when I paid attention to the loading screen which tells you about this. I suppose the manual does so too but who's looking at that, right? :D Well, since I didn't need such tactics, it kinda shows that the game isn't that difficult.Aircraft need to refuel back at a base after a few turns (which is good), but due to their small fuel tanks I find them to be rather useless. You rarely see them in the campaign anyway (2-3 missions), the main focus is on ground combat.A.I.----Bad. Doesn't seem to understand the rules which becomes obvious when it doesn't utilize units captured from depots. Never seen it using its factories either. It prefers to cheat - reinforcements just appear out of nowhere. Doesn't seem to know the words ""tactical retreat"" and, even worse, is very prone to ""idiot-bait"" - sacrifice a low value unit and the AI will happily swarm it, getting in range of your clearly visible artillery or giving you time to get into a better position.Graphics---------Imho not really important in this genre, but I certainly won't complain that BW:K looks quite nice. No need for me to explain - since it's turn-based, there's not much difference between the screenshots and how it looks like ""in motion"" ;) What you don't see, is that the animations and effects of units firing and exploding are also not bad either. Everything just ""fits"" and resembles the look and feel of the old Battle Isle titles. Just don't look too closely at the animation quality and models during the cutscenes - they're quite bad.Music/Sound-------------I play turn-based stuff in windowed mode with sound/music off, so I don't care. Sound assets are ok though, so is the music. The latter gets repetitive quickly however.Multiplayer-----------Turn-based games take ages in multiplayer - I never played one. Checked the community though and it's pretty much non-existent. If you like playing online, it'll be hard to find a match.Verdict-------I'm really trying to like BW:K and I do have a decent amount of fun it, but with better AI, more interesting units it could've been so much more. As it is, it's not bad, not great (but could've been, which is kinda sad)"

It's the Dark Souls of Turn-Based Strategy, and even when you have a grasp of all the mechanics it doesn't make the game much easier. There's no difficulty levels either, so if you were planning on scooting through the game on easy mode that won't be possible.Patience and persistence are key here. I failed the first mission like seven times before I beat it. That can be disheartening. I had to walk away from the keyboard a couple times and let my levels of frustration lower. What kept me from rage quitting was that I could see exactly how I died in each try.Each failure, gives me data I can use to win, bringing me closer to victory the next time. That's a good choice on the part of the developer.There's a few campaigns and some scenario missions along with hotseat and online multiplayer. There's also a built in scenario maker and the community has built dozens of maps, maybe even hundreds. The quality of those maps obviously varies, but there are bound to be a few gems in there somewhere.I'd recommend this game for people who like a challenge. Make sure you read all of the tooltips. This is one of those rare games where they can give you lifesaving information."

Missions turn into a trial and error of knowing when and where enemy units will activate and how they'll react, rather than being a fair assessment of strategy and tactics. The entire game feels like a poorly put together puzzle of trying to see where enemies will react and when they won't react to you being juuust enough outside the fog of war.Multiplayer's also a completely dead ghost town.I love Advance Wars, and this didn't deliver Advance Wars for me at all.

The hard skill level is ofset by the ability to get reinforcements every 10 turns but if you do you wont get those elusive achievments your chasing. the graphics are clean smooth and colourfull and explosions are cool. i am loving this and will be hooked for some time. some missions seem impossible but if you study the battlefield and use all you can to your advantage you can win and the victory is soooo much sweeter. only bug i have experienced thus far is lockups if you try to restart a failed mission rather than loading or backing to the startup screen and starting from there. not a game breaker but a little annoying.Im enjoying this greatly"

Sometimes you can get more ressources by conquering buildings and gain advantage but sometimes the loss of your units doing so does you more harm. Story and Graphics are not the highlight of this game but your strategic planning ist highly important since the scenarios are not easy to win... and then there are plenty of maps to master more challenges.

Well, if you came here looking for Battle Isle, go somewhere else.  Everything from unit movement, to combat, to story, to graphics, just feels cheap.  I played a few missions in the campaign and felt like I was wasting my time.  There is no hook, no real purpose for doing anything.  I also didn't see a free mode where I can build a base and play out a Battle Isle type map with resource gathering and army building.  That would have made this game playable, at least.  The campaign is just mission after mission, you get certain units, find more units, and are awarded more units during certain events.  It's like a game of those command and conquer missions where you had a limited number of troops to get through the map, but couldn't build a base.  I hated those missions.

Thought this would be a good game but there is no difficulty levels and the enemy is always over powered with the number of vehicles and weapons. The developers say its challenging and each scenario can be won with no losses. Maybe so if you make it your life trying to master this game. More frustration than fun. Definately play the demo before you buy.

This game don't make me happy.  I'm probably naturally pushed towards discontent being that I was a kickstarter, but as far as graphic fidelity I was hoping for, at least, something along the lines of Dune 2000 (which recollection serves me none at all when it comes to when it came out but I'll hazard a guess that it was around 2000).  And I was hoping for gameplay depth at least around the level of Dune 2000.  And as a pledgeman, a reach goal was depth around the level of MAX 1.  Forget setting the bar as high as MAX 2.As the project progressed, I learned that there would be no real base building component to the game and worried about my pledge (not that anybody promised it -- I just dreamed it).  It still seemed like the developers had a passion for mechanics so I stayed interested.I might be jumping the gun, and I know for a fact that I have gotten pussified as the years have passed, but such a disappointment.  Like combining the worst of a table top tactics game and a pc game.  You get damaged, you just drive over a tile with a wrench icon.  With maps hundreds of tiles across with instant healing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI?  Just wander, stumble, shoot, lose, memorize the pattern and try to iterate a better plan.  Nothing pretty to distract you from the mindlessness.  A total derth of emergent behavior.  Not my version of fun and a pledge wasted.Postface:  I could have tried to get involved, and had I been ignored I'd have a more substantive complaint.  I didn't.  Just a review of the finished product.  May get more involved in Unsung Story?"

It makes everything look kind of blurry even you can see that in the screenshots as well. You don't notice it so much in the screenshots but once you play the game you will really notice it, tried all different graphics options and nothing seemed to fix the problem, have no problems with any of the other games I play. It is almost like a blur affect on everything in the game hurts the eyes."

The reasons were dicussed well enough. I will not repeat them.The Dev's response related to this critism suggests, that they do not see any (design) failures on their side and that they are not willing to intoduce corresponding changes. Well, that's ok - its their game and there seems to exist a certain fan base which favours b]their approach . But hence, this will be my conclusion: Deinstall BW:K and discourage my friends from buying/playing it.Best regards,paxSeb"

IMHO Panzer General 2 is the gold standard for games of this type for and while this game at first glance tries to do it's best to be a creative spin on it, nothing really comes off as enjoyable in the process.Many others have listed many flaws which I won't double down on. I will just say that unit movement/mechanics do not mesh well with actual map design in a rewarding way which negates good old smart play making the experience unrewarding."
