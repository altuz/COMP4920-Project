,Recommended,237550,15106368,"Posted: 29 March, 2015",all,Marcelo Sampaio,"I'm not gonna talk too much about Realms of Arkania as a game. People who don't know the original ROA should read about it somewhere. I'm just gonna say this: its a WRPG where you have to THINK. Its a REAL RPG, where your skills are as much important inside battles AND outside.I'm here to talk about this reboot only, assuming everyone here knows ROA.First of all, this game was released in a very incomplete state when it came to STEAM. Almost unplayable, actually. The guys patched it intensivelly after that, but at that point, the game got some of the worst reviews ever (as bad as Big Rigs!!). The thing is: after all the patching, the game became QUITE playable... and very fun to play. But people didn't gave it a chance.Just like the original ROA, your party has TONS of skills that are used in battles and on the field. This is what I always liked about ROA, and its all here. Just like in the original ROA, you have to take real good care of your chars. They will get sick if you are in a cold place without clothes for winter, for example. And just like in the original ROA, this is the most fun part of this game: surviving while exploring the world.The battles in here are the weakest part though. Then again, they were not much different in the original ROA... Keep in mind that this game is NOT forgiving in the beginning. You will die. A LOT. You will miss most attacks, you will be frustrated. It was like this in ROA, and its exactly the same in ROA HD. After a while, you'll get better, and will be able to DESTROY your enemies. This version has some bad looking character models though. It seems they are just placeholders, but never replaced with real models. Your characters look awful, your enemies look awful too... The backgrounds are ok. The originals had horrible looking battle backgrounds, and they are also bad here. But are at least more detailed, and since they are in 3D, you can rotate the camera at will.Outside battles the game look quite good; impressive for a low budget game, actually. Even though this is an indie game, the backgrounds are VERY detailed, and beautiful to look at. Specially the dungeons: they are very good looking, and varied. And since the game is in 3D, you won't move in a grid based system, like in ROA 1 and 2. You can move freely, rotate the camera at will, look up and down. Kinda like ROA3, but with a WAY more beautiful world.At the end of the day, this is still a VERY rough release. It has some bugs and some bad looking models. But its FUN. One of the most fun RPGs I've ever played. You need patience though. This isn't a game for newbie's. If you didn't like the original ROA, you will NOT like this one. ROA HD is just ROA, but with 3D graphics.Even if this game has issues, I recommend it for fans of the original ROA. Give this game a chance. Exploring the game world is fun now. You won't see that basic tile-based cities that all look the same anymore. You'll see a world in 3D, with detailed residences, rivers and real people walking around (the 3 ROA games didn't even had NPCs visible in the game world!!). You will learn to care for that characters, because if you don't they WILL die on you. And you will be able to do optional quests to get money and experience, or can just run around the world aimlesly for as much as you want (if you can survive, that is).This is a great game. With more polish, it would be perfect. It's fun the way it is though, and this is what's most important in a game."

(Delaying the Ork Invasion is 1.32 review)*****Delaying the Ork Invasion*****Why I chose this title? Because at the release of this game, we all were leaning towards the thoughts that the game was doomed and orks would conquer the Northlands without our intervention. The game was a mess of bugs and a graphical parody to a degree where NPCs and surroundings would make you feel like in a zombie apocalypse version of Northlands. And furthermore the game used to lack many spells, mechanics and had several other gamebreakers which is probably the reason turned off many people. But...there is always a ""but""...and this time it is a good ""but"".The game evolved...while I am telling you its evolved it is in the level of a pokemon evolution where you would barely recognize what it was before. Crafty Studios perhaps hired a faery who touched the game with her magical wand exorcising a nasty demon who made the game look bad and broken. Or briefly, they worked their asses off during these months releasing several patches to reach this state. But before going into detail...some screenshots from my game:http://postimg.org/gallery/1zsvh03w/c4dcb1c8/If you have the game, you will notice the major differences...if you don't have the game well you should get it while it is still on Christmas Sales, because the great leap forward which has started with 1.32 patch which is named as ""Revised"" will not stop till ""Gold"" version of the game. I presume you already looked at the screenshots. Here I will not go over change by change but mention the crucial changes which made me rather happy.The Journey Map is in English and place names are in accordance with the original Blade of Destiny. Of course still there are no descriptions for Hjaldor Mountains and such, that is just a matter of adding a few place holders.NPCs look good and NPCs with striped pants you can feel like you are really traversing Thorwalian towns. Also market days, opening/closing times of the shops as well as if you get caught cheating at a tavern you get punished by no entrance features integrated to the game over this time.The new UI which provides more information to the people in a coherent way, as well as they are more versatile then the old UI which was closing a part of the main screen. Now you have a broader area of view where you can enjoy the good sights of the game.Except Demon Summoning spells(which are not added) and a few more, most of the spells are fully functioning and ready to assist you in a dungeon as utility or perhaps to decimate your foes as fast as possible. After all, we could wait a little while longer to see a few stray/unimplemented spells.I'm not even mentioning several optical improvements done to the environment letting screenshots talk for themselves. Though, one thing worth mentioning is the improved interiors of the buildings...especially my favourite is the inn which gave me a dark feeling and I could say I was definitely in backwater, gloomy Northlands of Aventuria.There are also a good deal of fine tunings, bugfixes and balancings...but I'll cut to the chase. This game evolved truly and deserves a second chance. You will not regret it, especially when you buy it now at a bargain price.Edit: Price advice was during Christmas Sale, but rest of the review is still valid since it features 1.32 patch. I will update the review, after every noticeable change.*****To Cross the Borders*****The anticipated 1.33 patch hit the Steam and I should say while there are still shortcomings here and there, it has been a solid improvement.Though sadly we still have to be exposed to unpolished Battle Avatars and Sounds. This can be a major deterrent to some players. But for me it is a moment of ""Eh..."" since I have been more interested in content of the battles rather then nice looks. But I must point out, now spells are associated with different animations, that can be a good indication for the future polishing(One can keep hoping).Now, one major striking point is that every temple has a different interior as well as the temple distribution on Hjaldings is accurate to the world description. So you'll find a good deal of Swafnir and Travia temples while there are no Praios or Boron temples.About battle, there are now Battle Stances! Yes, they have finally found their way into the game. Aggressive, Balanced and Defensive. Depending on your tactical situation, now you can make use of those stances. For example, if you flanked somebody, this especially alleviates the issue where hitting is a problem. Going aggressive will increase your hit chance while reducing your parry chance, providing you more success. On the other hand, a hard pressed character can switch to defensive to hold off the enemy. Another plus is that now Necrophobia is important in battles. It'll make your characters skip a turn if undead is in the vicinity. (Necrophobia roll) Also weapon/monster re-balancing seems like it will make things quite different then before. One example is some animals are hitting twice. Also two spells Nekropathia and Abvenenum added to the game. The more, the merrier.Heavy bugfixing as usual made the game stabler and Main Game+DLCs present a good deal of content. ""For the Gods"" add a number of challenging unique battles across 2 detailed dungeons and one town while ""Ogredeath"" adds several side quests spread through the world and one extra dungeon at Groenvelden.Now, I should stress it again. If Battle Characters, Animations and Sounds can get an overhaul via a major patch, this game has the potential to be a true success. The game has already crossed the border of remake and now it should move forward with full force.*****More Then A Remake*****I wasn't expecting to update my review but surprisingly 1.34 patch hit Steam containing several additional encounters, bugfixes and fine-tunings to mechanics. Additionally some of the good mods (such as herb pouch) created by the dedicated community members of the game made formal appearance with this patch. The game still has the mediocre character models, but aside that in my eyes it has become more then a remake already."

That alone makes this title worthy of picking up.I have been playing pen and paper RPGs for over 30 years and computer RPGs since the late 80s, so I suppose I am more forgiving on graphics quality than some.  What I fiend for in games are interesting combat systems and diverse skills. So far, this title doesn't disappoint.I feel that watching my fledgling characters grow as the adventure progresses will be quite gratifying in this title. I can't wait to get into some serious questing.One thing I still can't stand in this  game is the English language voice acting.  They need some serious help in the voiceover depatment. Monotonous doesn't even begin to describe the voice work, though it may be an ESL issue.Regardless, this is a small quibble about a product that has been considerably improved over the last few weeks. I am excited to see what other new features and improvements are introduced in the weeks and months to come.-T"

The game has several cool features, but it ends up losing a lot of fun factor to poor UI and some highly tedious elements.+Graphics and environments are well done, dungeons are interesting and adventure/GM text is fun+Good variety of classes, skills, and spells+Ability to customize your own party of up to 6 characters+Management of party health on several levels including HP, starvation, thirst, warmth for the winter, etc.+Tactical battles, ability to automate/accelerate battles-World outside feels dead; can't talk to people, look inside boxes/barrels, or interact with much of anything, no visible enemies. You will sadly miss almost nothing just by walking around in map mode and ignoring the 3D environments.-Travel between towns can be very painstaking; sometimes going through 20 or more camp/resting screens with little or no activity. Worse, most towns have little/nothing to offer and you cannot fast travel or even queue travel past 1 town.-Poor descriptions on items and equipment; likely to have unlisted class restrictions-Failure chances for attacks and spells are so high most battles, especially early, every action taken feels like punishment-Most game time will be spent walking or sleeping. It is as exciting as it sounds."

There are too many problems with the game and things such as difficult controls and poor user interface will frustrate anyone who doesn't have the nostalgia of the original to force them to overlook the problems.The user interface and controls are shockingly bad. The developers really need to fix it but I can't see that happening. Other games in this genre such as the elder scrolls have very easy controls. The game also has bugs such as the wrong text on dialogs and random bugs that get you stuck in a situation where nothing is happening. The most frustrating for me was that you can't cancel the level up process and start again.The game is very true to the original however and I think they succeeded improving on the original in quite a few ways. The combat simulator is much better than before. The graphics are of course much better as well as the artwork. Some small annoyances have been taken care of.

It has depth and offers a interesting and enigmatic world. The story is deep - as you would wish for in a good Role Playing Game.I can only recommend to give this game a try - and maybe watch some Youtube videos or read a guide before playing. I was very frustrated after a few tries of playing without any help (maybe because this game is originally from 1992)  and now that i consulted help, i got  into the game really well and am very happy that this game did not become one more never-really-played game-corpse in my steam library."

I agree, version 1.32 was a quantum leap when compared to the fraudulent, apocalyptic trainwreck they released. But that just means it has improved to be a below-average game as compared to horrible, unfinished and dysfunctional theft. As of version 1.33 there are few to no game breaking bugs left, but all the glitches still annoy.The game today is *still* a clunky, uninspired and cheap remake, full of little bugs and glitches, with an incredibly clunky interface and very low on fun.There are still not all functions of the 20 year-old original implemented or working as supposed to, in combat enemies still occassionaly bug out, balance and AI is terrible, you can't close some interface screens and I have to click 3 times after saving a game to close *every* open interface window.Graphics are improved but still very mediocre, NPCs now look ""halfway OK"" instead of ""ridiculously awful"" (combat avatars of your party are still 100% godawful bug-ugly, though) and performance has improved from terrible to unimpressive...Extrapolating from 1.00, the game might start to be fun and enjoyable around version 1.50. But as all updates sem to have stopped, I've given up the wait. Avoid."

I love the old School feel, I love the story, I love that its got so much lore to it. The opening city is truly huge, with shops and tavens.  Ive made a name for myself playing the flute!  I like the voice discriptions, it feels like a real Pen and Paper experience, reminds me of the Dungeons and Dragons Online in that it is narrated.  Ive been looking for a game like that for a long time!  At times it reminds me of Eye of the beholder (in the dungeon crawling) and other times like heroes of might and magic (in the combat).  I tried the orginal from GOG, and enjoyed it but have found this, with its updated graphics and narrated discriptions better.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes deep roleplaying.  Give it a few hours and let it grow on you.  I'm really glad i took a punt!Probably ought to note there is no tutorial, and its pretty hard core and plays best on my rig in windowed mode."

But, combat is still boring, voice acting is terrible and if you take a closer look, you'll notice that 3d models in battle mode have gigantic heads, even their limbs seem strangely shaped. Sorry, but this game feels cheap and rushed.Don't buy it, maybe Star Trail is going to be a better installment --and at least more faithful to the original.Edited: Well, I was really scheptical about this game, and as you can see in my previous review, I didn't like it at the time. Now, having played more than 25 hours I can say that the game is really good. But, why did I change my mind? Because I actually played it more, and found out that some things (like character models, etc.) are not that bad, especially if you compare them to the old ones (the original 1992 game). The cities are beautiful, by the way.I found myself playing more and more, up until now when I decided to change my review and recommend it, because I'm enjoying it as much as the first time I played Shadows Over Riva. I mean, it's a true CRPG, and that's something very hard to find these days.Also, I found some mods and tweaks that helped me get rid of things I didn't like, i.e. the narrator:- Just rename the folder ""VOICEOVER"" TO ""VOICEOVER-"" or something like this. The game won't find the sound files and hence, you won't hear the narrator.Mods:- ClassicMod: Restores the old spell chants from RoA 2 and RoA 3 (you have to own them). Also, it adds the original intro and some other goodies.- Bildschoenes-Aventurien-1.0: Restores vignettes for some dialogs, i.e. when the party picks up the trail of a wild animal, etc.- Magic_Weapon_Pictures: You can now see whether a weapon or item is magical or not.If you find more like these, please let me know :)Cheers!"
,Recommended,237550,7760136,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,raixel,"Although I cannot recommend this game in its current state, the devs have stated that they will release a ""Gold"" edition, that is what this game should have been. If you are a fan of oldschool RPGs with lots of flavor text, skills, quests, items, spells, and plot buy that when it comes out.As it is though, it was released a few months ago as completed when it actually appeared to be an early access alpha, couldnt even be called beta.I bought it on release, and it was so buggy I literally couldnt get past the character creation screen, or even into it for that matter. Had the devs released it as early access they would have had a horde of loyal followers. But what they released as a complete game looked worse than some small game-builds Ive seen people make for quarter-long class projects. This, obviously, torked off a lot of people, myself included.The translation leaves a bit to be desired as well. For instance when you light a torch/lantern, the game asks you ""What do you want to inflame?"" For those of you that are not native English speakers, inflame has two meanings, neither of which has to do with lighting an actual fire. The most common use means ""To cause strong emotions in, esp anger or lust."" The other means ""an infected or red and swollen wound/part of the body injured due to sickness or damage."". Needless to say the sentence cracks me up every time I try to set something on fire. As in ""What would you like to make really lustful?"" or ""What wounds would you like to infect?""So why am I recommending it? In short, when it works right, its *awesome*.That and the head dev is very active on the forums, has apologized for the game repeatedly, and has made great strides in making it functional. You can play it now. There are still bugs, but they are relatively minor although annoying.It has ok graphics, that are slowly getting better, and a decent automap. I tried to play the original from the 90s while waiting for this one to be playable. It didnt have an automap. I dont have the time to map anymore, like I did as a teenager, so thats a great improvement. The music is perfect for the setting, and really puts you in the appropriate mood. Town music is cheerful, and puts you in the mind of wandering through a small green village with exposed-woood and thatch roofs. Dungeon music is nicely dark and spooky, with weird ambient effects. Only really bad thing about non-combat sound is the ♥♥♥♥ing *awful* narrarator. He narrates *everything*. And its *terrible*. Fortunately, it can be turned off. The sound effects in battle are typical grunts, ""Oof""s, ""EEeee""s, slashes, spell zaps and so on. Nothing special.The combat is action-point turn based (Fallout 1/2 style), but there is decent room for strategy with the large selection of spells, movement, combat options and so forth.As far as content, theres a lot. You can camp, hunt, look for herbs, set watches and get attacked. In town you can talk to shopkeepers, drink, gamble, pick pocets (Although you can do nothing with the wandering NPCs - I think they are just there for flavor)Random events and side quests abound, and really make the setting come alive. I cant wait for it to be finished and fullly functional, with all content added (There are still some missing side quests).So I future-recommend it for any oldschool RPG fan, with the caveat ""Even though its not listed as Early Access, it is. Don't get it now, wait for the completed gold edition. If you don't, there will be bugs. *Most*are not game breaking *knocks on wood*, but they are there.I also have to recommend it just because of how open and honest the devs have been, unlike so many who drop broken as hell games on Steam and then disappear while laughing all the way to the bank."

76561198059740220,Recommended,237550,15693885,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,BigRowdy,"IntroductionHardcore fantasy turn based strategy game. This is a modern version of the original and if any of you have played that than you know how brutal this can be. Disease, hunger, dehydration all can kill you as well as enemies.Graphics split into two sectionsWorld  Beautiful for the most part and then just average in some areas (npc's especially females)CombatIts full motion turn based combat and a different engine was used (appearently) and it is ugly. They dropped the ball imo here as this is what many players complain about. The mechanics work well, but the rendered models are less than stellar. If only they had really had more time on this it could have been awesome but I guess animation full motion is probably extremely complicated. Also weapons are not diplayed correctly, for example a character with a sling is shown using a crossbow. Beleive me they took a hit on yhat one with modern gamers.MusicTop of the line...seriuosly up there with Jeremy Soule and Two Steps from HellCombat and other soundsGood to just o.k.Interaction with worldLike in the original 99% of the NPC's serve no purpose. So whem you enter a city you'll see people in the streets etc. that you cannot talk to. Merchants and tavern keepers  say the same old things over and over. You'll find your selves quickly pushing dialouge(sp) buttons as quickly as you can.Progression of charactersSlow and grindy. However this game is about living in a fantasy world and at level 1 all your characters are really weak (as it should be) and will fail much more often than they succeed. EVENTUALLY your heroes will start to improve but you are going to spen ALOT of time in combat. Did I mention progression is slow?Other stuff:Although you have healing magic, it is not gonna be enough to restore everyone to pristine condition so you are going to have to find Inns to rest in. Now you can campout overnight and heal BUT wounds can get infected. As I said this a simulation fantasy experience and it ain't gonna hold your hand. There are various diseases that can set in but they are all treatable with herbs you can search for (good ones very rare as expected) or buy. Herbs and potions are VERY VERY VERY expensive. Magic items are extremely rare but you can buy some enchanted weapons in some rare places but after seeing the prices you will probably decide ""Nah I will loot some magic off foes"". This is simply a pipe dream it is so rare.There are smithsBecause your weapons get worn and can break (you better have a backup weapon for combat)The stores, smiths, herb shops, healers, Inns etc. all have varied equipment and different prices. There is definetly some economy management to your party. You will find yourselves going from shop to shop looking for the best prices because as I may have mentioned, things are very expensive. If you are lazy and just buy from the first store that has the item you are looking for, then you may later learn you spent twice the amount of extremely important gold that could have been used elsewhere.there is also a weak haggling system. You can try for up to a 50% dicount but be warned if you anger the shop keepers they may kick you out and refuse to deal with you until you leave town for awhile.World size and questThe world is vast but quest are limited. You will spend all your time on the main quest as it sends you all over the place. There are side missions too and I would reccomend doing them, but it wont be long and you will be on the main quest again. No spoilers here so that is all I will say regarding quest.Is it linear?  Nope, you can go wherever you want, and do side quest in any order for the most part.Bug?Yep. got some. Most are minor like the wrong label on items are events that don't really seem to do anyrthing. I personaly have not come upon any game-breakers though.So who will like this game?Older D&D players who appreciate using your imgination and really want the ""feel"" of a true wolrd. Grognards who keep diligent notes and love a challenge. Hardcore gamers.Who will not like this game?Console gamers that push ""a"" and everything dies type gamers. Gamers that like being spoon fed. Tales of MaJael (which I also own and love) and rouge-like gamers. Probably. Its kinda the opposite of those type games. Rush players who want to quickly become powerful and complete the game.OverallI simply love this game. It can be tedious at times but I find myself losing hours in this world. Don't let played hours fool you as I play offline alot because my bandwidth is also split between my two sons watching movies and playing online console/computer games.If you are a hardcore simulation type that can get past a few hiccups and use your imagination I whole-heartedly reccomend this experience. Fast players give this a pass/Final note...The devs had some legal issues and had to stop development and updates for awhile but are now back currently working on a patch anb free DLC (Ithink) and most importantly making the game open to modders."

Having played the original back in the 90s on a C-64 I expected to have something comparable to that. Perhaps it's being seen through rose colored glasses, perhaps not.What we ended up with here is a shadow of the game's former self. The cities are generic, the buildings all look the same, the NPCs (if you could call the that) have no life to them. Inns, taverns, shops, smithies, you can't tell one from the other at all except for the names.The voice acting should have been left out entirely. It's awful. It's obvious as hell that whoever was doing it isn't a native English speaker and was dry reading from a script. Yes, it's almost 2014, but not every game is well suited to lots of voice acted stuff. This one certainly isn't.The combat system is a major deal breaker though. I know I can't possibly be doing things SO WRONG that I screwed up two different attempts to roll up and equip a party. Every fight I've been in (which has always been the party's first) ends in defeat with us missing, fumbling, being parried, or whatever. Rarely hit a damn thing even with high stats and all the equipment our meager funding could manage. Turning things over to the auto-AI is an extremely disappointing and very LONG wait for the same result - our deaths.I hate to say it, but this is starting to become a trend with these Indie RPGs and it's now going to make me think long and hard about parting with the money I'm spending on this stuff. I took a chance on this one and got burned - it won't happen again.(Note to Valve: This is why refunds exist in the real world! Learn something here! I'd surely love to get one at this point!)"

I shudder to think of what playing the original re-release of BoD must have been like.Pros:-Planning your party's make-up and levelling up strategy matters (somewhat)-A somewhat nostalgic old-school RPG flavor with emphasis on being true to the underlying game world, and story-telling/quests-Apparently there is a second installment in the RoA series being worked on, so hopefully the party you build and grow in BoD can carry over to the Star Trail re-make (assuming the developers improve on playability in the next installment)Cons:-Combat is glacially slow, riddled with incessant misses, and overall just a chore.  If my characters weren't missing all the time, they would be dropping their weapons, or the weapons would break.  (Hi I'm a warrior, trained in all kinds of combat techniques and... Whoopsie I just dropped my sword on the ground and now I'm dead....) Luckily I ran across a forum post recommending to switch to computer-controlled combat.  I did that, running at a 100x time multiplier and basically just brute-forced combat encounters until I won.  (You can configure the time speed-up to use in the settings for the game.)-A still largely opaque and broken skill system.  As an example, I'm running around with 15 in Treat Disease, and yet >50% of my Treat Disease attempts fail.  For the life of me I still don't understand why my characters miss combat hits, mis-cast spells, etc... The game sorely needs a way in-game to explain what success/failure percentages are, and how changes in base skills and talents will effect those percentages.-Related to disease, it seems that staring at the sky (metaphorically speaking) in this game leads to your character contracting a disease.  While I did choose to play the game with the realism setting turned on, the way disease works in this game is beyond ridiculous.  I swear in at least one case a party member went from ""ouch I didn't sleep well because of a pebble"" to ""I'm dead"" in a matter of days because of the inane disease mechanic in the game.-As noted earlier, weapons break in combat.  As in ...all... ...the... ...time...  I never did figure out how to prevent this from happening.  You can buy whetstones in shops, and repair weapons after each combat occurrence which helps to some extent.  But unless you are lucky enough to find a magical weapon, resign yourself to weapons constantly breaking in combat and your party being reduced to making like Chuck Norris (unarmed combat: go punch mummies in the face!)-Travel becomes laborious after a while.  At first I enjoyed travelling around parts of the map, wondering what I would run into.  But once I got farther into the game, and the much larger distances that needed to be traversed, travel was an exercise in boredom and frustration.  Travel is also a great opportunity to contract disease - despite running around with cloaks, sleeping bags, campfires, etc...  I swear there is a bug somewhere in this game that is just hell-bent on making characters contract disease.-Inventory management is, well,  unmanageable, because of the strict encumbrance system.  Luckily I could use a number of mods (listed below) to make inventory management tolerable.*Review based on playing Blade of Destiny v1.36 with all three DLCs installed.  It is important to play with at least the latest free DLC (With Blade and Brilliance) since it includes numerous bugfixes.*Additionally I installed a number of mods to make levelling and inventory substantially less onerous:  Packesel (pack horse), Mit Sack und Pack (storage chests for potions, books, jewellry and poisons), and erfolgreicheSteigerung (replaces random level up rolls with fixed increases and 100% skill up success).  Very important:  don't put any of the storage add-ins inside of another storage add-in.  For example if you drag and drop your pack-horse, onto the pack-horse by mistake - all of the inventory stored by the pack-horse disappears!*Mods can be downloaded from amod database.  Hint:  use Chrome for its handy translate feature if you don't speak German!*Highly recommended to read both of the following community guides for this game so you can plan a reasonable party and know how to invest in and focus on growing your party's skills:""The old Memories Blade of Destiny Starter Guide""   and    ""A camping Guide through Arkania"""

I have to say in comparison this is a much better product to the one I played in 1995. There are a few items I would like to see worked one as possilbe upgrades or version releases.1. When in dialog with an NPC all of the NPC's have the same arm movements. I found this a little distracting. It was really distracting with a few of NPC's where the lay of the clothing, the logic of the arm movement, and the arm all created a sort of hellicoptor effect.2. The fixed camera angle works most of the time but when going up or down an incline this presents a problem.3. The inabillity to move items from one party member to another easily made game play a downer. Be careful how much and what objects you give to party members.Good stuff:The narration voice was good. Not harsh, not rushed, and very practiced. It is a voice with a even pitch and tone.The random party I was presented at the beginning of the game was well rounded.The idea of the beginner quest in the local school dungons was good. It may be that I just never found that one when I played the old version.Overall:This version was just as engaging for me as the original.

Its clearly not a finished product.  Even basic things like character creation are buggy and incomplete.  This is obviously not a ""finished"" product.  I'd say it was an alpha at best likely shoved out the door when the money ran out.  A good indicator of the quality to expect... look at the steam achievements.  It lists it as having 1 achievement.  Now take a closer look at that achievement.  Its a random glitchy screenshot of turn based combat labeled ""Testing Achievement"".  When you try to view this achievement it gives you an error.  Obviously the developer threw that together quickly to test how achievements work and dispaly... and never got rid of it.  Good show.  Now just think to yourself... if they butchered their store page display that bad... what is the game going to be like!?  Incase you really love to torture yourself and decide to buy this game anyway... have fun trying to understand a damn thing.  All the dialogue, writing, and descriptions read as if they were translated into english by ""Borat from Khazakstan"", that is of course whenever the text is even in a place thats readable or there at all. Almost all of the entries in the help section in the game had a majority of the text running out of the help window itself.  Very helpful.  Creating a character was a tumor inducing affair as well... I've played enough RPG's to guess what a Warrior, Hunter, or Rogue is like skill and ability wise. But you aren't even going to give me a hint about classes like dwarf, thalworian woman, leaf elf, ice elf, etc?  Not to mention there is no information about what any of the attiributes do in-game.  If somehow you haven't already quit and uninstalled ... you'll get into the game itself and can leave the temple you start in.  Now you're in a 3D city with not a damn clue what you should be doing.  Even on the lowest settings moving around the city ran horrible and using shift to run causes nausea inducing motion blur effects.  Through some heroic act of endurance against this horror of a game I managed to play long enough to get into a battle.  It was a buggy and unpleasant affair.

,Not Recommended,237550,30912912,Posted: 2 April,all,zpangwin,"TL;DR - Probably would have enjoyed this more if a) I had read manual first and b) devs had cleaned up the UI pop-up messages and an option to disable voice acting. As it stands, it's not for me but I could see where some might enjoy it. I do give it props for having Linux support and for that reason alone I may revisit it eventually... after I have read the manual.I was willing to look the other way on the outdated graphics (after all I've enjoyed plenty of other retro games such as Betrayal at Krondor and several other old Sierra/LucasArts titles) but I just wasn't able to get into this game.For me a lot of the problem was the tons of menus, which made many things, such as trying to play a lute in a tavern or even character creation, very very cumbersome (repeated pop-up menus). The combat also felt clunky to me. I was thrown off by the ""re-release date"" initially (my fault for not reading the actual game description to realize the original version was older than Morrowind by a full decade), so I didn't bother looking for and reading the manual first.To be fair, I only managed one fight.... and killed half the party before I realized I could run away. But there wasn't anything that grabbed me here. Besides the old graphics, clunky combat, and menus I would say the one other thing that put me off was the bad voice ""acting"".Edit: corrected date; as others have pointed out this is a remake, not the original. I think my point of ""it wasn't very fun for me and I really wish they had spent some time during the remake to reduce pop-up screens and make menus nicer"" still holds.Edit2: @RandalMcdaniel: corrected the other date part I missed. The original version is in fact 10 years old than Morrowind. I didn't think it was that hard to figure out what I meant but I have corrected my review now. And to your point, very few of my complaints were about it being 3D/having older graphics. Did I give the game much of a chance? That's subjective, but I gave it about 3 hours to grab my interest and it failed to do so. Feel differently? Write your own review.Edit3: I will be un-subscribing from this review thread going forward. I've fixed my f*** ups and I don't have any more time for this game right now. If I get through some of my backlog and decide to revisit it then I will make an effort to RTFM first and update my review accordingly. If you like it then more power to you but I'm moving on for now."
