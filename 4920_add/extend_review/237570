I do recommend this game, but play it on easy. Combat mechanic is just too meh to bother with.thats not to say that the combat is awful, its just that there is about 15+ hours worth of combat and thats way too much for what ends up being recylcing the same abilities in the same order again, and again....and again.....and again....and again."

They're each good for around 12-16 hours.The combat can get a bit tedious as you wind up doing the same abilities repeatedly, but it is mixed up somewhat in the 4th title by having the focus switch between 2 parties through most of the game.The story is cheese but the humor will see you through to the end.  All in all they are well worth their cheap price."

,Recommended,237570,1547316,"Posted: 9 July, 2013",all,noibn,"PA'sOtRSPoD4 is the conclusion to the Penny Arcade 16-bit throwback RPG saga. It maintains the same look and gameplay as the previous game in the series. As with the previous game, the battle mechanics are unique and overall decent, plus there are tons of options and strategies to play around with. This time, Instead of having ""pins"" with special abilities that can be assigned to characters, you now have a zoo's worth of cutesy and/or weird Pokemon-esque monsters to do your bidding. Each monster has its own set of abilities and attacks, so you have no shortage of options to find a play-style and team combination that works for you. The main characters from the previous game all return and the story continues in the same strange and often amusing fashion. All is fine on that front, and the saga comes to a satisfying conclusion. Overall, the game seemed a bit easier than the previous one, but you have the option to change the difficulty at any time, in case you want a steeper challenge or can't get by a particular battle. In summary, this is a worthy conclusion to the series, assuming you have played and enjoyed the previous games. If neither of those things is the case, then I'm not sure I would recommend it unless you are a mega-huge fan of old-school RPGs and Penny Arcade. It's a passable game, but only has niche appeal. For existing fans of the series, I'd give it a solid B or B+, and for non-fans who are into 16-bit RPGs maybe a C or B-."

Violence over character development. There is some nice exploration available, and it's a good move that the overworld is no longer locked to a rails system.Despite being significantly longer than 3 it feels like there was actually less content here. And what there is isn't that exciting. That makes this is a great example of a game that would've been improved by being shorter. It felt stretched too thin: a foregone conclusion to the series, made solely to wrap things up, not because anyone was interested in what was happening.I much prefered playing as humans instead of these emotionless proxy creatures. They made me feel very removed from the combat. Since they were constantly changing and all had different powers it was a bit hard to keep track of them. So I locked down my party pretty early. I'm sure I didn't optimize very well, but I didn't really care as long as I could beat the bosses. Once you discover a couple overpowered strategies the system is a boring grind. Lather, rinse, repeat.While there are some comical moments this final entry in the series leaves much to be desired. The ending fell flat, and didn't explain nearly enough. But it was an ending, and for that I'm grateful."

Quadro...Fourology.Possibly my favourite of the series, primarily for its off-beat style, variety of playable characters and depth of combat.Zeboyd Games appear to have had a creative field day with this one. Where Episode 3 felt a little restrained, here they have flipped the desk and gone ""screw this! I'm doing it my way!"" - Want a demon train? You've got it! Want to play with a sentient vending machine? It's yours! Want to fight panda-duck hybrids? Why the heck not!It's essentially taken everything from the previous game, fixing the weaker points and trying to dose it up with more fun and variety. In effect, it's no longer trying to mimic the first 2 episodes, but stand alone with its own style. The music's had a badass overhaul and the attack sounds are considerably more fitting; all-in-all leading to very satisfying and engaging combat, aided by an even greater cavalcade of silly foes and special conditions.But the creativeness hasn't just extended to the world or visuals. The combat system has been given a fun rethink too. The characters now fight using a team of fun, yet cute, creatures (very much an ode to Pokémon) each with their own very unique edge and specialisation to bring, really pushing the game mechanics to creative new frontiers. Some are defensive healers, others item-oriented... one even boosts its allies whilst KO'd! There's plenty to mix-and-match and, much like the class badges from before, the designs are creative, absurd and pretty damn fantastic. For those who like to play with every character in an RPG... this is an absolute gold mine!The humour is still rich as ever, pushing the boat out even further with the parodies and puns... including a group with their own theme song. I can't say much on it, but it's possibly one of the most bizarre, yet wonderful moments of the game.All this does come at a price, however (there's always a catch). In all of the outrageous fun, it's lost the brooding noir from the other episodes, so has a very different feel to it. And despite the sprawling world, the plot is actually quite sparse. There's still a wealth of brilliant dialogue and laugh-out-loud moments but, other than a nice conclusion, there's not much in the way of twists or turns and a rather drawn-out finale. Neither are problems in and of themselves, but it ultimately depends on what hooked you into the series.Still... it was a very satisfying end to an incredible series of games. Not the deepest, but almost certainly the most fun!"

76561197971628333,Recommended,237570,28114994,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Modranto,"Borrows from several of RPG's greats to become very good, but not quite great itself.This fourth iteration in Penny Arcade's RPG series takes several steps forward and a couple backward when compared to its predecessor. The places you visit and the situations you are thrust into are more spectacular, graphically detailed and imaginative. The storyline deftly pulls you along with more polished cutscenes, gradual plot reveals and split narratives. On the other hand, the combat both gives players less character flexibility and does little to overcome the fatigue of using the same battle system as episode 3. Additionally, a dearth of object examination text and only a modest number of NPCs to talk to contribute to a sense that the ""Underhell"" has been under detailed from a world building perspective.When I think of retro RPGs I don't imagine big set piece locales as key components of the genre. And yet, that is one of Precipice of Darkness 4's strongest areas. A few of the many lively environments that you'll find yourself in include riding onboard a living, dangerously lonely train, escaping a collapsing tower and navigating through an active warfield. The train sequence is clearly a reference to Final Fantasy VI (AKA III in the US). That game's influence can be felt elsewhere too. I suspect the parallel storytelling style that has you frequently alternating between two separate groups of characters is one such homage (in addition to being an effective storytelling technique).Unfortunately, splitting the group like this takes a small toll on the combat side of things. Early on you are often without a full party to wield in battle. I saw this as an unnecessarily slow build up in combat complexity considering that most players will already have experience with this battle system from the previous game. It should be noted that you command a collection of oddball monsters in battle rather than the human characters. Despite this, the underlying functionality and flow remains virtually the same. Instead of being able to customize what classes are set to each character, you swap between monsters that are permanently tied to a specific play style. I preferred the flexible combinations you could make in episode 3 over the linear growth paths of this Pokémon-esque system.The story is a direct continuation from Precipice of Darkness 3. Even though there is a brief recap at the start of this game, I would still recommend playing part 3 first. In contrast, that game can safely be your entry point into the series. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply say that I really enjoyed Precipice of Darkness 4's otherworldly plot with its astronomical implications. The characters and comedy along the way didn't stand out as much to me though. That's not to say they are bad; It's more that they are passably amusing without having enough depth or novelty to be memorable.Ultimately I think that episode 4 is better than 3 but, lamentably, it is hurt by its precursor. This is evidenced by looking at Steam review totals of which there are currently 503 for Precipice of Darkness 3 versus only 277 for this game. Both of the two games took me 15 hours to complete in entirety, including side content. If you feel you'll only have the lasting interest to play one of these games, make it part 4 and make do with the recap of episode 3.Click here to check out my review of Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3."

For a story that built up an arc over three games and more years, the story felt rushed and unexplained to the point of nonsensicality. It relies mightily upon the memory of the player—assuming, of course, they played the other games—and gives only the sparsest of details the to uninitiated. Having not touched the other games for well over a year before this, details were slow in returning. Worse by far was having an ending that left me feeling miffed and forsaken, as if my playing of this game were a duty that was all the reward I needed, and it was indeed not. The ending was so dissatisfying as to taint the memories of the past entries into the series, all of which I would label as anywhere from 'fine' to 'good' based on their own merit. If you want to finish this series, by all means, buy this game, otherwise, forego this title in favor of greener digital pastures."

,Recommended,237570,1692552,"Posted: 14 August, 2013",all,Kafro Hudrep,"Rain-Slick 4 is an improvement on Rain-Slick 3 in almost every way. Once again, I played through the game on Insane difficulty. Due to the new monster ally mechanic, party member roles are not as rigid, and many battles require a different approach than using the same team composition over and over. While the overall challenge is slightly less than 3, it felt more rewarding to clear a hard encounter through modifying my strategy rather than just retrying and hoping my tank takes more hits; not to mention, there are still plenty of formidable opponents in the optional content.Aesthetically, the lush landscapes and eccentric creatures of Underhell are far more delightful to behold compared to the streets and buildings of New Arcadia. Along with that, significant upgrades have been given to the music and sound effects, including a couple of really stand-out boss themes, which is excellent because boss themes are the most important aspect in judging a JRPG's quality.My only criticisms are that, for most of the game, the focus switches between two separate parties with their own monster groups. Equipped items are not shared and money is rather scarce, so having to re-optimize after each swap can be quite irritating. The story is also barely-existent, essentially serving as ""an event happened in the previous game and now you have to kill these things and then a final boss so the series can end."" There are a few twists, but they are hard to care about because the characters are primarily vehicles for jokes rather than empathy. This was expected, as Penny Arcade has primarily been about comedy, but again it tends to be hit-and-miss. Personally, while many of the outlandish enemy designs and descriptions genuinely entertained me, the dialogue has a prevalence of snark, walls of text, CAPITALIZED SENTENCES WITH NO PUNCTUATION, ""hitting stuff is funny,"" and ""we all hate everything"" that I can definitely see irritating certain audiences.Still, this is Zeboyd's best game to date, and indeed, one of the most well-refined JRPGs I've played. An exceptionally good deal at $5 for ~15 hours of game time, and an absolute must for those who would rather think than grind."

The maps of the game vary in quality and inspiration, with some being very nice, like the jungle. The portraits of NPCs were not that great, but the sprites in combat looked pretty good, and all were properly animated.The music is great, and was made by Hyperduck, known for their work in some indie titles (they did the soundtrack for Dust: An Elysean Tail for example), but I felt there were a few situations where the music did not match the environment, as was the case with the desert. But that does not change the fact that it is great to have music of such quality after the horrendous soundtrack of PA: RSPD 3.One thing I like about Zeboyd games is how they pick some classic JRPG systems and enhance some features, leaving the boring bits... a lot less boring.As for the combat system, it's a mix of Grandia and Pokemon:The protagonists do not fight directly, but acquire a team of creatures throughout the game for use in combat and act as their trainers. Each creature has its own skills, expertise and equipment types it can use, and in addition each can ""equip"" a trainer, which determines the progression of status when leveling up and also gives access to skills from that trainer.The Grandia part is how the the action order works, which, by the way, was also used in the recent Child of Light: There is a time bar and the icons of all those involved in combating above it. When an icon reaches a certain point of the bar, the character decides on a command. Then the ""casting time"" of the command begins while the icon travels the rest of the bar, and when it reaches the end the action is taken and the icon goes back to the beginning of the bar. The catch is that there are attacks and skills that cause interruptions, making a character go back on the bar, and if it happens between the command and execution the character is thrown far behind. This ends up having a strategic use in the tougher battles.The ""zeboyd"" part of the system is, among other things, the fact that everything (including items) recovers at the end of a battle, making each combat the focus of the challenge, instead of resource management during exploration. Moreover all the monsters are visible on the map and do not respawn, making every fight somewhat unique. Thus, even battles with normal enemies are planned so you have to pay attention because your characters may die if they fight relying just on normal attacks. The downside is that it makes battles time-consuming and also takes away some of the impact from bosses, since they are not much harder than a fight against five strong enemies in the same dungeon, for example.Because of the way the progression and narrative were structured, around halfway through the game I was finding it all a tad monotonous as it was following a very poorly disguised ""go through that dungeon, upgrade your equipment in that city, rinse and repeat"" mechanic. Alas, the towns had hardly anything interesting, all of which contained only NPCs giving ""funny"" remarks or some semi-relevant information (through funny remarks) on the current region. Eventually very short dialogues between characters would occur at the entrances and exits of dungeons, but nothing that could get me invested. By the time I got to late game things got better, mainly because of the battles becoming more interesting with the best skills of my monsters.About the plot, written by Penny Arcade... It's a story that tries to have epic proportions while using a humor deeply rooted in sarcasm all the time. It's bizarre to see the characters of the strips (and others created for the game) alternating between making sarcastic jokes and taking things uncomfortably seriously in a plot that never suspends any disbelief. It felt extremely pretentious, and almost every character (except for Gabe) is extremely obnoxious and arrogant. Another problem is that narratives and descriptions were writen full of flowery and pretentious rubbish, which ends up killing the fun of the jokes it tries to tell, with just a few instances hitting home. I prefer the kind of humor written by Zeboyd themselves, such as what can be seen in Cthulhu Saves the World."

Following on the indie coattails of Rain-Slick 3 (also from Zeboyd), the team raises the stakes and brings the story to a final, satisfying close.This game presents more like a Pokemon or other copy-cat monster trainer RPG (I guess, no personal experience), but the mechanic doesn't diverge too far from the basic party system of PA3. It does give you more characters with distinct personalities and play styles to work with, and that makes a big difference by the end of the game.At times the narrative gets a bit wobbly in the sense that it's just not clear what's going on, but it's never too disorienting for long. In that regard, the pacing of the story is pretty unbalanced. For instance, there's a big plot revelation in the final scene of the game that really ought to have come much sooner. These are minor flaws, yes, but it makes the game feel rushed.This series is well worth playing. It's an ambitious project spurred on by a team of people who have spent most of their adult lives discussing video games and I like to see that. It captures the humor of Penny Arcade brilliantly and, of course, is laced with plenty of in-references (but is rarely obtuse about it)."

Fortunately, 4 aims to mix things up right off the bat. Not drastically, but enough to feel a little different.In Underhell, monsters are far tougher than our characters are used to, so they must capture and train Underhell creatures using a Monstorb - so there's a bit of a Pokémon vibe going on. You can choose which trainer is attached to each monster, which determines the monster's secondary abilities and level up bonuses. You'll want to experiment with different combinations to grow your monsters and benefit from trainer passive abilities, but you can swap at any time. This training feature, coupled with a reduction in combat options, adds a new layer of strategy while cutting down on the option overload. You don't have ten combat abilities per class for three classes - this time at max level you have five or six combat abilities from each of two classes, with passive abilities making up the difference.The new overworld map makes the game feel less like a series of corridors even though it actually changes very little. It's a trick of perception - there are a few optional areas, but for the most part the game is just as linear as the last one. It took me a while to notice, though, so points for that. And the map looks pretty cool too.Visuals and music are more distinctive and unique this time around. Environments that might normally be cliche (like lava world and desert world) are made weird enough that they're still interesting. And then of course there are some more unique areas like the ice cream caverns and the world tree zoo. Many of the audio tracks have more memorable melodies and more interesting sounds - enough for me to be writing about it this time, where last review it was more like ""I guess it did have music"".I had fewer laugh-out-loud moments in 4 than I did in 3. I guess the subject matter - killing the last remaining god to destroy the universe and create a new one - is a bit less conducive to comedy than the more typical (but still weird) adventures in the previous games. But slightly less funny doesn't mean worse because the writing is still great. Tycho becomes an NPC this time around, acting more directly to fulfill his plans, and that's OK because it allows him to finally become as mysterious and badass as he's tried to appear all along.Precipice of Darkness 4 provides a mostly satisfying conclusion to the series.

A fitting ending to the series.The story picks up where the third game ended, as our casts thrown into the abyss they have to finish their job of destroying the world and finds out what happened to Tycho in the process.The game itself is improving what the previous games did. Fixing the linearity of the previous game by adding world map and much bigger, unique and interesting dungeons. Music are AMAZING. Totally different from the 3rd game.Characters now aren't involved in battle instead they use demonic spawns they found in the underworld to fight other monsters ala Pokemon. With characters acting as trainers and giving them osnters bonus in stats and skills as they leveled up.

If you have played 3, then there are two reasons you might be considering this game: 1) you're interested in the ending to the story or 2) you enjoy old school, 8/16-bit turn-based, menu-based RPGs.With regard to the first reason, this game is quite similar to its predecessors from a thematic standpoint.  The story continues from where the last game left off and there is closure.  The dialogue maintains its humor along and the narration retains its cryptic, Tycho-ness.  If you enjoyed this aspect of the Rain-Slick Precipice so far you won't be disappointed.If you remove the Penny Arcade references and focus on the mechanics however, I am convinced you will find it as disappointing as I did.  Combat is repetitive and boring.  This is how I felt about the previous game, but the problem is exacerbated this time because there are noticeably more encounters.  You have the ability for open world exploration, but each individual *instance* is very limited with nothing to do except fight in a linear manner from point A to point B.You can adjust difficulty on the fly throughout the game and I found myself frequently toggling between Veteran and Insane.All in all, I don't regret purchasing this game for $5.00.  If you're not invested in the story though, I recommend going through and playing an actual old school RPG.  I recently finished Final Fantasy 4 and am working through Final Fantasy Dimensions, and both are easily more fun and rewarding than this game.  I would recommend you play those first, even with the latter costing 4x as much."
,Not Recommended,237570,10733672,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,I Aten't Dead,"Honestly it pains me to do this.Zeboyd Games has a reputation for really grabbing the unholy trinity of RPGs: Interesting premise, well constructed gameplay, and dirt cheap price. In the finale of Rain-Slick, they pull off one and a half. While the game retains its bizarre unpredictable environment, fast-paced action, humorous writing, and gains a killer soundtrack, it overstays its welcome rather quickly. Which sucks considering this is the longest game in the series.Early on you're introduced to the UnderHell, which fits considering the fact that virtually everything is unoriginal and dull to walk through. The enemies are as creative as ever but it's horribly boring to go through, which sucks since one of the aims was to give the game a more epic scale with the addition of a world map. The job pin system is also replaced with a party of four different monsters ranging from a bro rodent - or brodent - to a living vending machine, which hits and misses. Similarly to the job pin system of the last game, each monster has its own playing style, but none really match up to the rather impressive ideas that came from the mundane made awesome job system, which in case you forgot, weaponized shoemaking and planted gardens that caused various effects as time passed. Ultimately they play very simularly. The difficulty ramps up nicely as well and offers a good deal of challenge as time goes on, which is nice, though early game feels very simple.Ultimately, Rain-Slick 4 just motivated me with the desire to play 3 again since I had a much better time with it. While this game offered a great amount of unpredictable moments, it's much more predictable. If this was 3 it'd be running around in circles, then as you thought it would keep running it'd do a backflip or start talking in an incomprehensible language, or randomly combust. 4 just keeps running, sometimes changing speeds and direction but it's still moving and you know it's going to move. This works out for it somewhat well as endgame is a lot more predictable compared to 3's endgame coming near out of nowhere, and it finishes very strong too. It's just a lot of the middle faultered greatly.I recommend this game if you want to see the conclusion of the Rain-Slick series, are looking for a somewhat enjoyable RPG to play, or just enjoy Zeboyd Games' games. I mean it's cheap, you really can't beat that."

Episodes 3 and 4, however, combine elements from many classic RPGs such as Final Fantasy 6 and Grandia, all headed by the geniuses behind Penny Arcade AND Zeboyd, the dude who did the hilarious and addictive Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World games.Episode 3 stays a little more traditional by trying to tell the story straight while involving different characters that come and go, various upgrades, a vast job system, and an interesting new MP system. Episode 4 takes a lot from that, but also adds in a sort of Pokemon style take on it, has a hell theme, and replaces jobs with trainer perks.Both episodes are instant classics and well worth your time and attention. The best part is they’re already pretty damn cheap, but then you get them even cheaper by getting them in the package deal.

Penny Arcade 3 and 4 calls back the nostalgia of older JRPGs, especially of FF and CT, but they introduce so much originality that you could hardly hold them for relying on rose tinted glasses alone.  Compared to the JRPGs of yore, PA4 requires very little grinding, and you recover all HP after each battle.  Also, you are welcome to use skills as often as you like, as your MP resets to 0 with each battle (MP grows steadily every turn or with special skills).  This lends each battle a uniqueness of its own, as there is very little mindless button mashing.  Enemies are difficult and even random battles CAN kill you if you don't think through your strategy.  These games also include a ton of customization with the myriad of classes and monsters you can unlock... there are even secret items, classes and monsters for the inquisitive to find, along with the requisite JRPG secret boss that is much more difficult than the normal story boss.  The dialogue is nonsensical and pretentious, and I found myself ignoring much of it... I'm not really a fan of PA's humor anyway, and these RPGs hammer that into my head by taking itself just a little too seriously.

You spend time with one, levelling the monsters and getting comfortable with them... then it switches you to a completely different party, with lower level, unfamiliar monsters. Overall the game has the same level of polish as the previous but isn't as enjoyable (the writing and creativity is worse.)

,Recommended,237570,8413721,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,wolfbm09,"I've reviewed the previous episodes and have been scared to give this review. First off let me be clear, i've loved this series but I honestly am torn as to if I should recommend it. As purely a game on it's own I say yes, on the terms in realtion to the series I say no. It kind of felt to me like it was rushed and made with the idea of ,""ok let's get this series over already"". The only ""playable"" character you have loved the whole series is Johnathan Gabriel. I think why I disliked this series is how drastically it changed after Zeboyd Games got their hands on it. Hot Heads ep 1&2 were great...loved them; Zeboyds ep 3&4 were ok and possibly horrible in regaurds to 4. Episode 3 changed the graphic style and took away your main character but I could give it a pass due to it basically being the same premise. Episode 4......well....it's crap in relation to the series as a whole.When I first loaded 4 I thought ,""Ok, it's keeping it's same style, I can deal with this."" When the game soon informed me that no longer do I do the rpg battles with my characters but with ""pokemon"" style monsters I was at a loss for words. I honestly kept hoping this wasn't going to be how the game played out but sadly it did. Outside of finishing the story this game has literally nothing to do with Precipice of Darkness.Now during this review I have strongly considered changing this to a not recommended but I will tell you why I didn't. The game is good in what it is and can be fun. It does finish the story line so at the end you finally have a conclusion. If the other 3 games didn't exist there woudn't be any trouble with saying it's good. If you buy this hoping for everything from 1,2,&3 you will be sadly and quickly shown you won't find it here. Ok...I'm posting this before I change my mind on to recommend it or not."
,Recommended,237570,8735644,"Posted: 16 January, 2014",all,aejira,"Summary: The fourth installment vastly improves over every element from episode three, with a much more coherent and identifiable plot, a battle system revamped with much more input from the player, a soundtrack that is decently done, and a greater emphasis on the adventure and roleplaying aspects of the game. It spends less time trying to serve itself up as a novelty of the 16-bit era RPGs many of us grew up with and instead craft its' own identity. Granted, some may quickly feel alientated from the approach it took for its' battle system (similar to Pokemon), but it's much more solid experience than previous installments. On its' own merits I'm recommending the game, I think most people will have a good experience and enjoy it. 3.5/5So surprisingly, most of the faults I identified in the previous review for PAOtRSPoD 3 have actually been changed for the better in four. It's still a world full of 2D sprites, still a battle system more akin to Final Fantasy than anything else, and still full of the same humor and writing style from the previous installments. The biggest change you'll find is that the characters you were previously using, Moira, Tycho, Gabe, are all now ""trainers"" and will be in charge of a host of different monsters to control. Now this will sound amazingly like Pokemon, even the ability to change out monsters  with another mid-battle makes it seem ever more so, but the game fully recognizes this. There is even one satirical approach to a reocurring Jesse-and-James (from the Pokemon show)-type nemesis throughout the episode. It was minimal to the story, didn't really affect the pace of the game, and really is a sidenote, but still it shows that the developers were aware of the similarities. Besides this, the items are all fairly the same, spells and effects unchanged, and the WAIT-CMD-ACT phases of battle identical to the last installment.Now the plot from three is summed up in the first few minutes of the game and that was actually very helpful. Three was incoherent and made little-to-no-sense, but the synopsis wrapped things up and put everything into focus. It's kind of ironic that things just seem to make more sense in this new world filled with monsters, demon trains, and flying daewhales than the city of Arcadia, but it does. I feel that the ending was a bit incomplete and may have just opened a window for succeeding episodes, but still there was a set objective, a defined mission that made the game easier to follow. There is still a limited amount of character development, not to mention there is virtually none for all the monsters you capture, but it is still a marked improvement.The game is still fairly linear, but the ability to explore and more importantly the reward factor in doing so has greatly improved. You will find items, chests, and new monsters to ""train"" as you scour for every alternate pathway and random cave on the overworld. I've felt that in the previous games that the reward-to-time ratio was vastly low and in many cases not worth it, but spending the extra time walking around for hidden chests can be rewarding. There are now shops and towns, NPCs, and random dungeons to explore, which adds a greater depth to the world and although the effects of this is superficial, it does add some variety to the monoity of just dungeon-crawling all game.In alot of ways, I feel that this should've been the type of game that was done for #3. I think that there was more effort put into this title and that the last game was kind of written off and pushed out. By no means is this game a masterpiece though with all the praise I've poured over it, it's just a vast improvement on everything that series failed on previously. There are still much better games out and the game can easily be covered in about 8-9 hours. It's not life-changing or particularly deep, but I found it enjoyable. There is limited replayability, the battle system could honestly have been just revamped instead of swapped with the monster trainer approach, and I feel that the game is still linear and falls short of being on par with the gems of the 16-bit era.  One part of the game that blew me away was the soundtrack. The music is a hundred times better and I'll probably end up keeping a few of the songs for casual listening. The Airship and Tycho themes in particular were well done.With these points in mind, I'm recommending this game for the masses, it's a game I might recommend to certain gamer friends and in general you'll probably find something worthwhile along the way. 3.5/5"

It felt professional and didn't feel like a RPGmaker game. There were lots of avenues to go off and explore. There were whole dungeons set off from the main path to look into. The music was actually fun and I enjoyed fighting Fish Force.It did suffer a bit from repetitive gameplay but that's a fault of the genre not of the game and I think the devs saw that by not making you fight an insane amount of enemies and spicing it up with special conditions, having two parties you switch between, and giving you a lot of combinations of heroes and monsters to fight with. The third game I had to grind monsters for an hour or two for xp but there's none of that in this game.I never read the Penny Arcade comics so I didn't quite understand the reasoning of Tycho but the storyline was still fun. I wish they had kept the unnamed protagonist in One and Two but maybe there is a limit to the technology they used in this one."
