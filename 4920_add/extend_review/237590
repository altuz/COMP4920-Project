The Game might as well be an unofficial expansion pack to the Old School Games' previous effort, God Mode. The guns, animations, and AI behaviours are all the same, but with different skins and models. Oh, there's also the whole license tie-in and some small semblance of a plot, but you don't care about that. You came here for more God Mode, and that's what you're going to get with ""Bet"" replacements for Oaths and  ""challenges"" in place of Tests of Faith. The game is generally easier thanks to infinitely stocked ammo boxes scattered throughout the stages as well. So, do you still want more God Mode? If so, then this is for you. Anyone else, stay far away."

For a game that relies on Co-op sadly even from launch noone really bought it to make it worthwhile.  To play the game single player requires clicking custom match, then it boils down to a simple wave attack game.  Not very interesting and during the first match feels old and tired.  This is one of those games that takes longer to download than anyone bothers to play it because it gets boring that fast which is just pathetic.Rating:  0/10   Value:  $0.00"

The only sad fact is that you kick your very own♥♥♥♥♥and so hard as much you paid for it. Is not that it would be insanely bad, but it can be frustrating due the game knows itself that many parts could have been easily made better with a little bit of effort. Graphics are decent and technical-wise (supports all modern resolutions) the game is up to any standard (non-indie) game. I also like the design of the weapons, which are retro, but classy at the same time, though - we now leap into the very core of the game, they feel utterly uneffective on their initial levels. You need upgrade them at least to level 2, even better to level 3 to be able to feel a bit secure with them -  unless you have ammo for those babies. Yes, ammo. This one of the most frustrating parts, is extremly limited. Wouldn't be better if the creators would have raised the ammo ammount instead putting multiple ammo boxes on the maps? I would say yes, and of course the enemies doesn't seem to have this problem, their ammo is basically unlimited, included a unlimited ammount of pretty effective grenades, which are able to kill you in one hit. Your grenades? You don't have any, not even a limited ammount! Also enemies, unlike the players models they look literally like scarecrows. I haven't seen the movie, but they look just too idiotic to me. To this also comes the very hard boss battle (due the endless summoning of enemy groups), which is near to impossible to do alone on anything as the mild difficulty. Did even Oldschool Games played their own game? I'm really wondering about that.So unless you aren't a huge fan of the movie, avoid it. Even if I bought it cheaper as one lunch (I'm now on diet anyways) I start to regret it. But no, I don't want a refund, I want a better game from you Oldschool Games, which isn't just a reshaped version of your previous project.My rating - 3/10"

The guns are even more inaccurate than God Mode, with the reticule slightly off to the right of where your model shoots when not aiming down the sights. Has only 2 player co-op compared to God Mode's 4 player. The game places semi-random challenges to avoid the fact there is no substantial progression during the levels. I played this game for 20 minutes before I understood it is an endless wave shooter with no story campaign and not much incentive to improve equipment. I promptly requested a refund after that sub-par quality of an experience.While God Mode has it's own problems, if you can get that to run, play that with friends. It is the superior version of the two, made by the same developers."

I liked the game, it was very simple to play and a lot of fun. The betting system was one bit me and brother enjoyed a lot, if you mange to get through a level killing all the badguys in the right amount of time then you will get to do a face off against your friend, I think you can choose from a dual, combat and how many ghosts you kill or how much money you can get so all this just adds up to the fun. I bought this game during a sale and got the two pack deal for like £4 so it was worth the price, I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it a full price as the game can sometimes get repetitive so just wait for those sales and give a copy to a mate as you won't find anyone to play with online and will have to wait a long time and this is the♥♥♥♥♥♥kicker if the other guy leaves the game for whatever reason the game ends that's it.The RatingSo the rating I overly enjoyed this game and found it to be one of the best co-op games but because it is a cash cow and slightly misleading I will have to give it 6/10Thanks for readingCash"

Sure, I recognize why everyone says it's bad, but doesn't mean I don't enjoy it myself.As for the game, I got the 2-pack so that I could gift it to a friend and we play together. I don't bother with the online lobby. It's got some strange controls but it's not totally unplayable. The third-person takes getting used to.Some of the menu visuals make me think that the game is less based on the movie and more based on the graphic novel. Although there are clearly elements lifted from the movie, such as the voice acting from the two main characters.I do wish there was a single player mode. When I bought the game, I half expected it to let you step through the story of the movie as a self-contained single player campaign. Nope! It's multi-player only and doesn't follow any story.Overall, far from a perfect game, but nice for a 2-player experience with a friend.Wait for it to go on sale, the asking price of $9 is a little high for what you're getting.

76561198023996575,Recommended,237590,11764813,"Posted: 18 August, 2014",all,JohannZA,"R.I.P.D.:  The Game (Old School Games, 2013)Some have referred to this game as a re-skin of Old School Games' other, better known shooter, God Mode.  While they are clearly built on the same core design, the games are different enough for such a comparison to be invalid.  Certainly, you could love the one and dislike the other, and I have no doubt that some people do.  Me however, I love them both.  In other words, brace yourself, because a glowing review is incoming.First things first, I have not seen the movie on which this game is based.  (I shall post in the comments once I have.)  I've seen the movie trailer about three times and have an idea of the core concept - great policemen are brought back from the dead to battle demonic bad guys, or some such thing.  However, not having seen the movie, the locations and enemy designs do not make all that much sense.  Obviously, once I've seen the movie these things will likely have been cleared up.  As of this writing though, I'm going to disregard those elements not related to the gameplay, as I have no measure of the developers' success in implementing facets of the movie.Looking at R.I.P.D.:  The Game purely for what it is, i.e. a run and gun, third-person shooter, one can't help but take note of the following:1.  It's fast.  Much faster than God Mode.  The enemies are on you in a second and there's nary a breathing space to be found.  Once you get to the higher difficulty levels you'll be running and rolling (and gunning) non-stop.2.  It's colourful.  No dull greys and browns here.  The colour palette is just sumptuous!  All deep and saturated.  Love it!3.  The level designs are brilliant.  Each level has its own identity and warrants developing a new way to approach it.  And really, the level designs are this game's greatest strength.  These levels wouldn't look out of place in whatever AAA shooter you'd care to mention.  (And that's odd, considering you're playing a movie-based game.)4.  The weaponry is fairly generic (outside of two bonus weapons).  I was expecting something more in line with God Mode's exotic weaponry.  You are after all a ghost cop fighting supernatural enemies.5.  Music is good, gets you pumping, but lacks variety.  I believe there are only two or three different tunes.6.  Control is tight i.e. responsive.  I have had no trouble doing what I want to do.7.  The A.I. is incredibly adept at avoiding your attacks, strafing around you, seeking cover, and generally making your life a living hell.  This is especially true at the higher difficulty levels.These were my immediate impressions.  Since then I've gone on to do everything there is to do, including unlocking all of the achievements, upgrading all of the weapons, buying the super-expensive bonus weapons (with gold earned in-game, just like in God Mode).  I certainly don't bother with writing reviews for every game I own.  But I feel that R.I.P.D.:  The Game is worth taking the time for.  I'll be uninstalling it soon, as I have quite a backlog that requires my attention.  But if you need some help with whichever part of the game, feel free to ask in the comments section below.I would like to add that I bought two copies of the game for €3 during the recent Summer sale.  I feel like I got my money's worth.  And honestly, if you pay €3 to €5 for a single copy you'll still be getting a good deal.  (Provided you can afford it.)  Otherwise keep an eye on Ebay for a Steam key;  some people will be selling those separately, what with the game recently having been bundled by Indiegala.SCORESGraphics - 75 %It's a good looking game.  At times I've been floored by just how good looking.  It's true that R.I.P.D.:  The Game isn't jaw dropping like God Mode.  But I certainly never thought a company would go to this much effort for a movie-based game (although Ocean had some classics back in the day).  The interplay of earthy and neon colours work to the visual style's advantage - it's set in the real world, but the setting never looks too real to make the supernatural element stick out as being unsuited to the environments.The character models are lacking in detail.  I'll give the critics that much.  The main characters also do not entirely resemble the actors on which they are based, namely Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges.  Since I havn't seen the movie, I have no idea how accurate the enemy representations are.  And since the game is played at a fair rate of knots, I never had much issues with details being a bit lacking.There also isn't much variety in the enemy models.  But again, I didn't mind, I was having too much fun with the gameplay.Sound - 45 %Weaponry feature fairly generic sound effects.  The musical selection is limited.  Only one voice actor who narrates the cinematic comic-style story sequences (and I don't think he's famous).  If they paid to use the likenesses of Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges (however poorly they may be represented here), shouldn't their voices have been made available as well?  I ask as the game's trailers feature clips from the movie.  So surely the game could have integrated the movie's audio a bit better.  It's all a slight bit quiet at times.  The speed of the gameplay means you don't really ponder the silence.  But some wisecracks from the protagonists wouldn't have gone amiss.Addictiveness - 90 %I started it.  I played almost nothing else (except R.I.P.D.:  The Game and God Mode, which I also purchased on the Summer sale).  I didn't take any long breaks until I had all of the achievements.  It all just clicked.  I'm not expecting it to click for you, necessarily, but I enjoyed myself.  Moreso, I enjoyed challenging myself, as the higher difficulty levels are the purest, hardest hardcore you could ask for.I played most of it solo.  I really should note this:  the game is much easier if you partner up with a friend.  But the solo challenge was what I was after.  I wanted the adrenaline.  I wanted to have my l33t skills pushed to the limit.  And R.I.P.D.:  The Game did all that for me and more.  Two of the achievements require that you play with someone else.  Luckily the game is available in a two-game bundle, with a slight discount.Execution - 80 %As a low-budget, low-priced run and gun shooter the execution is far better than expected.  As a movie game, the execution is superb.  The game is difficult to master.  But extremely satisfying once you do.Obviously the question of whether the game stays true to the source material or not needs to factor into the score here.  I havn't seen the movie though and can't judge it on that specific criteria.  I also will likely not see the movie in the near future, though I am actively in the market for a second-hand copy of the Blu-Ray release.Overall - 85 %R.I.P.D.:  The Game is a delightful slice of hardcore shooting action.  It is run and gun of the purest sort and an easy recommendation for fans of this particular sub-genre.Of particular note is that none of the achievements are broken.  Though I would recommend God Mode over R.I.P.D.:  The game, the realisation that two of God Mode's achievements are broken made for quite an annoyance, as I truly adore that game and was hoping to achieve 100 % on it.  So yes, that 100 % is achievable on R.I.P.D.:  The Game, if you're the kind of person who's into that sort of thing.Overall, if you're in the market for a fresh new take on the run and gun genre, this isn't it.  God Mode, however, will wonderfully surprise and awe you with its many ingenious qualities.  However, if you want to test yourself, and you want to do it on a fairly standard framework, then don't shy away from R.I.P.D.:  The Game.  It's basic.  But all hardcore things are.To close off, the Inferno difficulty can only be unlocked once you've beaten the boss.  I did it.  And I beat every level on Inferno after that.  Playing solo.  Now let's see you match that."

And hey,it has Jeff Bridges,and we all know how awesome he is."

,Not Recommended,237590,33367614,Posted: 8 July,all,ILikeToasters,Really fun if you are the type of person who liikes banging their head against a wall or stubbing your toe.  If you are looking for a really terrible game to play for the laughs and can get it in a bundle (please don't pay anything for this game) then this  is great. Okay not really.  Of course everyone should know not to buy a game made from a movie.  Rarely is that a good idea.
