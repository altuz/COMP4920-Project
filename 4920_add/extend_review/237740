It pretty much plays like a NES game, though the graphics and music are *slightly* more modern. It’s hard, but not too hard. It gets easier if you keep practicing, and is very rewarding when you manage to finish a level. There’s also tons of references to NES games, which you’ll probably know from AVGN’s videos, and the music is awesome too.My only complaint is that it seems to crash quite a lot, especially when I’m near the end of a level. Ugh. Maybe that's just me."

76561198085752945,Recommended,237740,32629755,Posted: 21 June,all,Roy Johnson,"Now, I went into this game as a fan of the AVGN. As a fan, I found this to be a very entertaining experience. But even if you're not too familiar with the Nerd and his reviews, I feel some enjoyment can be had with this game. This game drenches itself in the retro aesthetic from the sprites-style to the kickass soundtrack to the ridiciliously hard gameplay. This game really doesn't baby itself with its difficulty. Even when given infinite lives, the game can be a challenge. Admittedly, most of the challenge comes from the ""death blocks"" (instant touch 1-hit KO) which are drenched throughout the game. This does cheapen some of the difficulty you face. But still I felt a rewarding feeling when I did overcome these challenges and beat the game. Even if it did took a while and I had to pull every hair out of my head to do it. But really you'll get the most enjoyment out of this game if you are a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd. The game is filled to the brim with references and really does a good job in representing the Nerd's profane, ridiculous, and insane sense of humor. I also recommend plugging in a controller to really get the true experience (keyboard controls don't feel as right). Even with its flaws and conditions, I can say I REALLY enjoyed playing this game. The game might emulate those ""crappy games that sucked a$$"" but it is definitely not an example of such."
,Recommended,237740,7762743,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Emily,"One of the most frustrating, yet fun to play platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. A game based on the hit, internet sensation the Angry Video Game Nerd, a character portrayed by James Rolfe whom reviews older games ranging from the Atari, to the SEGA Genesis to the NES and a bunch more.Off the bat, the game starts out by introducing the Angry Video Game Nerd (or AVGN for short) before he is sucked into the TV (by the balls no less!) and is forced to play through what he calls hell. The stages, quotes, etc are references to older video games and episodes he has done in the past. The game itself conveys a traditional 8-Bit art style for the majority of assets used in the game aswell as play the expected 8-bit style music to go along with them.Now, personally, I love this game and actively recommend it to everyone that loves/loved watching AVGN and likes tough platformers in general. The game plays out very similarly to classic MegaMan games and Mario Bros, since the Nerd has his standard jump, shoot and crouch, as well as a few nifty temporary power-ups you can pick up across the stages - these range from the Glitch Gremlin (a green creature that glitches the game and often helps with progression as it halts both stage hazards and enemies), the Super Mega Death Christ (Yes lol, a power up that destroys every enemy present on the screen at the time.), an upgraded gun for the Nerd (Has a much bigger hitbox than his standard light gun) and rocks (Yes rocks, like those found on one of his older episodes that he says is useless because of the low travel distance and low damage).The game has a 3 damage health system and lives (unless you pick a higher or lower difficulty setting in which the game alters these). 3 beer bottles pretty much signal how many more hits you can take before dying, and the lives, like in older Megaman games, means how many times you can retry before being kicked out from the stages. There are also toasters (checkpoints) scattered across the stage to mark your progress on any given stage, but they are optional to activate as there are also beer bottles scattered across to help restore health to you - and there's also secret characters you can unlock all based on his show.Stage Progression~ Generally, excluding the tutorial stage - you pick a stage in a similar fashion to MegaMan games, there are 8 in total. Each stage has their own deathtraps, some will take a point of damage, and some, like the golden skull blocks found across every stage, will kill you in one hit. Some zones are based around very careful and timing based jumps, movement, etc - like some zones will have an enemy type that is there to hinder you while you do a section, it's all very much reminiscent of the old formula of games back in the day - and like those games, this game isn't very forgiving.In general, if you're a fan of the AVGN no doubt you'll already have this, but if you're a fan of tough NES-like platformers, get this game. From the obscenely ridiculous references to the appealing art style, this game screams AVGN charm.B+"

,Not Recommended,237740,8054747,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,Ashes,"I'm a huge fan of AVGN and have watch every single one of his videos several times. To see a game based on his outrages is such a brilliant idea. This game really takes everything that he hates about bad games, or they take some of his comments and make them an actual idea. (Especially the ""Super Pitfall"" reference was brilliant.)If you've watched his videos you'll easily catch the references through out the game and the appearences of popular characters. Some of them are so awesome it brought a huge smile to my face (like the fireshark) and it's also nice being able to beat up the boss on the Atari stage. They are in no way overpowering a whole stage, just a small reference placed perfect in some parts of the game.I liked that the stages had their own themes as well as that they tried to include his famous quotes in the game as a reference. I wouldn't have mind seeing more bats in the horror stage, as it always seems the old games have way too many bats than needed. I think my favorite stage was the Winter stage, just because of what happens after you defeat the first boss. Just brilliant and easily my favorite part of the game. Anytime you die, you get a randomly generated outrage from the nerd which is fun when there's a great mix up.The graphics are well done and the music is very good. The controls for the most part feels very solid. I'm glad you can adjust the keyboard to your own liking.So why don't I recommend this game?Well, unfortunately whoever designed all these stages obviously ran out of ideas after taking the nerds outrages that don't fill a complete stage. So half the stages consist of instant death blocks. More than half of the deaths within the game will happen due to these blocks that are everywhere. Placed in hard-to-reach areas, walls of death blocks that changes between invisibility and jumping over them with a sketchy trampoline techinques. Did I mention they are literally everywhere in this game?What would have been a brilliant platformer with great humor and references, ends up being a practice jump game to test your accuracy whether or not you're able to avoid these deathblocks or not. I guess the idea is making the game so utterly frustrating you will swear and scream like the Nerd, but even the games he played seem more fun than going through a stage of deathblocks. A lot of the games he did play featured some areas with frustrating jumps, but not to the extend that this game uses them.If it wasn't for these tedious deathblocks, the game would honestly be very short. There isn't much variety to the stages other than being lucky enough to avoid deathblocks and occassionally shooting some enemies. It's like switching from one deathblock avoiding game to another. Just add some new sprites and backgrounds and voila, you are ready to make another test of frustrating accuracy. It feels quite sad that such a fantastic idea just ends up as a bland jumping game.I can enjoy a game despite them being difficult. This isn't one of them though. Anytime I completed a stage I didn't get that rewarding feeling. In other difficult games, you complete the difficult part, then move onto another different, yet difficult task. It really was like playing the same stages over and over, with the deathblocks making up too much of my playtime than it was enjoyable. I enjoyed the parts of the game where these weren't present and quite frankly, I wouldn't have minded them being a bit here and there. It just feels that they are all over the game as a way to extend a very short game into something longer."

It does a great job of emulating the Nerd's typical brand of crude, geeky humour. The game is all about what the show is about: raging at old-school, hardcore gameplay that is often frustratingly hard.It plays just like a classic Nintendo platformer, with levels poking fun at famous - as well as infamous - games of the 80's and 90's. What is great is that it throws these old-school frustrations at you without it being badly designed. It's done in such a way that it is hard not because it's poorly designed, like many of the Nerd's most despised games, but because it requires skill and some effort. It's not unfair if you start at the easiest settings.The Nerd humour is recognizable in every element of the game: there's a randomly generated line of cursewords if you die, Mecha Jesus powerups, a laser-shooting shark in Hell, snowboarding on Santa's corpse, sh*t pickles and gratitious amounts of potty humour. Each level is distinct and full of geeky references to the show.In the style of Capcom classics like Mega Man or DuckTales, you can start at any level you want, with an additional final level opening up once you beat all of them. Each one is based on different Nerd episodes and video games. At one point you are fighting Doom-inspired poop demons and a big-toothed Satan in Hell, the next moment you play through a colourful level reminiscent of Super Mario World and in another instance you find yourself shooting ghosts and zombies in a Castlevania-based world. There's even a level based on the 'Atari Porn Games' episode which really must be seen to be believed.Hidden inside the game are three additional playable characters from theCinemassacre.comuniverse as well as cameos ofScrewattack.comstars. Fans of the Nerd will know what I am talking about. Power-ups include Super Mecha Death Christ and the Glitch Gremlin, two funny allies that attack all enemies on screen. There's also somewhat useless grenades, poking fun at that one useless power-up that every video game in the 80s and 90s seemed to have.It's that parody element that makes this game so great. It's not just an old-school 'NES-hard' game, it's also a parody of every game ever made in that genre, both the classics and the ones that are the subjects of the Nerd's crudely graphic tirades. If you like that type of humour and are a fan of the show, this game is for you. If you are unfamiliar with the AVGN and the show's inside jokes, the game falls a bit short, however. Look past the Nerd twist given to classic gaming tropes and the levels turn out to be fairly similar in gameplay elements and are only different enough in the visual department.If you like old-school, NES-hard platformers, you will feel right at home. You will die. A lot! At the easiest setting, you have unlimited lives, plenty of checkpoints and more health. The credits will roll in a few hours. Try normal, hard or one of the unlockable even harder (!) modes and you will face a much more meaty challenge that will leave even the most veteran gamer screaming in frustration.There are plenty of similar old-school platform games available on Steam. Wether or not you want to buy this particular one ultimately boils down to the question of wether or not you are a fan of the Nerd. If you are, it's worth your ten bucks. If you aren't, it's just one of many games to choose from for fans of this genre. You won't get much of the inside jokes that make up much of what sets this game apart from others. Thankfully, the overlap between genre fans and the AVGN fandom is probably big enough to make this a game I can recommend."

Noob (Nightmare Lyra),"Before people get angry, yes I like AVGN, I like challenging platformers, I like chiptune music and 8-bit grapichs, etc. and I really really wanted to like this game.However, I am also of the opinion that if you are parodying something by doing the same thing ironically and then charging money for it, you are still doing the same thing as the thing you parody, and there lies the real problem: strip away the funny presentation and this is the very type of game that James Rolfe makes fun of in his videos, a game filled with fake difficulty to artificially pad out the play time.Yes, I get it, it's meta jokes, and the jokes are fun... the first time, then comes the major grind to actually beat the levels with insane unfair difficulty. The levels are fairly well designed in of themselves and are amusingly parodying many of the games reviewed on the show, but the platforming controls are rather stiff, hitboxes are often bigger/smaller than they look and obviously the game does everything to kill you as much as possible, though not in a funny ""invisible block near a pit"" kind of way which would give it a bit of a puzzle element, here it's just by throwing a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥at you at once and having you deal with it through sheer pressure.Also while other fake difficulty parody games like I Wanna Be That Guy at least have the decensy to not throw you back to the beginning unless you pick the higher difficulties when you die, here it does just that on everything but Easy when running out of extra lives which I find to be a major flaw from a modern perspective, no matter how retro or thematically appropriate it is. And before you say ""just go play on Easy then"", I would if it didn't give me more HP than normal, make bosses stupidly easy to beat and lock off several achivements, which obviously isn't very enjoyable, and it still doesn't fix the hitbox and stiff controller issue.Ignoring the difficulty, the game is also rather short. If you get good at this I could imagine you would be able to beat the entire thing in 2-3 hours, though it does have a fair ammount of hidden secrets and replay value for the really really hardcore crowd when you unlock the truly ridicolous difficulty levels, so it's not that big of a problem, but still worth noting.Basically, if you don't mind NES games that beat your♥♥♥♥♥with fake difficulty to the max and aren't affraid to start from the beginning of a stage (or the game itself) every time you die, you will probably love this game. Fans of AVGN may also appreciate the referencial humor to both the show itself and the games that he have played. However, the game still isn't up to modern standards in many respects, and it is rather hypocritical, and therefor I cannot recommend it to everyone. It's basically an extremely niche title with a (relatively) mass appeal brand attached to it, but if you don't fall into that niche it might not be worth the frustration no matter how much you like AVGN. If Steam had a ""middle"" option I would have picked that, but for now I am sad to say I will have to give it a thumbs down personally.Also, I think James did a disadvantage to the game by reviewing it himself and showing off all the best bits in the video, made playing the actual thing feel a bit less special."

There's potential here with decent controls and above average spritework but it is quickly squandered in gameplay aside from the outstanding soundtrack and occasional fun reprieve. There's a heavy reliance on 1-hit kill tiles and trollish blind traps to create a crutch of artificial difficulty that takes the place of interesting and iterative level design. Enemies, jokes and references get recycled over and over through the game to the point of tedium.

That said, certain problems keep me from loving the game.The game is a throwback to the 8-bit style of games both good and bad. The game also pokes fun of bad games and has many refrences to avgn and in those regards, this game is perfect. The problem is that if you strip those things out you are left with a game very frustrating and cheap.Graphics 10/10- I have no problems with this game on this font...They're great and you know what everything is as soon as you see it.

The sound track is a real standout part of the game, with great remixes of the avgn theme and orignal work that would be at home with the nes tune greats. The audio mixing is great too, with every shot  and explosion having a perfectly timed sound effect.Control 9/10- Any problem you have with the difficulty will not be related to this. The controls are great, the only complaint is that switching characters in boss battles can be hard on the controller since there are four characters and only two buttons to switch between them.Gameplay 6/10-Now for my biggest issue. The game is very cheap with it's deaths. The game is going for jokes about bad design choices, but the problem is it only works if you get the joke. Because at the end of the day a bad design choice is still bad. I know this was for a reason but that doesn't make the game play better. But to be fair, it isn't awful. There are very cool moments in the game as well. I just wish they cut back on those death blocks. They're funny at first but lose me the 50th time they instant kill me.replay 8/10-If you are a fan of the show then this game has a treasure trove of goodies. Hidden characters and cameos, secret jokes, and every frame is a refrence to the show is some way. The only thing is that all this doesn't matter unless you are a hardcore fan. There are multiple difficulties but I think the game is hard enough on normal.overall 7/10-If you love the show totally worth it. But as a game it's slightly above average."

This is doubled when coming from the perspective of an actual AVGN fan such as myself, but even then, someone new to AVGN could still pick this up and be heavily amused by it. Adult humor required. In terms of the gameplay, it's as difficult as some may have heard and this is also amplified tenfold depending on the difficulty you pick, such as Old School or YOLO difficulty. In short, NES hard. The game is incredibly fun though, so I'd recommend playing it and having a good time."

I respect and enjoy his content, but his game just didn't work out for me.)I wish there was a Mixed opinion for reviews, but since there isn't, I have to make it a negative.When I was 12, I was very curious about this game when I saw it was rated M on the 3DS/Wii U. I was like, ""what the heck? How can a pixelated game like this get a M rating? That's stupid."" That was the time I never heard about the Angry Video Game Nerd. So when I found out the game is on steam, I bought it on sale to see what it's like. Well... since I was 12 I wasn't use to language, I stopped playing after 5 minutes, and never touched the game ever again.Now after 2 years... I came back to this game since now I'm use to language, and it has been a while.Now to the actual review:Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures (AVGNA) is an action-platformer. Nerd and his friends were playing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, which caused Nerd's friends to be sucked into the TV. Nerd almost escapes, but then an arm comes out the TV, and grabs him by his... balls... and gets pulled inside the TV. There isn't much of a story, but it's an alright and appropriate opening for this game.The gameplay at parts can be fun, but most of the game is filled with cheap deaths. The first level isn't all that bad, and the easiest out of the whole entire game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥vania is more difficult, but yet still passable. Happy Fun Candy Time is even more difficult, to the point it can make you get quite frustrated. Future ****balls 2010 feels easier than Happy Fun Candy Time, but it's still quite hard. Blizzard of Balls is like Future ****balls 2010: It's easier than HFCT but it's still quite hard. Thy Farts Consumed has the coolest moment in the game, but the level is quite difficult, and needs some thinking.Dungeons and ****holes has a part that is quite unexpected for a cheap death, but the level is quite hard. Beat It and Eat It is a... low graphic porno stage... that actually made me rage quit. It's mostly the second hardest stage in the game.That's how far I got, but you know where I'm going: The game is hard as hell. The game does make fun of bad level design, but that doesn't make it any better.The gameplay does go overboard with the death blocks. They're everywhere... and in every level. If you touch one, it's an automatic death. Since these are in every level, and everywhere, you will die a lot. To make things worse: there is different type of death blocks. There is a type that just stays in place, a type that disappears for 3 seconds and reappears for 3 seconds, a type that you need to be close to see where that death block is at, etc. etc.When you die, you get AVGN references to the show. They're suppost to be funny, but for me, they just appear just childish and cringeworthy. If Nerd said it in the show, it's funny, but if you read it, it's not that funny and you just want to get back into the game (the death screen lasts for like 5 seconds each. No joke.).The game does have positives, though.The 8-bit graphics are the best I've seen in any game. Everything is very detailed, and you know what you are looking at.The soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥ They did a good job on making the soundtrack sound amazing, and fit appropriately into levels.You can use a controller. That makes the game much more easier to control since using a keyboard doesn't really work well for platformers.TL;DR: But even with its positives, Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is just a game that is only made to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. I know it's suppose to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, but making a game way to overwhelmingly difficult just ruins the fun of the game, and it won't make you want to come back to the game.I will try my best to finish the game, but I can't recommend it (really wish there was a Mixed option for reviews). 5/10.Edit 1:I had 24 lives, and lost all of those lives on ONE BLOODY BOSS.

A movie thats out today and a video game thats right here on steam. But will this be the game you will want to play ? We play as the angry game nerd who gets trapped in Game Land. So he has to conquer all the levels to get out. So how is this game ? Personally i really enjoyed it. This game is a shooter platformer in the style of contra. The game also is quite difficult and one of the hardest games i have played. The game has a few problems. The level desing is pretty bad. The controls are kinda stiff at moments cause the game requires a split second reaction time. The game is also quite buggy.The game has this really annoying thing called Death Blocks which seems like all levels are made. If you touch em thats it game over and its quite annoying that youre jumps need to be very persise to not get killed by em. Overall Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a really fun platforming game with an exceptional soundtrack and its also really fun to play. Its also quite short and i suggest you get this game on sale.

While it certainly is good for AVGN fans and it certainly is difficult, it is by no means fair. Rather than building the game around a particular structure and then making that difficult, the game is built around the difficulty itself. This means that almost every part of the game is designed to kill you, particularly in certain areas. Fantastic music and stylized graphics are overshadowed by areas that get so difficult, they no longer feel like levels but like a path of obstacles created in a predesigned level builder. Many of the faults that the AVGN has pointed out in numerous bad games have been built into this one, and by doing so it's less of a parody and more of a bad game itself. All in all, AVGN fans will be pleased by the pretty colors and references, but anyone else will find this a very frustrating experience."

,Recommended,237740,21990088,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Cosmozerk,"After finally completing The Angry Video Game Adventures for the first time i can only say...WOW.STORY: The plot of AVGN Adventures goes like this: One day the Nerd and his friends were playing a ***** game, when suddenly the TV sucks them in, the nerd tries to escape, but he gets grabbed by the sack and he enters Game Land to complete 9 levels and find out who the **** is responsible for this.PRESENTATION: AVGN Adventures, like many other games, looks like an old retro-NES-SNES-game and by that i mean that the game has a mixture between 8 and 16 bits type graphics and sound (all tho you could argue with 32 bits for the sound, but that's besides the point). The sprites and backgrounds are well done and detailed, the framerate is consistent (at around 60fps) and the music ¡is kick-***!, everything in this game looks colorful, eye catching and different from one and other.GAMEPLAY: AVGN Adventures plays like a 2D platforming shooter from the NES era with a very high difficulty. You platform around and shoot the enemies with the NES Zapper to progress and you can get upgrades or sub-weapons to add to your arsenal.The game has 4 Characters to play with and each of them has some especial attribute, tho you do have to find the other characters. First there's ""The Nerd"", which is my personal favorite, he's the most balanced character of them all with a decent run speed, a decent jump high and he does decent damage, BUT! he is the only character who can use the upgrades and sub-weapons + he can stand in place and shoot in 8 directions, he is personally my character of choice most of the time. Then there's the ""The Guitar Guy"", he might seem like an awful character at first since he cannot use any sub-weapon or upgrade, he can only fire straight forward and he's jump is very...meh, BUT! he is the fastest of the bunch and his proyectiles can go through walls, proyectiles and barriers and believe me that doesn't sound like much, but he is very useful later on, especially on the final boss. Next there's ""************ Mike"", he has decent run speed and his weapon has a little range, BUT! he can use that weapon to destroy certain walls and he can jump the highest. And then theres ""********-Man"", he is the slowest of the bunch and he's jump is TERRIBLE, BUT he's the strongest and he can do a ""not-so-helpful-double-jump"", personally i never used him, and i feel he's the worst of all the characters. You find these hidden characters (excluding the Nerd) by using the abilities that each of them have.Now while the game does have all of those characters, they are actually not required to beat the game. YEAH every level was designed in a way so you can complete all of them with just the Nerd, but while this is true, certain parts of the levels will be a **** ton easier if you have a buddy along with you, so keep that in mind. Speaking of the levels, the level design, for the most part, is pretty good...that's all i can say about it. This is certainly good level design, but i feel like sometimes got lazy when designing some parts of the levels. Each level has some sort of gimmick in them, but aside from that each level plays pretty much the same way. One of the things that this game loves to throw you is death blocks (pretty self-explanatory), there's like a bizillion of them throughout the game and the placement can be very brutal at times. The levels have some very fun set pieces and creative enemies (tho some of them are just re-skins of other enemies).Overall the level design for the most part is really good, but there are some parts that are designed to anger you AND OMG they succeed. The game is hard, in a Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Zelda II, Megaman type of way. Now don't worry it's not as hard as any of those, but some of them can make say the phrases that the nerd says every time you die. But quite frankly only 2 of the 9 levels legitimately angered me and by the 2-3-4-6-8 playthrough of the level...it wasn't that bad and i felt like most of my deaths were fair and even if you feel like you are having a hard time, the game has different difficulty levels. I recommend normal mode for your first playthrough, it gives you 30 lives and 3 beers (which are this game life bar) and even in the highest difficulty, there are a lot of checkpoints throughout each stage.At the end of every level there's a Boss which will require a different strategy to defeat and you will have to memorize the patterns in order to beat them, tho some of them are very easy.The game has a lot of references to the Angry Video Game Videos and any AVGN fan (like me) will feel right at home with the over abundance of references, jokes and even cameos from other youtubers and enemies of the Nerd.So overall with great graphics, music, bosses, characters, controls, decent level design, references and much more, Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures gets and 8/10. Definitely worth your money...and i can't wait for the sequel!!!."

For the three people around who aren't familiar with AVGN, he's a character whose life mission is to play some of the worst video games from the retro era. The original focus was the Nintendo Entertainment System, but games for others systems have also been covered. The brainchild of filmmaker James Rolfe, the nerd is a loud, vulgar, beer-swilling cad who bemoans his need to play these horrible games. The pain is eased in no small measure by his love for Rolling Rock beer.Angry Video Game Nerd Adventure is very much a fan service game, so it's the dedicated videos of his web-based show that will get the most out of the experience. Borrowing heavily from the 8-bit Mega Man games, the gameplay is classic, tough-as-nails platforming with insane traps, waves of enemeis and frequent deaths. Fans of the aforementioned Mega Man, Metroid, Castlevania and Contra games will appreciate the old school difficulty. While one-hit kills are frequent, you do have a life meter (a line of beer bottles) and you can find health power-ups throughout the level. Searching the levels also unlocks new playable characters. Each level is based on a trope from the AVGN series, with various in-jokes to the series providing much enjoyment to hardcore fans.While your enjoyment of the crass humor depends on how familiar with the AVGN series you are, the gameplay is accessible for most retro game fans. Your goal is to get from one end of the level to the next and defeat a boss, very simple premise, but the difficulty makes it an endurance test of trial and error. This is by design, since the game is a homage to an era where video games didn't hold your hand and ""Game Over"" meant just that. There is an easier difficulty setting for those who want an easier ride, but the true risk and reward comes with the more challenging settings. Since the platforming needs to be precise, I highly recommend playing with a controller over the mouse and keyboard. The game plays beautifully with my Xbox 360 controller, with fast, responsive and tight controls making the game a blast...even if I'm constantly dying,AVGN Adventures is not a perfect game, but it's a joy to play if you're a fan of retro side-scrollers and especially fans of the AVGN show. The full price is a little steep for some, but those who make the investment are in for a great time."

76561198044917795,Recommended,237740,7979299,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Pale Caesar,"I recommend this game, but with stipulations.(1) You have to appreciate 2D sidescrollers. Unlike Super Meat Boy, which at its most basic is attainable to almost anybody (thanks in no small part to it's quick respawn and limited screen length), AVGNA is rooted much more in old school games (as is to be expected). If you can't stand 2D sidescrollers from the NES or SNES era, you WON'T enjoy this game.(2) You have to expect its difficulty. Beings as it was devised to emulate the atrocities (to an extent) that The Nerd reviews on his videos, this game emulates the difficulty perfectly. I didn't even attempt beating the game on normal or hard, where you have limited lives. It took me over 100 lives to beat the game on easy. Am I that bad? Probably; my hardcore gaming days are over. But the game is also just that difficult. You CAN'T get frustrated with the game, or else you will wind up making mistakes that will set you back (or just make you more angry).Those stipulations aside, the game is enjoyable, and the final battle/stage will surely be a great ""surprise"" for any fan of AVGN. In fact, fans of AVGN will love the amount of references to the popular character and his videos. But I will say this - the game is short. The majority of its length of play comes from dying (and there are plenty of one-hit-kill objects in the game) and resuming at the previous checkpoint.If you really like AVGN and can handle the above stipulations, the game is worth the price (though a sale price would help me encourage that). If you've never heard of AVGN and happened to stumble onto this game based on its old-school look, be advised of the above and note that there is LOTS of swearing in the game, and many humorous references will be missed."

I'd say one of the best things in the game is the music. It redefines NES music. Way more chords and bass drums; enough for it to be awesome, but not overused. The amount of humor is incredible for a game that was designed to be very challenging. It gets me stressed, but just enough to influence me to keep going. The references to the bad games James reviewed are everywhere and the bosses are even bigger references. I had a lot of fun playing this and would definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a challenge.The story: 4/5 because it relates to the AVGN show's logic and humor perfectly, however it's so simple.The music: 5/5 because it's just so awesome and I can't get it out of my head.The gameplay: 4/5 because almost everything is fair and the controls aren't awkward at all.The characters: 5/5 because each character has their own personality, they relate to the show perfectly and they all serve a purpose somewhere in the game.Overall rating: 5/5.

,Recommended,237740,15968177,"Posted: 23 May, 2015",all,Expi,"Since I'm a HUGE fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, I decided to purchase this game recently. And after a few days, I'm definitely not disappointed.The game is very reminiscent of many old NES sidescrollers, mainly Mega Man, as it uses the ""choose your level"" kind of gameplay like Mega Man does. And there's also.. running while shooting a zapper like in Mega Man.. yey. It makes it rather fun to play, while being rather nostalgic at the same time, which is also added on by the 8-bit style of this game. I also like the bit of challenge within the game, as some of the levels do make you think what you need to do, and being careful in general, giving a bit of strategy.Another thing I like is how it has references to the actual show, with the powerups like the ""Glitch Gremlin"" and ""Super Mecha Death Christ 2000,"" as well as having some of the characters such as Mike Matei, and even the levels do reference some of the games he's played. Not to mention, some of the things he says within the game and the cutscenes add some decent humor as well.So, overall, It's a fun game that is definitely a good purchase if your a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, or even if you're not a big fan, but you like to play old NES games like Mega Man. Either way, it's still a good purchase."

,Not Recommended,237740,19027775,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,Anema86,"In their zeal to make a game that features all the things the AVGN has complained about, they managed to make a game that is only slightly below average. One would expect that the novelty would make up for it--having useless power-ups, cheap deaths, and all that were intentional design choices, after all, so you know that you're buying into that when you buy the game. In addition to this, though, AVGN Adventures has clear problems that should have been fixed.Serious Problems:Movement. The characters move with all the precision of Meat Boy. This makes playing the level ""Beat Em and Eat Em"", which features a ton of slippery surfaces, even more frustating. The imprecise controls are one thing, but there is something else that combines with them that, honestly, threaten to make AVGN Adventures unplayable. And that ""something"" is:The camera. Rather than centering the AVGN, AVGN Adventures has him just slightly to the left of the center when you're moving to the right, and just slightly to the right of the camera when you're moving left. Changing directions on the fly becomes borderline impossible, because the camera shifts, too, which can and will totally screw up whatever difficult platforming section you were trying to get through. And that's a problem because of:Knockback. The knockback in this game is weird. I'd tentatively say that the knockback consists primarily of you getting hit UP, not backward or forward. In good games, knockback is predictable, and can even be taken advantage of. There's none of that here, and the unusual knockback will be a source of many deaths, simply because it's non-standard and very difficult to get used to. And, naturally, there aren't very many platforming sections that don't feature enemies coming at you, because:The level design in AVGN Adventures is horrendous. It's dull, uninspired, and boring. As ProJared rightly pointed out, there are actually only a few enemy types in the game, and what they look like simply varies based on what stage you're in.And, as ProJared also points out, the developers substituted instant death blocks instead of creative level design. Predictable disappearing/reappearing Deathblocks appear in almost every stage, and they're not really difficult to get past; it just requires you to wait. There's a lot of waiting in this game. Something ♥♥♥♥balls is the most obvious offender: half of the stage is filled with instant death beams that are ridiculously easy to avoid and accomplish little more than making you wait for 3 seconds every 15 steps. This will almost certainly be the first level that you beat without dying at all.And you'll be glad to not die often, because dying is tedious. Even though there's an obscene number of checkpoints, even on Normal mode, death is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because the developers thought it would be funny to have a random AVGN statement about what he'd rather do than continue playing--every. single. time. you. die.And you die a lot. That's kinda the point of the game, supposedly being Nintendo Hard. But it's not. This is AVGN Adventure's main flaw: it PRETENDS to be Nintendo Hard by throwing a lot of cheap deaths at the player, but it's actually a very easy game. This is no I Wanna Be the Guy, which throws up a lot of cheap deaths AND is Nintendo Hard. I can't quantify what the difference is.It's a short game. It can be beaten in just a few hours, which makes that $9.99 price tag WAY too high. For $2.99 or $3.99, I could recommend this. But at $9.99? You're paying more than $1 per hour for an experience that... just isn't that good.People often say that the music in AVGN Adventures is awesome. But that's not true. The only level in the game that has good music is Something ♥♥♥♥balls, and I'll give it that--that level's music is incredibly awesome. But that's only one-ninth of the game; what about the other 8 levels? They're nothing special, and a few are actually annoying. One stage has really awesome music, but 8/9 of the stages have boring, uninteresting music, yet the game is still cited as having awesome music. It doesn't. It has one stage that has awesome music. The rest of the music kinda sucks.Almost all of the bosses are the same, too, including the final boss. There are one or two exceptions, but most of the bosses just move around in a figure 8 while shooting things.So here you have a game that would have quickly faded into obscurity if it didn't have the AVGN's name attached to it. There's a sequel coming out relatively soon, and my sincerest hope is that the developers took a few lessons in creative level design before then, because I don't consider filling a stage with death blocks, using only 5 or 6 enemies, and making players wait constantly to be ""creative"". Even the final boss is just a rehash of several other bosses in the game, with nothing unique or new going on anywhere at all. Take that $9.99 and buy the Mega Man Legacy Collection instead. You'll get way more entertainment out of Mega Man than AVGN Adventures.To that, you're probably saying, ""Well, duh!""And that's my point EXACTLY. They're both $9.99."

The sound effects fit but can be annoying sometimes (but I guess that was even on purpose, like: Annoying sh*tty game reference = annoying sound effect).A handful of different levels, a lots of secrets to find and a couple of Steam achievements additionally keep the player going.As I said: A good game and tribute to this angry internet reviewer but mostly recommended to players who at least know who that is and what he does.

You can beat them in any order you wish: once you cleared all the areas you can access the final stage and its boss. Along the levels you can find power-ups and collectables, cameos from internet celebrities and sometime other playable characters with different stats from the Nerd.It's worth mentioning that the game is very difficult. The obstacles are either annoying or plain hard to overcome and a precise timing is often required. On Easy difficulty you have infinite lives and tries and an higher stack of health (as to say, beers). However, starting from Normal difficulty onwards you recive a certain number of lives and tries, culminating in some unlockable difficulties that require you to finish the entire game with three or four lifes or just plain without dying even once.Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a challenging game in its own right and will surely please the long time fans of the show due to its numerous references"

The game puts you in the role of the easily angered, foul mouthed, ill tempered Nerd as he travels through 8 levels of ""Game Land"" inspired by ""Video Game Land"" from the late 80s cartoon ""Captain N: The Game Master"" while the gameplay is inspired by classic retro games like Castlevania, Contra, Mega Man, Ninja Gaiden and others.Each level has various nods to games from the past as well as games that The Nerd has reviewed on his web series. For example, the level ""Beat it And Eat It"" is inspired by the Atari Porn games for the Atari 2600, and the level ""Boo! Haunted House"" inspired by the ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Friday The 13th"" NES games!The most satisfying thing about this game is the challenge! Yes, areas of certain levels can be difficult and will even get you to curse like The Nerd himself, but that is what makes this game fun! The process of trial and error while playing through the game and being rewarded for beating the level instead of having you're hand held with a useless guide that shows you how to beat the level or give you recharging health or anything else that current games do nowadays. The game is still very fun as well as rewarding to play and gives you just that right amount of challenge that makes you want to keep on playing til the end!If you are a fan of classic ""NES hard"" games like Castlevania, Contra, Mega Man, or Ninja Gaiden or are a fan of the AVGN character and his web series, then you should definitely get this game!"

The game is clearly designed to have most people die a lot, which is completely fine in my opinion, it makes victory that much sweeter. Here's the problem, when it is designed such a way that you might die every 3 seconds for 5 lives the load screen should be very quick, and in my opinion it shouldnt even have one. You should just appear back at the checkpoint. In this game the ""load"" screen after each death is like 5- 8 seconds long, yes it seems to change, on what i dont know, which you can't skip and considering the graphics, has no reason to force you to sit there for so long when youre just trying to get past a part over and over. It slows down the gameplay so much in what would be an otherwise fun experience, dying over and over, getting better every time. I just don't understand the decision to do this. Yes, in an alpha where they didn't have to testing done to see how much it slowed down the game it would be fine but not in the full release. And you can say im just being unpatient if you want but there is a thing that exists called pacing. when you create a fast paced game and then arbitrarily slow it down with a ""quote"" screen that gets old really, really quick, it just didnt get tested with enough people, or the creator saw it as something so great he wouldnt remove it. sorryfor the rant but i feel like this game could be a lot of fun without this needless screen. why not just make it scippable after one second if you are someone that doesnt wat to read the same quote about a skunk farting in your face for the 25th time?"

I had that feeling when I beat my first level in AVGN Adventures, Hell i believe. I died numerous times figuring out the patterns and planning my attack but when I finally beat it I sat back and let out a sign of victory and that feeling of beating something that kicked the crap out of you through let's just say 18 lives or so is a feeling I thoroughly enjoyed.

,Recommended,237740,19740472,"Posted: 16 December, 2015",all,MeleeKirby,"AVGN Adventures, as you probably figured looking at the screenshots, is a sidescrolling retro style platformer. What makes this one different from all the other retro style platformers is that it is based entirely around the concept and exploits of the Angry Video Game Nerd.AVGN decides to play a pretty bad game, as he usually does. However, this game decides to pull him through the TV, sucking him into the world of terrible videogames and bad videogame tropes. The plot is very simple, and only really serves the purpose of giving you the setup to actually play through the adventure.If you're not really a fan of the AVGN series of videos, then this isn't for you; the whole game is designed to be a playable homage to the Nerd and everything that the fans love about him and what he does. The whole game is jam-packed full of references that most people familiar with the series will get and appreciate, as well as a number of deliberately bad game design choices that make their way in as a result of his frequent complaining of said issues in many of his reviews. It all adds up to a game with themes that are very faithful to the titular hero.The levels are deliberately very tricky, and oftentimes you'll find you die a lot in each one. Most of the levels often have instances of trial and error. You will most likely die not knowing how to navigate certain obstacles the very first time, or not react quickly enough not knowing what's about to come. To offset this style of difficulty, the player is given a total of 30 lives to work with. This is usually enough to make it from beginning to end of a level. But it's in this feature that lies my main criticism with the game.The system of 30 lives to make it through any given level is fine, however my main issue with this is that upon completing a level, your remaining number of lives will carry over to the level you play next. This means that unavoidably you will always start subsequent levels with significantly fewer lives to work with, and you might find that you won't even have anywhere close enough to beat a level the first time. Get a Game Over, and you lose your checkpoint progress.There is no way to reset your lives count except by getting a Game Over, either. I've tried to save, quit and come back into the existing save to see if that would work. Sadly the save does save your current lives count, meaning it was intentionally designed that way. So if you begin with a meager 5 lives, you will either want to just kill them off at the start or use them for practice in the early part of the level, because you're probably not going to get too far with them.That issue aside, AVGN Adventures is a really fun game for fans with great graphics and awesome 8-bit music. Highly recommened if you love AVGN!"

I don't always find it funny, and I generally enjoy Jame's videos more for the information and content than his ""angry"" rants.  However, this game has it's funny moments - and the cameos always made me laugh.  But most importantly is that THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE.   If you play on the easiest setting, and are an experienced platform gamer, you should be able to play through it withing a couple hours of game time (if that).  But then this feels like a classic ""go back, play it again, do it better, find everything, beat it on higher difficulty"" style of game play.The controls are incredible - and I use a Logitech F310, so nothing perfect, but the game feels amazing.  The contoller support is wonderful, as well.It plays in a similar manner to a Mega Man game with it's intense platforming... but it runs much faster and much more smoothly.

,Recommended,237740,12668757,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,BadassFreeman,"I'm working on a video-review of this game, and I have already beated almost the entire game (all I got left is the secret last level), but I think I've played long enough to make a Steam review of the game, and talk about it. As usual, I'm gonna take the bad things the game has out of the way first:First and foremost, this game can be hard. It depends on your skills on these kind of games. Have you played the old Castlevania games? The 2D Metroids? Megaman? Or even f#cking Super Mario World? If you have not, then you're going to die more than any nooblord in the PC version of Dark Souls, trying to play without the patches, AND USING THE KEYBOARD INSTEAD OF A CONTROLLER. I'M NOT KIDDING. Of course, the game has many difficulty modes, depending of how much of a casual you are, but I got to the last level of the game in almost 4 hours, trying to find everything, and in normal difficulty. Of course I died a lot of times, but you're going to die, it's how this game goes.The second thing that it might make you regret buying it, is the lenght of the game. It is entertaining and fun to play it, but it's not that long. Dude, It took 4 hours to get to the final level, and I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good at these things, it might take you 6 or so to beat the entire game. You can of course replay the game in other difficulties and all that stuff...But there's not that much reason to replay it, unless you enjoy torturing yourself like the Nerd. And that's the last bad thing the game might have:If you're not a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, or you don't watch his videos, then you're not going to understand shi#t. Pretty much 90% of the game are references to his videos and old-school videogame reviews. ALL THE BOSSES ON THE GAME, ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HIS VIDEOS (except the Giant-claw, I believe). Before picking up the game, you should check out his Angry Video Game Nerd videos, get some pop-corn, some Rolling Rock beers, have a good time watching him destroy those putrid mother of an #ss games. That said...This game is BALLS TO THE WALL! It's been long since I found a game with ACTUAL CHALLENGE! I find games like Dark Souls a walk on the park, but this game actually♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off at random times, because it's as ruthless as games used to be, back on those times. What, you're a casual and a p#ssy? Play it on Easy, you have infinite lifes, double the HP, but in normal, you can take 3 hits before you blow up to pieces, and can only die 30 times before getting a Game over screen. The game over screen doesn't actually make you play from the start of the game, just sends you back to the level select screen, so it's fair, you can beat any level on your first try in 30 levels, if you're competent and don't f#ck up too much. In harder difficulties there's a limit of how much Game Over screens you can take before it actually ENDS the game for you, so yeah, pick your poison motherf#cker.The graphics, along with the music, are the best thing of the game, everything feels like a mix between NES and SNES graphics, and the soundtrack is just AMAZINGLY AMAZING! I won't lie, the theme for ""Future F#ckballs 2010"" is probably the best one so far, SPECIALLY WHEN YOU MIX HEAVY METAL ON IT:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MXefuJ9UQThe Boss themes are also quite good, an 8 bit remix of the classic AVGN theme.The game is also quite truthful to the Nerd style: Everything screams b#llshit and swears, he breaks the 4th wall a lot of times, and the Death Screens manage to make me laugh without any reason. They're just random generated text that makes no sense, but stuff quite fun to watch♥♥♥♥♥♥like this:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=322735188The game is worth like 10€ or so, you might want to wait for a sale...But for less than 6€?

The major problem with AVGN is quite simply ""we forgot people would be paying money for this."" the satire about a person being trapped in a bad game you play is largely lost when you have to shell out money to play a bad game.That's really the feeling I got the whole way through the game, the tropes and nods to the AVGN series are funny and entertaining but the bad game gets in the way quite hard. I really think they tried so hard to capture the ""crap nes era experiences"" that they forgot not only would people have to play this game but people would be paying money. its almost like it'd been less offensive to me had I paid for a movie instead, to watch someone else suffer through the game for my amusement than play the game myself.What makes this game terrible? death blocks that kill you instantly just to touch them which are EVERYWHERE to the point it felt like ""we couldn't come up with something here so we'll fill content with these cheap deaths"". ""I wanna be the guy"" style tricks and barebones mechanics are all over this game, however IWBTG was free and this you pay money for, so it makes things a lot more sour.If you are an AVGN fan you already own this game so I wont be convincing you, but to anyone else looking at this game as a person looking for a platformer to play I def say wait for a sale, because the only appeal of this game comes from the tropes and humor nods to the series, the gameplay is powerglove bad. when I beat the game I did not feel like a winner, I felt like I used drugs."

It feels like they were intentionally made stiff to subtract from the ability to steer the nerd. The truth I however fear is that the guys who made this  game are inexperienced game devs or simply have no skill in their trade whatsoever OR were so busy thinking of foul words that they didn't have time to test if the game was actually playable.The good humor from the series is more or less absent in place of just swearing endlessly.In regard to the indie AVGN fan games I've played (watch episode 115 if unsure of which I'm referring) this doens't present much original content.The level design is really bad as well. I haven't played for that long because I more or less ragequit due to all these issues I'm adressing here. But I did play all stages.

,Recommended,237740,28171674,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,Will The Kill,"This is a fun 2D side scroller, but I'd likely suggest picking it up only if you're a fan of the AVGN series or a fan of really hard 2D side scrollers.  There are a total of nine levels and you can play through the first eight in any order you like; completing those will unlock the final ninth level.  With multiple checkpoints throughout each level, there's a decent amount of challenge to be had in getting through the game.One thing to note here is that if you play the game on any difficulty above easy, you're going to be subject to a life system.  So if you're playing through a level and run out of lives, you have to start back at the very beginning of that level, regardless of the latest checkpoint you got.  This almost made me give up on the game, as the very last stage got to be a bit too challenging for me on normal difficulty with a finite amount of lives to work with.  If you want to change the difficulty, you pretty much have to start over and complete each level again.I ended up beating the first eight levels on normal difficulty, which I thought was a fair challenge, but like I said, the final level was hard enough to make me drop down to easy.  Unfortunately, that meant replaying through the previous eight levels again, although they were much easier to maneuver through on a second run.  The final level was still a challenge, but well worth getting to the end.At the end of the day, if you're familiar with AVGN and the various characters that have appeared in the game, there's plenty of references and funny material to get you through to the end, as well as some really great music and the option to purchase the soundtrack separately.  I do think some of the frustrations in a few areas of the game take the joke of this being a hard game a bit too far, but then again, that's kind of the point - this is supposed to be a very challenging side scroller reminiscent of past generations of video games."

It's extremely difficult and yes, they are merciless with the Deathblocks, but this game is not unfair.  The controls are perfect, there are no infinitely-respawning enemies just offscreen, damage that can't be avoided, none of the truly rotten things that ruined our weekend game rental.  You'll die a lot at first as you incrementally learn the stages and enemy patterns, and just like when you rented that NES game on Friday and couldn't get past the first stage, by Sunday you're burning through most of it with only the occasional death and desperately trying to figure out the last boss before you have to return the game.Also the soundtrack is seriously awesome."

He administers the death of all life, and offered much of the energy of his own soul to death itself. He, along with the other Lords (Gwyn, The Witch of Izalith and Seath the Scaleless) waged war against the Dragons, unleashing a miasma of death and disease upon them. When the Age of Fire began, he ventured deep underground.He acts as a god of death and disease, and is the master of the Gravelord Servant covenant. The player can join this covenant by interacting with Nito, but killing him (which is mandatory) will not break the covenant.LocationTomb of the GiantsAfter the Pinwheel Servant area.Playthrough	HP	SoulsFirst	4,317	60,000NG+	7,076	120,000NG+6	8,845	150,000DropsLord Soul (Gravelord Nito)NotesHe is the only covenant master that must die in order to finish the playthrough. Killing him doesn't break the Gravelord Servant covenant, but you can't upgrade its level until the next playthrough.Gravelord Nito cannot be harmed when you access him by using the catacombs' coffin next to the titanite demon. However, you can find the Paladin Set and your bloodstain (if you died while fighting him) and can still join the Gravelord Servant covenant provided he was not killed.The Gravelord Sword, Sword Dance, and Greatsword Dance are unavailable once Nito is dead, so if you wish to obtain these you'll need to do so before killing him.WeaknessesFire-based damageAttack PatternsSlam - Raises his weapon above his head, then slams down in front of him.Horizontal Swing - Swings his sword horizontally, does not connect at extreme close range.Miasma - Curls up and begins to glow, then after a brief time releases a shockwave that deals high damage and will at the very least stagger you.Grab - Raises his hand and attempts to grab you dealing high damage, alternating shoulder buttons will reduce duration and damage.Gravelord Sword - Screams and raises his sword, then thrusts it into the ground to summon a single Gravelord Sword from beneath you causing knockup and heavy Toxic status.StrategiesUpon entering the area you will be attacked by three Skeletons, a Divine weapon is recommended for killing them so they do not interfere with your fight. Additionally there are three Giant Skeletons at the other end of the arena that will not engage unless you approach them, these can be ignored as long as you don't venture too far. Any remaining at the end of the fight will permanently die as you kill Nito.The recommended approach is to kill the three skeletons and wait for Nito to come to you, then fight him in the small area you landed in. You should still be able to run far enough to escape his miasma without pulling the three Giant Skeletons.An alternative, if you don't have better rings to use, is to equip the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring AND the Ring of Fog which will prevent any skeletons from attacking you as long as you don't get too close. This does reduce your effective arena in which to duel Nito however.For NG plus, if you have havels shield and a heavy weapon, you can stand in front of him, let him attack and be able to withstand his hits. This will make him kill his own servants and allow you to hit him a few times before he attacks again and before his servants come back alive. Rinse and repeat. This is recommended for tank characters though. Be sure to have quite a few high healing items(20 estus fully upgraded, divine blessing, humanity, Elizabeth's mushroom, etc.)Dodging and BlockingWith high poise (such as using Havel's Set or Iron Flesh) most of his attacks will have no effect with the exception of his grab and miasma attacks, which should be avoided. His Gravelord Sword attack will still knock you up but he will not use it once you are up against him. You can watch a video here.For medium builds, a shield with high magic resist is recommended to block his miasma. Poise will assist with blocking his sword attacks, and his grab needs to be avoided. Staying right up against him should prevent you from being staggered if you are hit.Light builds should have little trouble rolling all his attacks except the Gravelord Sword and miasma.The Gravelord Sword should be avoidable by sprinting (heavier builds may need to roll at just the right time).If timed correctly, Nito's shockwave can be cancelled while drinking an Estus Flask. Try this as a last resort if he has you pinned against a wall, otherwise it can easily be run from. The visual extends further than the actual area of effect so don't be worried if you're caught at the edge.MeleeBeing in melee range will cause Nito to primarily use his sword attacks, with an occasional grab and miasma. Avoid getting tied into long attack animations to give you time to react and try to stay behind him. Note that being right up against him will cause most of his attacks to miss or do very little damage.To gain cumulative damage, Quelaag's Furysword deals good fire damage with fast attacks.RangedNito moves very slowly so when using ranged attacks you only need to worry about his miasma, Gravelord Sword, and running into the Giant Skeletons.Pyromancy is also an option to consider, preferably Great Combustion, as being in medium range will put you at high risk of his sword attacks.The Great Lightning Spear miracle is very effective and on NG should require about ten uses to kill him. Having a few casts of Lightning Spear in reserve is recommended should any further damage be required. Sorceries are all very effective but visiting The Duke's Archives first is recommended.BugsIt is possible to have Nito throw you into the rock formations in the center of the room, right in front of where you drop down. While hard to do, it will cause you to stay in a falling animation and performing the plunge attack. Every time he moves near you, he will take damage and can be staggered. You can still die here but his attacks seem to do less damage. You will have to save and quit after killing him to get out of the position."

The game will last you about 4-6 hours, depending on how good you are at platformers, This game is very similar to Megaman 3 when it comes to control, flow, and level design, but even more difficult. If you don't like to die a lot, then a game that is easy to get an achievement for dying 1000 times isn't for you.The game lets you shoot in all directions, except down for some reason. This is a nit-pick worthy note to me, as he does claim to put elements of all his favourite side-scrollers together, which one of them is Super Castlevania 4.All the great AVGN moments are referenced, with the Couch / Guitar guy, Bull♥♥♥♥♥♥Man and even Mike Matei, James' best friend and co-worker, being playable. You will see halarious moments, such as the ""Pitfall first ladder"" rant being heavily enforced. You go down the first ladder in one of the levels, and instantly fall to your death into a chamber of lava, spikes, and flame-sharks (which, by the way, you get to ride later!).The humour is exactly what you would expect from a game written and designed by James Rolfe. Sarcasm levels reach 9001, as the nerd himself will comment on the &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥factor"" of the game. When I was playing the ""Beat it and Eat it"" level, which pays omage his Atari Porn Games episode available only at his website, I hit a slippery spot on theground and fell to my death saying ""God damnit, stupid ice... wait. That's not ice.""Level design is very good, but enemies lack real depth. While the poop jokes were kind of novel in 2007, the just aren't best served wth a dish of platformer.Other minor issues I have found are that sometimes you don't get a chance to read the text. It took me quite a while to find out how to switch characters, as the only time it tells you without going to the option screen to my knowledge is when you meet your first alternate character. Another small problem I ran into was the music bugged out on Blizzard of Balls, looping indefinately until I closed the game entirely. This never reaccured, so it may have been fixed in one of the regular updates Mike and James roll out every few weeks.Over-all, if you are an AVGN fan like me or retro-loving gamers, it's a must-buy at a respectable 8.5/10. For non-fans and platform haters, it's a non-impressing 6/10."

The Angry Video Game Nerd has become an Internet legend and a game based off of him was a must have for the Nerd and fans alike. With a sequel coming soon, I would recommend playing this game before buying the sequel when it comes out.Pros:Awesome music reminescent of 8 and 16 bit genre videogamesPlatforming action similar to many classics like Super Mario Bros, Megaman, Castlevania, etc.Difficulty that's easy to get used to, but still challenging.Four unique characters from the AVGN series. The Nerd himself (James Rolfe), Guitar Guy (Kyle Justin), MotherF*cker Clarence Mike (Mike Matei), and the Bull-Sh*t Man.Familiar faces from the AVGN episodes, such as Super Mecha Death Christ, Sh*t Pickle and the Glitch Gremlin, as well as a good number of cameos that you can find.Cons:The game's difficulty can become frustrating at times. The death blocks, as well as obstacles that can kill you in one shot, are more frequent in certain levels than others, requiring skillful platforming action to pass through. That's pretty much the only con I have for this game.Overall, it's an awesome game worth your money and time. If you're a fan of the Nerd, a fan of challenging videogames, or a fan of the classics, then this game is for you."

The game is ok at its best but contains some of the most horrible designed levels with insanely unfair difficulty at its worst.This is a piece taken directly from Screwattack homepage: Some say ""hard,"" but we're saying ""rewarding!"" Why? Because every check point you get, every boss you beat, every accomplishment is something you've earned. You feel like a stud. This is a game that allows you to brag to your friends if you beat it.I strongly disagree with that statement! You won't  brag to you friends instead you'll ask yourself why you put yourself through this half-baked mess? The single biggest problem with the game spells: DEATH BLOCK! An extremely cheap way to make the game hard without any finess or thought! If you play this game you will come to hate those, I promise.  If you're still considering buying this do so when it's on sale! Of wait for the sequel, that game could actually be good.MISC: This game seems to only support the Xbox 360 controller.

It's fun for a bit, but ultimately I was not a fan of how the game artificially increases the difficulty with death blocks. They do not test your natural gaming skills, instead they exist only to turn the entire game into maddening trial and error. I like to think I did well, making it to the final stage in under 4 hours, but it was never very enjoyable because of repeated sections of levels filled to the brim with anxiety inducing death block patterns. It isn't nearly as hard as some NES games like Battletoads, but it is equally stress inducing and only makes me remember why I hated games like that on the NES.6/10 Average. Will most likely only appeal to AVGN fans. It unfortunately takes its cues from all of the most frustratingly designed NES games, missing a grande opportunity to be its own unique game."

There are plenty of platformers that are more fun to play than this, though I really wish the level design was better, because that with its perfect controls would just be amazing. It's basically a game that had a lot of potential and failed because they chose to make it hard, not knowing the difference between making something fair and unfair.

Anyway, you should know who the Angry Video Game Nerd is. He single handedly started everything to do with gaming videos online. He's a foulmouth nerd who has dedicated his life to warning the world of bad games, whilst being absolutley hilarious at the same time. If you have never watched him, what are you waiting for> Go watch an episode right now 'cause you're really missing out.Anyway, the game starts the Nerd being sucked into one of these terrible games and must get ou. Simple, right?Ladies and Gentlemen, I now present to you my least favrioute thing about this game...THE DIFFICULTY IS OFF THE CHARTS!!!I never usually loose my temper with games. However this one really started bugging me within 5 mins of boot up. Not trying to spoil anything, but I was in sweat and tears during the final boss fight. I tried for an hour and couldn't do it. I managed to develop a stratergy for part of the fight, but died something like 400 times. I gave up all red and in tears. The next night I went back and my strategy still worked, but I was still struggling. So I used a walkthrough, combined it with my stratergy and I finnaly did it!Anyway, the point is this is easily the hardest game I've ever played. Even on easy. I'm impressed just beating it once on easy only having to use a walkthrough once!But, the real problem here...If you watched AVGN for as long as I have, you probably will have memorised some of the things he complains about in games. And, without listing them, I can tell you this game has ALOT of these problems. Its like it took inspiration from bad games!WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!(Sigh...)I usually decide whether I'll reccomend or not reccomend a game beofre reviewing, but this time I'm really struggling. This game almost ruined AVGN for me. I went through sweat and tears just to beat this game on the easiest difficulty! However, it has gogeous retre graphics, occasinally fun gameplay and, of course, the Nerd. Due to it taking too much inspiration from bad examples of games and not being entertaining 100% of the time, it is with great sorrow and regret that AVGN Adventures is the first game I dont reccomend on Steam. Still buy it, play it but not till the end. It is the most brutal and unforgiving game I've ever played.Did I mention the feeling when you finnaly beat it...?"

I support him 100% enough to buy his DVDs and his movie. I think he's a great reason why gaming on the internet is such a popular thing, especially the whole ""I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off so I'm going to make up words to coicide with what I think about this game"" fad. But this game... Not even remotely worth your time.First off, let me express my UNDYING HATE FOR SETTING UP THE CONTROLLER. I had a struggle just like everyone else, and it's almost a year past it's last patch. Every controller I plug into this PC is recognized by EVERY game I own. This game? Nope. I had to fidget with the advanced settings just to let the game recognize my controller. And as much as I wanted to use my Xbox One controller, I was limited to my 360 controller.Hell, even my PS4 controller worked, What a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥Secondly, this game does a great job at making you FEEL like the ♥♥♥♥in' nerd. I couldn't help but go through the game and say nearly the same kind of lines AVGN uses in his own reviews as I went through each stage just to cope with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the levels are. But that's the only good thing it has going for it. Just because you FEEL like the ♥♥♥♥in' nerd doesn't justify a 9.99 dollar pricepoint and it's extrutiatingly difficult levels (especially the final level).There's a difference between intelligent and clever level design that pushes the boundaries of difficulty (Kaizo Mario is a great example of this)  by utilizing every single mechanic to to be frustratingly hard, but you envy it because the way the level is set up is extremely smart and well-thought. This game? This game is just a ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ You like invisible blocks? How about death blocks that force you to die upon touching them. Hell, this game has INVISIBLE death blocks! Granted, it's tied to two specific levels, but the game is already hard enough. That's just a small sample of how the game forces you to cope with the♥♥♥♥♥♥it gives you. It isn't clever. Just a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥You'll blaze through 30 lives like it's no one's business, but 30 lives is about enough to get through a single stage... Excluding the LJN stage. This is the only forgiving mechanic in the game, seeing as your only punishment is restarting the stage and not the entire game. Each live gives you three hits before you're done, but the game isn't very sparing of these magical ales. It's pretty ruthless. I've gotten to the final boss of the game and blaed through 75 lives. That's three seperate playthroughs of the level, by the way.Final thoughts. The game does a great job emulating how The Nerd feels when reviewing games. That's it's biggest pro, and possibly the only pro. This game isn't clever or smart or forgiving or whatever. It isn't like Super Meat Boy where everything you do is your fault so you can't feel too upset about it. Nope. This game didn't justify it's original 14.99 dollar price point or it's 9.99 dollar price point. I'm more than glad I only paid 3.99 for this hunk of♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Now he's got a game of his own. Not a homebrew. Not a mod. Not a token character in a mobile device game but a real game!The good: The sound is top-notch.  The graphics are what you'd expect from a great 8-bit/16-bit platformer. There's no difficulty in differentiating  anything from anything else. The levels are challenging so you don't feel bored or any tedium setting in.The bad: This game is HARD. Even on EASY. Some of the stuff like spikes you'd think would one-hit kill you only damage you and enemies like Deathbloks (some of which blink in and out of existence) will outright kill you. enemies are cheap, specifically the ""moving hazard"" enemies (suns, fireballs, stars, etc.) don't outright kill you but they can either knock you into a pit or knock you into something more deadly (like a Deathblok). The death screens are randomly generated, which sometimes means while the English is correct, the words don't fit. I have gotten some laughs from the game.Overall this game isn't for babies. This game isn't even for kids. This game is for adult gamers that like a challenge.  I hear people whining about the Deathbloks and to be honest they fail to realize that there's a whole game beyond the Deathbloks they're missing out on. If you're going to discount an entire game based on who someone said about one thing, then you're missing out on some important experiences in life. And that's kind of how guys like the AVGN go into playing terrible games. Or games in general.This game is great. I had fun playing it, even though I was frustrated at times.

,Recommended,237740,9276849,"Posted: 26 February, 2014",all,Zastavan,"$15 maybe a bit much, maybe $10 or less is a better price for what it is.The game should really appeal to anyone who likes the AVGN videos and maybe only them. People who don't like the comedy style of AVGN or don't know him will probably just get annoyed with the game and the story as a whole. There is swearing everywhere but its just text, there is no voice in this game and the story is told via text boxes with drawn art cards depicting scenes at the start of the game and the end. Honestly, story is negligible and really isn't to the concern of the player in these sorts of games. Its all about gameplay.You play as the nerd or one of four characters you can find. You can hot swap between these characters and some may make situations easier but in all honesty all you need to beat the game is the Nerd and Guitar Guy. The nerd being perfectly fine with all situations aside from those the Guitar Guy is required. Each character has their own special stats/move so you can have some choice about how you accomplish a goal. But for the most part their is really only one way to get by most obstructions. Jump a second to soon or late and you die or get hit. This is to be expected with this type of game but it does get annoying as you progress and insta death blocks become more and more common.Oh yeah, insta death blocks. Some of the biggest bs to ever grace this game and they are everywhere. I mean EVERYWHERE. They are just plain overused, like the dev couldn't figure out how to give a fair new challenge to the player so they just tossed insta death blocks in everywhere they could which is especially painfull as you get more and more stuff on screen and you have to pay attention to all of it to keep from getting hit. Once you figure out when to jump, run, or whatever it stops being such a challenge unless a glitch or so messes you up.What I found is the game has really strange hit detection. Sometimes things that clip into your character don't hit you (enemy attacks or insta death stuff) but sometimes you can be not even near it seemingly and it kills you. Exactly how close you can be to something before it kills you is something I still havn't figured out. It just seems like luck that you live or die, especially in the last insta death dissappearing and reappearing block puzzle. You just have to keep trying over and over until it lets you through. Of course skill does come into play but I can't tell you how many times I thought I was in the clear only to have the blocks appear and instakill me although I know I was clear of them. Its complete bull. This same problem can happen with platforms but it seems to be limited to falling platforms I think. You can jump and get stuck on the corner and then the platform falls.Bouncing is a game of luck aswell. You can try and get good at it but even when you think you have it down your character desides to take a suicide dive straight into insta death. Its like playing with fire while soaked in gas, you have to have the patience of a saint and a surgeon in one to do it right.Controls are solid aside from the bouncing mechanic which is like the wheel of misfortune. Your character controls very smoothly and solidly aside from times when you need to do jumps perfectly on a single block with an instadeath right beside your intended jump spot. At times like that its easy to overjump and die or under and fall to your demise but this maybe also something to do with the weird hit detection. I really wish I would have recorded it in slow motion to see exactly what was up.Bosses are a pleasant challenge and once you figure out there pattern they are pretty easy, but thats after you die a good number of times though. Fred Fuchs, the final boss, is an absolute pain in the rear as he is right after the most horrible level in the game. Once you get past beginners traps and turtle your way to the end you will have no lives, but even with knowing the level well you might only get to him with 20 lives and let me tell you that you'll probably need them. What I did was crouch on the lowest right platform and when I could I would jump up and shoot him as he flew up until  he brought out his balls. When hes got his balls out (hehe) crouch on the left side of the platform when hes flying to the left side of the screen, and when he flies to the right side of the screen get on the left sideof the middle platform and crouch. When he starts crapping on you you have to pause the game to see if he is going to♥♥♥♥♥♥above you, then you have time to react and dodge him. I would advise shooting at him while hes above you then pausing fast as you can when under him. It seems like cheating, but honestly since the crap is random its fair in my opinion. When he brings out his wrecking balls or chain balls (whatever the heck you call them) get on the two platforms farthest to the left.There you go, Freds dead baby!Powerups are fairly rare and and theres only 4 types, beer for health, the SNES gun, mecha jesus, and the glitch gremlin. The gun sucks because in one hit you lose it, and the gremlin is mostly useless as it only stops enemies and fire balls and similiar dangers like that from moving. It dousn't make them stop damaging you so its pretty useless aside from points where you get lucky and you line everything up so you can run through an area without getting hit at all. Mecha jesus kills everything on screen and is only really used around where he can be picked up.The game is pretty goofy, just like AVGNs style but people who arn't familiar with this may become offput by that comedic style. But its all taken from the show and I even chuckled out loud when I saw some of the enemies, text, and levels in general. They nailed AVGN, maybe a bit to well.The graphics are farily nice and colorfull. Not as good looking as Bastion, but still good looking. The music is also good stuff. I can't remember if its the same song throughout the game as I was to focused on playing the game. Which I think goes to show the music is good if it didn't annoy me and helped me keep my head in the game.Another bad point is the acheivements, I don't think its possible to get them all. YOLO seems impossible and impossible seems masochistic. I died over a 1,000 times but I had to play through the game twice. Oh yeah, twice! Not even on purpose. I wanted to see other difficulties and without thinking and half on accident I pressed new game but I didn't select a difficulty. The stupid game deleted my save. THIS WAS IN A NERD VIDEO! This was one of the most basic things and they screwed it up. You have one save file and nothing else but you can go in and edit he save file I think in order to skip parts in the game. I didn't do this because I didn't feel like cheating and possibly disabling acheivments since I just don't know what it would do to them.In summary and TL:DRAVGNA is a rather good game with alot of throwbacks to the old games featured in AVGN. Unfortunately it is somewhat flawed in some very annoying ways and takes to many of the things that just♥♥♥♥♥♥gamers and AVGN off and puts them in this game. Its much better though than most 2d Platformer games around these days as instead of trying to be someing silly like art it just tries to be a fun video game and succeeds for the most part. But technical hitches here and there do creep up at times and can be very annoying when they do but its hardly a constant problem.It can be very challenging, but also very rewarding when you do finally beat a level and eventually the game. The only really big issues are hit detection (because when it does creep up and become a problem you can waste several lives with it) and some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t jumps or puzzles that are just stupidly difficult. The game is pretty goofy, just like AVGNs style but people who arn't familiar with this may become offput by that comedic style. For better or worse they took everything from the show."

,Recommended,237740,11917497,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,Olde,"Wow, I'm very surprised to see some hate for this game. Let me try to be as objective as possible here. AVGNA is a game that, let's face it, is designed around the problems that James Rolfe has pointed out in his over 100 videos for his popular web series, the Angry Video Game Nerd. AVGNA is mainly a tribute to his legacy of video reviews, but which manages to capture the spirit of that show while also providing humorous dialogue and some pretty fun levels. The control is very good (best played with a controller), the graphics are appealing, the health pickups and one-ups are relatively plentiful, and there are numerous checkpoints scattered generously across the levels. The music is very catchy and gives the game a strong sense of energy. I also enjoyed how you can play as different characters who have different weapons and abilities, if you could find them.Now let's get to the major complaints. Yes, this game is full of cheap kills. That's part of the point. This game is full of meta jokes because you're playing as the Nerd who has to fight the summation of obstacles that have plagued so many of the terrible games from his youth. As I was playing, I was really thinking ""Wow, this stuff really must've been horrendous"" in reference to the games he had to beat for his show. But the beautiful thing about this game is that I feel it never exceeds the threshold. The ""cheap"" sections really aren't that long, and the difficult areas are always preceded by easier sections that are meant to teach you the tricks or gimmicks of each level.For people who are debating whether or not to buy this game, I would say that if you're a fan of AVGN and you like platformers or played them as a kid, give this one a go. In terms of 2-D platformers that have come out recently, this is definitely one of the best. The level design actually had quite a bit of thought put in, and even though it can be frustrating, if you're smart enough to figure out basic patterns and patient enough to repeat certain sections, you won't regret getting this game. I've been a big fan of James for years and I think that this game stays true to the basic feel of the videos and the attitude he exudes as the Nerd. Plus I loved the humor and self-referential jokes.To respond to negative reviews, here's what I have to say: There's no way I can understand complaints about this game being too difficult. Compared to some of the games people of James's generation played growing up, like Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Silver Surfer, and Battletoads, AVGNA is a walk in the park. AVGNA was made as both a parody of bad games and as a send-up of the games that defined ""Nintendo-hard."" Kids these days are coddled. This game isn't really that tough when you get down to it, nor is it unfair. As for complaints that the game is padded, you could say that for any platformer. The only platformer I've ever seen with a decent storyline was Braid, and this game is definitely not that. Is AVGNA worth $10? I suppose it's subjective, but I had more fun with this game than I did with several other more expensive games that may have technically better graphics and more of a story but fail at having an interesting character or unique feel. This game doesn't feel recycled, it feels new and different, in spite of its origins from past games. In other words, it synthesizes elements from both the AVGN show and from the games themselves, but I felt that when notoriously bad elements were included, it was always for the sake of humor, and they were treated in a relatively fair manner, even though some people find the game to be grinding."

So why make the stages so incredibly difficult just to have a boss that takes no strategy what so ever to beat? I am on the last stage of the game (after less than 2 hrs of gameplay) and I have died almost 200 times. All this game has to offer is dying over and over again and repeating the same sections over and over until you have played the same thing for so long that you realize ""I've been playing the game for 30 minutes and have been repeating the same 10 seconds of gameplay the whole time"".

The early levels are actually reasonably fair with few surprises that can't be overcome with a bit of skill. The later levels however are designed to kill you over and over and only thorough memorisation will get you through.The retro visuals and soundtrack are impressive and probably the best part of the game. The ""Nerd"" humour is frankly vulgar, childish and often disgusting. A better showcase of the steep decent the series has taken since it has begun, and not what made it so sucessful in the first place.This is a hard one to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the AVGN. If you're looking for a deliberately punishing platformer than you'll want to check out Super Meat Boy. If you've done that and want something more, this probably won't be much more of a challenge. However even long time fans might find this game to be too much; especially if like me, you enjoyed the earlier, tightly edited and genuinely funny series and not long, vulgar nonsense it has become."

Every death you have to sit through a long, unskippable rant about how awful the Nerd finds this world before you can retry.

Creating a game about the Angry Video Game Nerd seems like the next step in breaking the AVGN brand into a new medium seems like a natural progression. The end result, however, just ends up being a dull and charmless. The worst of it, just being downright dull.The best way to take a look at the game would just be to start up at the top with the man whom the title is named after. The majority of the comedy of the AVGN is in his delivery, his facial expressions, and over the content of the game. That gets lost when the extent you see of his anger is a simple ""This game is a bunch of diahrea♥♥♥♥♥♥coming out of a rabbits♥♥♥♥♥♥"" readout in a slow text. It is true that a majority of the nerd's history is present in the game but it suffers the problem of being a reference alone without really adding much of anything unique to the game. (i.e. The Robot Jesus Christ being a general screen clearing attack.)This extends to the game itself, while it's true you'll find a challenge here that isn't part of the problem. Challenge in itself can be dealt with if the core of the game itself is interesting and fun to play and that simply doesn't apply here. Across a generic song backdrop the game it plays almost exactly like run and gun flash game you play on the internet with generic challenges, all the while reading Angry Video Game quips slowly sprawled across the screen. The problem I had with the game itself was the challenges to the game being repeated (""Skull deathtraps"") with each stage being a homage without doing anything really different to the formula that changes the game up in any reasonable manner.It strikes of an idea that sounds interesting in paper but not in practice. Angry Video Game Nerd playing all of his past games he's slammed? Sounds like a reasonable and interesting idea. Playing the stages without varying the levels up to a significant degree? That's when the game starts going downhill. What could've been an interesting formula just descends into a dull  and unexciting game that doesn't really justify spending the higher spending price. Angry Video Game Nerd fans will be mildly amused by the nods present in the game but as a whole the Nerd's style of humor doesn't translate well into text form leaving them dissapointed. People looking for a challenge will be turned off by the overall dull game play and design despite the colorful stages offering no incentive to continue playing. I'd skip this even if you are a huge fan of the Nerd."

Its designed to be nearly unbeatable, except through reptition and learning to beat a level the hard way, much like super meat boy.  The art and music are great if you appriciate 8/16 bit era looks and sounds and there are lots of nods to both nerdy culture and classic games that any retro game fan is sure to love.  Sadly, the game is too lude and crude for its own good... It doesnt' try to be witty and instead hopes that you'll find tastless nonsince amuseing, but I didn't.  I'm sure the humor will appeal to someone, but not me, and it will likely appal the average person.  If you love dificult, retro stylized games and can enjoy or ignore course and disguesting content, you'll love this game, especially considering its low price point!

NO! But did it succeded? YES! Indeed the game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that's the whole point.

Has a ton a references to the episodes whether that's the level look or enemies. Music is enjoyable. Controls are very responsive.CONS: As a game, it is very frustrating. I wanted to like this game but I just can't. Its level design and cheap deaths ruined the overall experience. Idk whose idea it was to have a bunch of death blocks (seriously they are everywhere). The game does not have a good balance of challenge. The game is literally trial and error, and maybe that's the point to be the ""Nerd"" but don't feel that it needed to be this diffcult. Some people like the old school difficulty, but I don't because I find myself repeating the same parts of a level over and over again. The levels are ridiculously hard but the bosses are easy. Again, an example of not a good balance of challenge. I have forced myself to finish the game and that's not a good sign. Really hope the second one is not like this.CONCLUSION: If you're a fan, you will like this for its old school difficulty. If you're not, you might not like this."

Every other level is just the same thing (some slight alterations sometimes) with a different skin. Boss battles are boring and all 8 levels' bosses can be defeated by just smashing fire button. The final boss is a slightly different case. This time you are faced with something that actually feels like a boss. The fight is difficult, but it is much less complicated than it feels. On the other hand, one good thing about the game is the movement. It feels raw and good, had no problems with landing precise jumps etc.So, to sum it up:If you are looking for a fun hard game: don't buy this one, go with Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV (though it's not the hardest game in the universe).But if you are looking for hard game based on cheap repetetive traps and enemies - go with this one."

He's a really cool guy, so I try to support him in any way that I can. When I heard he had his own game, I jumped at the chance to get it.Simply put, this game is a blast. It's a tough as nails action platformer that perfectly captures the spirit of older gen titles. Kickin' music? Yes. Tight controls? Yes. Colorful, varied stages each with their own theme and challenges? Yes. A play experience that makes me feel like I spent my money well? Yes.If you remember playing games like Contra, Journey to Silius, Mega  Man, and  Super Turrican, this game is for you. It's a simple premise: shoot and jump your way through each stage, all while collecting power ups and dodging an insane amount of obstacles. That's it. And it works. It's the high level of difficulty that makes this game so good though: a very balanced difficulty system allows players of all skill levels to get what they want from this game.Aside from the great gameplay, this is also a fantastic low-brow homage to the games of yesteryear. The incessant profanity made me laugh, too.Buy this game.

The games control is silky smooth (although I reccomend a controller), and the graphics are colorful and full of charecter, and the music is fitting and memorable. The games difficulty is high, but MOSTLY fair. I say mostly because there are points where the game doesn't quite live up to the name, and on higher difficulty modes where lives are few and far between, It's a real hastle when an unexpected instant death block comes on screen, leaving you less than a second to react. Another issue I had with the game is that alot of the games variety of enemies are just clones. I noticed on several occations that I would find an enemy in a stage based off of horror designed like a ghost, and then go to the hell level and find that exact same enemy with a new sprite and same sound effects. Yet another issue I had was that the highly mature and rauchy humor throughout the game is really not very funny. Even when the game quotes the youtube sensation himself, without any context, the jokes just come off as immature and childlike. But even with all of these issues, the game is still really fun, warrenting another playthrough from me. Just be careful with the unlockable difficulties unless you're a masichist."

It is full of cheap kills and vulgar language via this ""Nerd"" character who is nothing more than a cheap megaman knockoff who proceeds to whine about every single thing this stupid game has to offer. There are not very many levels and all of them are crafted with the level design equivalent of something an 11 year old boy drew on a piece of paper when he was supposed to be paying attention to math class. Tons of one-hit kill blocks muck up what could have at least been a mediocre yet fun little romp through the somewhat clever parody levels of other much better games. But that's it there are only 6 or 7 levels! That's HALF of one megaman game. Also this nerd is not your only character you play as. He has friends - go figure - a nerd with friends! Doesn't seem very nerdy if you A) have friends and B) have a cool gun that you fire at everything. That's what cool people have! In fact the only thing nerdy about this stereotype is that hes got glasses and whines!The other characters all suck and do not help you out in any way and the collectible &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥pickles"" add nothing to the game. There is no reason to collect anything in this game unless you are really so bored that you'd want to play this atrocity again. Oh, and despite the pretty colors and simple gameplay, this game is NOT for kids. Heck I don't think its for adults either as the humor is an uncanny blend of juvenile and adult (see: &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥Pickle""). This is a game that I can only reccomend for sick twisted minds of 20-something stoners and drunks who want something stupid to laugh at for about 30 minutes before getting tired of dying and need to go play GTA while they get high and blow up cars and run people over.Depraved, dawdling and unfunny.

,Recommended,237740,9535887,"Posted: 17 March, 2014",all,Colonoctopus,"First of all, let me start off by saying that this is a fun game. It's pretty much all I've been playing recently; the controls are nice, the levels have variety, and you get a great feeling of accomplishment when you get past hard parts of the game or beat a boss. However, there are a few things that have really annoyed me, and one of them was enough to make me stop playing the game entirely.My biggest complaint is that there are no save points. There are checkpoints that you respawn at, and the game saves every time you beat a world, but if you quit in the middle of a level, you won't be able to go back to where you were. This really ♥♥♥♥ed me off, because I was fighting the final boss at the end of the hardest stage in the game (which took me 20 minutes to beat) when I had to leave. When I came back, I couldn't resume the fight. Frankly, there's not much of a chance of me going back to playing it anytime soon, simply because of this.As for my smaller complaints, some of them may be by design, but that doesn't stop them from being annoying as hell. Whenever you get hit by an enemy, you lose all momentum. Normally this wouldn't be too bad, but the amount of enemies and hazards the game designers put before or in the middle of big jumps is just ridiculous at times.The standard short invincibility period when you are damaged seems to be present in this game, but it doesn't protect you from most enviromental hazards. This one is really a tiny annoyance, and it becomes less bothersome as you get used to it, but I still feel that potential buyers should know.As well as losing momentum when the enemies hit you, you sometimes move slightly in a random direction. There's one part of the game where this is especially annoying, where even the slightest hit from an enemy will send you a pixel to the left straight into a skull block.Another larger complaint is that you take too long to respawn. In other extremely hard, death-comes-in-an-instant games (Hotline Miami, Super Meat Boy), you respawn instantly when you die. In AVGN Adventures, you have to wait at the game over screen so that the game can show you its novel at first, but eventually just annoying randomly generated nerd quotes. This can be very annoying in the parts of the game that are filled with the skull blocks that instakill you when you touch them.Another warning to potential buyers: This game is mostly fanservice. If you're not into the Angry Video Game Nerd, then this won't be very fun for you. Unfortunately, even the fan service aspect of the game leaves something to be desired. It's filled with funny references, but other than that, not much of the dialogue and level design really reflects the show all that much.Overall, it's a fun but extremely flawed game, and definitely worth it if you're an AVGN fan looking for a couple hours of (extremely frustrating) fun."

After switching to controller the impossible became much more possible and suddenly I could easily fine-tune my jumps instantly making for a far more enjoyable experience. So I sincerely advise using one with this game.Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a side-scrolling action game which offers you that pure sense of accomplishment and rewarding feeling harkening back to the simpler side-scrolling days of old, complete with punishing, somtimes unfair, hand-sweating level design.  The controls are tight and responsive and won't be working against you in any way.  The challenge will seem daunting at times but with patience, observation, familiarity and quick reaction you can make it through.

The music is phenominal, the gameplay is tight and responsive, and it has plenty of attitude.

If you enjoyed the platformers of old (NES specifically) you will find some familiar tropes and humor. I’ve never really watched anything this game is based on – I was more interested in the throwback style and references to old games. The game itself is fun but challenging to a fault – it’s nearly unplayable except with the unlimited lives option. The levels are designed to be a throwback to the challenging platformers of old but they go too far and create something that is borderline unplayable. I’ve actually beaten Battletoads and Ghost and Goblins on their respective systems and this game is harder than either of those combined.

What I find interesting about the AVGN game is that they actually incorporated these game design flaws and made them into something great. From impossible jumps to unfair design, AVGN Adventures takes these monstrosities of game design and turns it into something fresh, exciting and just fun.The difficulty on this one is worthy of the title ""NES Hard"" and the actual game itself plays like a mixture between the original classic Mega Man games and Contra. The music is reminiscient of nostalgic 80s chip tune and brings gamers back to a time where the basics were all you needed. The sprite art is beautifully built from the ground up with some clear inspiration from other titles, again, such as Mega Man.Many people seem to say that this game has hardly any replay value which I would like to say is complete bogus. There are three different characters to play as in AVGNA, two of which need to be unlocked by finding them hidden throughout the 8 different stages (All based on episodes of the AVGN.) Also, the game can be played in different difficulty settings, allowing for more than one gameplay experience. A true completionist will want to not only beat this game in more than one way, but master AVGNA, much like those of retro gaming tastes do.The in game dialogue (in text boxes) is crude, filthy, disgusting, and downright hilarious. AVGNA incorporates many of the Nerds' iconic quotes as well as invent new terms that are definetly NSFW.Overall, this game is definetly worth purchasing and playing through. The difficulty is extreme at times and I would recommend a controller rather than a keyboard. Those with a taste for retro gaming will find this a masterpiece. Even, if you're not into retro gaming, pick this one up when it goes on sale. You won't regret it."

,Recommended,237740,8837508,"Posted: 24 January, 2014",all,CantyCanadian,"This is one of the game I have the most mixed feeling about. Being one of the game I was most hyped for, having the main character being one of my favorite video-maker on the internet and one of the pioneer of modern video-format video game reviews, but does the qualities of the game finishes there?First of, the gameplay. The nerd, being a player of old school games, had to have something resembling this in his own game. So, the gameplay is a mix of multiple games, but mainly from 2D shooters like Megaman. You're able to shoot (with the nerd) in eight directions and can jump. That's about it.During the game, you can find other characters that can help you during your adventure, three of them being even playable. The first one is The Guitar Guy, who is the creator of AVGN's theme song. His weapon of choice is his trusty guitar that shoots waves of sounds that passes through wall, making some parts in some level easier to complete.Next, we have Mike, James Rolfe's friend and the 'co-founder' of AVGN. His weapon is a lightsaber that only attacks at melee range, but is the fastest weapon. He also jumps higher than any character and has the power to see special blocks that can be destroyed with his saber to reveal items, like in Castlevania.Finally, we have... Bullsh*t Man. For this review, I'll just call him BSM. BSM is a strange case, being a character from another sere run byCinemasacre.com, James' website. His power is the 'sh*tdouken' where he throws a poop projectile that suffers from gravity, making some kind of arc. His main ability, however, is a fart jump, allowing to jump in mid-air to make platform parts easier.For the gameplay, we also have collectibles. You can collect beer bottles for health, Nerd heads for lives and a Super Scope for a temporary power boost. You can also find the Nerd's friend that will give you tons of power ups while saying funny stuff. They are well hidden and make it worth to get off the main track to explore a bit.To finish with the collectibles, we have the special powerups. There is the 'rock' which is... a rock. This is a reference to Friday the 13th on the NES. It's literally the worst weapon in the game. Next, we have the glitch goblin that freezes any enemies or obstacles to pass them easily. And we have Super Mecha Death Christ, which is a fully loaded Jesus that kills everything on the screen.Sadly, even with the amount of collectibles you can get, the gameplay stops there. Sure, you have some sections where you ride either Santa Claus or a fire shark, but the game doesn't really change much. Not that it's a bad thing, but it might get stale for some players.This game, however, has a different meaning for the word fun. ""The best part of a journey is the travel, not the destination"", this game make it so you wish there was no travel. You are a god (or too young to play) if you don't swear at least once during the game. This piece of software sh*t is made to make you suffer.The difficulty, however, was expected. There is different difficulty option that changes the lives and beer bottle count, but even at easy, it can be hell to some players. I could say that it's a fun game, but it's f*cking hard. Seriously, there is a reason why there aren't that much people who did it in the maximum difficulty (being hardcore 0 lives, one hit point). Want a challenge or miss the NES era, grab this game.Which this game is challenging and fun, the replayability is kind of non-existant. Sure, you unlock some new difficulties, but the experience doesn't change. Worst, you know where the easter eggs, easy to grab powerups and death traps are, making the journey less fun. Plus, being only a game that last around 3 hours before finishing doesn't help.Then, the art department, namely the graphics and sound. From the mouth of the developpers : ""We tried to stick to some kind of 10-bit display. 8-bit didn't have enough details while 16-bit wasn't enough old school."" This statement make it so that this game has a style of its own and it really shows how much you can do with it. The appearance of the game is really good and each level has a different theme, making the backgrounds vibrant and ever-changing.The soundtrack is simply awesome. For a game about a swearing nerd, the music really sets the mood for some balls to the walls action. Some of those tracks could make it to my music player if I wouldn't be so lazy. The sound effects, for the most part, are pretty good. Each sounds are different enough so that it doesn't sound like recycled bleeps and bloops and it sounds like it could belong on an old console.This game is obviously a gift to the fans of the nerd. It's a challenging game, but that's about it. Both for fans and non-fans, you shouldn't buy it at full price (15$) and wait for a promotion, which happens very often. Even then, I think that only fans could really enjoy this experience due to the sheer amount of easter eggs related to the f*cking nerd there is hidden in this.Gameplay : 6/10Fun : 5/10Graphics : 7/10Music : 9/10Result : 6.75/10   Good-ish Game."

Crazy hard platforming, annoying enemy patterns, small invinciblity window after taking a hit and a small life bar.  Oh and the skull blocks, If you touch a skull block you die istantly and there everywhere! its insain.As annoying as all this can be, each level does gradually ramp up the challenge so you'll be able to get a bit of a feel of things before they go from hard to insain.

This is not the game for you.AVGN Adventures is a love letter to everything that is the Angry Video Game Nerd. You've got the Rolling Rock health display. You've got familiar Cinemassacre characters. You've got Super Mecha Death Christ. You've got Glitch Gremlin. You've got the NES Zapper as your main weapon. You've got hilariously vulgar lines coming from the Nerd at every new element in the game. And you've got homages to some of the Nerd's best moments.As for gameplay, it's kind of like Mega Man in that you run and shoot similar to the Blue Bomber. You also have stage selects before each level and, after defeating the previous bosses, you fight in one final stage that throws everything at you. It also throws in a little bit of Super Mario 2 in having different playable characters with different mechanics.The music is the absolute best part of the game. Each level has a driving theme that's also an homage to a certain game. While my personal favorite is the theme to Future ****balls 2010, the Laughin' Jokin' Numbnuts theme is just crazy.It's not a perfect game at all, but it is more competent and has had more care given to it than most of the games James has played on the show.

I've been watching AVGN for a long time now, and this game is very suiting. But don't pay too much; to won't be worth your investment. Catch this game on sale if you can. This is the short answer. If you want to know more read on.The good:The controls are good, though definitely use a controller. A keyboard has felt clumsy for me and the developers definitely had using a playstation or xbox controller in mind.The story is VERY AVGN. It's a bit of fun and makes it worth playing for a while. If you've watched AVGN a lot, you'll see a lot of references to his videos throughout the game. The humor is funny for a little while, but it gets a bit tiresome.The music is great. Every stage has different theme and it's some of the best 8-bit music out there. The sound effects make it sound like your zapper or sound waves are really inflicting quite a bit of damage on the enemies you hit. These are great compliments to the game.The difficulty is quite hard, but once you get used to the controls, you'll be blaming yourself rather than the game for deaths. The first few stages aren't terribly difficult in comparison with the later stages (they'll give you a run for your money though), but the later ones aren't nearly so easy. More on that later.I haven't had any major gripes with the types of enemies.The eh:The stages get very repetitive and by the end, you don't feel like you're really playing a different stage with completely new enemies. Most of the enemies are reskins from other levels. For example, the fireballs, the happy faces, the flying ghosts, the squids are all the same, just different shapes. These are the most common enemies, and you can't even kill them. Furthermore, there aren't enough enemies for the diversity of weapons. So many times have I wanted to slaughter a band of enemies with my light saber but rarely do any come. And the ones that do come are so difficult to hit, it's easier to just avoid them than to risk getting hurt by one.The extra characters are cool, but they're usually impractical to use. The guitar guy has a better weapon, but he can't aim it and he can't jump as high as the Nerd. It's too bad there aren't quite that many enemies that can be killed. Mike jumps higher than the nerd, but he's a bit clumsier and his weapon isn't nearly as good as either of the others (kind of like Luigi in the recent 3D Marios). The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t man gets a special second jump, but even with both jumps he still can't jump higher than the Nerd. His weapon sucks, don't use it. There aren't really any points in the game where you realize you HAVE to use another character. It's a shame because this could have been a real good opportunity for a bit of a puzzle design.Powerups are in the game, but they're too scant to be useful. Plus sometimes they don't even do anything good anyway! The glitch gremlin will stop all enemy movement, but what good does it do if you have standstill ghosts everywhere and there's no way to jump over them all? It's impossible to freeze them at the perfect time.The later stages are just tedious. Multiple obstacles face you in every direction and the game isn't even fair for most of them. For example, the haunted stage involves moving platforms that you have to keep up with. But if you haven't played that part of the stage before, you're bound to fall off because of the unpredictable motions of the platform. I understand a couple deaths to this, but the coupling of the platforms, enemies, and those wretched death blocks make the game outright frustrating.In fact, my biggest gripe has got to be the death blocks. The death blocks are everywhere and they don't add to the game experience. If you touch them, you'll die instantaenously; it doesn't matter how many beers you have left. With so many in the game, you will come to realize that there's no reason to avoid the other flying enemies since your main obstacle are those death blocks. The death blocks are strategically placed in stupid locations designed to make you die and start all over again. They just seem like cheap deaths. With so many death blocks around, it's nearly impossible to beat the game on normal difficulty, let alone hard.The humor feels much much darker than the Nerd is in his videos. Maybe it's the open-mouthed shock-face that James instills in his character every time something goes horribly wrong that the game developers didn't manage to recreate in-game. The nerd starts dissing the game too early and never stops.Conclusion:If you're a fan of the Nerd, get this game under one condition: don't buy this game for more than $7! The game gets a couple things perfectly right but then forgets or gets too lazy to change it up. If the developers didn't want to spend the extra time to program new and intuitive enemies, better levels, and more exciting uses of your teammates, you shouldn't pay the extra money to buy this game."

,Recommended,237740,15681049,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,goblin girl,"Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is at base a typical ""very hard"" platformer, not nearly hard enough to qualify as Platform Hell (I was able to beat three levels without trouble, and got most of the way through a fourth). It has standard indie-pixel graphics (which is to say, visually appealing, but much more pixelized than actual 8-bit games were). The controls are pretty solid, there are multiple characters you can rescue and then switch between mid-level, and a decent number of powerups and items.The connection to the AVGN consists primarily of references; while there's not actually that much original humor in the game, there are plenty of times you'll be able to say ""oh, yeah, I remember the episode where the Nerd made that joke."" The game does contain the Nerd's trademark profanity (throughout the game's dialogue and randomly generated phrases upon death). It doesn't, however, contain much for the Nerd to really complain about; you'll die constantly, but still end up making steady forward progress.Most of the game's difficulty comes from a single source: death blocks. Touch a death block and it's instant death, like the spikes in Mega Man. These things are EVERYWHERE -- lining the bottom of pits, lining the ceiling of hallways, in vertical rows you have to springboard over, in horizontal rows you have to ride conveyances over. Some of them just flat-out block the way, and fade in and out of existence; you have to dash from safe spot to safe spot while they're gone. Timing this @#$@ is absolutely vital.So I can recommend this game as a standard hard platformer that'll take most good players 1-2 weeks to finish. If you aren't confident in your platforming skills this is NOT the place to try and hone them. You don't have to be familiar with the Nerd's oeuvre to understand it, but it'll seem pretty random and surreal if you aren't.Warning: One level in particular, the one based on the Nerd's ""Atari Porn"" review episode, is absolutely nauseating. Seriously, at certain points I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. Play that level on an empty stomach or you may react to it the way the Nerd reacted to E.T. II in the movie."

I don't know why, but it felt like movement was just tighter with the 360 controler.If you are a fan of Cinemassacre or just the good old NES and love a good challange, this game is a must have."

,Recommended,237740,8237655,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,The Great Cassowary27,"TL;DRThis retro style platformer is very challenging, but offers great audio and visual treats for the player. Tons of replay value, but not for younger gamers.Story - 4/10Gameplay - 8/10Difficulty - 10/10Visual - 9/10Audio - 9/10Replay Value - 10/10Family Friendly - 0/10IntroductionIf you dont know anything about the Angry Video Game Nerd, AVGN is a game review  web series where James Rolfe, the creator and star of the series, portrays an angry nerd who ""Takes you back to the past"" and plays terrible games from the NES, SEGA Genesis, and Atari ages of gaming. The reviews mainly point out flaws and mishaps with the selected games, and does so with the use of heavy profanity and poop jokes...A LOT of profanity.The first line of the AVGN Theme song is""He's gonna take you back to the pastTo play the sh*tty games that suck *ss""The Nerd has reviewed  games, consoles, and even video game accessories throughout 100+ episodes.Story - 4/10The intro cut scene tells the simple story this game has. The Nerd and his friends were playing a terrible game one night, and they were zapped into the game! The Nerd escapes to his basement, but he is quickly seized by a robot arm that comes out of the TV and pulls him in by his ball sack. You play as the Nerd and his friends trying to escape from Gameland.A pretty generic story. You are placed in a weird world, and you must escape. The reason that I gave the story a 4 and not lower, is because I can see this ridiculous thing happening in an episode of AVGN. Some of the more thematic episodes of the series involve the Nerd being chased by Jason Vorhees, fighting ROB the Robot, and even taking a dump on Bugs Bunny's face! Getting sucked into a video game sounds nothing out of the ordinary for the Nerd.Gameplay - 8/10This game is a platformer, but it offers some variety of gameplay. This game mainly consists of the player trying to get to the end of the level, but the difficulty is insane.In the ""normal"" setting, you get three beers, which act as your health. along with 10 lives. The easiest setting gives you six beers with unlimited lives. Most enemies take off one beer, but there are insta-death blocks and lasers as well, in addition to the standard ""fall of the screen"" death.There are eight different levels of Gameland to play in, each with a different theme based on an existing genre, including mid evil, sci-fi, winter, fantasy, and even a level based on the Atari porn games titled ""Beat it and Eat it"".Each level has different enemies and design, but they all have insta-death blocks, pits, and these annoying circular-flying enemies that are re-skins for each level. (In one level they are ghosts, in another, they are balls of electricity etc..)The default Nerd is only armed with an NES baster gun as a weapon, but once found, the Nerd can get help from his friends who offer some special abilities. The other characters are also from the AVGN web series. While the game is able to be completed with just the Nerd, his friends come in handy at times.Guitar Guy can run faster and shoot through walls using his guitar.Mother F*cker Mike can jump higher and longer, similar to Luigi, but his attack is a melee lightsaber. He cannot move while attacking. He can also see through walls, revealing lives, beers, and save points.The B*llsh*t Man can throw turds at enemies, but only at a short distance. However, he can double jump by farting, which allows access to previously unreachable areas.There are also special attacks that can be picked up throughout the game, including the Glitch Gremlin, who “glitches out” every enemy on screen, making them easier to kill. The Super-Mecha-Death-Christ powerup kills all enemies on screen. There is also a joke “rock” powerup. You can throw them at enemies, but the rocks arc over everything, which is useless, but is used in various real games the Nerd has reviewed.Difficulty – 10/10I have only beaten this game on the easy mode. With six beers and unlimited lives, it was still difficult. Literally everything in this game is trying to kill you. There are walking enemies, flying enemies, enemies that float in patterns, lasers, disappearing blocks, insta-death blocks, disappearing insta-death blocks, and more. I cannot fathom how anybody can beat this game above the normal setting.Visual - 9/10The graphics in this game are superb. It really captures the style of the old-school NES. The animations are spot-on, and the color schemes of the levels are outstanding. There isnt much I can say about it without showing you the game itself.Audio – 9/10Much like the visuals, I can't really give the audio justice without you actually hearing it. The music in this game is phenomenal. Each track is memorable and fits the mood of the game that you're in. The title screen is a chip tune version of the AVGN theme, the level select screen gets enhanced after unlocking the final level, each level track is amazing for a minute long loop. I don't know what else to say except for you to listen for yourself!Replay Value – 10/10There is tons of replay value in this game. After discovering the other three characters, you can go back and find all of the hidden Sh*tpickles (another character from AVGN). They don't do anything besides you get an achievement for finding them all. After beating the game on easy, you can refine your skills in Normal, Old School, and the other advanced settings where the beers and lives become fewer, and the enemies become harder to kill.Family Friendly – 0/10As you have probably noticed from the names of the characters, this game is not for children. The nerd curses (all through text boxes) during different levels, character reveals, and sections of the game. Each time you die, the death screen shows a randomly generated phrase “I'd rather X X from a X's X than play this X game!” one of the less profane ones ive gotten was “I'd rather chew urine from a potato's butt crack then play this crummy game!”The Nerd flips you the bird if you leave him idling for too long, and when you start up the game, the first thing you see is “RATED 'F' FOR F*CKBALLS”The worst part, is that there is no way to filter out these obscene things. I'm afraid to play this game in around my family because of all the profanity in this game. Sure, the AVGN series is filled with it, so I guess it fits to have it in the game, but I was shocked when I first played it. There was no warning or disclaimer telling me of this on the Steam store page. If you are heavily offended by profanity, do not pick up this game.So there you have it! My review of Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures. Overall, it's a good game. It can be difficult most of the time, but what it lacks in easiness, it makes up for in audio and art style. I say that it's listed on Steam at a fair price."

Personally, I'm more of an Irate Gamer fan (haters please don't spam me a bunch of hate), but since I still do in fact like the AVGN, I decided to check out the game. After playing it, I was amazed. The game takes inspiration from classics such as Mega Man and Castlevania. The graphics, music, nostalgic values, gameplay, humor and replay value were just remarkable. Even if you don't like the AVGN or his videos, I still recommend this game, because its a great stand alone game, even without the AVGN character. My only nitpick with the game is that there are only 10 levels, but the game resembles an NES game, so I'll let that slide. I see myself playing this game a lot in the future, and I won't regret it either. Now if we could only get the Irate Gamer game on Steam, then I would have a match made in Heaven.

However, despite having some really good aspects (music, styling,...), the game sadly resulted in being a precision/timing platformer, in which the smallest mistake will end up in an instant death. Unexpected and really fast moving hazards just end up in annoying trial & error and when there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of stuff happening on your screen, it'll be more based on luck instead of skills that will help you get through it.The game also doesn't reset your lives at the start of a new level, so if you have 8/30 lives left, you'll find yourself killing you over and over untill it's game over and the game givces you back 30 lives. Note that the easy setting has unlimited lives.If you are a big fan of the series and you don't get frustrated fast, you might want to give this game a shot, as for all the others, there's just to much trial & error going on to be enjoyable (as it is not really a challange, but more of  course memorization)."

A 2D sidescroller that harkens back to the old SNES days, The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a smorgasboard of James Rolfe's ongoing Youtube sensation and celebrates every second of it.Graphically the game has an inspired look. Meaning that pretty much everything in the game is an homage to something from the show, and the music is probably better than it deserves. While the presentation is top-notch, the gameplay is where the game falters. The game has the tendency to mock the faults of other games: not being able to see oncoming enemies beyond the screen, checkpoints that are placed at sadistic spots and instakills are only the tip of the iceberg. Alot of trial and error is in place here when it shouldn't. If you want to point out the mistakes other games make by being unfair to the player, don't make the same mistakes aswell.Frustration aside, I still think this is a game you should at least give a try.

A really bad game in fact!The problem by writing this review about this game, is that it draws so many refrences to the internet show, that you need to know the show, in order to get many of the jokes. In fact you need to know about most of the things James Rolfe has made, since it`s also draws refrence to other shows like ""monster madness""The game it self is a sidescroller, and it is hard, really really hard! This draws a line to the nerd, since he hates hard and cryptic games.The diffeculty is as I said very hard, and changing the diffeculty dose not help that much. I have only completed the game on it`s easyest diffeculty, and I even found that very hard to complete. The game is not that hard so you wanna quit it, (although I were doing that at times), but it keeps it just that frusterating, that you have to complete the obstacle in your way, like ""super meat boy""There are six stages in the game, which you can play in the order you please, after completing all six levels you unlock the final level (which is a nightmare to complete)Some of the stages draws reference to the nerd show, where we go trough a Castlevania kind of stage, where the end boss is doctor Jekyll. Another stages is the super happy land stage, where the last boss is a unicorn ******** rainbows, and you even have to got to hell, in order to defeat satan.the gameplay is very simple you run and gun, and you jump and duck in order to avoid obstacles, this makes the game sounds easy, but it is really not. You can also find power ups doing the game. There are three power ups and they are the rock from friday the 13th, which is a bad weapon, with a annoying angle to shot with, it`s the glich Gremlin, which makes the game glich out, and thereby stop the game for a while, and at last the ultimate weapon the super mega death Christ, who kills all enemys on the screen, and damage bosses a lot.There are also other playable charectes, but they are not just someone you unlock, but someone you have to find throughout the game. The other charecters are Mike, who uses a lightsaber, to cut trough enemyes and some walls, the guitar guy, who can shot trough walls, and the bull**** man, who shots...well ****.To talk about the diffeculty, you have to talk about the nerd. The nerd would hate this game (in fact he have done a review on it), and it draws from all the things the nerd hates. That would be things like annoying enemys with hard to dodge patterens, one hit kills, disaperring/reaperring blocks and so on. This makes you remember all the times you have seen the nerd and laughed at him, and now you see the frustration he is going through.About all the refrences:I have been a long life viewer of James shows, and therefore I can understand all the references that the game is making, it even makes camios by the team of screwattack (who are also making internet shows, and created this game). You will really find the game random if you never have heard of the nerd before, and that is really sad, since all the jokes cracs me up all the time. You even get a ""ill rather"" rant from the nerd when you die. The nerd is famouse for making these rants, about what he would rather do then play this game, and trust me, there are no nice words used there.The game get`s a thumps up. I enjoyed the game a lot, and I personally think it`s a good mix of good and hard game. You will get frusterated at times, but thats a part of the games charm. I would however say you have to look the angry videogame nerd up, in order to really love this game. It draws so many funny refrences from the show, that you will find youself smilling a lot at times. If you don`t look the nerd up, you will properly just fine the game to be a hard but fun sidescroller.To end this I will just say. I would rather **** a ******* skunk up it`s *** while I *** a cat in it`s eye`s, while a dunky is ******* in my ******* ear! Then play this game again!wow gave that a shot, hope you guys will enjoy playing this game couse I sureiy did. 8 out of 10"

Yes, it's a lot harder, but they give you 30 lives and constant continue points on the normal difficulty, so it's not much of an issue.  It's very doable even with a keyboard.  Once you've memorized how to get past the hardest parts, and as long as you're taking your time, it's not even that bad.  Of course, the game basically taunts you into rushing head first into the various obstacles, and by the tenth time you've died to one, you end up playing so recklessly and ""on tilt"" that you just keep dieing, with the Nerd character giving a hilarious randomly generated complaint after each death.  The game is a bit short, like a traditional Megaman game (8 stages and an amazingly evil final stage) but for $10, it's totally worth the money.  There are a few secrets to find, like unlocking some bonus characters, and there's always the added replay value of trying to complete the game on the hard difficulty, which limits the number of lives and continues you get."

It has a distinct visual style, very well implemented mechanics that are both old-school and new, and is just generally one of the few examples of a modern 2D platformer done right. Sure, there is a little bit of trial and error, but I would say that patient players will not find themselves frustrated with the level design and the death traps. The level design is devilish, but not unfair! Really, all of your skill depends on whether or not you can remain calm and on how fast you pick up on shortcuts through levels and boss fights. Secrets are hard to find (I would say impossible) and I would suggest looking at a guide to find all the cameos and characters to help you on your way through any of the higher difficulties.If you are a AVGN fan, you'll definitely get more of a kick out of the game as there's lots of references. I can imagine the 'dialogue' in the game being grating to non-fans as you can't turn it off. That quickly becomes a problem for anyone that wants to replay the game multiple times, as the dialogue still remains there.The game can be beaten in an hour on lower difficulties, but the game banks on you replaying it on higher unlockable difficulties. If you like earning achievements, this game makes it really satisfying to get them (for the most part). I played it for 8 hours according to my timer, and I have only beaten the game on 2 difficulties so far (Normal and Old-School). All that changes is that you have more limited amounts of lives and harder to beat enemies to face (as well as other small things).All in all, AVGN Adventures is definitely a memorable 2D Platformer and definitely an instant-classic for AVGN fans. For everyone else, though, this will just be a fun experience for a few hours. I recommend it to anyone who likes a simple game with challenging level design and a lust for earning achievements."

If you really like The AVGN then this game is for you. It has alot of the same humor that is found in the videos and many charactors and settings are in the game that are direct references to certain episodes of AVGN. If your not familier or a fan of AVGN you may like this game less however if your a fan of older video games such as side scrolling action shooter platformers I would give this game a try. It is however insanely difficult and that is the way it is meant to be. Also what I found really interesting and fun was the ability to play not just as AVGN but Mike which is pretty cool among others. This game was a bit short however but I guess the real challenge is seeing how much better you can do going thru it again and dieing a little less.
,Recommended,237740,17776973,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,Clarky,"I intially went into this game with low expectations I have been dissapointed with licensed product before (having played a myriad of movie tie-in shovelware titles in my youth.) However I was very impressed with AVGN Adventures, a game that will appeal to both long-time fans of The Nerd and fans of hardcore retro platformers.This title was released in 2013, developed by FreakZone Games and published by ScrewAttack. As shown by The Nerd in his episode ""AVGN Games"", games about The Nerd and his angry world have existed long before this game came out. Many of those titles were homebrew titles often created by one person and released on the Internet for free. AVGN Adventures is the first commercial AVGN game and certainly the title with the highest production value. Visually, the game features rich and colorful pixel art in additional to some smoothly animated effects (The Nerd exploding into several bits and pieces a la Fallout 3 is a highlight.) The soundtrack hearkens back to the video game days of yore, featuring an engrossing score that fits right at home with the games overall difficulty as well as sound effects that further  draw you in.The gameplay is almost perfect for a game of this genre, it's hard but not unfair, and it's levels are fun and all vastly different from eachother. My only true gripe with the game is the finicky keyboard controls which unfortunately makes jumping and landing with precision challenging. This problem is of course erased when you plug in an Xbox 360 PC controller, however it does not erase the games overall difficulty. This game is not recommended for anyone who's not familiar with NES titles like Mega Man, Ninja Gaiden, and Castlevania as the difficulty of this game mimicks that of those classic titles. Also, the game doesn't have much replay value after you complete it for the first time which is acceptable for a $10 game but it would have been a nice feature to unlock additional levels or harder difficulty levels after you complete the game.It's definitely worth your money if you like hard-as-nails, old-school platformers!"

My only issue with this game is the lives system.  Why does normal difficulty limit you to a certain number of lives?  There is a lot of trial-and-error gameplay (especially in the haunted house level).  I like games like super meat boy which have some trial and error, but there you get unlimited lives.  I think these two things should always go together.  The easy setting lets you blast through the level and tank tons of hits.  I wish there was a setting where you had 3 HP, but unlimited lives."

Now, it's starring AVGN, who is one of my favorite reviewers of all time. For those of you who aren't familiar with him, he's a nerd who plays sh***y games and curses. He may not sound like much, but he's hilarious, and so is his game. The story is about the Nerd, the Guitar Guy Who Lives Under the Couch, the Bulls**it Man, and Mike Matei playing a game together, when suddenly it sucks them in, and grabs the Nerd by the crotch......did I mention this game is weird? The levels are based on AVGN episodes, and boy, they are really, REALLY difficult. It's difficult in an old-school style NES type of way, which is great. I also like it how the Nerd in the game says the lines he would say if he played that game, and wouldn't ya know, there's an episode where he plays this. There are a few Easter Eggs here and there, for example, if you stand still for a moment, he'll give you the middle finger. Now, 30 lives on Normal Mode may seem like a cakewalk, but far from it. You're going to find yourself on countless Game Over screens with dirty yet hilarious lines that the Nerd says. Overall, I'll sum up this game the same way one of the guys on E3 who played it did: ""It's Fard; A combination of fun and hard"". I love this game, but unless you know how hard old-school games are, do yourself a favor and don't play it."

Itisludicrously difficult, but it's not as cheap as you may expect from a game with a premise like this. Sure, there are some parts where you can't help but get hit (one of the witches in the last section of Beat'em and Eat'em springs to mind), but for the most part it's all about timing and pattern recognition. Some people might complain about the instant death blocks, but I didn't mind them.The graphics are pure 16-bit goodness, but the real highlight here is no doubt the music. The theme songs for Thy Farts Be Consumed and Laughing Joking Numbnuts are just amazing.My biggest complaint are perhaps the controls. The characters could use a bit more traction, and there are times when they don't turn around when you tell them to (this is mostly noticeable in boss battles). That being said, this doesn't completely ruin your experience like in other games.So in short: yes, I would recommend this game to those looking for a challenge, though it's best enjoyed if you're familiar with the series."

One of my most favorite youtube channels, this game is the lovechild of cinamassacre, screwattack, and freakzone. AVGN adventures is a metroidvania platformer type game that is not lacking in the difficulty department. As you would expect, this game is hard. Not just hard, but ♥♥♥♥ing hard. Most of the levels require memorization of some parts and the ability to have good platform timing (cough cough future ♥♥♥♥balls 2010) While others are brutal to the point where you will be seeing the death screen plenty of times. Most of the enemies that you'll see are the typical bunch, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who throw stuff, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who move back and forth, and the mother ♥♥♥♥ing madusa head type enemies. There are a total of three playable characters, James (of course) a dead Kyle Justin (The guy who lives behind the nerds couch, and who composed the original theme) and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself, Mike Matei. All three have their own playstyles, James is the all rounder, he can shoot in 6 directions (up, up right, up left, down, down right, down left) with his zapper. Kyle moves quicker and can shoot through walls, but cannot shoot in as many directions and cannot jump as high. Mike is the melee player, he is virtually Zero from mega man x. All and all, the game is great. Animation is smooth and fluent, while the subtle nods to the show and annoying game tropes are pretty funny. A great buy!"

Naggie the tutorial fairy tells you jump is A (when it isn't for PC) and so unless you looked at the controls before playing the game you have to guess what the controls are. Also, the fact that you can't use the mouse is the real deal breaker for me, I have to use the keyboard fully, which doesn't sound that bad but is an issue when ""up"" and ""Jump"" use different keys and you can't use the mouse it means that it is really hard to find the keys that feels right.So be prepared to have to spend about 30 minutes changing the controls to feel good.It really annoyes me that they made this port to PC with the very low effort. But the game is good and if you like the AVGN then you will be able to get over the controls, to improve it i would say to go into the controls and make I,O and P as the attack.Who wants to marathon the AVGN tonight?"

When I finally got my copy, I realized very quickly that my money was well spent.This game was definitely made with fans of the show in mind, but, it can be enjoyed by anyone who has a love for old school 2D platformers. Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a challenging, 2D platformer where you take control of the Nerd himself (or one of the characters that show up on the show, even people like Mike Matei, that you can unlock.)If you have played a platformer on the NES before, you can imagine what you can expect from this. The difference being that it has the AVGN humor, and tropes from the show. For instance, AVGN's main weapon is a NES Zapper. His life are bottles of Rolling Rock. Levels are based on games he has reviewed in the past, even things he has only talked about- Such as the most ridiculous trap room a game developer could ever make... and they made it in this game.The game is a blast to play, and as I said, it is challenging! Although, I do think that there are a few too many checkpoints in the game, and this makes the challenge a little lower-the final levels of the game are madness!So, if you are a fan of AVGN, you will love this. If you are a fan of challenging 2D platformers from the NES era, you will love this.Forewarning, this game is DEFINITELY for the mature gamer. Lots of Swearing and potty humor, so if that isn't your thing, you may want to pass this up as there is quite a lot of it. But, otherwise, this game is a fun throwback to my childhood gaming days, with AVGN's brand of humor, and LOTS of references to the show, even very obscure references, these guys really fit a little bit of everything into this little gem."

It's a good example of NES hard (at least on old school it is) Which contrary to some belief, difficult can actually mean better gameplay (That is for those Veteran gamers out there) I think its best not to make some games too easy on the normal difficulty setting, but have an easygoing difficulty for any newcomers, that is to allow people to get into the game easier. The AVGN Adventures is a platformer that has a good difficulty setting, an easy mode to compensate, and brilliant level design to make things even harder.

If you don't, you absolutely, positively will not enjoy this game. And if you've never played an NES game, or at the very least never played one of the first three Mega Man games... well, ""I"" can't ""recommend"" piracy, but you should probably try playing some of that.The reason for this is that this game borrows a lot from the original Mega Man games. And Metroid and Castlevania and there's a little Ninja Gaiden in there and... well... look; basically this game is a pastiche of the best of the NES. And I've definitely seen criticism of AVGNA because it's 'using elements from games the Nerd reviewed' or something. Let me be frank. At least I can *beat* this game. Out of the 30+ NES games I own, I've completed less than a third. This game is a CAKEWALK comparatively speaking. You want impossibly difficult? Go sit down with Monster Party for a couple hours. I guarantee you'll be looking at this game differently.This isn't to say that the game is easy. A term I hear thrown around a lot among nostalgic and retro gamers is ""NES hard"". Which is to say that games from that time period, as I've said before, tended to be highly aggravating in difficulty. However, there's just no feeling of satisfaction quite like finally managing to beat an area of a classic game you've been struggling with for hours. It's honestly a bit difficult to explain what makes it different from most modern games, but I think it has to do with how cinematic current games are. Even if you struggle with a section for hours, you've primarily done it to progress a story. 'NES hard' means it's just you and the game. If there's a story, it's bare bones at best. You struggle over every obstacle just to be able to say you did. Current gaming is generally like watching a movie. Retro gaming, at least in the 80's, was more like climbing a mountain- there's nothing up there and there's no logical reason to do it, but ♥♥♥♥ it- YOU DID IT.Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is one of the only modern games I've played that has managed to capture that feeling, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree. Like I said, the game isnt' as hard as some classic titles. And as much as I like James's work, the presence of all the reference jokes can be somewhat distracting. The soundtrack is pretty solid. I don't think it's something I'd listen to in my free time, but it works pretty well and it sounds nice.Basically, if you're waffling, refer to my first paragraph. But for me, I recommend it."

,Not Recommended,237740,26594121,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,WillSpringer,"This game has a lot of potential. The mechanics are good, the pixel-graphics are wonderful, and the controls are tight. It would have been a great retro-styled platform game if it weren't so difficult.It seems that the team who made this game decided that making an ultra-difficult game would either be funny, or a fitting homage to the older 8-bit games that many us us grew up with (many of which owe their own difficulty to the quarter-eating business plans of arcdaes).As others have mentioned; death will occur often in this game, and it would have been nice to be placed at the last checkpoint instantly (a la Hotline Miami) instead of being forced to sit through a screen with a ""funny"" AVGN quote after each death. The ""death block"" (tiles in the environment which kill you upon touch) are pretty annoying, and do seem to stem from the developer's need to artificially increase the diffictulty.If you enjoy ultra-difficult games, perhaps you will enjoy this. I found it to be much harder than Contra; maybe more akin to Ninja Gaiden or Battletoads. Overall, I was disappointed because I found this to be more of a test of patience than a proper game."

I even broke a controller of mine because of this game. The last boss is the cheapest of all, especially on the Hard As Balls setting. Even though I know what's coming, it doesn't matter. He starts crapping on my head, which is somewhat manageable, but then he keeps hitting me with his hard balls. I keep focusing on his balls as much as possible, watching their every move, but he keeps hitting me in the face with them nonetheless. And then, when I finally get him down to almost no energy, one of his balls drops really low, and he keeps swinging it and smashing me with it, and his balls are so hard that you can't shoot through them to hit him in the face. What a cheap piece of crap!"

All the playable characters are fun (maybe other than MIke) but the only one you can really complete the game with is the nerd. Though I have not beaten this game, I have come close to on another person's account. If you want a very retro themed game that pulls it off well, than buy this.
