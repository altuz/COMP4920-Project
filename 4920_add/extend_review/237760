Intake takes some practice to master; it's a true test of your reflexes & mouse control skills. Music (although limited) keeps the adrenaline pumping & the graphics look great!Hard not to become hooked as you hunt for your perfect run to Level 100. Very addictive :)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=193390647{ No Commentary - Straight Gameplay! }Here is some gameplay footage without any hype so you can make up your own mind if its something you might like. More fun in playing than spectating though :)Be sure to adjust your mouse cursor speed to get the maximum control and highest scores! If your cursor is too fast (or slow) by default the game becomes crazy hard and is not enjoyable.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

Excellent game.Intake it's a rare gem, every single part of it in harmony with the rest, making this game an instant thumbs up. Gameplay is excellent, either you use keyboard or mouse: simple controls for quick, non-stop action. Graphics are sharp and bright colored and the interface is, for a lack of a better word in my limited vocabulary, classy. Sound effects are great and contribute to generate a really immersive experience.And the game's soundtrack it's glorious, making the game unique and memorable. The coin-up theme it's another plus, even more if you used to play arcade machines with the level of addictiveness and replayability that this game has. Let me tell it on more concrete terms: this game it's a good purchase for ten bucks (even if you can get it for one).That's high praise coming from me. Well done Cipher Prime, I hope you keep making awesome games in the future."

But those 10 minutes are going to bring you far! One thing i recommend is taking breaks often as its fast phased, intense, and requires a steady yet fast hand aswell as eyes.Its challenging and its a lovely feature to add milestones on the waves such as 0-25-50-100 which means if you ever should get past level 25 you woulndt have to work all the way back up, you can go to the settings and make it start at level 25 :)The lack of music tracks is what brings it a little down in grade as you only got 1 song and 2 unlockable songs, which are about 30 secs long and then repeated :/ I find my self just slapping one of my own songs on in a browser or media player and play the game W/o music ^^The tricky parts comes in evading flashbangs (placebo) and changing colors so your crosshair's color matches the pill you want to bring to an end, as if a yellow pill falls you want to right click or press spacebar to change to the yellow color. There is 2 colors changing each round, and you can unlock a harder difficulty by unlocking 3 colors or more.The game is enjoyable, playable and most of all replayable :)! but as i said, the major thing that drags it down is the lack of music :(8/10!"

Its a simple mechanic, of two coloured pills each level. You can switch colours between the two and match to maximise score. Although im not a big fan of dubstep, the music is still impressive and well done, I do like the way the colours compliment eachother and the way the levels ramp up makes the game really hard. The powerups are fun and interesting and overall the game is impressive.A game is nothing without its faults, It has a very strange screen resoulution, screaming that this is a phone game aswell, and personally i think the powerups came in rediculously frequently. I also think the bright colours may or may not hurt peoples eyes.In conclusion, if your looking for a game about popping pills, then you probably might need help, but this game is really fun arcade score attack and I'd advise considering this game.7/10"

This game is addicting and so fast paced.  There is a joy from swapping color to color at a high fast pace and the music though repetative keeps you jamming (only 3 music tracks).  There are nice checkpoints in the game 0-25-50-100 where once you reach them in the settings you can start off at any checkpoint.  Theres power ups to unlock which will help you in the later waves and 4 challenge levels involving a ton of pills falling at once to pills falling at lightining speed.

It's super enjoyable to blast pills, moving as fast as you can from one to the other. The soundtrack is also pretty good, it loops really well. However, there will be a large portion of you who don't like the game, so let me make a disclaimer. If you don't like dubstep, the reference to drugs, arcade style games, fast moving games, reflex tests, color/light shows, and an upgrade system that takes a hwile to unlock things, DON'T get this game.
