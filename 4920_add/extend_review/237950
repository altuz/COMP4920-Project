,Recommended,237950,8601455,"Posted: 6 January, 2014",all,Troublehalf,"Don't listen to Veggie, there is a tutorial. It teaches you the basics of moving in the tactical map... Which is... You know, pretty standard RTS fair, you know, Right-Click to move/attack.... Wait, that's it.As for the base part... Once again, dead simple to understand, perhaps if you've never ever played RTS's before you'd get confused, but it's not that hard at all. You put Researchers (Green Stat) into Labs and such, Technicans into Workshops and such, while using your Soldiers and Soldier + Tech/Research to fight.If you've ever played UFO/XCOM/XCOM:EU you're going to understand the entire thing from the get go. You set research, you set production, you then let time run. You then defend your territories (many of which hold resources, which, once again, is so simple, each node = 1 resource, so if you have 2 Metal Mines, you can build anything that requires 2 Metal Mines as many times as you want) and attack others. At which point you go into the combat mode. While it isn't turn based, you can pause the game to issue orders, similar to other games like Dragon Age: Origin. You then gather loot, which opens up more research options.Your NPC's all level up, Techs and Researches included. This is done by Soldiers via fighting battles, while for Tech + Researchers it is done by researching and producing/building. Every time a Soldier levels up, he gets a point to put into attributes, like Strength and Willpower (there are several) these stats in turn affect skills, like Aiming, Snap Shots, Manipulation, Charisma. Each attribute, when clicked, tells you want it improves and each skill tells you want it does. You also get Training Points to spend on various abilities, such as being able to Equip Heavy gear. As for non-combat NPC's, you can train them with Training Points too, these points go into things which help them speed up or improve various other things. Such as Research Speed or Production Speed.Hybrid's are interesting, such as Soldier + Researcher, as while they are not as dedicated as others, you often need Researchers/Techs to go with you on combat missions in order to get various things. Which of course give benifits. Not to mention, you're not only getting human NPC's, but Alien's too, which have their own Training Point abilities.The Conquest Map is pretty simple. You click areas to capture, then build stuff, which is all done automatically once ordered. If you get attacked, you're warned and a Red mark appears so you can click it and enter a fight to free it. If you expand far enough, you'll bounce into other races borders, at which point, you'll be able to invade their area and get their resources and such.Overall, it's a DIRT CHEAP game which has lots going for it. Combat is decent, lots to research and upgrade, specific NPC's talk and argue with each other over stuff to do. It's enjoyable for the price and I recommend it to anybody who likes XCOM:EU/XCOM/UFO series, or perhaps Xenonauts. For £5.50, it isn't bad at all.I also believe there were two prequels to this, UFO: Aftermath and UFO: Aftershock, both set in the same universe at different points in time.Aftermath is fighting the AliensAftershock is the rebellionAfterlight is truce and leaving for MarsI think. Can't remeber this late."

But compared to this one, the latest XCOM is a little bit more board-game like and Afterlight is a little bit more complex without overstrain the gamer.You'll like this game, if:- you liked the most recent XCOM but looking for a more complex XCOM/UFO game- you like strategy games generally- you like squad-based strategy games with RPGs elements such as Jagged Alliance, Fallout TacticsYou'll probably don't like this (so I was told), if you're looking for an first hour XCOM successor or can't overlook the outdated graphics.Let's get more detailed:Afterlight is ""more"" real time like XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Let's say there is an enemy attack on one of your territories you have e.g. 3 days to react. In the mean time you can keep on training or squad (which takes time actually), keep on with the production and so on if you need to do so. The opportunity of the attack doesn't vanish if you ignore it just to do one day more of research or you need additional time for producing a item (that is instantly ready in XCOM: Enemy Unknown).Also your scientists and technicians you take on a mission (which is quite a good idea because of some bonuses) are not available at your base and since getting to an attack spot needs a bit time it is important to manage well your base, squads and as well as the equipment.In combat it reminds me a lot to Jagged Alliance. You just can't spray and pray on an enemy if one of your squadees is in line of sight because the travel distance is actually calculated instead of simple numbers on hitting a target or not hitting like in the latest XCOM. The odds are showed to you so you know what are the chances of hitting own soldiers, in such case, or the enemy.The combat system is very transparent and is comparable to Jagged Alliance Back in Action (pausable real time with each individual plan for any squad member). I don't want to bad mouth the newest XCOM. I still love it and it features much better graphics, innately better customization possibilities for your soldiers and it is more user friendly (interface, micro- & macromanagement) and feels just ""more modern"".This games got me hooked right from the beginning that many games aren't able to nowadays so you probably should get it."

76561198052577107,Recommended,237950,11329331,"Posted: 20 July, 2014",all,Softis,"I've played both XCOM:EU/EW And UFO:AL for a significant ammount of time now, but I like Afterlight better overall.The depth of the game easily rivals if not outright defeats XCOM. The weapons can be modified with various attachments and ammunitions, and there are dozens of weapons, most of which are still useful by mid-lategame. Equipment loadouts range from weapons to inventory including spare magazines and more weapons or tools.It also does not burden you with pre-selected classes and equipment restrictions [Which cost me quite a few XCOM:EW playthrough attempts] since all your crew are capable of the same training and skills [Though alien teamates have different training from humans], which are also more indepth than XCOM. You can train military personell to run faster, damage specific species better, use heavy weapons/suits, or handle weapons faster to name a few categories.In XCOM's strategic play, you have to manage your money, alien resources, and research projects while scanning for alien ships. In Afterlight, you also have to attack and seize territory, and decide who to be friends with. Will you create lasting friendships or do eye their territories, looking for more land and resources?The game also has lasting consequences and effects. Team members aren't generic soldiers who happen to be a notch above the rest of millions. You've got a colony and a couple-dozen people to staff it, and those who die are gone, they aren't cloned or replaced, just dead.On that topic, terraforming [Because thats an obvious goal, right?] has visible overtime effects that ever-slowly escalate visibly on both tactical and strategic play. As terraforming carrys on over the days, you'll see the world turn green with blue slowly, and tactical maps will gain plants and grass graphics too. On top of that, more overgrown areas tend to have lower environmental hostility ratings for tactical battles.The biggest upside it has, Afterlight's action is real-time with pausing and planning rather than XCOM's turn-based action. Running head-on into previously undetected enemies or missing a shot is no longer a death sentance for your troops, though avoiding the former is still advised. Realtime action and positioning all play a role, where a sniper lying prone on a cliffside can spot enemies and clear them out quickly, and cover is less important and less of an invasive mechanic [though when you get the chance, use it]. Stealth is also an option, with smaller suits, stealthy movement training and silencers all present and accounted for. In a rescue mission, I snuck into the camp, and extracted my target without having to kill more than 2 or 3 enemies patrolling that area.Although Afterlight is in many respects more realistic than XCOM, it still has downsides. The graphics aren't up-to-date and the dialogue switches tones and word-accents [You'll see what I mean if you watch videos with story dialogue.] The most invasive bugs such as the ""Green Grid Error"" as I call it where most of the map in tactical battles covered with green grid squares. [There is no explanation at all for these grids. Could they have something to do with graphical errors related to terraforming? I think it's an unknown error with my settings but who knows?]"

It has pausable real-time combat like X-COM: Apocalypse. You aren't able to recruit new team members so you basically have to do a mission restart if one of your guys gets killed (although you can have robots on your team and build more robots). Difficulty spikes a couple of times as game throws larger numbers of increasingly powerful enemies at you, but they basically just rush you with no special tactics or real coordination between enemies. The game also generates TONS of tactical missions, there are about 100 regions on Mars with missions to capture every one, enemies counter attack generating defense missions, and the tac missions are fairly repetitive with you taking the same squad/equipment on a dozen or more missions between upgrades. The game does a poor job of keeping you updated as to where you are and what you are doing and the tactical camera went nuts on me a couple of times in the Martian underground. Also the game sometimes hangs for 1-2 minutes while pathfinding in the tactical game."

,Recommended,237950,31487254,Posted: 1 May,all,Lord Deviant,"UFO: Afterlight is a twist on the old X-COM games. In addition to the research, production, and tactical battles of the X-COM series, it adds an interesting story along with the need to capture territories and gather resources. Personally, I feel the real-time aspect of the battles makes strategy almost non-existant (at least for me), and the 3D graphics can make controlling the battlefield difficult at times. However, you can freely pause the game, which allows you to strategize and adjust the camera as needed."

,Recommended,237950,12124448,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,RockstarCRO,"This game is an interesting one to say the least. I thought it was a XCOM : Enemy Unknown knockoff but I got something different, and different was good to me this time.This game I would consider real-time, however it has it's moments of turning into a turn based game. The difference here there is no set square you have to go on, and you are in control of when time stops. Being in control of time at first was annoying, as I didn't know why the game kept pausing on me. When I figured it out I found it brilliant : the game pauses after you have moved one of your players/gunners into position. Why is this neat? Well this ensures you have COMPLETE CONTROL over tactical positioning - literally ensuring that you know what enemies are in site or when someone is in position. The neat thing about this game is that you can tell your gunners exactly where to proceed. This is phenomenal when you want your gunners to stay and move near cover instead of cutting through the middle of the map (which easily ends up being spotted, getting shot at just for trying to get to cover). That was just the battle portion of the game, there is a strategy portion to it. They tried to nail every single detail they could and it seems they have. When you move your players and try to shoot at an enemy, it shows the chance % you have of hitting the target.You have a limited amount of gunners/civilians you can use and assign them to different positions (research, resources, military etc...). You are bound to a planet in which you may take certain territories which contain certain resources. From this tactical perspective you can build or add modules to your main colony building, allocate resources, choose what to research, modify and customize your assault teams, attempt to take a new territory, or send your military units off in your UFO spaceship to go deal with conflict (be it controlling new territory or defending a sector you have. One mission consists of defending your water supply line for example. Upon finishing missions, you are able to take back spoiled goods. Careful though, you cannot over cumber the UFO as it can become too heavy to fly. Keep your fuel levels in check as well or don't expect to get to the fight!For future UFO Afterlight Developments : having a few varying maps would be nice. It was sort of refreshing to see the glacier tile on one of the maps, but generally looking at orange got a bit boring. I know we are on a big red planet but don't be afraid to add something! More importantly, I hope that some sort of ""reaction"" button is added. Watch sort of works but doesn't trigger the characters to fire on site. What would be even cooler would be adding a FPS camera in which you could control a unit. The game is extremely efficient in it's planning steps that I could see potential for FPS to run smoothly.This game is bigger than I anticipated when I first bought it and am still exploring what it has to offer. So far of what I see I like as I've never played something like this before. For that reason it gets a .1 addition to it's score from a 7.9. If it had a multiplayer feature, the rating would have increased again.RATING : 8.0/10.GameplayBStory / CampaignBVisuals / User InterfaceC+Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityB-OverallB-Generally staying at a higher ground gives you an advantageOne thing you need to be aware of is friendly fire.

A bit like Knights of the Old Republic, which, in my opinion was good because of this dynamic, just as MassEffect2 was unmade by loss of it. IT has a lot going for it but ultimately I would recommend it only as a steam sale curiosity.PROS:The gameplay mechanic is the strongest aspect of the game. It lacks a little polish but I love the idea, and I think it has tremendous potential. A compelling concept, with an albeit slightly rough around the edges, but unique and distinctly old-school art style that more than makes up with freshness wht it lacks in polish. A likeable cast of characters  that gives you that Sci-Fi novel feeling.CONS:Unfortunately, while the art and core gameplay are very good, the metagame in most of its aspects lacks the element of strategy, and becomes a tedious afterthought. The technological and base-building progression that is such a satisfying and powerful drive in games like X-COM: Enemy Unknown, has been designed and balanced haphazardly. The important aspect that makes it strategic and good is that you should understand what your goals are, and what paths lead to them, so that the choice you have to make are meaningful. UFO: Afterlight has a pretty byzantine management game which just kind of drags on and you have no idea how well or poorly you are doing nor are you given any clear objectives. You research stuff, make stuff and aside from guns and medpacks you have no idea what you should be doing. Also after a little while you encounter enemies that are completely unbalanced , which kind of destroys the inmersion as you run around for an hour kiting a single enemy with your whole team, after every other type alien had been killed long ago ibn a more or less fitting tactical fashion.  I'M LOOKING AT YOU, GAME ""DESIGNERS"".In short, like I said, Steam Sale Curiosity"

The features of the game are very similar to Aftershock and Aftermath, so if anyone had played those, you won't have any problems with the Interface. To the resolution problem there is a clear fix, if someone has problems with it, but I am not here to tell you how to fix stuff, but rating the game. The game might seem VERY difficult, but if you know how to play (For Example setting up Killboxes, hit & running and many other interesting tactics with the help of Technologies helps you out a lot) it ain't that hard anymore.UFO: Afterlight has some very new features which the games before didn't have for example building stations, and not gather resources with ♥♥♥♥ing roads, which had my rage counter held up in UFO: Aftershock and Aftermath. Also here you have to assign Scientists and Ingeneers to their buildings in order to even do something.The fights haven't really changed, you use the same Techniques like in the previous games, but the enemies can make you change your way of fighting with knowing where you are with devices, which you can counter by technologies. There are enemies, which can wipe your squad out, when you're rushing them without certain weapons and Level of the Peeps.Here is another new Mechanic, called Terraforming. You see, before you start a mission you can see how dangerous would it be for suits, and If your terraforming progress is far up, you don't really need to worry about the dangers for them.Now the only problem is Savescamming; you can play without it, but I had more fun with Savescamming than with normally playing the game, as i could Design Strategies to Finish one mission and Complete another one Much easier knowing what can happen from the previous experience.The difficulty is also at it's highest point at the 3/4th of the game, it's the point where NOTHING can happen anymore if you could handle one mission from there with ease without savescamming.So Altar games had done a VERY good job making the game differ from the Previous parts of the game.The game was well worth it's money, It was worth each Cent I've spent on the game, I don't regret any second that I bought the game for 7€9,5/10 (as the game has SOME points where i had a bad experience from it, however after a time i think those would've not been if i would've played better)"

76561197999103145,Recommended,237950,8689561,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Theodore Roosevelt,"I played UFO: Afterlight in the time between the announcement of and release of XCOM Enemey Unknown. When I first purchased it, I treated it almost like a surrogate. But as I played it, and even more now after having played the new XCOM, I really feel that UFO: Afterlight has some points that distinguish it and make it a good game in its own right.That said, it's not a perfect game. The interface is annoying, and the pausable real time combat can be frustrating at times. I hate loosing an important character to an interface misclick, a pathing issue, not being able to navigate levels effectively, or not being able to react to enemy fire in time.But, when the chips are down, Afterlight was the most memorable of all the X-com-ish games that I have played. Why? Character. When you start the game, your roster of characters isn't randomly generated like in XCOM. Instead, you have the handful of members of a mars colony on the edge of survival. Characters have family relations, friendships, and history. Loosing a character on the battlefield means so much more when you know that that characters brother was right beside her, or that her mother is waiting back at base. The stories that unfold as you train your characters and send them on missions has much more impact when you see them as real poeple.The focus on characters extends to base management as well. Base management is an important part of the game, and much more developed than in Xcom: EU/EW. But in order to construct buildings, explore new territories, or do research, you need characters. Need to send a character with engineering skill to repair a pipeline? Do you send your best engineer, or do you hold him in reserve because he has combat skills? Do you reserve your quickest rover pilots for ferrying combat missions or explorations? That sort of thing. And while there are ways of getting new characters as the game progresses, this system means that losing a combat medic in the field may have drastic side effects for your research efforts at home.Technological development also feels more substantial in comparisons. Weapons have attachments, and there are many varieties of space suit that you can equip your people with. Space suits effect movement and stances, meaning that people in large, heavily armored suits may not be able to run or go prone, and people in light suits will be faster and stealthier.Overall, combat is the area that I think the game is the weakest (besides the voice acting. Its not the worst in the world, but it can be annoying at times). It is real time pausable, which sort of works, but because characters have very little in the way of AI, it means that inattention can be very fatal. There is a good enough variety of enemy types, equipment options, skills and maps to keep me interested throughout most of the game, but by the end I was starting to feel that it was a bit repetitive. Worse, sometimes failure feels cheap and frustrating, especially when you grow attached to characters.To conclude, I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something like XCOM: EU/EW but with a little more depth and character. As I said earlier, its not a great game, but it was memorable and fun. And at less than 10 dollars for a full games worth of playing time, its worth a try."

It definitely looks too much anime, but plays nice.You comand a human colony on Mars and have to face of few types of enemies each coming with various ranks and gear.As most XCOM/UFO it is divided to base comand and tactical comand.On base comand you manage people and what they are doing (healing, training, building, researching etc). You have few resources to manage.On tactical level you take team to action in real-time with pause combat. Combat is quite detailed. Your troops have some limited space for gear depending from armors you have, you have few weapon types (heavy, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shortguns, etc). You can also build and operate drones which can mount an impresive amount of weapons (like up to 4 miniguns / rocket launchers) or be very tanky with like 80/90% resistance to all kinds of damage.Tactical combat is nice up to the point when you start running into Beastmen Matriarchs as they have like 90% of dodge of everything coming their way while packing masive guns themselves.While training your squad you will create some classes of troops (some will learn to use heavy guns, some sniping and some will learns to use explosives and repair/healing stuff).This game is 5 years older than XCOM, so there is no cover, but your troops can hide behind terrain to ambush enemies (or be ambushed), they can change stance to kneel or lie down to increase accurancy and reduce chance to be hit.I can recommend to all waiting for XCOM2 to to get on some discount or a bit more bug-free."

I prefer providing individual unit orders in turns rather than the ""stop time and give everyone orders"" strategy.   The game can drag on so I find myself making decisions based on how long it takes to give out orders rather than what is tactically smart.Initially the tech tree was incredibly confusing.   I had to research and find detailed descriptions for how to produce sniper rifles and shotguns.   In-game you have no idea what you need to be able to research something new.   (Which might be realistic)  There is very little activity on forums or walkthroughs.  The most annoying part of the game was that when I finished a technology the game doesn't tell you what you researched or how it would help you.  I couldn't remember what I was researching so I wasn't sure if I needed to reequip or build something new.After 35 hours of playtime I got to the point where the missions were getting harder but the remainder of the tech tree wasn't going to help me."

The strategic game is entertaining -- you always feel like you're short on something.  Base management, research, and manufacturing is cleanly done.The tactical game is poorly developed.  The first few missions are nearly identical, and overall the challenge is to find a good place to stand while the bad guys charge at you.  There's a wide variety of armor, most of which you won't have a use for.  It seems like they tried to accommodate a wide variety of play styles, but the tactical game isn't really deep enough to warrant more than stand-here-shoot-there.Overall it was interesting enough that I wanted to get to the end, but I have zero interest in playing it again.

76561197963778820,Recommended,237950,10504690,"Posted: 17 June, 2014",all,gRoUiKgRoUiK,"Summary:Anhardcore gamer-oriented and enjoyable game for those who appreciated UFO-like gamesand don't pay too much attention to graphics.Research, characters design, story-telling, and ressource management are nice. RPG aspects are average.Interface, tactical aspects, game balance, and graphics are desappointing(not completely bad though).Gameplay:- The focus is put on ressource management and research. There isa wide range of technologies to discover, and as other people already mentionned, you don't have a 'technological tree' to guide you but I think it's part of the roleplay and not a problem at all.- There isa world to explore, which is nice at the beginning butgets repetitiveand therefore boring after some time.- Thetactical aspects of the game are desappointing. This is a shame becauseweapons are varied and nicely designed, and have a great impact on combats, but the tactical game is almost ruined by a poorly concieved interface and some problems in game bablance (ie: some weapons or tactics are overpowered, while some other are useless).Interface:As you can expect from a UFO-like game, you can control many aspects of the game,  But as already mentionned about the tactical interface, the global map ('strategical') interface is  also poorly concieved. It takes some time to understand where the useful buttons are hidden, and even when you know the interface, it still isa pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to use.RPG:-Characters design is well done. Like in Jagged Alliance, you get attached to some of your characters. There voices are nice too.- You have access to many skill options, which enables to build very differents characters, but only a small part of those skills are useful.Story:The story is interesting but not amazing, and you can make some (limited) choices that have some impact on events.Game balance:- I think it'sone of the major drawback's of this game: it looks like all the ingredients for a great UFO-like game where available, but the dev team didn't have time to perform the last tuning.- For example, there are too many alien attacks, and even if you completely dominate them in combat and/or world domination, they still attack you very often and it gets very annoying. It consumes time without adding any fun to the game.- Other examples : some items are completely useless, hybrid character classes are too powerful compared to regular classes, some weapons are overpowered (I mean, really), conquering the planet and building stations takes too much time, ...Conclusion: in spite of the many flaws in this game, you'll probably want to get to the end because you get immersed in this universe.I would advise this one to UFO-like fans, but NOT to other players."

In this one, we enter a story where the original game was lost; instead of kicking our enemies off Earth, for some reason we allowed our enemies to take over our planet and cover it with some kind of mutant biomass. That's a part of the over-arching story you'll be briefly introduced to as you march your little soldiers over the surface of Mars, cutting yourself out a new home after having been dispossessed of your old one.The graphics are a little old, but each weapon, including the customizations, can be seen in their tiny form during battles, and your soldiers' faces appear clearly behind their helms. The game's tutorials can be annoying, and the constant reminders by the helpers in each screen, giving you information you can't really use, is downright frustrating.Unlike most X-COM clones, this game feels like it's especially built to be played in small bites. Battles are intense, but brief, and the whole thing consists of a lot of peaceful waiting, or tense waiting, as the rampaging beastman hordes threaten to swallow everyone whole.Overall, I like the game. Fun, keeps you occupied for enough hours, and you get to watch your characters improve more significantly than in the original series' entries. There are also a lot of nifty, hidden entries and situations that require a bit of caution, planning, or just dumb luck, and getting a new character under better circumstances than your last playthrough is extremely rewarding."

Overall a great game for those that enjoy the UFO or X-Com inspired games and series.the graphics are nice and enjoyable, with funny characters as well as a rarther challenging combat/management system if you increase it so. It also have the option to modifiy whats hard: so in a sense you can make the combat impossible but management easy or opposite to suit your taste,Single Base with automated stationsYou have 1 base where your characters live, they can improve the base, train, manufacture items and research new technology. However you need to build Automated Stations, Terraforming Plants and more to increase your Sphere of Influence on the map, enemies can attack these stations if they succede you lose your area or even die if it is a vital location like water.Enviromental ThreatThe planet is very hostile to human life and the humans need Suits, Light or Heavy armors to surive. The Enviromental threat is very important if this threat is higher than your suit or armor has in enviromental protection the suit will break and you will take damage over time. Either you abort the mission or you hurry to compleat the mission. In the start of the game my suggestion is to get metal 3 and get the first heavy armor as it has great enviromental protection, overall combat survivability the only downside is that it requires a total of 3 soldier talent points to learn how to wear it.EconomyThe game has no income of money or possibility to buy like other x-com or ufo inspired games, however instead you build automated mining stations that give you the resources you need. To build items you require a set level of the resource, so if you have Metal 3 you can make Heavy Armors that are great to face trouble at a higher enviromental threat.DiplomacyThe game has a very easy diplomacy system and several factions, some are constantly hostile, others require the proper research or being hostile to a rival faction. Having Alliances will give you access to non-human allies that can among otherthings use Psionic Powers that can stun enemies for easy capture, but so can the stun grenade so it isnt the end of the world.Class SystemThe classes are divided in 3, The Soldier, The Scientist and The Engineer. Some characters has 2 classes.To use in combat they have to be soldiers, It is important to quickly take a Soldier Scientist and Soldier Engineer into your main party to make them have a good soldier level for later. The Scientist Soldier is the only one that can heal in combat with the First Aid tool and the engineer gets access to powerful weapons that no one else can use aka Warp Cannon, this weapon has a wooping 999 in damage output and anything standing infront of that blast is dead. In addition the engineers can repair suits or armors (and droids if you choose to use them)Pure Scientist or Scientist/Engineer are used to research tech and construct some of the various overworld buildings.Pure Engineer or Scientist/Engineer are used to produce weapons, armors and ammo, overworld resource buildings and base buildings. Scientist/Engineers work best as scientist in the start and get used for manufacture and such later in the game when you are done researching or lacking things to research."

Only buy it if you have a lot of time available. Really. The combats are certainly challenging as the main enemies have a wide troop variety that poses many problems at once. If you are interested in this series then I'd suggest playing the older (but shorter) Aftermath first, skip Aftershock, then play Afterlight."

It was sooo awesome. I played Aftershock and Afterlight, and later played them on Steam. They are constantly driving you to do more, to research more, to plan ahead, strategically and tactically. Specialize your team, train them, lose some of your soldiers and grieve for them. This game... makes it personal. YOU are on Mars, YOUR teams have to research and produce, fight, conquer and expand YOUR territory, YOU train them, YOU take care of them, and it is YOU who lose soldiers in battles.Just those damn Reticulans from Expedition give you soldiers but no armour."

There are some significantly limiting factors that are removed from game play, such as good resource management and the character handling/advancement is just clunky. Combat is okay but is very steep. The learning curve is high, but completely different from the original X Com. It's worth playing through, and is significantly better than most alien games, but still doesn't live up to X Com"

I personaly rly liked the mars enviroment. Combination of global game mode and tactical is working preaty well.Concession: Sometimes u play one map several times but this is balanced by terraforming. If u chose bad science projects things can go really wrong and game will not have mercy with you :)"

This is the third installment in the ""UFO: After..."" series, and having played the first two, I think the most polished.Strategy and Tactical play, with same research concept as X-com games. Good storyline.  The game is very in-depth, yet manageable. Lots of menus to help navigate, and a decent tutorial.  There are several user-created mods which help increase enjoyability. A link can be found on the Afterlife website, so they *are* promoting these mods!Graphics are good on 1080x1920 with lots of filters to make adjustments as needed for any system.  I don't recall the battles being too difficult, any you can save at anytime. Camera is zoomable for up close action, and angle. May take a bit of adjustment to figure out all the controls, and totally worth it.One of those ""one more mission"" games that will keep you up past your bedtime.The few negative things I can recall were ""cured"" with a mod or two. Check them out."

,Recommended,237950,34302314,Posted: 17 August,all,Fazzan,It has more strategic depth than most games in this category. (Don't confuse strategy with tactics please). For me it does have great replayability
