76561198004519882,Recommended,237970,14227926,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,dadel,"Quite a good adventure with a good script (except Chapter 1), plot twists, some original and inovative puzzles and long gameplay time (over 20 hours). I am a Czech patriot (the game is from Czech republic) and give thumb up. And now the negatives:- first chapter is the worst and easily expendable. Do not get discouraged, be patient- various bugs (misplaced subtitles, different voices)- long loading screens (even if you hit ESC and press Continue game ! )- some unnecessary and stupid puzzles whose sole purpose is to make game longer. Fox example, you need scissors and you cannot just buy them, you must repair a hose and use it to hit flowerpot on 1st floor with scissors in it! Or you must print a page, but toner is depleted and you must replace it (wtf). Or you need white paint and even though your character is a painter, you are out of white (what a shame) and you have to find it elsewhere."

Also, whoever played the first game knows how bloody awful was the majority of the game voiceovers and how sloooooow was the actual way the game introduced you into the story.Luckily, Memento Mori 2 has a brand new voice actress for Lara which did the job perfectly. The gameplay is good with puzzles that tie into the story very nicely with no random stuff to do just to prolong game time. The story this time is much better than the first game (at least to me) and it really builds up nicely up to that final moment when you find the murderer and the whole reason behind the events in this game. There are a lot of locations all over the globe you'll visit, and lots of characters to talk to.I only encountered a few audio bugs with strange vocal morphing or random ""radio/telephone"" filters on characters that were clearly infront of me - but apart from that, it's a very enjoyable game that I would recommend in a heartbeat!It will take you at least 12-15h to finish the game and that's for a single ending only. There are several occasions where the choices you make impact the ending of the game so it even has a replay value."

The puzzles are more challanging, it dropped the dumbing-down cursor indicating if two items are compatible (so you have to actually try them), the story has a better pace and the game has a great way of screwing your expectations of what is going on. You can also get the two main different endings by a choice that comes up very late in the game (I could see how some may not consider this as an improvement but I dont think many people replayed the whole MM1 to get another ending, it doesnt have much of a replayability potential). On the other hand, some twists are really obvious and there are many unfortunate problems with dubbing. It seems that they recorded some parts of dialogues separately and it sometimes sounds as if one character was voiced by two different actors (maybe there is just a weird echo that deforms the voices). Also, some lines, especially Keira's, come up in wrong dialogues. It was kinda awkward when she yelled WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, SHOOT in the middle of a normal talk."

This has something to do with the area where game autosaves.EDIT: so main menu stays black but you can blindly click the ""continue"" and carry on the game.I happily played to chapter 4 and today misclicked ""start new game"".So autosave is now back in chapter 1.I'm done. I'm so done. Damn this game and damn the autosaves to lowest hell.This IS a decent game but now I just want to give it superdislike."
76561197999015663,Recommended,237970,29726096,Posted: 5 February,all,Aros,"Well... I say YES, but I perfectly understand those who say NO. This one is just very inconsistent.First of all, the atmospehere of the game is absolutely brilliant and the czech studio certainly did their job very well. Also the graphics look very nice (I mean the level of detail and the post processing effect add nicely to the overall feel of the game). I have probably never seen so good looking an adventure game. And... this is a game from 2008 which seems incredible to me. That's nearly 10 years old a game and you just wouldn't tell by the graphis.Now to the cons:- dialogs. I am going to talk about English version, don't know about the others. Sorry, but the technical solution is just a disaster. It's not that it would be silly, would not make sense or anything. It's just that it seems they did not even test it at all. The level volumes do not match... Very often one person speaks much louder than the other. And you need to adjust the volume a lot during the dialogs to make anything out of it. Also some lines are completely missing (you see the subtitles but there is no sound), sometimes the subtitles say something completely different that what is being said. In other words the lines are misplaced... Often you hear something much sooner during the dialog than you should, and then later something they were probably supposed to tell you earlier. I just do not understand how is it possible nobody noticed. And it's not a rare thing actually, there is this problem in most of the dialogs. What strikes me the most is the at the very end of the game there is a dialog where you don't hear what one of the characters says. It's voice is so low and completely lost in the music. I thought that this must be some rare bug, beacuse clearly this was meant to be the pinnacle of the game, the final scene... And... you dont hear it. And guess what. They just made it that way. You can watch the endings at youtube and the thing is that that's just the way it is made.Also sometimes during a dialog or even a monolog, the voice of a character (it's not just about the main char.) changes in a very strange way that I am almost sure that it's a different person speaking. They probably needed to make some rush adjustments in the end and they just didn't have the original voice actors. I can't explain it otherwise.- there is a vary annoying menu bug that prevents you from entering menu at certains locations (meaning you cannot save) and also sometimes it is even impossible to launch the game if the last save is at one of those locations (I know I said you cannot save in them... Well, sometimes it works it's really not that deterministic)... Sometimes restarting the computer helps, sometimes it doesn't. I really had a hard time just trying to launch the games on many occasions.- there is obviously some kind of bug that causes line endings not to work in all the documents you find in the game. The problem is that the structure of these documents is essential in solving some of the puzzles, but the documents become almost unreadable as a result of this bug, which makes some of the puzzles many times harder.Some more things I'd like to point out:Detective rating. This is a briliant idea. Really. But well.. the implementation is bad. Very bad. The problem is that you get rewarded for some actions (not necessary for the advancement in the story) like touching things on crime scene only wearing gloves and not your hands, finding out some additional information and so on, BUT you cannot do much more important things that are OBVIOUS in the given situation. Oh common, they must have seen this during the development. So in the end, it is about not about what is a good detective approach but whether you can find out, what the devs consider a good aproach. Wasted potential unfortunately...Items combinations. Well I liked the original Memento Mori game bacause the things you did in the game made sense. I cannot say this about it's successor. Very often you have to do things that make absolutely no sense in the sitatuion. It's OK if you force the players in two unusual solutions of problems. But hey, first you need to remove the obvious and simple means from the game. And the game absolutely fails in this way. Like having to cut something using glass shards when there's a knife lying on the table. Or having to steal a spray can from the people you are bout to break in to, so that you can finish your disguise that is going to help you in that, when you are actually a painter and have a lot of paint on your own... And so on.Puzzles. Many of the puzzles are poorly designed. In some of the cases you don't know what to do and need to try to see how it works. And you solve it by chance after few clicks before you even grasp what it is about. On the other hand there were 2 puzzles that were driving me nuts. The first one I solved very quickly on a paper but, I was desperate as how to explain my character that I actually know the solution. In other words sometimes the game is often not about your wits but about... ""What the hell do the devs expect me to do?"" The second puzzle I really didn't like was badly designed in a way that it clearly explained the rules, but than you had to break them, which is really not what you would expect. I don't want to spoil here so I will not tell anything more.Characters models. There are very few characters models in the whole game. Sometimes you meet one character three times during the game with different clothes, which feels... odd. But what really got me is that they even reused the main character model (different clothes and... sunglasses) which really confused me, because I realy thought it was him and was expecting how the things would turn out since he was obviously in disguise...If I were to summarize my opinion, I'd say two words. Wasted potential. This game could have been so much more! And I feel sorry for it because it is a brilliant concept held down by some details... Well, as the game would so often remind you: ""It is all about the detail"". Just why did you not heed your own advice?"

I am a die hard adventure gamer and find it to be mediocre in all aspects. Puzzles are easy, graphics are dated, mechanics are cumbersome and the voice acting is second rate. The game is not worth $20 IMO."

I was surprised by the strong story with nice twists, sweet puzzles and especially the amount of hours this game will keep you entertained for...Had this game on a sale for a low amount but the price was definately worth it!The voice acting is also excelent, something which is often badly done by other click/search adventures, throughout the game there is a constant and very defined atmosphere which I also found in part 1, nice :)Highly recommended for puzzlers!"

I also appreciated its length and character development, important features which have lately made games like Broken Age or Moebius kind of a letdown."
,Recommended,237970,11603660,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,aeonfluxx75,"I really enjoyed this game as I have been waiting for the US translation and release for quite some time.  The voice acting, dubbing and script (for most of Max's and Lara's interactions) is a dreadful miss on all points and the character animation at times is a bit wacky (Mainly with Lara) and finally, due to multiple endings, the story can feel a bit disjointed or anti-climatic.  Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it.  Aesthetically, it's a gorgeous game, even though there was lack of facial expressions.  For the wait, I would've really liked less linearity and of course, a longer game.  It's quite short, with determination and no disturbances one could finish this in a day or weekend."

Things such as sound dissapperaring during dialogs and Lara having a different voice every now and again that really distracted you from the plot.If it wasnt for the interesting story, interesting characters, nice artwork, music and having played the first game I think i would have struggled to complete the game but as it is if you can put those issues aside you will be rewarded with a very nice adventure game about love and death."

It tries, sure, but it is glitchy and buggy and ultimately just not fun. The game's opaque logic and long♥♥♥♥♥transit times between scenes basically enforce the usage of a walkthrough, and at that point why bother. The one thing I liked was that the minigame puzzles were usually pretty interesting and innovative, and it felt like I was solving real puzzles rather than trying to find whatever bizzare logic the game's creator decided should be the solution for an arbitrary challenge.Also I know this is petty, but if the game is set in a city that the characters can roam freely about, why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to solve a 7 piece item puzzle to make a jurry rigged socket wrench when I could just go to a hardware store and buy one. It was a sloppy excuse for a puzzle, and this game is full of them."

Poor translations and varying speeds in the playback of the voice acting are at once  charming and off-putting.  Subtitles and dialogue are often hilariously mismatched. Broken menus and a faulty save system paired with random crashes make this frustrating.  The game autosaves when changing to new locations (not every screen as some have suggested.)The ""detective points"" system is back, but good luck applying any logic to some of the choices or figuring out what NOT to do in some cases. (e.g. Better take a picture of that handprint on the post (with the correct light) before ""looking"" at it, or be docked several points later without even knowing why, because an automatic cutscene has been initiated for clicking on it...)If you can tolerate any of the annoyances, you will find a deep mystery story and a detective mechanic that is fun and rewarding.  Graphics are great and much care and attention went into the many locations."
