,Recommended,238050,11009143,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,zone,"These Blake Stone games are cool stuff if you wanna see where first-person shooters were between Wolfenstein and Doom (in particular shortly after Wolfenstein, since this uses the same engine while managing to look a bit more detailed and feel slightly more ""alive"" with NPC/enemy behavior).  Some of the monsters share a screeching sound effect with aliens in X-Com and so those games are forever linked in my mind.  Rise of the Triad is interesting, too, being a 1994 (or 1995 for the full version) game planned as a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, even using a heavily modified version of that game's engine well after the release of Doom...!"
,Recommended,238050,12315862,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,sarysa,"I liked it. I was too poor back in the day to have anything more than the shareware version of ROTT so this'll give me a chance to delve deeper into that title that I really loved. It's amazing how well it holds up today, once you change the control scheme to something more modern. (which is doable, though I had to substitute middle and right mouse buttons for look up and look down, which thankfully is seldom needed) ROTT has just about everything I like in a classic FPS: The fast movement speed, the exploration, the waves of mooks you get to mow down in droves with your superhuman prowess. But what I also enjoyed is the complete lack of realism, and the platforming which, unlike in the 2013 remake, you could more or less opt out of the more difficult platforming sections which only provided rewards like 3-ups. (I'm a bit unusual in that I like the platforming) I look forward to completing the game and subsequently getting destroyed by Extreme ROTT.One thing ROTT really has going for it is personality. There are so many little easter eggs to find, like the end-stage music when you finish a level in Dog Mode, the murderous game quit sequences, the ludicrous gibs, and so much more. You can tell the developers weren't making shovelware here, they made something that they can proudly affix their names onto.Blake Stone is a bit iffy at the moment. It was never on my radar in the 90's. Even though I grew up with the awkward Wolfenstein controls which were designed to be keyboard only, it will take time to reacquaint myself with those. Unlike ROTT, it's not possible to rig a typical modern keyboard and mouse FPS control scheme.It's not the game's fault at all -- it was the standard for everything, including DOOM, at the time. I do want to give it a shot, as it seems to have more complex objectives than the run-and-gun style of FPS that Wolfenstein was. It'll just take me time to prepare...I haven't used that control scheme since Quake in the late 90's, which I subsequently abandoned after getting annihilated by keyboard-mouse players. FPS controls aren't like a certain plumber whose controls have remained steady, with new moves merely added onto existing controls since the 80's. This difference is mainly due to the lack of mouse driver standardization back in the early 90's -- not to mention many people didn't even have a mouse back then. Trackballs were also strongly competing with the modern mouse in the early 90's, which justified the fact that pushing your mouse up moves your character forward. It wasn't until the late 90's and early 00's that FPS controls settled into what they are today."

,Recommended,238050,8058095,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,Kritikos,"It's worth getting this pack for Rise of the Triad alone. It's twice as intense as Doom and twice as difficult. The over-the-top weapons, high-speed platforming, and irreverent humor make for one hell of a classic FPS. The visuals are a little less impressive than Doom, which was released a year prior. This never came as a distraction to me and actually made the game feel a little more abstract, which lends to the memorability of the level design despite the repetitive textures. You'll get lost and frustrated, but the difficulty is balanced with playability, and that's what keeps a connoisseur of first-person shooters from giving up."

Awesome pack that comes with everything you need for a nice DOS 3D shooter revival. Feels like 1994 again :)  I suggest you take the files from the pack and use D-Fend reloaded as a DOS Box frontend because the preconfigured DOS box version in this pack isn't perfectly preconfigured (at least to my opinion).The pack comes even with original manuals as PDF files, soundtrack for ""Rise of the Triad"" and each game has a icon that comes in handy as a shortcut icon for the desktop or for the launcher menu of a DOS Box frontend. The original Adlib sound is included as well. Highly recommended if you want to legaly own and play these classics.The only downside: There is no Linux version for it, which means the pack won't appear as   installable under a Linux Steam Client, after you bought it."

But more of same.Rise of Triad is partly awesome and partly bad. Parts of fast action fun.

The Throwback Pack includes the original Rise of the Triad, and it's expansion Extreme Rise of the Triad. Both in their original glory, played through Dos Box.But what sold me on this was the inclusion of Blake Stone Aliens of Gold and it's lesser known successor, Planet Strike. Back in the days when Wolfenstein 3D ruled the FPS roster, Blake Stone was a refreshing diversion from the dark halls filled with Nazis and trips into hell. Leaning more toward an 80's sci fi horror FPS, Blake gave everything that Doom and Wolfenstien had, plus the introduction of food dispensers, and the ability to return to levels you had already visited to access areas you missed, or to top off your supplies.All in all, there is no reason that these should not be in your Steam library.

It makes many improvements as well as refines old ones. The shooting is still great and there are more weapons as well. They give you a map which is VERY helpful.  And you also get to go back to earlier levels at any time(you could restock or look for things you missed). You also have to think a bit more with your shots as well since scientists are scattered on every floor and can help you with info and even give you items, but you can shoot them. There are problems though. All the weapons use the same ammo, so some become worthless when you get other ones. The map is better than nothing but while it shows locked doors it doesn't show doors that open on one side only. And this led to me back tracking for nothing at times. It also doesn't show you where your facing in a room, but you can open the map a couple of times to get the idea. While having some npc's are a nice touch you can't tell which are good or bad(as some are enemies) and on higher difficulty levels you can get killed quick so it can make sparing a scientist very risky. Overall while not as remembered as wolfenstein 3d, it's a solid shooter that has aged better.7/10Blake Stone: Planet StrikeThe sequel to blake stone:alien gold takes what the first one did and improves it in almost everyway. There are more enemy types, more weapons,etc. The graphics while not leaps better, have a few new details and animation. The pacing is also much better. There are less keycards (three instead of five) and more of a focus on level design. The map is on your screen at all times which means you won't have to keep pulling up the map like in the first one. But it's more zoomed in so you may get lost a bit more, however I will take this over the last games setup. There are less levels(1/4th from the first one) but this is a case of quality over quanity as I can see going back to this one more. Not everything is better however, all the weapons still use the same ammo, leading to some weapons just filling up space. I also felt less satisfied with the ending than the first one. But overall, this was great and i'm glad I played it.9/10Rise Of The TriadROTT was orignally going to be the sequal to wolfenstein 3d and you can tell in many ways the game looks and plays(such as the ""triad"" being nazis and the levels looking limited since it uses the same engine). The action is quite intense and has plenty of weapons. This game is also very gory to almost mortal kombat-style over the top violence and it's done well. You also get choices in your character which can change your speed,defense,and attack, giving the game some variation. The map is the best in the pack and shows a lot of detail. But the map may not always help, as the levels are very large and that can make you lose track of where you are and it doesn't help that it uses the same level designs throughout making it hard know where you been or not. You are also limited to how many weapons you can take, Only one bullet based (which you can't swap out) and a powerful weapon(rockets or firewalls etc.). The game is made for this design choice but it can lead to fighting enemys that are resisting your bullets. Over all this is my favorite in the pack despite my complaints. It's fun, fast, over the top, and doesn't take itself seriously.9/10Extreme Rise Of The TriadThe expansion to ROTT. There are no new weapons or enemies to my knowlege, it's all brandnew levels and I must admit I didn't like this one much. Not to say there is no value here, this is far more difficult than ROTT and some may enjoy it. I found it, straining the gameplay and my patience way too much. I was getting lost very frequently and enemy placement and limited weapons made it difficult to enjoy. However I do think many fans will find something to like here. And it still has the gameplay that I enjoyed in the first one.6/10Overall I really enjoyed the game pack with all it's up's and downs. I fully recommend this to anyone who wants some classic shooters, I know I had a blast."

Rise of the Triad: Dark War is an old school First Person Shooter that started out as a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, but it turned into something else. You are fighting the Triad Cult with unlimited ammo in your SMG and Pistols, but you can also carry one rocket/missile based weapon or magic based weapon. There are also power ups that can turn you into God himself or an invincible dog with a VERY powerful bark. Then there are the power downs, shrooms mode makes you high and it is hard to shoot anything, and elasto mode makes you bounce all over the place.

Certainly, the throwback pack sounds like a good deal in theory, but once you play them all you see why it costs so little.The Blake Stone games are a bland, boring experience that offers little to distinguish itself from the glut of pre-Doom shooters. The controls are inadjustable, the levels show no variety, and the NPCs might as well be cardboard with the way they act. You'd have more fun playing a sci-fi themed Wolfenstein 3D mod.The Triad games, meanwhile, are exactly worth their price. Even today it still holds up for all the wacky ideas it crammed into the genre: where else can you fire drunken RPGs, earn high scores for destroying every decoration, and fly around the level as a yawning deity? It'd be madness to see such acts in a modern grimdark game.My advice: grab this collection strictly for Rise of The Triad and its bonus level pack. Even with the other crap attached, it's worth buying even as just a curio."

Case in point: the old Rise of the Triad and Blake Stone games. This was back when the name Apogee actually meant something.  I say it’s disappointing looking at myself because I’ve forgotten how to not WASD. See, back in the old days, you moved forward and backward and turned with the arrow keys, then had to hold down alt if you wanted to sidestep. It seems rather counter-intuitive if you’re used to the WASD system and it’s really hard to go back.Worse still, the games don’t make it much easier because the key bindings are hard to manipulate and often don’t want to work with the mouse. That said, IF you can manage to retrain your hands, this is a great set of nostalgia that shouldn’t be passed up. Maybe I can get the joystick to cooperate…hmmmm.  As it stands, though, I can't recommend this one simply because of the control style.  If you're still used to the old control style, go nuts."

The games that are included in thes package are go and sadly forgotten gems when It comes to classic MS-DOS PC gaming but one you play the epseically if yo are into this form of gaming you will certainly enjoy them even if they feel dated and sometimes unrealistic by todays standards. But if you are into just playing a game for a games sake then and yo are not looking for ultra realsim then these are the games that yo should definately ckeck out.

76561198106011053,Recommended,238050,11075905,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,RenegadePanda,"Years ago, people made games that were unapologetically stupid, crass, violent and never, ever serious.  ROTT is everything you could ever want in a video game, and more, though the shooters of today may have you believe otherwise.  Run around, shoot stuff, maybe turn into a dog, sometimes God, and one time a bouncy ball person.  It's still one of the best shooters out there and you owe it to yourself to play it.Blake Stone is also quite good, think Wolf 3D but with aliens, and scientists you can hold up for money, and lasers.  It's admittedly a bit hard going back to after all these years, but it's (and ROTT too) just as fun as I remember it.  Both games are bundled with their expansions/sequels, so that's great if you never got a chance to play them.  They're also playable right out of the gate, widescreen and all, with none of the tweaking needed for some of the other DOSBox versions you may find.Complaints?  It's DOSBox so the Steam overlay doesn't work correctly with it, other than that, some annoyances like the lack of an autosave and mouselook retain, but they're so insignificant they barely merit a mention."

Doom was definitely better but I have fond memories of ROTT.  The multiplayer was fun and I bet it was funner with 11 people.  Doom only allowed 4.  The graphics I'd say might have been better than doom and it just had it's own thing going for it.  Good graphics, good music and sound.  Overall pretty good level design too.  Not too sure about it's replay value though and it's engine limitations are pretty bad, even for it's time.  Basically this is a really advanced WOLF3D engine.  Good arcade shooter and worth a try if money isn't an issue, just remember it's a really old game.  NOW, with that said...*Blake Stone/Planet Strike -are a bit different.  They ARE WOLF3D engine games and probably the best ones.  Back in the day I felt Blake Stone was too corny, but now I love that about it.  It's style definitely has charm.  It has a colorful 70's style to it, everyone seems to have sideburns!  Lol.  Great graphics (amusing), awesome sounds and music and gameplay.  I love the variety of enemies.  It's very arcade and old school.  The addition of a good minimap makes all the difference and it's fun to collect the bonuses.  Planet Strike refined all that and added more features.  Hard to critique old games because by now we've seen this all but for what it's worth it is a very well done game(s)."

Thoroughly enjoyed these games when I first played them around the age of 9 or 10 years old. as I've revisited these games, Ive noticed the concepts in each series (Blake stone, and ROTT) were before their time, and have also been tropes that have been used many a time in video games since, for example - silenced weapons in Blake stone Aliens of gold (released in 1993, the first fps to feature silenced weapons) - many would think that Goldeneye 64 (released 1997) was the first fps to feature a silenced weapon - well you are mistaken if you thought that. Then theres ROTT which was the first game to feature looking up and down, as well as double weapons (john woo style as the game says) and bounce pads which are fun, and serve as a primitive base for jumping in a video game. thumbs up. revisiting these games has been great, and I recommend you to do so also. and if you havent played them, play them! watch how fps has evolved using simple ideas these games troped over two decades of violent fun4.2/5 stars."

The amount of hours I spent on this game trying to find every secret door is ridiculous!!PROS:- SECRET DOORS!! Oh man... there are tons and tons of secret doors with gold and money and all sorts of goodies.  Secret doors within secret doors within secret doors!! Today's games are seriously lacking secret doors!!!- Very fun blood and gore 90's retro FPS.- Kill people for candy bars!!- If you like the original Doom and Wolfenstein 3D then you'll love this game (unless you don't...)CONS:- The controls are backwards 90's FPS... meaning you have to use the arrow keys, shift keys and space bars.  You can use your mouse which makes it better.- No Steam SHIFT-TAB screen (its a DOSBOX game).Short Story: It's 1993... I'm 7 years old and my mom got a hand me down PC from her work.  I wanted to  get a game for it but she wouldn't let me get Doom or Wolfenstein 3D because my Aunt let my older cousin get them and she said ""OH MY GOD THEY'RE GAMES ABOUT PURE MURDER!!!!

So I hear about this game called Blake Stone from another friend of mine, which at the time was very underated and unknown to parents.  It had all the  blood, the gore, the killing monsters and robots but no parent were raging on it yet because Doom and Wolfenstein took all the heat!  So I was able to convince my mom it wasn't bad and she bought it for me! I can't even imagine how many hours i spent playing this game.  Still holds up pretty well in fun factor considering how old it is.  If you love retro 90's FPSs then try this game out!!"
