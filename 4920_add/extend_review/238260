It is also very nice, that you can buy single tables. Absolute recommendation for anyone who ever played pinball."

I'm stuck with a game that freezes on a regular basis. Nothing like being on a great roll, tripled the free game score on your first ball and you know you've already lined up at least three extra balls and you think this is the time I break the table - my score is going to be through the roof. As the third multi-ball madness winds down, without warning the game freezes. The table broke me and I never got to ball number 2. This is when the heartache went too far. The game freezes more often than not before I can go through three balls."

Between this and Visual Pinball....I play this much more.  Graphics are very clean.  Physics are great.   Love that I can rotate my monitor and set for portrait mode.   My only gripe is I wish I could choose and save a custom camera angle.  I purchased every season.  Can't wait for the next table!"

I have been a pinball fanatic, practically all my life.  and it is a luxury to play pinball, from my home.  Especially when Pinball machines are not always available at the corner store.  Now!  Complaints!  I can not be believe I have played Adams Family for about 400 hrs and don't have 99 bear kicks!  I had 400 hours on this game in a Corner Store!  Your interpretation of the game is not quite perfect!  I rarely miss anything on this  game!  And now I am missing!"

76561197988323561,Recommended,238260,29700411,Posted: 4 February,all,Toejam264,"This is a great pinball sim. It has good physics and a bonus are all the historical (and new) tables. That adds a nostalgia factor, because I remember playing some of those machines when I was a teen. Also they have 2 of my favourite tables: ST TNG and Haunted House.If you like pinball, get this game. The tables are more expensive than in Pinball FX 2, but I guess the licenses for Stern et al. are more expensive. Also (for even more money) one can acquire pro versions, with tips and the option to explore tables in detail."
,Recommended,238260,30034321,Posted: 19 February,all,himitsu--p,"This game is simply stunning! The simulation of the tables is on-point, and the audio sounds are crisp and HD. I love coming home from school and settling down with a cup of coffee and playing this game. It's so relaxing, and yet it's also intense. Me and my little brother love to battle it out on Arabian Nights, and he always beats me! I highly recommend this game, whether you are a newbie or a pinball wizard!"

I also have this on PS4 and the older UI is much better, and the game itself is much more responsive (I enjoy it enough to buy some tables on PC during the sale). Can't recommend PC version at this time."
,Recommended,238260,33340491,Posted: 7 July,all,Owl Exterminator,"If you're looking for an accurate and realistic pinball sim you really can't beat it. It comes with a free table which is very welcome (you can see if you like the game before buying any additional tables, unlike another pinball game I could mention).The UI is definitely clunky and could use work, however it is not gamebreaking and won't affect actually playing pinball (might make purchasing more tables difficult as it can be unclear in the shop menu which table you currently have selected/highlighted).It also would be nice if they would add more menu music, but you can always turn it off if you get sick of ""Pinball Wizard"".All in all a really good pinball sim, especially if you prefer actual table over ""fantasy"" pinball."

Great physics, with only the rare lag (usually during a multi-ball, but still uncommon).Downside is that the UI isn't very friendly when looking for tables. Then there is oft-mentioned price of the tables and lack of an a la carte option to buy tables. The licensing fees are the likely culprit, but considering how much it costs to actually play the real life tables, the price isn't so bad. With the bundles, I've discovered some fun tables that I otherwise wouldn't have bought individually."

,Not Recommended,238260,30248524,Posted: 28 February,all,MansterSoft,"Other than the Pinball Arcade on PSP, this was my first foray into virtual pinball. Farsight offered a UI that was not only attractive and easy-to-use, but also semi-customizable. All-in-all, Farsight did a good job at simulating a lot of classic tables and also did a good job of balancing the amount of tables made by a certain manufacturer. Some are glitchier than others, and sometimes the physics are a little too forgiving, but all in good time these issues will be fixed, right?Sadly, no. There are a good deal of glitches that have apparently been in the game long-before I started. In Black Knight the ball phases right through the flipper at times. This is one of their oldest tables, and yet the issue has not been addressed.Also, that nice UI I was reffering to is long-gone. Half-of-the-time I'm unable to even access some of my bought tables. When I scroll down through the list they just dissappear. Also, navigating via cursor keys through the menu (who uses a mouse for a pinball game?) is near impossible. Instead of scrolling through the table list, the cursor just darts around all over the screen; auto-scrolling (until the tables disappear) and choosing random menu entries until you decide to use the mouse. I'm starting to ramble, so I'll just say, Mouse selection isn't all roses either.As for a nice representation of all manufacturers, as of season 6 that is also no more. Apparently their contracts with Bally and Williams temporarily expired, so Season 6 is mostly made up of Gottlieb (bad other than EM's) and Stern (worse). What about Bally's Embryon or William's Big Guns?The cherry on top is that Farsight is now developing another game known as ""Stern Pinball Arcade"". This game has an even worse UI than TPA and doesn't even have an options menu (One-Resolution fits all). Instead of focusing their apparently limited resources on one dying game they're now spreading them between a dying game and a game that was dead on arrival.Maybe I'm being a bit overcritical, and I would agree if the game didn't cost you nearly $200 to own all of these pinball games. I've already sunk over $100 into the game, but I've since moved onto other Pinball Simulators. Visual Pinball X and Future Pinball are both free, and nowadays look as good as TPA, have more games, and are pretty simple to set up. Zaccaria Pinball is also finally starting to shape up as one of the better simulators out there (and is waaaay cheaper than TPA). I strongly suggest you look at what Future Pinball and Visual Pinball X has to offer before sinking big bucks into this hopeless title OR at least wait for a sale to get the season packs half off.Until the UI mess and some of the other glitches are fixed, I'm done buying tables."

76561198044561880,Recommended,238260,30166301,Posted: 25 February,all,zztop_mesa,"Good (3/4). While the core pinball game is flawless, everthing else you take for granted is poorly  done. Like missing touchscreen controls; Also my controller doesn't work. Or that I need youtube to to play a table because the in-game help is a 500+ slide clickfest.Developers, Please stop pushing updates! I only play a few tables that I purchased, occasionaly, but every time I launch I have to wait for a download. One update obliterated the AAA UI and replaced it with something Indie looking. After you sell someone a copy how can you change its features?"

A lot of the table collections cost real money, shame but you can still free play each table once to get a high score. there is a slight delay in the controls... or it could be me being a bit slow (probably, hee)I like it, for a quick blast of something other than shooting stuff or rpg roaming, or playing any of my other games it's decent, you can buy the tables you want to play and try out the others when you want, there's the usual multiplayer and other bits. Can't really fault it for a freebie"

That would be the best game if all of you guys would put the Workshop and a Pinball Arcade table creator with it. Still I really like the game alout, I have it on android right now and I have unlocked so many Pinball Arcade tables. Since that I have no got it onto steam or on my computer, I still like that game alout."
,Recommended,238260,29929745,Posted: 14 February,all,VigorousJammer,"Has tons of great pinball tables, with more being added all the time. There's a ton of classic tables in here from Bally, Williams, Stern, as well as Gottlieb and other table manufacturers.The level of accuracy in each of these tables is really astounding, too. They scanned in the entire playing field, the backglass, the instructions near the front of the cabinet... they also render everything as it'd look on the actual table, not just on the playfield, but the tables all have accurate plungers and launch buttons.The ball physics in the game are also really well done, the ball feels like the proper weight that it would be in a real table, and it lends itself to the accuracy of the game. The physics do get a bit screwy sometimes, with the ball occasionally merging into other objects and not behaving like it should, however that happens so rarely that it's almost not even worth mentioning. For the most part the ball physics work as intended and feel great.The leaderboards really add something to the game, as well, especially if you have a friend that you're competing against, and the game makes this competition easy by having online ""friend leaderboards"".The online leaderboards also seem well managed, in the sense that the top scoring players appear to have gotten their scores legitmately and not through cheating.There's also challenges which have you go through a number of tables with only 3 credits to use on each one, where you try to reach a certain score on each table to allow you to progress. These challenges also have leaderboards, and it's all done using a balanced point system, meaning that a higher scoring table will get you a similar amount of points as a lower scoring table.This balanced point system is also used in tournaments, which are held occasionally and have their own rankign at the end of a certain time period.Overall, if you like pinball, this game delivers not only one of the most accurate pinball simulations I've seen, but also has a lot of features built into it to keep things fun and interesting. Would definitely recommend it to any pinball fans out there."

On first play was not that impressed , but that was when I played it full screen , in the window ( slightly stretched ) the tables came into their own and most of them are far superior to the Visual versions , ( which are great ) especially in the audio department . My only caveat that the full price for a package seems a little steep when you can play most of the tables in Visual for free , or a voluntary contribution , but if you can get these packages on an offer go for it !!!"
