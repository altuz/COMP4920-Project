Legend of Dungeon is an addictive romp on classic dungeon crawlers. The graphics in this mix 8- bit characters, modern day textures, and AMAZING lighting that work so well together you'll find yourself just stopping to appreciate it time and again.The story is simple, you are generic adventurer A in search of treasure, and go searching a dungeon. You make your way down gaining exp as you desecend by killing monsters. The farther you go down the stronger the enimies, with it all being random each playthrough.Items give the game a good idea of how seriously you should take the game. Hats are the armour for the game. Different hats giving different stats. They can vary from a miners hat that lights up an area, to a cat helmet, to a literal cat sitting on your head and so much more. Weapons vary from all shapes and sizes. You can be very lucky with weapons, or just get nothing. I've had playthroughs where on the 5th floor obtained a Scythe that did +199 damage, and enimies were mearly targets, until a giant minatour appeared from a trap door and tossed me to the side. The only way to heal yourself is by eating apples, or finding a health potion, but potions are random depending on their color. An Aqua potion could be a health potion one game, and make you vomit the next game.In the end Legend of Dungeon will always have me trying again to see if I can make it to the bottom of the dungeon. It's simple and easy on the eyes, but provides a challenge if the playthough allows it. It's a great time consumer and is definetly worth the buy."

,Recommended,238280,13640127,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Nerd House,"Legend of Dungeon has no story whatsoever. You are simply an adventurer (or four adventurers, if you have three friends who are willing to crowd around your computer screen) attempting to reach the 26th floor of the dungeon to find and retrieve the legendary treasure there. The controls are configurable, and gamepads are supported, so a session full of yelling at three friends to give you that new helmet can be yours if you've got the hardware for it. There aren't many buttons required for each player, but I don't relish the idea of putting more than two people on the same keyboard; a gamepad just feels more natural for this game. Still, as long as one player remains alive, anyone who dies has the chance to avoid the aforementioned permadeath by collecting orbs that will bring them back to life, and that's the kind of perk that makes a little keyboard crowding feel like less of a hassle.Whether you're playing alone or with friends, randomness is the main characteristic of Legend of Dungeon. The levels are randomly-generated, as are the enemies you find there and the items you pick up along the way. In fact, although you find a rainbow's worth of potions as you progress, even those are randomized at the start of each playthrough. In one play, the inky black potion may put you to sleep, but in another, it may heal 100 HP. The game never tells you what a potion does, even if you've already tried one of that color during the current game, but the developers have hinted that this may change in a future patch.How you feel about this chaos will almost entirely determine your overall reaction to the game. I've played it quite a few times now, and I've never reached the end, but the intrigue of what items may appear next time brings me back. Will I get a machine gun? A top hat that spews smoke like a chimney? A miner's helmet with a light for dark rooms? Or maybe something else that I've never seen before? There's no way to know, and the creativity the developers put into the items makes it fun to find out each time. Of course, the flip side is that when you don't know what you'll get, every time you play can begin to feel the same and you may feel that there's more luck involved in your success than skill.The game's visual presentation is another element that could strike some gamers differently than others. It's an intentionally pixelated style, similar to that seen in Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. There's no denying that it is a frequently-used style these days, and that turns some gamers off, but I think it's done well here. Legend of Dungeon's environments and enemies are all clearly defined, and the particle effects fit well with the game's overall look.Light can play a big factor in your survival, so it's fortunate that plenty of attention was focused into creating a lighting engine that works well. Some rooms are pitch black and, unless you've found an item that provides more light, you must inch forward and watch for any hint of a monster coming near your tiny pool of visibility. And even if you have your own light, is it a helmet, or is it something you'll have to carry in your hands instead of a weapon? Is that worth the risk?The sounds of enemies play a similar role in your survival, particularly in those dark rooms. Each type makes a distinct noise when they notice you and come to attack, and you quickly begin to recognize common foes. This helps not just in dark rooms, but in knowing how to time your attacks in any room where you're facing a number of enemies. There is no voice acting and only occasional, but perfectly serviceable, music. This might be a negative in some games, but in this one the crucial need to hear the monsters makes the lack of constant music a good thing.Legend of Dungeon is fun to play, but it's a game that you're unlikely to actually finish without trying a great number of times. And since you can't save your game, each attempt is a fresh start. The question is whether you'll continue to enjoy the game's randomness long enough to attempt it that many times. As for me, it's the kind of game I find myself thinking about when I'm not playing it; making plans for the next round; trying to decide what I could do better and how to progress farther. I'd rate that as a pretty good indicator of success for any game.Recommended"

And that literally adds a whole new dimension to it.Played normally, it's a 2d game that uses 3d techniques for its rendering but sill looks and feels very 2d and retro. But in the Rift you can see the whole level in true 3d from any angle just by moving your head. It's like the game is an animated diorama or board game. That works surprisingly well and I'm sure this kind of perspective will become very common in VR games in the future.This is not the type of game I would normally consider playing on a flat screen, but in the Rift it's a lot of fun.(Note: currently steam does not count my play time in VR as it's a different .exe)"

If your looking for a cool indi-game like I was, this one is not bad, worth the sale price. One thing to mention the the fighting system uses a ""negative edge"" style attack, where your character attacks when you release the button, took me a bit of time to realize, although I improved, I still thought this to be difficult to time the release of button while in the heat of battle. Also, the ""streets of rage"" perspective is a bit awkward to judge where you are in space but that's whats kinda cool about it too. Overall, It's a good game, great replay value.8/10"

You can only move and do one type of sword attack, and use items such as apples to refill your health. The level art is always the same no matter what dungeon floor you are on. The game lacks a good inventory system for the tons of items you pick up. Your only way of switching items is cycling through them in a long list.The little art that appears in the game is fantastic, and the music is great too.It might be more fun as a co-op game, but you can only play local co-op. I'm not sure who does that on PC. For some reason the pre-release videos of this game made me assume that you had a party of AI heroes, but that is not the case.Overall, feels a bit half-baked, like an early access title. The game has no back story or lore, it is like an Atari game with pretty graphics. Could be great with some more features such as block and roll commands, real inventory system, and changing dungeon art design every few floors. Needs a save system too. I played for awhile yesterday, came back today and my progress was nowhere to be found.Edit: After playing the game some more I managed to have a decent run until the game crashed on Level 7. Still not sure I could recommend it yet, but that was the most fun I had with it. Got a badass fire sword and upgraded the hell out of it at the random blacksmith. Also had a magic item that summoned a dark warrior to fight for me. Pretty cool. Realllly needs a quicksave system like Dungeons of Dredmor so you can stop and come back to that point later. I don't have the time to sit down and try to run through all at once."

It's FUN: my #1 reason for playing games.The goal sounds simple: start in the tavern, work your way down to the 26th level, get the treasure, and bring it back up to the tavern, and you win. Simple, right? HA!Ha!Nope.I usually play this game late in the evening, after I've done everything for the day and am winding down. I can't beat it, I can't even get close to beating it, but I enjoy every moment playing it. When I die, then I go to bed. ;-)Legend of Dungeon is colorful and gorgeous. The pixel art style here is well drawn & attractive. The colored lighting of effects, with light sources & real-time shadows vault what might have been an ""ordinary"" pixel art game of the '90s into a beautiful, 21st century game.It combines the randomly generated levels/rooms/monsters/objects of a rogue-like with a classic ""beat 'em up"" style of movement & gameplay which I enjoy more than normal 2-D side-scrollers or classic top-down games.The neat quirks of this game keep it interesting. Everything's randomly generated, even the color of the potion bottles to their effects; different every game. The swing of your melee weapons need to be timed well to hit your enemy best: you don't just button mash. Spellbooks that shoot flaming skulls or spawn monster companions mix up your strategy as you go, as do rare projectile weapons. A spray paint can will help you mark your path on walls (or just vandalize the walls!). Sometimes you get a room with so many baddies, or really wicked ones, that the only thing you can do is RUN! Or get lucky and find a path of rooms around.I really enjoy playing the Daily generated dungeon, and this is the only game where I've cared to know where my score ranks world-wide.If I had to use 1 word to describe Legend of Dungeon: FUN.2 words? Colorful fun. =)UPDATE August 2016: Legend of Dungeon now has a VR mode!When played in VR, the level that you're playing on is floating in black space in front of you. The game is then like a live diorama that you play in/on!  And it can be up to 7 feet long IRL, so you will need to side-step along your roomscale space to stay with your character.This experience should set the bar for making side-scroller games in VR."

However, the game's simplicity means that it'll likely get stale after the first few attempts.The dungeon has 26 floors, each getting progressively more difficult (some levels can REALLY screw you over if you are not careful/have bad luck and don't have good items). Once you get to the bottom, the you're expected to make your way all the way back up to the first floor. Due to this, runs can get VERY long, and the game doesn't seem to have enough complexity to keep such long runs interesting after a while. Not to mention the fact that at the time of writing this, there is only local co-op -- no online play whatsoever, which is baffling.Still, the game can be relatively fun for a few runs, and it's somewhat cheap.

My only gripe is the potion system since my memory is that of a goldfish I always have a spreadsheet open whenever I play this so i can mark down what potion does what. I haven't played in a while but a good feature that would alleviate this so much would just be to identify the potion after using it so you dont have to remember or look up on a damn spreadsheet. Other than that the weapons are highly varied and useful in ways you wouldn't think of at first such as books that summon skulls that attack eneemies from afar. One of my favorite hats is the hamster that confuses enemies.

Potions are labelled with their color (and sometimes random adjectives) and have random effects.  Items are random as well – I once had a coffee mug as a hat, until I switched it out for a deer’s head.Other randomness includes the appearance of random characters, including a Doctor Who (complete with phone booth).

This is an issue which harkens back to the great 2D brawlers like Final Fight and Double Dragon.Some of the levels get rather dark, but since item and equipment drops are randomized, you can’t be sure of having a source of light in order to explore them.This game is screaming for an online co-op mode – which for all I know may be forthcoming.

There do seem to have been some patches since some of the gameplay I have seen.  Maybe you should update this game and try it out again.The lack of class distinction is easily offset by the wide variety of items you stumble upon.  To those who say there is a lack of variety in LoD and it's just a basic sword slash game, you obviously haven't been deeper than the first couple floors.  By the time I get to the tenth floor on each run, my character is truly unique and I am having a blast playing.

It handles pretty smoothly, the RNG keeps things fresh, and it's beautiful in both sound and graphics. Secondly, there's a surprising amount of depth in the items and the difficulty of the game. Enough to keep me coming back repeatedly.People keep citing Binding of Isaac as inspiration for/similar to this game, but I see more of Dungeon Stone Crawl Soup than anything else here. The randomized dungeons, the similar amount of floors, the similar goal. The only real Binding of Isaac-esque thing I see in this game is the descrepincy between it being ""Rogue-like"", as Stone Crawl Soup is, and being ""Rogue-lite"" as Binding of Isaac is.The starter class is utterly terrible and it is, from my experience, a decent amount of work to unlock the other classes. Some enemies are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and often I get hit when I can't clearly see why. There's little direction on why you do what you do or even what your overarching goal is(Or, at least I wasn't entirely sure until my third go around.) While I enjoy how obscure the game is on item and equipment effects, I feel it can also work to it's detriment at times, as the menu, to me, seems rather unintuitive and uninformative, which served to make me frustrated at first.Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10 and will definitely keep watching this game as it updates."
,Recommended,238280,15111015,"Posted: 29 March, 2015",all,Seign9,"A simply brilliant rogue-like with beautiful design aspects. Don't let the pixelated look fool you. The way the devs use color and light (especially) makes this game really stand out from an aesthetic stand-point. There is always something flashing or glowing or light coming from something you have equiped and it all adds up to give the game a truly unique look. To top it all off, the sound effects compliment the aesthetics perfectly and you end up with a totally emersive experience.The gameplay is just as pleasing as the design. The controls are tight and responsive and are set by the user before you even attempt your first run. There is a nice variety of weapons and hats (which act as your defensive equips) and it's always  fun finding that new weapon that does massive damage or that new hat that makes your run faster or jump higher or whatever. Being a rogue-like, no 2 runs are ever the same and this random aspect gives the game possible endless replayability.This game is still in beta and the devs are constantly adding new content. There are now different classes (i.e., knights, rogues, mages etc) and a new pet system which I'm just starting to really get to know. I'll update this review once I get a better feel for it all or the game hits it's final release.As it stands now, this game is an easy 9/10 for me and absolutely worth the small price. This is one of the rare games that makes me want to buy copies for my friends just so they can experience it for themselves and to also help the devs and hopefully encourage them to keep up the amazing work. This game is a perfect example of everything that is right about indie gaming."

,Recommended,238280,15208731,"Posted: 4 April, 2015",all,PutridMeat,"Not Quite LegendaryLegend of Dungeon = Roguelite-lite + Commodore 64 + Rainbow VomitThis game reminds me of action games back on the ol' Commodore 64.  I make this reference even though I know it will plainly sail straight over the heads of most of you youngsters, making me feel like the aging and increasingly irrelevant gaming hipster that I am.  *sigh*Uh, anyway.  The premise of this game is very Rogue.  IE - Journey to the bottom of the randomly generated dungeon to collect the frazzledazzled THING and return for ultimate glory.  Unlike Rogue, it is very light on the RPG mechanics.  You collect glowing experience orbs from fallen enemies and gain levels which translates into direct health and damage increases.  There is no stat or skill management whatsoever.The graphics are extremely charming and look like a sweet cocktail of Paper Mario, Realm of the Mad God, and Superbrothers Swords & Sorcery.  The lighting effects in particular are great to behold, lending a bit of rave neon to the otherwise repetitive and uninteresting brick environments.Combat is both terribly simplistic and very tactical.  You only have two mapped buttons to switch gear between and simple one-button attacks.  However combat is very deliberately paced and timing and planning are more important than button mashing.  For the most part the melee itself is mostly uninteresting as you swat at enemies with your pixelated implements of pain.  However, as you progress there are a number of weapons and items that have interesting properties that make them far more interesting to use.  Want to summon a room full of glowing pink succubi to whip your foes into submission?  There's a spellbook for that.Items and gear are likewise extremely simple.  There is no armor other than a hat/mask.  Most of these items are barely more than humorous cosmetics but some have alternative properties other than adding to your defense.  Some might light up a room and free your hand from carrying a lantern, while others may make you jump higher.  Like Rogue, there are the random assortment of potions for each run.  There is no way to identify them other than by drinking one, so take note of their effects.Hint: Vomit = Bad.There are a number of interesting boss battles to contend with, which can be entirely punishing and impossible if you weren't lucky enough to be graced with the right items during your trip down.  Other times you might cut right through them as if they were rice paper because you chanced upon some of the game's more overpowered items.  Difficulty is definitely a bit uneven, which tends to be true of any Roguelike game.Drink the Sickly Green Potion if you...Desire a Roguelite that is a bit off the beaten path.  This game defintely has a unique vibe to it that melds the gameplay and graphics of the 1980s with modern day sensibilities.Enjoy a silly game.  There are deadly Unicorns that fart rainbows to found as well as visors that let you shoot eye beams.Love olde tyme sound effects.  They're straight out of an Atari game.Throw the Kitten into the lava if you...Really aren't sold on ""oldskool"" appeal.  A lot of what is to be enjoyed here relies on that, and you probably won't get this game if that's not your bag.Demand traditional RPG stat crunching.  This game only has the window-dressing of stats and you have little influence over them other than your limited choice of equipment.Are easily bored by repetition.  A lot of dungeon runs quickly feel very ""samey"" due to the scenery bearing little of visual distinction or interest.  There are a few unlocks to find but once you've done a couple runs to the bottom you will have more or less seen most of what the game has to offer.The Bottom LineLegend of Dungeon quickly grew on me with its eclectic mix of visual and gameplay elements.  From womping foes with a giant, glowing hammer to wearing a Shatner mask, to summoning a room full of skeletons.  I'm a huge fan of Adventure Time which brings together so many disparate elements like this and perhaps this is why Legend of Dungeon initially appealed to me.However, after 20 hours or so I soon began to find the experience a bit bleak.  When you trundle through the same environments over and over and see the same enemies throughout it quickly starts to feel like a chore to get to the bottom.  I am not against simple mechanics but feel that this game istoosimple.  Part of the fun of a Roguelike is the replayability you get from trying out new classes, spawning with different gear, and discovering new items and enemies fairly regularly.Depsite its shortcomings, Legend of Dungeon has become one of those games I come back to every once in a while.  It's a solid Roguelite experience and I'd love to see this title become the first in a series.  Take the core elements, expand upon them with more interesting character generation and more/more varied environments, enemies, and items and you could easily have atruelegend on your hands."

Rogue Legacy has stats and gold carried over between playthroughs.Legend of Dungeon is a REAL. ROGUELIKE. Your goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon, grab the treasure, and get back out. One life, permadeath, start over from the beginning. No stats are conserved, no inventory is conserved, no gold is conserved. If you die, you lose everything.The graphics are a very cool 2.5D pixelart style with a 3D dynamic lighting engine running seamlessly on top of it. (See the trailer, the lights are beautiful). Characters can be enhanced and customized with gear as you progress through the dungeon and uncover items. This is a true work of solid game design, high graphical quality (as far as pixel art games go), and the spirit of roguelike gameplay. Give it a try.Many of the negative reviews this game recieved are undeserved in my opinion, and I want to address a few.Complaints include:Poor combat - Simple, but not really ""poor"". The combat is varied enough in the types of weapons you get and it promotes smart handling of enemies rather than hack-n-slash overkill combos with QTEs.Bland Design - The game is PROCEDURALLY GENERATED. The environments aren't terribly complex, but they look great and the game feels immersive. Apples to apples, it's just as boring as Minecraft world generation, and nobody complains about that.Lack of Online Co-Op - this is a legitimate complaint because sadly this CoD generation of gamers assumes that online play needs to be a feature for every game... BUT, The game does not have it in its current state (maybe after beta?). Nowhere in the description is online play advertised. LEARN TO READ. DO NOT BUY A LOCAL CO-OP GAME AND EXPECT ONLINE PLAY.All in all, this is a great game and deserves attention. If you're unsure, maybe wait for a sale to pop up or go play it with a friend.

It's kind of Diablo meets NetHack meets the Atari 2600.The new content added with the last update adds a lot of depth.
,Recommended,238280,8227182,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,Bluddy,"This is a great game in the new, ever-expanding rogue-lite genre. Don't let the first few levels fool you -- the game is hard! While others might complain that the mechanics are too easy, the reality is that you need to minimize the damage you get from even basic monsters if you'll have any hope of reaching the treasure. The skill in this game is knowing your enemies well: knowing which enemies to avoid, which to run away from, and how to hit the rest of them without getting hit in return. The graphics are a marvelous mix of old and new, with truly beautiful lighting effects, and the music is incredibly good (far better than what I'm used to in this genre).A few downsides:1. There isn't enough randomness or variety in the dungeon layouts. Compared to Spelunky where levels feel mostly original each time, the dungeon levels here feel repetitive. This is balanced out by the fact that the dungeon levels aren't the main source of randomness here -- the monsters and items are.2. Summoned monsters are too easy to abuse via spamming. I really wish the dev would do something about this. Basically, once you get a summoning spell, you can spam critters in every room, killing the monsters and preventing you from getting hit.Regardless, this is a great game and if you liked Spelunky & FTL, there's a good chance you'll like this one as well."

That is when I realized, this game is awesome! The point wasn't to get things, it was to adventure as far as you could and get as much loot as you could, then die and do it agian, trying to get more and go farther! Its an awesome game! Putting a fish on your head as a protective item was grand sillieness, as is the whole game, its just a fun game when you get the idea of it. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone! It is a good time killer, that doesnt frustrate you when you die. The character selection is pretty sweet too.

,Recommended,238280,224149,"Posted: 26 August, 2013",all,d.Tox508,"Legend of Dungeon is an appropriate name for this game by Robot Loves Kitty, and like its namesake is bound to leave a long legacy. Roguelike, this is one of those games that has that edge of your seat madness we all crave when it comes to gaming these days. A visual assasin with controller smashing delight, Legend of Dungeon is genius.I often browse through games that are soon to be released so I can see what I might want to add to my wishlist, anything indie or retro always seems to catch my eye, and this was a perfect candidate. Seeing as the game was still in beta, I usually try not to get too involved before the final product is released. This way, it doesn’t taint my vision of what the developers intend the game to be when its complete. So, with that being said, one half drunken night after coming home from the bar I just said “♥♥♥♥ it.”“Legend has it there is a treasure on the 26th floor…” IF you ever get there that is. Your goal in Legend of Dungeon is to make it to the 26th floor where you will battle your way through hordes of zombies, demons, bats, and creatures that you would only see in your wildest nightmares. Multiple weapons, magic, power ups, coins and don’t forget HATS will help you battle your way to the 26th floor, and trust me, you WILL need them. This is definitely not a simple playthrough by any means. The randomized bosses are a challenge and can quickly become a problem, but make sure you defeat each you come across for special item drops.Addicting within the first 2 minutes, I’d say clear the next 2 hours of your schedule, or even better yet the next 2 days. Graphicly, the visual intensity of this game is amazing. Brilliant lighting mixed in with perfect shading makes this game not only fun to play but fun to watch as well. Legend of Dungeons soundtrack has an old school feel with a modern touch and is almost like a electronic opera filled with emotion. These two elements combined with a flawless attention to detail make for an awesome gaming experience.This game is loaded with all types of different weapons, potions and again HATS, lots and lots of HATS. Weapon wise, you begin with a sword, and throughout the game pick up different weapons as you go. With everything from a flare gun, pistol, saber, lasers that shoot out of your eyes, lasers that shoot out of a CATS eyes, magic spells, and even a lantern, you are well suited when it comes to taking on this castle. Hats make up the brunt of your armor and can range from a normal piece of headgear like a turban, to the outrageous, like a beehive or koala bear. Each hat has a different stat booster, and can sometimes help light the path in a dark area. Potions also make up a large part of the game and can do anything from raise your health and stats, to making you act like a drunken single girl at a bachelorette party. Sometimes, more often than not it’s very unclear what the potions do but like most drugs, you always gotta try it once, right?Replay factor isn’t a problem when it comes to Legend of Dungeon. You feel like you have something to accomplish, and you just don’t feel complete until you do. I love games like this that when everytime you die you come back with avengence, setting goals to achieve while trying to surpass your last attempt at glory. Don’t worry about getting bored with the dungeons either. They change with every game and are randomized, and this makes each attempt better than the last.Every element of Legend of Dungeon seems to amaze me, and I can’t get enough. Enough can’t be said about the brilliant lighting and vibrant colors, the intense and emotional music, or the edge of your seat game play that is experienced with each run. Legend of Dungeon is an automatic hit, and can only get better. Well worth it and another essential in any gamers library.Graphics: 9/10Playability: 7/10Story: 1/10Challenge: 8/10Replay Value: 8/10"

There are spellbooks which enable you to shoot spells at your enemies, or summon minions. You will also find a multitude of hats which are used for protection, to shed light on your way in the dungeon or just for fun. There is this one  mouse-hat, that throws tiny mice ahead of you which will daze any monster/player they hit.In conclusion, Legend of Dungeon is great in both single & multiplayer and even though I've yet to reach the bottom floor even once, I've had hours of fun with it."

Whether you try it with keyboard, mouse, or gamepad, the controls are just plain bad.  The combat is not engaging or fun in any way.  Your abilities are based solely on picking up a random weapon/object in the dungeon, and none of them are any good.The inventory ""system"" is barely functional, every ""randomized"" dungeon looks exactly the same, and the lack of anything resembling a class system gives this game zero replay value.

The average roguelike has random events, and a wider array of of strange and interesting goings-on, so starting from the beginning isn't nearly as soul-sucking.

While it's not necessary for a rouge-like, it is critical that it's fun to play, but Legend of Dungeon isn't."
,Not Recommended,238280,20442756,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,Dr. Chad Feelgood,"TL;DR version: Game is a solid C/C+. Worth getting for 5/10$ or if you like rogue-likes/dungeon crawlers and want something new. Personally I had some fun but am going to wait till it's a bit more polished, and some bugs are fixed to play it again.Game is still in Alpha/Beta as of this review.Also have not tried coop mode. May or may not make the game more fun.Pros:-Game modes. You can choose between having a new dungeon every death, or a static dungeon that changes every day, or even go off a seed. I think this is a good balance that can accomidate most styles of play.-Classes. Though you have to rescue them from the dungeon first, I liked the veriety available. There seemed to be a good balance between melee/ranged combat; offense/defense; as well as some that fit in the middle.-Items. I liked that nearly any item could spawn at any point of the dungeon. You might get a sword on level 1/2 of the dungeon that you'd use all the way down. However, that being said; compared to the stats you naturally picked up on your character; strength/defensive stats on items are extremely underwhelming. I frequently had runs where my character would get up to 500-700 strength. Weapons could give a lot, but helms (the only other equippable item) - I think the most I ever saw on one was 5-10? Basically useless.-Difficulty. With a few exceptions on seeded dungeons that put difficult monsters very early on; as well as the last few hours of my gameplay, I found the difficulty of the game to be challenging but not frustrating. Character Health/Healing items, which are rare/small in a lot of rogue-likes, were abundant but fair, given the damage of some enemies and the difficulty of later levels of the dungeon.Meh:-Art. Pixel art was OK. Not terrible but nothing to write home about. The dynamic lighting was nice sometimes; other times it was annoying.-Dungeon Veriety. The randomness/pathing of the dungeon didn't bother me; but the tilesets did. You'll recognize patterns almost instantly. There's some variation when you get further down in the dungeon, but it's only a change of skin/color of the bricks - nothing else. Not a big enough deal to make me put it in 'cons', but keep this in mind if you're going to buy it - things are going to get repedative, and fast.Cons:NOTE: As this game is still in alpha/beta, take these with a grain of salt.-2d/3d enviornment. This was one of the most annoying aspects of the game. You have a fixed view, and your character/monsters in the game are 2d; but the enviornment is 3d. This makes moving and combat awkward because you have to be on the same 2d 'plane' to hit anything. To be fair the game is somewhat forgiving, both making monsters automatically orient to your plane to attack you; and giving your attacks some 3d depth to them - but FAR too many times i had a good run come to a halt not because I didn't react to an enemy; but because they could hit me from an angle from which I couldn't; or be flailing around all over, hitting me every second, and me, not able to move up/down to the right orientation to attack back. On that same note; the hitboxes on some enemies and attacks are very misleading and will leave you frustrated. Given the damage that some enemies do in later parts of the game, this gets to be more and more of a glaring flaw.-Combat. A little too simple for my tastes; as your attack is simply that. Press a button, or hold it down to do a little more damage. No parries, blocks, dodges (aside from avoiding things manually), etc. No combo's/special attacks. Normally, I'd put this in the 'Meh' category,except for the reason I finally gave up on this game. Sometimes, for no observable reason, your attacks will be reflected back on you by 'some means'. I say that in quotes because I was left literally baffled at what would happen. There was no warning, no sign of an enemy using a special attack, nothing to learn from or adapt to your next run - id just press attack, as I would have done thousands of times previously, and just die. This happens especially frequently with ranged weapons. Because of the games nature to favor strength/offensive damage; what this means is that EVEN AT FULL HEALTH, WITH PLENTY OF HEALING ITEMS, YOU CAN KILL YOURSELF IN ONE HIT. When (good) runs take over 1, even 2 hours, to die in this way out of the blue was more than frustrating, and a dealbreaker for me.-'Magic system'. Compared to melee/ranged (guns) attacks, magic is laughably underwhelming. The most powerful offensive damaging magics end up doing as much damage as you'll do with the standard sword within a few levels. Your character levels up strength on thier own; increasing melee/ranged (gun) damage; but there is no corrisponding stat for magic; so the damage/skills remain static. There are a few books to summon creatures, but they generally all too weak to be of any use past the first few levels; not to mention that they get in the way as well. All other magic is generally useless effects. Also, the art/sprites of the magic is all the same - firing a colored skull.-Inventory system. There is none. You pick up items which appear on a rotating 'belt'. You can cycle back and forth, but you can't orginize them in any way, other than dropping them and hoping to pick them up in the right order you want. You can assign some things to hotkeys...if you can keep it to 2. I understand that this game was made with gamepads/controllers in mind; where buttons are limited...but to not have the option to set more if you are using a keyboard seems dumb.-Controls. Pretty minor, but if you want to reset a control you have to reset everything. Meaning, the game will cycle through all keys available to that character, and ask for an input for each one. There's no option to choose what single button/command you want to change.RPG elements/Stat system. Also a minor flaw; mostly because I think this game wasn't meant to be any sort of RPG; but a platformer/dungeon crawler/rogue-like; but it's difficult to see the benifit of stats that your character has. I mean, Health is obvious, and strength is fairly easy to understand in time; but I could never get a handle on defense. Meaning, I had some idea of how much damage monsters did - but having more or less defense; I couldn't tell it making that big of a difference. What this meant is that every character seems to become a glass cannon - only concerned with attack.Despite thier being a lot more Con's than Pro's; I don't hate the game. Up until the last 5-10 or so hours, I was hooked. But I don't see myself playing it again until some of these aspects are fixed."

The movement works like a street brawler, You can move closer and further to the screen. The thing i do truly love about this game however is when you can gather items and they have stats. These stats can be stacked to an absurd amount however, You can get a coffee cup, wear it as a hat, and suddenly you are running so fast you cant control yourself, or you can improve your jump so that you rocket to the roof every time. It also does have procedurally generated dungeons, randomly generated enemies and randomly generated loot.This game does have some annoyances however, It seems success can be quite random. Getting down to the lower levels is heavily based on the gear you have and sometimes you can find really crappy gear, or really awesome gear. Also the controller configuration is very annoying, But havent seen any noticable bugs, so thats a plus.Another thing this game has going for it, it the local co-op. You can play with up to four friends and can get quite entertaining. However no online co-op is available and when you die, getting back in the game can be very problematic, especially since most of the time when you die, you fall in lava or something, so you lose all the gear you had on you.In conclusion, this game is pretty entertaining, but very random, and can be better with friends.7.5/10 Alone8/10 with friends"
,Recommended,238280,7896413,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,Mollusk,"So far the game has been fun but I can see it wearing out very quickly espcially without the ability to save your progress. What the game needs is a better way to manage your invitory, possibly by using hotkeys for quick action and more enjoyment. The level design is well...a dungeon but it's not even a cool dungeon. The levels all look the same and can get boring really quickly. I think with the ability to save progress, a better invitory system+hotkeys, and different looking levels, this game would be well worth the $10. Right now I'd say it's worth about $5 maximum and the only reason I bought it was anticipation/the low price.The fact is that most of the negative reviews are accurate which is sad considering how awesome this game can look before you purchase it. I'm sure since the game barely just released on steam there will be plenty of DLC content to come in the future. I just hope they fix the key areas I mentioned above.I would not recommend this game to anyone who likes to save their progress and expects the gameplay features to mirror it's graphic design. The bottom line is: if you are looking for a dungeon crawler that's balanced between casual and exciting, this game is for you. Otherwise, try something else."

The decision to randomize potions on each playthrough while initially interesting gets real old, real quick since the effect is never presented after the first drink thus requiring you to write down what does what on each playthrough.

76561198047988603,Not Recommended,238280,17292369,"Posted: 29 July, 2015",all,Jason,"I spent quite a bit of time on this, relatively speaking.  And I have to say that despite all the quirky items and pleasant nuances, it wasn't worth it.  The price is fine, but the time it sucks out of you isn't worth the payoff in neither enjoyment playing it or the ending.I'll give a few examples.  To unlock a class, I had to backtrack through more than twenty floors, spray painting what amounted to a bread crumb trail, just because otherwise the NPC you are escorting will die.  I did that for more than a dozen times and less than half of that was successful.  The appeal of managing that minimalistic UI and working through sheer memory wears off quickly.  I don't want to remember what potion does what, grind snakes for apples (HP), circle through the floor for mobs & exp, or hide in a corner and shoot random floating homing skulls for five minutes to beat a boss anymore.And of course playing with friends is more fun, but isn't everything?I played over 2000 games of free cell, 1000 games of Mahjong Titans, hundreds upon hundreds of games of minesweeper and solitaire, nearly a thousand games of The Binding of Isaac, and so on.  I don't mind repetitive for the most part, but I don't want the game to demand my focus and at the same time make my efforts feel futile.  And that's what this game does."
76561197987395751,Not Recommended,238280,17822363,"Posted: 31 August, 2015",all,The EYE,"I am looking for good games for myself. My parameters are:-I'm busy. I don't have a lot of time to sink into games. I just want something that's really fun every now and then, for a few minutes or maybe an hour or two once a week. Because of that, games that are really hard, games that require grind, games that are slow to get into, and games that get confusing if you put it down for a while and then come back, are not good. If it's a story, it's better actually if it's not to long. I'll never finish a 50 hour game, and that will just irritate me, because I hate not finishing a story. Also:-I like good art, good story, good sound, interesting worlds.-I like good puzzles, well done action. Humor.-I like feeling my time playing has been of some real value. I've learned something, been uplifted by great artistry, been inspired, been amused, been challenged, grown. I'm never bored. I don't need a 'Time Sink' I hate 'time sinks.'Games I've loved include Cave Story, Portal, Flow.So, with that background, on to the review. I'll give it to you simple: I only played 30 minutes, because that's all the time the game held me for. And the last ten or fifteen was me being graceful. Sad truth: I've got a lot of games I haven't played. I don't have time to give each game two hours. If it loses me, that's it. deleated. That's what happened.Pros: I loved the art and the sound. There was some good sense of humor. The most fun I had was when my computer was acting up and as I flailed to get focus back on the screen I accidentally drank some beer and was attacked by a bat. That was entertaining.Cons: either not much happens, or it takes more doing to get to things happening. I killed a bunch of bats and snakes with an irritating sword. Flipped some switches, most of which did nothing, and thoroughly explored the first level. Couldn't find my way to the second level. Either there was some puzzle I would have to figure out, or a door I missed. In any case, the game didn't grab me enough to want to try.Wanted More: there was one potion that made me throw up rainbows. that was great. I wanted to have some kind of ranged spell weapon that looked cool. but I didn't find one and I had no idea when I might. The cool or funny things ended up being pretty slow in coming, and the sword was really irritating. combat wasn't fun with it.I'm sorry developer, my heart goes out to you for making a pretty game, but after fiddling around for a half hour I have no desire to play any more. I guess it was too slow? Not that I wanted more combat, the combat needs to be made more satisfying, at least in the beginning bits. If you're waiting till later to make it fun, it's not working.Anyhoo, that about wraps up my thoughts. Maybe this kind of game is your cup of tea and you'll love it. To be fair, most games are not my thing. I'm extremely picky because of my limited time.End verdict: deleted after 30 minutes, never going to look at again. Feel bad for the developers. The video’s look really cool but the actual gameplay is boring, at least in the very early bits, playing by myself.If you have lots of time on your hands, read someone else’s review and get off my lawn you darn kids."

I am a huge user interface snob, and as such I found this game nigh unplayable. The only issues I really had concerned the UI, so if you don't think it would bother you too much, you might get a great deal of enjoyment from this game. However, because of the UI issues, I cannot recommend it myself.I loaded up the game and went to change the resolution. Immediately, the first issue arose. There is no drop down menu to select a resolution; instead, I have to cycle through all of them to my desired choice.  ""Oh well"", I thought, and returned to the main menu and clicked on start.The game told me to hold down to enter the tavern. Lacking a controller, I naturally press and hold the 's' key, for a significant amount of time. Nothing happened. I tried the down arrow. Nothing happened. It would seem that the default keys are, most likely, for controllers, even if you don't have one plugged in (except escape, which luckily took me back to the main menu). I set up the controls, unsure how it would play, and continued. After a couple of minutes of playing, it became apparent that I needed to change some of the buttons. So I went back to options to change, and had to re-enter every key again, just to get to the one I wanted to change. I was a little frustrated, but these issues would no longer affect my gameplay.A short while later, I realised just how annoying this game was going to be. I had 10 items to cycle through, with the only way to do this being a next and previous item method. 5 button presses to get from my sword to my apples (which are used for health restoration), and I'd only been playing for 5 minutes on level 1. It was only going to get worse as I got more useful items, too. This is the main reason why I do not recommend this game.I'm sure many people would just tell me to drop the items that I don't need, and keep a small supply. A lot of games have some way of forcing the player to regulate their inventory, normally in the form of limited slots (both inventory and hotbar slots) and/or weight management. This works well, and is used in a great number of titles. It forces the player to make a decision on what items they might need immediately (hotbar), while not allowing an infinite supply of items that can make the game too easy, or make the inventory unnavigable. Awkward or lacking controls are not an effective or enjoyable method of inventory management. It's as simple as that.Ignoring the UI issues, the graphics and visual effects are fantastic. This is the level of graphics detail that all indie games should aspire to have, it really is. The enemies, characters, attacks, particle effects, levels, and especially the tavern, are unrivalled. I quite possibly haven't seen any other game of comparable style come close to how great Legend of Dungeon looks, it is truly impressive.The music and sound effects are also absolutely top notch. Every item you pick up makes a brilliant noise, as do all the enemies. I pay so much attention to my exp bar because the colourful explosion when leveling up is so awesome, I never want to accidentally miss it. Even the sound effects in the menu are really good, too.Gameplay wise, it's not leagues ahead like it's graphics/sound, but it is certainly good (ignoring of course the rather severe inventory issue that I've gone far too in depth about). You hack and slash and jump your way through varying enemies and obstacles. The dungeons seem vast and difficult to navigate, and I've already found myself wondering how to get back to certain areas. The gameplay is nothing special, but it is certainly fun. I imagine that this would be a great multiplayer title, it really would.Unfortunately, the developers have fallen into what I assume must be the deepest trap indie development has; the pile of corpses inside is now so large that the stench is overwhelming. With their limited budget, they have decided to emulate older games, because it is cheaper. This is great in terms of graphics and sound (both of which are excellent in Legend of Dungeon), and even gameplay, for some titles, but should no longer be acceptable in terms of UI design. It does not take oodles of cash to make your UI usable. The inventory system is an absolute mess, and it's for that reason that I cannot recommend this game."

I love pixel art and Legend of Dungeon does not dissappoint in that department. I assume this is why others, along with myself, were drawn in. Although this 'thing' has unique pixel art, it has absolutely no other positive aspect. Legend of Dungeon not only lacks replayability, but lacks playability of any sort. I truly wonder how the developers could feel comfortable selling, let alone releasing, a product as unfinished as this. I say unfinished because I want to believe that this was not the product that the developers originally envisioned. Notice that I did not once refer this as a game, because it is not. It is not even close to being a finished product that can be called a game.TL;DR: Metaphorically, lets refer to the gameplay as the cake, and the art as the icing.

There are no enemy health bars, or detailed character skill trees, or magic cool-down timers.  What you get instead is the thrill of picking up an esoterically named tome, and trying to figure out what it does (and if it's going to be good or bad for you!)  Dungeon floors are randomized, as are the items and potion effects, making each delve a unique experience.  Yes, there is permadeath.  No, you don't get to save your game.  You don't keep a leveled up character, instead you need to ""level-up"" your own skills to be able to make it far enough to recover the treasure!  For example, each weapon has a unique attack range and speed, (not shown as a number) which you'll need to get the hang of in order to maximize your ability to crush monsters!

The inclusion of local co-op is a rarity for pc games and something I deeply respect, it adds a ton of fun to the game and thus should be taken advantage of if possible.

But after some time with it,  Legend of Dungeon leaves me feeling like the developers weren’t all that interested in their own game, or they ran out of their Kickstarter funding too fast. It’s decent, for what it is: a randomized dungeon romp for up to four players on the same PC, with nice real-time lighting and interesting weapons/magic. The music is well done, over 200 tracks that dynamically blend together based on what’s going on. The pixel art pops out nicely due to the depth-mapping system they’ve got going, and each type of monster/boss requires slightly different strategies.But there’s no saving (coming soon says the developer), and if you’re playing alone it’s a little boring. The weirdness of the weapons/items can lead to screen-filling insanity. If you find a sword that summons skeletons each time you hit something, pretty soon you can barely find yourself in the mess. With four players, each with such weaponry, it can lead to issues. There’s only one goal in Legend of Dungeon: go down, get the treasure, come back. No persistence whatsoever, which isn’t really a negative, but it leaves the game very light on content. It feels unfinished, like a beta. It’s also unclear if the developers are going to continue supporting it."

While attempting to figure out the controls and drinking a beer (in-game), this quickly spiraled into a alcohol-induced bar brawl with my fellow patrons quickly leading to my demise and subsequent respawn.StoryLoD is in many ways similar to other dungeon crawlers and roguelikes. The player is tasked with reaching the 26th floor of the dungeon, fetch the treasure, and return alive.AestheticsLoD is presented as a sort of 2.5D pixel art style, basically, 2D pixels presented on 3D environments. There are some interesting low-poly elements such as the water and smoke along with some interesting lighting choices that make the environments feel suitably gloomy for a dungeon romp.GameplayThe gameplay can be best compared to that of a beat-em-up game reminiscent of the likes of a Golden Axe title. The 2D/3D thing can make hitting enemies successfully a bit difficult, especially in darker sections of the dungeon. This reminds me of many beat-em-up games I've played in the past, so it certainly isn't anything unique (I'm looking at youSecret of Mana).You set off into the randomized depths with a weak starting weapon, a beer, and a few apples (the apples healing you for a minimal amount). Item pickups consist of unidentified potions of various colors, new weapons, and hats that modify your stats or provide you with abilities. Managing all of these items, however, is a chore at best. The inventory system is a chore and that's putting it nicely. You navigate your inventory solely by going left or right in your inventory one item at a time. I found myself going through my bottomless inventory tossing out currently unequipped items in order to make the selection process a bit less cumbersome and hopefully prevent me from having to cycle through tens of items trying to find a potion or apple on the verge of death.SoundThe soundtrack is suitable for the environment presented in the game. Gloomy minimal tunes blend in and out and seem to flow into one another the deeper you progress in the dungeon.Closing ThoughtsI understand that this game is also has local co-op for up to four players. I can imagine that this game (like just about any other) is tremendous fun when played in that setting. Unfortunately, due to logistics, I am unable to comment on that aspect.All that being said, LoD doesn't do that much that hasn't been done before in the dungeon crawling genre. The addition of a more action-oriented gameplay is nice, but you are limited to just smashing one extremely repetitive attack or charging up said attack. The combat lacks a visceral feel and good enemy feedback that really detracts from the action gameplay. Imagine Streets of Rage where the only attack is a jab that repeats and a successful hit on an enemy just sends them sliding back a few feet rather than making them keel over in pain or go flying through the air.After giving LoD a few goes, I can't say that I plan on coming back to it any time soon, if ever unless I find someone to try local co-op with.RatingNot All Legends Are True"

The gameplay does at first appear to be simple but as noted in a few of the other reviews you begin to pick up some interesting items along the way that give you many different attack options. There are also puzzles and secrets. Basically this game has everything that a decent dungeon crawl should have in it.I would recommend this game if you like easy to pick up and hard to master type games. It's a fun time waster (I hate that term, my time is not wasted if I am enjoying myself.) to be sure. I pick it up and play it in bursts.This is one reason I love Indie gaming so much. Sometimes something that doesn't look like a ""Triple AAA"" graphics fest can supply you with more fun than a way more expensively produced title could.Be warned though, the gameplay is not groundbreaking or all that pretty so if you are looking for that, please look elsewhere.If you want something fun then pick this one up. Wait for a sale if you want to but it's a cutesy and interesting little game.I think my only real complaint is that some areas are a little too dark but that is more of a preference than a complaint."

,Recommended,238280,9460540,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Silent Snow,"First off what can be said about this game. Even though I have had it for a while, I haven't played it that much. When I first became aware of this game I thought that the graphics were very cute. Also the lighting looked gorgeous. At the time Northernlion said that the game was in Alpha and playable, unfortunately after that there was a Kickstarter Campaign and then the Alpha was removed. I figured out why when the game was released.First off it handles poorly. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but there is also extremely poor hit detection. I must say the game looked more fun when someone else played it. I wanted to really like this game. I even did something rare and bought it when it was released! It doesn't seem like anything has changed since the alpha, so why did it take them so long to release it? It feels like an unfinished tech demo. I wish I had more positive things to say about this.It is a Roguelike-like, but not really. The dynamic music system I found to be annoying at best, maybe it was just what was generated in my playthrough. Also the levels all appeared to be the same and actually poorly layed out. It seems that they used set pieces instead of a truely procedurally generated dungeon. Also while the lighting is really nice, it is too gray and dull.Item management is a nightmare. I don't see how this wasn't changed somehow or complained about. I don't see how a better sorting system couldn't have been created. Oh, thats the challenge of the game you might say. Roguelikes are meant to be difficult. I enjoy them. For some reason, I was expecting something better than the initial alpha that I saw.Also a cardinal sin in 2014. No Online Multiplayer. What?! Only Local Co-op. I don't know ANYONE who invites 3 other people to cram themselves in front of a screen to play. What could have been an excellent LAN Party game just doesn't get any play at all. Why bother playing at all? There is no story, there is no depth. There is no point to this game. You're doing this just for the sake of doing it. While most roguelike stories are a bit ramshackle at best, at least there is some kind of Lore or atmosphere. I expected more depth from the combat. Combat has a disconnected unfinished feeling. There is no sense of progression or accomplishment beyond ""I made it to level X with Y gold"".Also, no ability to save the game. This is almost unforgiveable. Not even a quick save option. Even most hardcore roguelikes don't force you to quit your game without saving your progress. Have a sweet character and weapon set? Oh thats too bad, you just have to quit the game and try all over again. This is broken and frustrating.I wanted to like this game, I gave it about an hour of play before it was really boring and frustrating. I didn't pay much for the game, so I don't want my money back, but I wouldn't buy another game from Kitty Loves Robot again. The only positive thing really is hopefully other devs will see what is wrong with this game and not make similar mistakes."

,Not Recommended,238280,11226778,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,Alix,"I recently played Delver, right before I tried out this game. I must say, I am shocked at the similarities. There are 26 floors which you descend down to get treasure (compared to Delver's 7), and then you make your way back up to the Tavern where you started. ""It's a simple hack and slash where you don't have anything like classes or ability branches, but is reduced to the basic concept of wander a dungeon and collect loot."" as stated by someone on Metacritic, as also with Delver, and there's even a lich king enemy. However, unlike Delver which has a few flaws that can be looked over, I recommend this game far less. I realize Legend of Dungeon is still in beta and has time to fix the things that are wrong, but this game is extremely unbalanced  in many ways and will need a lot of work to fix it's many mistakes. So where to start? I have a lot to say, so I'll start with the more minor flaws/glitches and work up to the big things. Scroll past the list to see the main problem which lies in the game's mechanics.•  The writing is so tiny that I can barely make out the description or title of any items, even when the screen was made bigger.•  The inventory is messy, cluttered, and very inconvient. Instead of seeing your entire inventory at once, you scroll left and ride to see one item at a time. Similar items, except for apples, don't stack either. This makes it difficult to quickly switch items and if you have a lot of them, it takes a while.•  People have remarked at how beautiful the dynamic lighting is, and I'll even go farther to say that this game has beautiful particle effects, but the lighting from a lantern is so bright it's hard to see enemies because it just sort of blinds them out.•  There are lots of secret doors with seemingly no way to open them after much searching, and there are often high nooks and crannies with items on top that seem impossible to reach. Yes, there are floor pressure plates, secret wall pannels, levers, and fire activated switches, but I've come across a lot of rooms that I've searched top to bottom and found nothing.•  You will die if you fall into lava, but the bridges to cross can be so small (the size of your feet small) that it's unfairly effortless to fall into it.•  The potions are randomized with each play through but after you drink them, they aren't labled for the next time. There's too many to remember them all, so you'll just have to write down the effects for ones you can't keep track of.•  Experiance disappears way too quickly. If there are a big group of enemies, of even a small group of strong enemies, the majority of experiance will disappear while I am still fighting. And stopping the fight to gather experiance will knock a ton of health off of you since enemies will be following behind you, attacking. I have unfairly lost a LOT of experiance from this.•  Even after you've cleared a room, enemies will periodically come through the door. New enemies entered a room so often that it was hard just to get a few seconds of peace to drink potions, heal, or modify my inventory.•  Door ways are often blocked by enemies, even powerful enemies. Just trying to push past them to enter the room can grant you a large deal of damage.•  There's no map which is a huge necessity. Despite it being 2D, it's still very easy to get lost. There are many doors, often 3-5 doors within one room, and since most of the rooms look a like, it's easy to lose your bearings and second guess if you were already in a particular room. This also means that when you reach the 26th floor and retrieve the treasure, going back up will be a guessing game, running from door to door to find each set of stairs. Yes, this game does have cans of spray paint to mark door ways. As I traveled down, I was marking each door that lead upstairs to allievate the headache for my ascent. However, after you save and quit and reload later on, all the spray paint on the walls has completely vanished. This game can't possibly be beat in one playthrough either (solo). It will take hours upon hours to beat.Now onto the real problem with this game. I mentioned Legend of Dungeon being completely un-balanced, and I seen this in every major area, which I'll do my best to explain. For starters, the majority of monsters only drop 2 exp, which is frusterating when you need 100-500 experiance to reach the next level. It literately isn't until you are half done with the game that you run into monsters who drop a decent amount of experiance. This makes leveling up a hard process, which is what you depend on more than anything to survive. To top that off, the main source of health is apples. There are healing potions too, but they are very rare. Apples restore a 5 points of health. That's it, five points. You start with 100 HP points and but as you level up, that grows. Right before I died, I was shy of 400. Leveling up does NOT restore HP either. Even early on, some hits from enemies do 5 damage. Later on, a single hit can do as much as 40 and beyond. And apples are NOT common, at all. I've gathered a couple dozen in the beginning levels, which is where they are most frequent, but the deeper you go, the less common they are. I would go many floors without seeing a single apple. So running out of apples happens pretty quickly. In fact, I always died because I ran out of them and couldn't heal. So during one playthrough, I was absolutely determined to win.  If I didn't win this round, I was going to give up. I put my all into it. And this where the seriously messed up the game's mechanics really show. I found a gambler earliar on in the game, to whom you bet money against. You can get many things but the you most frequently get coins, apples, or an enemy. I legit spent over 2 hours hoarding over 500 apples. It was a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but I thought ""There's no way I can lose now. I surely have enough health to make it down to the 26th floor."" Here's proof if you don't believe me, which I don't blame you.http://oi62.tinypic.com/2zxtkdd.jpgShortly after that, I  came across an axe that did 200 damage that killed many enemy types in one hit and also aquired two unlimited monster tombs to spawn monsters to fight for me. With all that, I *still* died. I had ran all out of apples and had half my health. As soon as I entered level 22, there was  a Robot boss that killed me. It's not supposed to be activated until approached, but it was already awake, and it contiously spawned so many enemies that I couldn't kill them fast enough to even focus on the Robot itself. They didn't even seem to die either. It was a train wreck mess with almost the entire screen cluttered with enemies. So even with 500 apples, a 200 hit point weapon, and 2 monster summoning spell books, I still could not win. Even with my great amount of experiance, I still was very weak to a lot of enemies and had used my monsters to fight a ton of battles for me, which felt like cheating. I put so much time and effort into that one playthrough that I am convinced this game is not winnable unless in multiplayer. You shouldn't have to rig the system like I did, ridiculously hoarding apples, to win, and in the end that didn't even work, which to me screams that this game is un-acceptably difficult and unbalanced in the most important systems- health and experiance. And to put the icing on the cake, it just wasn't entertaing enough. As HookedGames from Metacritic put it, ""There is plenty of variety in the equipment that you find and the enemies you will face, but it is never enough to engage you for any great length of time."" I was determined to beat this game, but awfully bored while trying to do it. I desperately want to like this game, but I can't. At the moment there's just too much wrong with it."

The rest plays much like a rogue RPG, get to the bottom of the generic build dungeon, fight monsters, get the treasure and improve your stats & equipment along the way. Alas, some bugs & gameplay issues make the game virtually unplayable in single-player:PROS:- Functional & nice graphics, superb light effects, pleasant music, simple controls and some equipment with interesting properties make up for a fun start.- Fun & challenging till level 20- One more try feelingCONS:- bugs: return to tavern to find yourself suddenly in multiplayer mode, all potions sometimes get other effects when resuming game, sometimes losing your saved game, paintjob gone when resuming or entering tavern, level 26/27 dropping thru stairs making going up again sometimes impossible, returning treasure sets gold score to 0, inventory selections sometimes blocks visually- gameplay issues: frustrating, unbalanced & unpleasant from level 21 on, entering room while monster entering thru same door thus blocking your (escape) exit, rooms sometimes cramped with multiple bosses & high damage monsters on lower levels and in meantime new monsters of same difficulty keep appearing thru doors making the odds even harder if not impossible- to much depends on LUCK: finding decent weapons, armor, spells, potions, shops, smiths (but mostly not, giving an unfair feeling against the odds on the lower levels)So all in all, you will have a lot of fun in the beginning but because of above issues, you will also know you will certainly die before you even get near the deepest levels. You need to be very persistent and have a lot of time at hand to finally reach your goal in single player.

From what I have seen, it all depends on your tastes. I think those who are looking for a modern RPG experience come away dissapointed.You SHOULD buy the game if you are a fellow fan of the roguelike genre. From my experience, this game holds the core spirit of authentic roguelikes, but at the same time cuts out much of the over complex stat management that can burden players. Its visuals and sounds fit the game well. EVERYTHING is random, no two items you find will have the same stats, you will sometimes find ones that do interesting things. The game also challenges you to think out of the box by giving you seemingly useless items (spray paints, magnets, etc) that you will later find can be quite useful. I would also definitely reccomend this game to anybody who enjoyed Faster Than Light.TLDR: If you're buying this as an RPG, you might be dissapointedIf you're buying this as a Roguelike, you will love it.It all depends on your tastes..."

All rooms feel fairly simmilar.- Currently there is no save feature... Which wouldn't be a problem other than a good run can last upwards of 4 hours.

And it’s pretty obvious why I got attracted to it: it has an oldschool look and feel and definitely plays very oldschool. However, it’s permadeath, just like Hack Slash Loot, another roguelike that I’m not very fond of. Maybe it’ll just be a matter of playing this one a little more to warm up to it, I don’t know.It kinda reminds me of the old Temple of Doom game for the NES, but it’s a roguelike. The way it works is it’s an action/RPG, but very easy to die, kinda like Dark Souls. That sounds like it should be right up my alley, right? And then suddenly, permadeath. It’d be one thing if it robbed you of a level and put you back a stage or something, but no, game over.I’ve never been a big fan of permadeath especially considering the way you often learn from games is by making mistakes. Sure, permadeath makes it harder and forces you to be more careful, but it also makes the game more frustrating to the point that it will only appeal to a select few people…and I’m not one of them.

The lighting effects are next level though, so the game plays quite beautifully with a distinct nod to games of old. I really dug the style. Your character may wield a weapon, use items/potions, and wear different hats. Hats include things like a traditional plate and mail to pirate hats, turbans, light bulbs, and even cats.. yes, cats.The developers really like cats, btw. Don't throw them in the lava.The monsters in the game are humorous in their non-detailed 8-bit ways and range from bats and snakes, to skeletons, medusas, mummies, and leprechauns. There are many ways to die also. Many. It's quite fun to just see all the different ways. And the game encourages trying things out with no real direction. Pick up a potion? Might as well drink it.

We went in blind, not knowing a thing about the game.   It recognizes and uses xbox 360 controllers natively, but unintuitively requires you to setup the controls before playing (there is no 'default' configuration).It's a hack n slash dungeon game with up to 4 people at once.  You run around swinging your sword (or other weapons you might find) killing monsters, solving puzzles usually consisting of a series of switches you have to flip up or down to get stairs to appears or torches to light or (??? never did figure some of them out).You kill stuff and loot/exp drops.  Whoever picks up the loot or exp gets it so you can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to your friends or hate them or whatever, but it can get chaotic so it's hard to really work out a system to share the exp.  It's also got random/roguelike qualities to it so there can be a hard mob in the second room or you might find great weapons/items right away.  Best weapon we found that afternoon was a really large 2 handed hammer that shook the entire screen when swung, and did roughly 25x more damage than the other weapons we were using.Then we all died when we lost our lantern somehow and had to go into a dark room.  We never did see what killed us.Haven't played it since then, but that one afternoon was already worth a couple bucks.  Not the best game, it was kinda rough to get used to playing, dying kinda sucked (your ghost could collect 'souls' from things your alive friends would kill to get back to life and rejoin them, no other ressurection feature), and it was a bit unfair sometimes when your friends would push your guy around (but also hilarious sometimes so it evened out).Recommended when it's cheap or when a game that plays sorta like Deadly Towers from the NES days, but not as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and co-op sounds fun!"
,Recommended,238280,8446136,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,Ryozenzuzex,"Early on in Legend of Dungeon there is a sharp learning curve. The game is a randomized loot-fest that takes you deep into a monster-infested dungeon. Controls are rudimentary and unintuitive. Content is still being added and tweaked. Narrative is completely absent. However, the stylized graphics and dynamic music are excellent and enticing.The main purpose of the game, which is never actually clearly stated, is to delve down twenty-six levels, find a great treasure, and bring it back to the surface. Along the way, you'll find random hats that give you power, defense, and speed... or take it away. There is a huge collection of weapons--some very simple, like a battle axe, and some complex, like a spell tome for summoning monsters. Potions litter the stones, and their effects are randomly determined each time you go in (so try to find that full life potion early).Each level is not very different from the levels above it, sadly, so after a couple of attempts you'll probably be ready for a break. On some runs you may not even find a new weapon, literally taking away a third of the excitement the game offers. The goal of attaining points (via gold) is dull, and complicated by the fact that you can spend your points and earn next to nothing, then die and look like you had a poor score the whole time.Despite these limits, the game is still fun just for the sake of adventuring into the unknown and discovering new hats and weapons, strange and powerful enemies, and painful new ways to die. The developers are still adding new content, and Legend of Dungeon shows a lot of promise in what it can be in its final form. Right now, co-op is local only, but one can dream of a day when online multi-player and some form of narrative help round out this game, even as more enemies and items are added in.This game is not for everyone, and it is far from complete, but it was still a good buy for me and I can recommend it to anyone who is understanding of the description I've outlined above."

,Recommended,238280,7977569,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Carly 2000,"Short answer:Buy this game if you want a simple game to play with other people in the same room.Long version:The aesthetics are this game's strongest features, and can compare favorably to Fez or Spelunky. The lighting effects alone are almost enough to sell this game, as it features dynamic shadows, light and dark areas, and simply makes the game feel alive. The sound effects seem like something out of a game from the 70s or 80s, with the simplified sounds reinforcing the pixellated aesthetic of the game.The gameplay is simple enough, that it would be a good game to play with other people in your living room. It is easy to imagine a fun-filled evening, consuming beverages and salted snacks of choice, killing zombies and skeletons for fun and profit.Playing alone or for extended periods, however, is where the game is weakest. Since the game is 2.5D, you'll often find yourself falling into lava pits, or failing to connect attacks with monsters. After thirty-odd years of platform games being made, sold, and having time to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, I can only imagine the reasons that they chose to make this game 2.5D. I cannot think of a game where this set of mechanics works. Even playing with friends locally, the fun of laughing at your pals falling into a lava pit for the Nth time, would probably wear off quickly. They could fix this by having a graphical indication of the depth-level of your character, or making the hit-boxes more forgiving to the player.Other mechanics are equally poor. Combat is a simplistic button-mashing affair, with no chance of using anything other than your single weapon. There are health recover mechanics, armors, and other items, but since the inventory system is so cripplingly simplistic, the only thing you'll have time to do in combat, is to mash the attack button. Outside of combat, the inventory system will also annoy or aggravate. The game has loot-dropping mechanics similar to any Diablo or Torchlight game, where you will find a reasonably large amount of items over the course of your journey. However, your inventory is managed by scrolling left and right through the list of your items, and either equipping, using, or dropping that item. So, it's a game where the loot-dropping encourages picking up every item on the floor, and the inventory-management system forces you to spend most of your time throwing away useless items, so that you can more easily find your health-restoration items after combat, either apples or potions.The potions in this game are where its roguelike influences are felt most strongly. They're un-identified, labelled only with a color. After using one of them, however, they remain labelled with their color, meaning you'll have to stop your fast-paced hack-and-slash game, to jot down notes about which potions to keep and which to throw away. Weirdly enough, armor and weapons will enter your inventory identified, although with slightly vague names, which sometimes leave you guessing to their function. A heavy top hat of power, for example, would decrease your jump height due to its weight, and probably increase your combat effectiveness. Expect frequent visits to the internet, to look up what each enchantment does, before you decide on your hat, and continue in the dungeon.The levels themselves, are reasonably varied, with randomized layouts, doorways, and monsters. The level generator, however, needs some re-working. About one time in ten, you'll find yourself literally unable to proceed, because the game spawned a dungeon, with no path to get to the next dungeon level. Other times, there will be secret floor-buttons or wall-switches, with no apparent function in the dungeon. One time, I had an unreachable switch spawn at the top of the level with, presumably, a secret staircase to be activated by that same switch. Finally, the dungeons will randomly be filled with dark rooms, where you'll either have to fight with your lantern, or hope you found a hat which gives off some light. Flaming hats and the electro-sphere are good options. The current mechanics and items of the game, make the darkness feel like a feature which was not fully thought out, with frustration being the most likely option, and no productive things the player can reasonably do, to puzzle or fight past the dark rooms.Overall, this game feels like an unfinished product, which needs many of its existing mechanics fixed, reworked, or removed. It is an OK game for a short evening with friends on the couch, but not something you'd be playing after an hour or two."

It combines pixel art with advanced lightening in a very effective way. The aesthetic appeal is pretty high but as you might have read already, this is the only aspect where this game excells at.Gameplay is pretty boring after several tries, there isn't any variety to it at all. RPG elements are basic and you can't customize your character, it's all done automatically. Weapons and armor all feel more or less the same because there are basically only two attack types without any depth whatsoever. You can hit enemies and charge up an attack and that is all you have. Furthermore the hit detection can feel quite wonky and sometimes you get without knowing why.The nature of the game is random, so you always get a new dungeon with different items. But each playthrough doesn't feel distinctive enough. Basically you have the same boring dungeons and you see the same loot over again. Potions have unique effects but overall there isn't much depth here.I don't recommend this game, not even as a timewaster. It's shallow and doesn't offer anything good."

The first part of the game might feel like it's over-easy, especially if you spend a lot of time on it (you can descend to the next ""level"" of the dungeon as soon as you find the door down, like most roguelikes), but as you descend, you will start dying to random traps triggered by nothing more or less than your own curiosity, turns taken wrongly, ill-timed leaps into lava, and unfortunate encounters with vampires and cyclops - just to name a few. Under the thin veneer of cutesy ""8-bit"" sprites and whimsical openGL-driven lighting effects, beyond the little visual jokes like the bathrooms you can use to change your character's appearance at the beginning of the game, this program is very definitely trying to kill you. Sometimes this feels unfair, but the game mitigates that by breaking with roguelike tradition and allowing you to be revived from death (with no loot) - IF you have a friend to revive you who is able to recompose you from the tatters of the souls of those he or she slays. More on this caveat later.Gameplay mechanics are simple. There are no classes, no skill trees, no ""combo"" moves, and not even a whiff of crafting. Controls are so simple you can play this game on a super-nintendo controller without issue - which is a good thing in a game that's going for the arcade-ey beat 'em up style, in my opinion. All character progression lies in simple level gains, which boost stats for everyone in the same way, and the loot. Ah, the loot. This game features randomly generated weapons, bottles of unnamed substances (you gotta drink 'em to find out what they do; some will cause you to vomit a skittle-esque rainbow on the dungeon floor, which is almost as entertaining to watch as it is painful to your character), beer (gain XP, lose health and control of your character's better judgment for a while), apples (health), and hats like if you took Team Fortress and smashed it into 2.5 dimensions, then told a computer with a dictionary to name all the items uniquely. There are many hats. Many. I've had hats that looked like cats, which shot laser beams from their eyes. Hats that consisted of a wolf's face and which caused me to sprint and jump at great speed. There was a ""hat"" that was actually just a beehive, which released angry social insects upon any who dared get in the way of my sword swings. There were even some really weird hats that were just made out of cloth and stitching and gave me some basic stat boosts... And you can carry as many of them as you want, and switch out from one to the other whenever you need. Just keep in mind that your inventory system is its own game mechanic - it is a line that must be scrolled through to find what you want in it, so the more you keep, the longer it can take to get to what you need. Since there's no pausing and scrolling, even in single-player, this means that there have been times when I died because I couldn't switch out my gear fast enough to adapt to some new threat the dungeon had thrown at me. To me, that's elegant design. To others, that's the UI getting in the way of the gameplay. What you think about that may actually be a good judge of what you think of this game, because the 2.5-dimensional world you're in (you and all other sprites are flat, but you exist in a series of isometric rooms with depth to them) also makes finding the correct depth of your opponents something of a challenge. If you played old TMNT games, or other 2.5D games, then you know all it takes to get used to this is practice, but for some that's an off-putting requirement. I find it just complicated enough to add the necessary difficulty I'm looking for in a party game like this one.By now you've obviously determined that this is a positive review. I like this game a lot, and I think it has great potential as a game to break out on the big screen at a party (it worked great on my SteamOS machine in my livingroom with a Playstation 2 - 2! controller attached) for a night of drunken shouting, button-mashing, and confused laughter (remember that time when you touched your sister's barbie doll in the naughty places and laughed to yourself? Yeah, like that). Unfortunately, that's also the reason I haven't played very much of this game - it's difficult to get people to sit down and play coop games in person anymore, which is the only way you can do coop for this title. Maybe it's the perception that the game looks ""old"" and therefore ""difficult"" or ""arcane,"" or maybe it just looks too simple on the surface for people to be intrigued, but whatever the reason, you will have trouble getting people to play. That's worth mentioning, since the only way you can be resurrected is with a surviving friend to help you out - and the game's difficulty seems scaled around that mechanic. You can play solo, but it definitely makes survival to the end a much more random prospect - just like the point at which I decide I've said too much and end this review."

Well, you can, but it's a bad idea.Otherwise, this has an interesting graphical style and very good music.

My only success has been by spamming summons over and over, waiting a million hours to get through the game *yawn*.The potions do not get named after drinking, so you have to write down what each color potion does, and the game doesn't even tell you exactly what the potion did very clearly. If I wanted to write stuff down, I could just play a real DnD board game instead.Every level is too much the same exact thing over and over, so little variety here.No special dungeon branches, it's all the same thing- and it's pretty slow going until late game if you happen to find some speed items. Takes me hours each playthrough due to the slow nature of this game- and it is too repetitive so gets monatenous.Neat music but not much music.Local multiplayer only!Gameplay is too much the same thing every playthrough, not much going on here for a roguelike, not even the classes change much of the gameplay so far- well at least not the few I unlocked I suppose.I like the game but don't love it, and the developement has been frozen for years basically, with only tiny improvements made.
