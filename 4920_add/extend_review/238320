76561198073018990,Recommended,238320,12419824,"Posted: 8 October, 2014",all,Dr Trager,"Having 42 hours on record and 100% achievements on this game, I think I can provide a useful review. This is a great game and excels at what it was made for. That said, it is not for everybody. Thus, I shall be listing what to and what not to expect from it.What to expect:- Survival horror: there is no fighting (on your part), running and hiding is the aim of the game.- Jump scares: yes, it's a survival HORROR for a reason. Keep a spare pair of underwear available when you are playing this game.- Explicit and dark: violence, gore, vulgar language, some nudity and sexually related incidents all play a part in creating the dark, horrifying atmosphere of Outlast.- Interesting storyline and background information: The storyline has a bit of a twist in the tale, things aren't exactly as you expected them to be. Also, with all the notes and documents one collects in this game, one gets a decent amount of background information which helps with the atmosphere of the game, develops the plot (and player understanding thereof) and gives the player insight as to the nature of the silent protagonist, as well as some of the antagonists you'll be facing.What not to expect:- Hours of replay value: your first playthrough will probably be about 5-6 hours and the DLC about 1-2 hours. As the game progression is always the same, there is little reason to play it again (with the exception of wanting to get achievements).- Competitiveness: There is no form of multiplayer or leaderboards of any kind.- Something suitable for children (you should have picked that up by now)- Sunshine and roses- Clean underwear- Being able to sleep at night (slightly exaggerated)I absolutely loved this game and highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the horror genre, whether it be movies or games. I hope the information listed will help you in your decision of whether or not to purchase this game.Happy Gaming!"

,Recommended,238320,16876347,"Posted: 4 July, 2015",all,Tom,"Outlast is a first person horror game which was released in mid 2013 on the PC while also being released afterwards on consoles. It is own by approximately a million users on Steam too.  The game is also built on the unreal engine.The game is based around a story rich campaign told in first person narrative style set in a psychiatric hospital which has been overrun by murderous paitents.  Your character, Miles Upshur, has no means of combat, other than shoving enemies out of your way. You are forced to use the technique which most would do when faced with the types of enemies in this game, running for your life and hiding like a little girl under a bed.  You also carry a notebook and a camcorder, which is used to document the events inside the hospital. The camera is used as your mechanism of seeing in the dark, but obviously in good horror genre style it has a limited supply of power - so you also have to explore the hospital for batteries to keep it turned on.Outlast is built on the Unreal engine; so the graphics are top notch; they really capture the scene and will have you cringing in horror at some of the sights you will see. The lighting is absolutely perfect, along with the rain effects when outside.You can go as deep as you want with the story; you can either follow the plot by just wandering around the halls and purely just going off the scripted events that happen or you can delve very deeply into the story by finding all kinds of documents scattered around in drawers and cupboards.This is easily the scariest game I have ever played. On top of the stunning visuals that are almost life like, the game has the best audio you will ever find in a horror game; footsteps, background screaming, musical tempo changes. They are all amazing and you won't find a game which captures it more perfectly than Outlast.Outlast is hard; the first ""level"" chucks you straight in at the deep end as you have to scramble around a beefed up guy to turn the power generator on; this is the first of many challenges you will face in the game. You have to really stick at it at times to try work the best method of progressing around some events. You will be very lucky to complete the game without running into any problems.The whole game took me seven hours to complete; this was my first playthrough and there sadly isn't any other reason other than collecting all of the documents to play through it again. The story is linear and you will end up with the same ending each time.Regardless of the lack of replay ability, Outlast is easily one of the best games to come out in recent years and horror fans will absolutely love it. If you aren't into jump scares this may not be for you, as there are plenty and you will probably find yourself alt F4ing out many times.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Supposed to be scary or something.""And there I went.  Oblivious to what I was getting into.  Honestly, I had only watched 2 minutes of vids online and a Conan O Brian review. Then came the game; immediately creepy. And it quickly moved on to scary and terrifying. The world seemed a bit Portal 2-ish, but the actual gameplay...was amazing.  Pacing, story, real HORROR, and tension like I had not really felt in a horror game.  Not that I have played a ton of horror titles, but I would put it on par with early Silent Hill games.I won't go into the details.  Really, it would spoil it for you.  Honestly, very basic.  You are a reporter checking out the weird stuff happening at the aslyum.  And then you walk in into an evil Wonderland complete with menacing large evil killers and a nutso with no pants.Speaking of that, tweedle-nude and tweedle-nuder didn't get me once.  I was kinda proud of that.You can't fire a gun or use a weapon.  The only defense is running, hiding, ducking, and having your heart up in your throat as Chris Walrider walks by you...aw! He found me!  AwHHHHHH!! RUNNNN!!!Of all the games I have played this year, this has to be one of the best made in totality.  The length is just right.  Cues and progression move at an exact rhythm that does not allow you to slow your scare down. The jumpscares are there, but are by no means the meat of the game.  There are no useless time wasting missions.  Everything has a reason and the most annoying mission in the gameis perhaps one of the most terrifying when you do not know what will happen next at all.  Normal difficulty is not impossible and not once did I get stuck on geometry.  A few things are not apparent - that much is true.  Granted, if they were, the game would not be hard enough.  It's just right.  Really.  It's absolutely just right.  Kudos to the dev team.At one point I told my buddy I was really wasn't super scared anymore by about the middle of the game.  BUT.  I could not play for more than an hour or so or my heart would not slow down enough for me to sleep well.  Too much tension.  Then he said ""Isn't that what terrifying means?""He was right.  Even when the horrific graphics no longer phased me, it was the sheer tension of the game that kept me in it's grip.  That is amazing, and impressed me more than many AAA titles I've played in the past."

But during and after playing this game.. those money are saved...I just couldn't stomach the food for right now and i couldn't sleep last night...There is a chinese saying.. ""尸山血海"" Which is use to describe the battle field or Masscure... It's word by word meaning is ""Corpse Mountain, And Blood Sea"". This game literally take the meaning and produced the effect.I only posted 1 screenshoot of this game and I had to choose one of the very basic ones and put on spoiler...The other ones I end up deleting simply because it feels like a crime to show such graphic picture on internet to kids that may stumble upon them.I did play Insane difficulty to start to try to get all the achievements but gave up 3 hours in cause it's just a bit too hard since you basicly playing ironman and simply cannot die even once. Just lower the difficulty by 1 would be a great experience. 17 hours marathon was enough for me to complete the main game and DLC. I am sure a lot people can do much faster if they just play on normal.As I play this game. It immendiatly felt like the good old resident evi 2l: Nemesis. You are constantly pressured by enemy you cannot defeat and have to find way to evade, hide and use enviroment to your adavange to dodge/delay the encounter. Except this time you play a reporter(for DLC a software engineer) and unlike Jill you don't get a weapon... not a gun.. not a bat.. not even a shiv... You don't get to use a single weapon in the entire game.All you got is camera that have infradvision for you to see in the dark.. And there are alot dark...Graphics of this game is really not that great but creater made it super nasty and even borderline disgusting and give a grand sense of surreal terror. The way Horror game should be!The story, dialog and interaction is great though out the base game. The DLC even improved what worked for the base game and even made it better.There is section of full 20 seconds in DLC made me hold my balls the entire time and afraid it's gonna be table saw away...The heavy breathing and scared sound the main character feel so real.. and as you playing the game there will be many time you feel your heart beat match the main character's heartbeat. Sometime too fast.. sometime stopped!!!You must use everything to survive in this game and sound/music play a huge importance and it's very well done. You can just feel the big guy breathing down your neck when you being chased.For horror Game I have always said Silent hill Series would be my No.1 because that's psychologically involved...It still is my number one. But this game grab second very easily. It's not as story involved and intriging as silent Hill. But It  will make a weak man♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants... (I didn't .. but i did lose sleep and food over it soooo...)9.9/10 for a Great horror Game experience... And please keep kids less then 18 away from this game.."

,Recommended,238320,1547317,"Posted: 15 September, 2013",all,noibn,"If Amnesia: The Dark Descent and the Penumbra games had a baby, that baby would be Outlast. This is classic survival horror - a creepy setting, no weapons, and no way to survive except to hide. You play as a journalist investigating an abandoned insane asylum, based on an anonymous tip of shady goings-on there. The only tool you have at your disposal is a video camera. The main hook of the game is using the camera's IR (night vision) mode to see just what the hell is going around you. It makes for some very effective moments of terror. Imagine knowing something scary and nasty is out there stalking you, but not being able to see what's 3 feet in front of you... yeah, that's the experience in a nutshell. Those moments are what makes this game effective. But unfortunately the whole game is not just those moments. Some parts I found to be somewhat tedious. For example, in one section, you have to explore an area to collect 3 fuses to restore power to something, all the while being stalked by crazy people. It's tense, to be sure, but also makes you realize that you're playing a game with a lame ""collect x things"" mechanic. It kind of brings you out of the experience a bit. The final section of the game is also sort of hit or miss, as it changes direction in a big way (reminds me sort of how Amnesia fell apart a little bit towards the end). But it's not necessarily bad... just different (I don't really want to get into spoilers at all), so it's one of those things where you might like it or you might not. But the majority of the game leading up to the end is pretty much consistently good. The environment is creepy as hell, the atmosphere is dark, and the ""enemies"" (mostly disfigured inmates) serve their purpose well. There are a few jump-scares, and the aforementioned fetch-quest sections where you're being chased, but mostly, the horror of the game comes from the combination of atmosphere and having to rely on a camera (whose batteries drain quickly when using IR) to be able to see. On the downside, you sort of get used to things after a while, so the scare factor wears off a bit towards the end. So it's ultimately a good thing that the game only lasts around 4-5 hours. Any more would have been too much. Despite the flaws, there's still lots of good things to experience here, so if you're a fan of this genre, you pretty much have to play this at some point. I think the price is probably fair, but if you can wait, it's definitely worth picking up in a sale.Technical notes: I ran into a major bug towards the beginning of the game that prevented any further progress (it involves shaking the mouse during a quick-time event). The issue has supposedly been fixed in a patch, but it didn't work for me. There is a pinned post in the Steam discussions explaining how to work around this if it doesn't work for you either."
,Recommended,238320,7794217,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Boosegumps,"Even though the past few years have brought along a number of horror titles that haven't really been up to par, Outlast is a survival-horror experience that shines through.It's been stated previously that Outlast isn't the most innovative or creative work available, and although that statement rings true on a cetain number of levels, it's definitely a title to consider and invest in, especially if you're a horror-junkie who's looking for some more nightmare fuel.Outlast contains the same atmosphere-type horror as the most-all-around praised Amnesia: The Dark Descent, although it also features several other elements that keep the game flowing smoothly and keep the player on the edge of their seat. The game does contain a good amount of jumpscares along with the overall tense feel of the environment, and even if you're not a fan of cheap spooks, Outlast does a wonderful job of placing them in areas you probably wouldn't expect them to be, getting the best reactions out of the people playing it.Outlast also has fantastic aesthetic value, as the graphics are some of the most realistic I've seen in a long while. That being said, if you want to enjoy the full visual factor of this game, you might want to make sure your computer is up to speed.The game does have its flaws, of course. The story is well placed together, but in order to fully understand it, you'll have to make sure to collect all of the documents and notes you come across, making the experience a bit confusing and monotonous at certain times. I personally also had my dislikes with how the entire thing came to a close at the end, as it wasn't the best wrap-up I've seen.Although it has a few rough spots, Outlast is an overall excellent experience, and I was satisfied throughout the entire game. It's also the only horror title I've ever played that's caused me literal chest pain and nausea. Like, ever. So it's pretty damn good. Pick it up if you've got the coin. A definite must-buy for horror fans."

Right), who takes out a big f** scissor(like the ones Edward Scissor-hand used to have) and chops of your fingers.

,Recommended,238320,7755622,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,[AReV]BavarianGod,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDlctoCOq3shttp://youtu.be/3iuvdRrgUA8You step into the shoes of freelance journalist Miles Upshur as he investigates rumors of corporate misdeeds at Mount Massive Asylum in Colorado. Your red Jeep leisurely glides up the dark path to the front gate recalling Half Life's tram ride into Black Mesa. Upon exiting his vehicle and locating an way into the monolithic nut house it doesn't take long to corroborate the information that led Miles to Mount Massive. The build up to first contact with the horrors within the asylum is classic. Strange noises assault your ear drums, your character's breath becomes shallow and ragged, human figures dart across long halls and lock themselves in rooms and pools of blood stain hallway carpets... Your trusty camera documents your findings and allows Miles to take notes. These notes act as an internal monologue relaying your character's thoughts and feelings. Documents can be collected a la classic Resident Evil and flesh out the motivations of the dastardly Murkoff Corporation. It's a tale that swirls science and religion together in a mostly compelling package.Unfortunately, Miles didn't get his concealed carry license so that he could tote a rocket launcher around under a trench coat like a proper video game hero. Instead he is armed with only a camera that has night vision. It's this feeling of helplessness that is the crux of the game's scares. Upon encountering Mount Massive's monstrosities you are left with two options: run or hide. Most of the lights in Mount Massive don't seem to work anymore giving you plenty of cover to sneak past the mangled psychos that stalk Miles provided you move slowly. If you choose to sprint past the opposition you have keys that allow you to look back and survey your lead. Not every Asylum patient is a threat and this helps keep tension high since figures in the distance can be benign or send you to an early grave. Unfortunately, the pace of Outlast is hampered by a lack of puzzles and a reliance on key collecting or switch flipping for progression. These sections are predictable in addition to being uninspired since flipping switches alerts your psycho stalkers and generally prompts a mad dash for a hiding spot. Proper puzzles might have provided better opportunities for frights as well as encouraging exploration. Outlast is also very linear with few places worth poking your camera lens. Dark corners and dead end rooms often yield extra batteries for your camera or documents that flesh the proceedings out but fail adequately reward players who poke their noses around. Consequently the strict adherence to the critical path means that completing Outlast takes a mere four to six hours.The halls and rooms of Mount Massive are soaked in blood and covered in viscera, sinks are littered with severed limbs and diabolical looking medical instruments are scattered around. It doesn't seem as though the Murkoff Corporation spent much on renovations as the interior of the facility is crumbling and decaying. All of these foreboding details are rendered with a liberal amount of grain and noise giving everything a course texture. Lighting is dynamic and moody and the limited field of vision when viewing the game world through the night vision on your camera is intense. Miles animates well, his hands grasp corners as you peer around them and that way the camera bobs to emulate the motion of his head while running creates a very immersive game experience. The excessive motion blur isn't exactly welcome however and may make players with sensitive stomachs nauseous. Enemies look like they belong in Leatherface's family photo album with their mangled and stitched up visages. It's unfortunate that there are so little variation among them. Also the animations of your foes are not as commendable as those of Miles. They look more clumsy than menacing and watching them slide across the floor as you hide under a bed dimishes their stage presence."

There is a plot, and the use of journal notes makes Miles (and Waylon, if you're playing Whistleblower) easier to connect to as a character without losing imersion. The mechanics of the game work fairly well (though grabbing objects can be a little touchy; not enough to really be even a minor inconvenience), and the actual horror aspects are very well executed. The characters that do speak are interesting and engaging. You also don't want to encounter them in a dark hallway, which - just saying - you will. Often.Anyway. I had a lot of fun being murdered loads of times by guys who somehow found me sitting in a dark corner I couldn't even see in."

You know that mood shortly before it begins to rain? Lighting flashes soft thunder sound mixed with a nice sunset and an old lantern waving in the wind. Controls are easy going and intuitive. Mount Massive asylum is huge. You visit several areas of the asylum where some can be a true pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you run out of batteries. Oh yeah you are equipped with a camcorder that you can proof what you experience in Mount Massive. Every time you use ""night shot"" it is consuming battery power. The ""night shot"" replaces the flashlight in the game.I noticed weather changes during play through - so later in the game it rains cats and dogs. I loved the sometimes slow pace of the game  with lot of hiding in the dark e.g. where you have to get the three fuses - but maybe that´s just me TYLER :) There are fast paced parts alike where you have to run like hell to escape some baddies who just want one thing -  hunt you down! You quickly realize that you are the prey in this game - at the latest when you lose some fingers...All in all the reason I played OUTLAST again and again was the cool asylum setting. If you´re a fan of movies like ""Grave Encounters"" this game could be right for you since Unreal Engine 3.5 does a great job offering you Mount Massive Asylum as a playground. I can nothing but recommend Outlast as it is a great thrillride through an typically 1950´s asylum."

,Recommended,238320,33016515,Posted: 29 June,all,Steel,"This game was amazing, and gave out some really good horror that made me leaning back on my chair.Outlast is a horror survival game that takes place at an asylum. You play as Miles Upshur, an investigative reporter that risked his life to investigate the asylum, and to see what happened. But thank to that, you are trapped with crazy ""patients"" that usually want to kill you. In order to escape, you have to run or hide, and complete the objective it wants you to complete.I know there is a lot more to the story, but the story itself is quite interesting, and describing it more might bring out some spoilers (which I don't want to happen).The gameplay is stealth-base. You aren't a fighter, so you need to hide or run to survive. You can hide in the dark, under a bed, in a locker, or just run for your life (which I don't recommend unless you get spotted.). 90% of the game is dark, so you need to use your night-vision to see where you are going. If you do use your night-vision, it takes up battery, so you need to look for batteries in the area so you don't run out. If you do run out, your night-vision will be quite weak, and you can only see things that are close to you. Miles Upshur takes notes along the way to bring out his thoughts about what's happening (which was a clever way to give his character some development.), and you can pick up documents to find some answers on what happened to the Asylum.The enemies are terrifying. If they find you, they will chase you until you get away. Their A.I. isn't the best ever, but it's good enough to make the enemies intense, since they check lockers, wander around, and look under beds to find you. You never feel safe when they're in the area.The game does have good replayability thanks to achievements and difficulty choices. There are 14 achievements (you need the DLC in order to get all of them, though.), and 4 difficulty options. Normal, Hard, Nightmare, and Insane. On normal, you can hold 10 batteries, the enemies aren't very smart, the enemies don't run as fast as you, you can survive more hits, etc. On harder difficulties, however, the enemies can see and hear you easier, they run more faster, the night-vision drains the battery more quicker, you can't survive 2-3 hits, etc. In fact, on Insane, you have to play through the WHOLE game without saving, so if you die, you need to play the whole game all over again.Most of the characters are quite interesting. You have the main character, Miles Upshur, Father Martin, Chris Walker, The Twins, and much more. Most of them have a personality, and are nicely written.The game looks AMAZING. They did such a good job on the graphics it makes the game even more terrifying, even for today standards. For 2013, it's quite impressive. The levels, character designs, etc. just look really good. The only thing I can say about the graphics is, ""They're amazing.""The soundtrack fits into the game perfectly. When just walking around, it has that calm, disturbing music playing. If there is an enemy in the area, the music will get a bit intense, but not as intense as it gets. But if you are found, the music gets very intense it's really alarming, and it will make you panic. Again, the only thing I can say about the soundtrack is, ""It's amazing.""I do have some flaws, though.-The game can get repetitive with the chases and stealth moments after 3 hours into it.-The game's ending was kind of disappointing.-Some moments were kind of easy to predict what was going to happen.TL;DR: Outlast is a horror game that has a good amount of scary moments with fun gameplay, interesting characters, mind-blowing graphics for 2013, amazing soundtrack, and an interesting story. If you love horror, this is a must buy! If you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Decent, you will enjoy this game.Highly Recommended!"

I learned to always conserve your battery and check everywhere if it costs you a bit of time bu having an extra battery is worth it. Out of all the characters in the main game and the DLC I would say that Richard Trager, and Eddie Gluskin would be the most unique characters that stand out. They actually engage in conversation with Miles, Or Waylon and make the playthrough more enjoyable. However I'd like to state that when I tried to do the insane mode I would have liked for the checkpoint to begin after Father Martin's speech in the lobby after being thrown out by Chirch Walker. I suggest hiding when you need to, be quick on your feet, and always look in the rooms for documents. 8/10 Intact Fingers Agree."

It was originally run by Nazi Germans to conduct researches for the USA, but 1971 it was finally closed - caused by the brutal murder of three scientists.Enough spoilers, let's look at it graphically. I must say, aesthetically this game indeed serverd a great job of giving you the shivers... from dark creepy places to corpse-filled bloody rooms, it has all the horror classics you can imagine... well let's forget about the forest-cliché.

The scares are unexpected, and the tension of being chased, and getting into a door/vent at the last moment is just, ""OHHHHHHHHHHHH!"" It is just so well done! This is probably due to the fact that it's developed by Red Barrels, who have worked on multiple very successful games! They are very good in this field of game. The big devs should get into this kinda stuff. Sorry, going off track!------------------Gameplay and AI-----------The hiding mechanics are amazing! Enimies are obvoiusly on a random data table, for searching through lockers and bed, (ex. there are 27 beds, the AI will check 2 random ones, leave and check back later.) Enimies are smart enough to flank you, go around doors, and even juke you basketball style!------------------Scares----------------------This game perfectly blends scripted scares and non-scripted scares. When an enemy sees you, and the intense chase music starts playing, you know you're screwed! I should also mention that this is a mature, MATURE game. There are some shocking scenes! All in all, the scares and shocks work hand in hand to make a terrifying game!-----------------Characters------------------These are some people you are not gonna forget these phycos! I'll start by saying your character is a mute. An interesting thing is that you do know with this guy is thinking by him writing notes. This is genius, because we are with him the whole , and after a scary event, we get to read his input on that event. I really like this! This is an amazing addition to the silent protagonist. And the inmates, again, no spoilers! You. Will. Not. Forget. Them.-----------------The Verdict/TLDR-----------------This is one of the best modern horror games out there, and besides a few VERY minor glitches, this is one healthy baby boy!

And the fact that it was created by indie developers makes me wonder why all indie developers don't make games of this standard. They did get funding, however it is still a very high-quality game. Well done to the producers too, they made this game very scary, but not so scary that people wouldn't buy it because of the fear level. Now onto my opinions of this game. As you can probably already tell, I'm a fan of this game. I loved every second of it, the excitement, the fear, the horror. I do agree with people who say this game could've been way more horrifying, but at the same time I feel like the developers got it right with the plot, difficulty, build-up to scary moments etc. I also really liked the notes and documents system and the variety in the enemies (variants). Now with the Whistleblower DLC, I really want to say I enjoyed it more than the main game, but I'm just not sure about it. But for a horror game, it has an excellent story. The story and exploration mixed with the notes and documents made me feel like I was immersed in every situation, which, I think, the developers of all horror games should strive for. All in all, Outlast is a very pleasurable encounter for those of you that enjoy being frightened so much that your mind will scream in affliction and writhe in agony due to the malevolent nature of this game. 8.5/10"

,Recommended,238320,25865963,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,DN Ministries,"Summary/ Overview Outlast from a Christian's PerspectiveOutlast is a first-person survival horror game published by Red Barrels on September 4, 2013. You play as Miles Upshur, an investigative reporter that is called in to investigate strange and unlawful practices of Murkoff Corporation. The game takes place from the 1930's to the middle through late 1940's based on a true story around operation paperclip, a true account of criminal records that were kept based on a real insane asylum, also known near this time as Madhouses. In these mental hospitals, patients would be placed in separate rooms on different floors. Some were cannibalistic, others psychotic, some with schizophrenia, others with multiple personality disorders and yet others for a lust of flesh and bone. In fact, the events that take place in this game are so accurate; I believe that the developers in one interview lied on the web that they barely know everything about the greater themes behind their first game,Outlast. I know without a doubt that they know things that they have kept secret out of the view of public eyes, behind closed doors and windows.They force you into severe human deprivation and down a road of fear of human dilapidation in which they reveal the secrets of darkness that is found in Satanism but within the wrong light. They encourage the malpractice of darkness by using biochemical elements that are hidden in the game.Phenomenology, Hegel and Heidegger Overview in the Horror Genre at Its Core, The Tri-Unity of DarknessVisual StimulationThe first main element that they use to trick the mind into confusing your immediate perception, shifts based on the background images and objects, props placed throughout the environment. They use the game's soundtrack to distill the fear and bring the action, fear, dread and a biochemical drug known as dopamine to relax your mind while your conscious and subconscious remain separate from each other.  They use this tactic so then you will be unaware of the hidden themes, messages, objects and props used when you are in the first-person perspective as an insider so you won't be able to see the Satanism and corruption as you go through ' hell' fighting through the dark powers of this world. It is a madhouse full of naked men, naked twins who are deranged that try to murder you, a demonic presence known as ' the Walrider' and an arch-rival on a conquest for blood known as Chris Walker.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is used to drive the action to distract you away from evil presences and evil spirits in the game keeping your mind occupied on something else in which they believe you won't have time to see the other elements used in visual representations and deeper themes only found in the non-perceptible world of metaphysics. Metaphysics, the existence of being, the effect of human deprivation that affects the heart, body, mind and soul. The body being your flesh that desires sin, the mind being the rational, irrational and patterns of negative thinking that your mind reflects on and processes through the connection of the body (flesh) to the mind (theoretical thinking, third-person view as an outsider within the subconscious) and the immediate conscious being the perceptions of your senses through visual stimulation.Outlast 2 SpeculationThere are not as many props and objects in Outlast I as there are in Outlast II in which I have found.For example, though, in Outlast II there are two rocking horses. These rocking horses represent the loss of innocence. One is placed idly while the other rocks back and forth before you get to the well in Outlast II. The rocking back and forth represents the present loss of innocence and dreams which is very noticeable because they place it horizontally, so the gamer notices right before hearing a girl stuck inside a well that transports you towards another dimension in the Pax demo.Examples of the corruption in their new game, Outlast 2 and Links to Human Nature and Human Deprivation as They Apply to deep contextual Metaphysics and Illustrate Real-life ExamplesLinks, Research References (Mostly Outlast II but some blend in with Outlast)1.

Do not let anyone who is a minor play this game. This game is meant for adults only because of the graphic nature, cannibalism, misogynistic themes, homosexuality, castration in the Whistleblower dlc, slander, masturbation, one sexual scene with body on body contact with a dead body, corrupt ethics with the background of the morphogenic engine that is supposed to change the patients composure and mental state to be savages, strong language, nudity, murder, blasphemy and severe themes of human deprivation used to drive the game's influences, themes and Satanism found in two specific areas, the Walrider and in the downloadable content of two people talking among themselves which becomes one person with a multiple personal disorder of dissociative properties that comes after you to chase you before you face Gluskin in the Whistleblower, a deranged man that has replaced men's body parts with women's.Biblical Scriptures that Condemn Outlast and Outlast IIMurder, Injustice, Lust, Revenge (Isa 1:21-26; Matt 5:27-30; Matt 5:33-37; Matt 5:38-42; Matt 7: 15-20 (cf.

Luke 4:31-37); 2 Thess 2: 1-12; 2 Thess 3:11-15).Overall - 8/10 - While the game is consistent throughout and seen by others as entertainment, it is one of the goriest, darkest horror games in the market that is entertaining for the main horror audience, but morally abject towards those who are sensitive. Also, those within religion. I recommend it only because it is a game that needs to be talked about within religion, the Church of Christ and among parents,minors."

The story is clever enough to assemble all themes into a complete picture and tie it with some historical facts, but the most important thing is this: Outlast is really scary. Honestly, no game before has made me feel such strong emotions. Outlast is a must buy for all fans of scary stories. Outlast is a game designed to frighten even those who deem themselves hard to scare. What we have here is a proper survival-horror game that thankfully doesn’t make the transition to the action genre like so many other horror-themed games these days.Outlast’s combination of stealth, platforming and horror is exceptional, the benefits of the diverse experience of its highly talented development team always in plain sight. Outlast hits most of its objectives, serving as head of a new series for the horror subjective."

The amount of detail that can be heard when wearing high quality headphones is impressive and it makes the experience very realistic, besides helping the player project where the enemies are in the darkness of the Asylum.The graphics are incredible. In some parts of the game, you can stare at a certain spot and think: 'What in this image makes me know that it's a game and not real life?' And a lot of times you can't come up with an answer, that's how realistic the graphics look especially with the night vision on the camera.The voice acting is another one of the strong spots of this game. The screams and speeches of the patients sound extremely convincing, making the player question whether those are the screams of actors or actually insane patients. That combined with the high sound quality and amazing graphics makes Mount Massive Asylum a very real place and makes playing the game a more than enjoyable experience.On the other hand, the game lacks a little in story. Not to say that the story is bad, but the dynamics of the game makes the player sometimes forget what he's doing since he's too worried in not dying or getting caught. In other words, it's easy to forget your current objective. This is a very common mistake in horror games, but since Outlast is not very long and since every other aspect is overwhelmingly well done, the lack in story is overlooked by most players.It doesn't hurt to mention that the player will never feel safe during the game, unlike other games with 'safe spots' such as Resident Evil 7. That forces you to take breaks during the gameplay; it's not easy to clear this game in one sitting even though the game is not very long. The game ends just when it's about to become repetitive so the lenght feels perfect. Not too long and not too short.In summary, Outlast is one of the best horror games ever made and it is definitely worth your money if you're looking for something that will keep you up at nights for a while. It's not recommended, though, for those easily frightened and that don't know what they're getting themselves into. 10/10"

Indie gaming has been rising in notoriety in the last five years, reviving old-school genres, like platforming and horror, and offering generally good and refreshing experiences. Red Barrels, a team made of no-more-than-a-handful of veteran dissidents from BIG companies (like Ubisoft, Naughty Dog and EA), and graduates from NAD (National Animation and Design) Center, delivers just that: a good, refreshing experience that shows, just as Amnesia did, that the horror genre is still thriving and innovative, especially in the indie part of the industry.You play as Miles Upshur, an investigative journalist that seeks to uncover the truth behind Murkoff Corporation and its operations at Mount Massive Asylum, in Colorado. As any true horror-game protagonist...hrm, I mean, as any true journalist, he decides to force his way in. However, bad luck strikes, and Miles sees himself trapped as (and with) the inmates of the asylum, with nothing but his camcorder.The story revolves around the 'predicaments' that Miles has to go through in his attempt to escape. Most or all of them are caused by the asylum's inmates, which have taken control of it after a series of shady events, research and experiments. Yeah, cliche as hell itself, but that's how you know it's a horror game. I mean, if it's stupid but it works, it's not stupid. What I'm trying to say is: what matters is how it's worked out. How it's developed, and how it's 'acted'. And it is rather well, I must say. The whole mood is ingeniously maintained at the same tone throughout the game, and the tone is panic-struck after-a-marathon racing-heart beat. Mostly because there is no combat. The only thing you can do besides recording a lunatic violating a dead body, is flee from said lunatic when it goes ape-sh*t on you. Apart for some short interludes, most of your time will be spent either trying to get somewhere while running from someone who is chasing you, or asking yourself how long it has been since the last jump scare, and dreading the impending proximity of the next.I can't emphasize enough how much I love this game's atmosphere. The thrill of carefully opening a door and peer inside to make sure it's safe, or make it to a room before a chaser, and slam the door just barely before he gets there, to slow him down. Looking around a corner or waiting in a locker before the coast is clear, praying that the guy who's after you won't check the one you're in...The sole exception to this rule is the abundance of batteries (needed to use the camera, and its night-vision feature), which are sometimes placed in meaningful places, like next to a radio, but, unfortunately, most are just scattered around. It's not that it's not realistic, but it kinda of spoils the fear of running out of something we desperately need. However, in my second playthrough, I didn't find this to be such an issue, as I wasted far more batteries using night vision, looking for all the documents scattered in the environment (that serve for exactly what you think they serve).But getting back on the discussion of the story, the mood is also really well achieved and maintained when it comes to the characters you meet. They're all completely deranged and insane, obviously, but most have relevant personalities and a good design behind them. I'll point out two examples. First there's this duo you meet relatively early in the game that, albeit their savage and aggressive look and stance, have a somewhat cheeky, but nevertheless dark, dialogue between themselves. Second, sometimes you'll find harmless characters, which come as a great complement to the regular loud murdering sicko. They'll be just minding their business, doing like...things crazy people do.Many say that the story takes a sour turn in the last hour or so, but I don't think it does. What basically happens is, the answer to something that is happening at the asylum slowly begins to turn mythological...but you also feel like it could be dismissed as an illusion or a mirage or something like that. It's never actually explained except in the very end, and this part is somewhat different from the rest of the game. But, it's still very exciting and climatic. The ending is worth it, and the plot twist is probably not what you expected.In the graphics department, I'll kick it off by praising what I think this game does best, and that is lighting. I mean, it's nothing short of perfectly adequate and neatly executed. The light fills the room like it's supposed to, never too dark, never too bright. It really maintains the overall consistency and tone of the game in the best way. But it's even better when there is NO light. Then, Miles will need to use his camcorder handy night-vision feature, which is implemented in a terrific way, not only as a graphical treat but also as a neat gameplay mechanic. The environment is sometimes confusing, but not enough to be a bad thing (it's a horror game, after all, and for better or for worse, it adds to the panic and agitation). The environment design fits the ruined and decadent asylum ambiance like a glove, just like the grainy effects on the screen, when you're using the camera, match the found-footage effect. The animations are competent, not awesome, but, in general the graphics are great.The sound is also top-notch, from the simplest sound effect to voice-acting, even the musical score played when you're being chased. I can't point out one sound I was displeased to hear or that I felt didn't belong there.In conclusion, I say that Outlast is a definite must-buy for all horror games fans. At 20 bucks, it offers one of the best experiences of the genre. It highlights the indie gaming quality and stands as one of the best examples of it (along many other, and increasingly more). The only sour feeling I had playing this game was when I finished it. The game is short (it only takes 5 hours or so) but it doesn't feel short. And that is the mark of a great game."

,Recommended,238320,30692002,Posted: 23 March,all,Malkavian,"Disclaimer:This review may contain spoilers.Outlastset out to be an experiment in first-person horror survival , but unavoidably ended up being an exemplification of a perfect nightmare. This experience follows Miles Upshur, an idealistic journalist that sets out to investigate the horrifying mystery behind Mount Massive Asylum. A must-have for fans of the horror genre that might find themselves jaded by the medium. One of the thingsOutlastdoes so effectively is craft interesting, non-repetitive levels all inside one overarching location. Mount Massive Asylum's hellish level design will burrow under your skin like a bloodthirsty maggot. The puzzles are organic and challenging enough that in order to survive the player will have to balance critical thinking skills with the fear of getting caught by these asylum's demented denizens. You travel through sewers, prison cells, hospital wings, administrative departments, morgues and more -- all unique levels with beautiful lighting, graphics, puzzles and terrifying antagonists.Outlastutilizes atmosphere, classic jump scares, a disturbing narrative and a continous descent into madness, both by the protagonist and everybody around him, to effectively terrify the player.In addition to its beautifully illustrated and masterfully designed levels,Outlastalso effectively incorporates found footage elements into its gameplay. Aspiring directors of the genre should geniunely sit down and play this game if only for the cinematic and storyboard techniques they might learn from it. The crutch of the found footage genre is that ir relies too much and saturated camera techniques, unfocused zoom ins/outs, the infamous ""shaky cam"", low-quality video/audio recording and a lack of clear vantage points (to name a few). And while that might have worked wonders for the films that introduced the genre to the mainstream, such asBlair Wicth Project, orREC, most subsequent movies have failed to reach that standard because they simply craft a story and exploit these techniques.Outlast, on the other hand, manages to incorporate some of these while also introducing new ways to visually tell a story in the found footage format. For example, this game continously switches from found footage [the camera] to first-person POV [protagonist], adding a level of variety to the scene. Moreover, the lighting isn't always the camera's brightly lit flash, or a god for saken source of lighting like a lighter or a phone screen. It introduces night vision, no vision [when the camera runs out of batteries] and so forth to keep the player immersed and terrified.In this game, you are not a fighter, but instead of having a gas lantern like inAmensia: The Dark Descent, you have a cam recorder. This adds a second layer of purpose and functionality to such an item because not only does it illuminate your way through the asylum you're invesgating, but it also allows you to record the events that are unfolding. Moreover, because of the fact that your camera runs on batteries, there's two different settings of lighting you experience throught the game. The first, a brightly lit exposure that while arguably allowing you to navigate clearer and quicker, might alert the monsters lurking around the corner by disclosing your location. The second, a dark mesh of black and green hues that barely allow you discern between dead bodies, monsters and the walls around you.Outlastsuccessfully delivers a continous stream of terrying leves and visuals that make surviving, and puzzle solving, incredibly difficult and engaging. Lastly, the story is also well-written and well executed. You unfold the asylum's myseries either by collecting scattered records and files, or, by literally recording key events with your camera.

However, later on in the game i did find that i was repeating very similar scenario's and tasks. On the other hand, Outlast did not lack jump scares nor did it lack morbid scenarios and messed up acquaintance/enemies. The mystery of who you can and cant approach will also make you semi paranoid and vigilant throughout. Lastly, i found the ending  a slight drag and felt there was alot of unnecessary, mundane tasks to complete. But with that aside i did find majority pretty enjoyable and ran through the whole game in one sitting. If you do decide to play though prepare some extra underwear! >:)"

Play Outlast during mid-day lunch break, in a well-lit room surrounded by your noisy bros. Keep a casual attitude and act like you're showing off the game to your bros. Make Benny Hill noises during chase scenes to lighten the mood.I'm a pessimistic person, a bit depressive and with a bleak outlook on things. I search the darker side of life but I'm really more into the subtle psychological narratives, dark and twisted mind states. Not so keen on jump scares.You prolly want Amnesia - it's on your recommended list, of course. Outlast's story is a bit silly but the moment-to-moment gameplay will be tense, like a primal game of hide and seek. It will make you feel more alive and appreciative of life's sanity-filled moments. Get it on sale.I rather consider myself a regular, socially-adjusted person; would like to get more into horror as this seems to be a catchy genre and looks like fun.You're in luck! Buy Outlast and play it with your dates. Outlast is excellent for a romantic night-in. The saying should go 'Dinner and an Outlast chase' as far as I'm concerned; get that adrenaline pumping and you're in for some disturbing loving.I'm a relatively sheltered person and I'm curious about the horror scene; would be cute to get in touch with my darker side.You're a cutie-pie. Get Outlast right now, play it home alone at night, lights out, headphones on, it will be the start of something wonderful. Meet me for brunch after you finish it so we can share thoughts.I'm like - SO into horror! I just looove Nightmare on Elm Street and that American Psycho thing was oh-my-god I could just see myself in it!Oh boy you're gonna like this. Outlast is a very cheap investment for the success of your next Let's Play! series. Play it with your friends while downing Kahluas and blasting reggae on your surround system. Scream like a little girl when you see something moving in the dark so that your neighbours get some of that entertainment in their lives too!I am a connoiseur of the finest disturbing horror. Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun and Saladfingers all bore me now, played all the Amnesia and Penumbra games back to back - still left me wanting more!You are Chuck Norris. Outlast is actually kind of like your childhood so you will be quite bored. Give it a miss, Chuck.Gore! Violence! Blood for the Blood God!U're drunk. Play Outlast while getting drunk on a sunny Saturday morning. Wheee! Or instead go play GTAV or Assassin's Creed I DON'T KNOW.I want to be the King and Queen of Cheese! Buy some Cheese Cleese?You are the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. You are a mere mortal person wading through a meaningless, vapid, hostile existence. Play Outlast while watching Monty Python and simultaneously slapping yourself very roughly. Delight in feeling something, anything, even if it's mere discomfort.I am a refined individual and enjoy the finer things in life; Cabernet Sauvignon, chess, Arcangello Corelli and 120 Days of Sodom. I like it when the red liquid comes out of people...Save your time old chap, don't buy Outlast; life is your true playground, you can play in real life instead!

The combination of music, atmosphere, graphics all lead up to a very frightening experience.+Great atmosphere. The game takes place mostly in an Asylum.+Graphically, the game is gorgeous. The game makes good use of darkness, forcing you to use a camcorder with night vision to help navigate the environment.+ The gameplay although basic gets the job done. You have no method of combat so you have to rely on stealth, running, peaking around corners to avoid enemies.  The focus is on exploration and solving basic puzzles.+ Music is very well done, really adds to the horror element.+Decent story, most of it is done through records scattered around the levels.+Good length for the type of game. It doesn't wear itself out.The Bad:-The biggest problem I found was that the game relies on the same puzzles throughout most of the game. I.e Find 2 switches, levers, buttons to progress. Overtime it doesn't feel 'natural' to the setting but it starts feeling repetitive.-The AI can feels a bit wonky at times. It becomes hard to predict when they come after you and when they don't and what triggers it.ConclusionIf you've played Amnesia or Slenderman you should know what to expect with this game. The goal is to get absorbed into the world, and try and survive until the end. Your ultimate enjoyment is going to depend on how scared you are going to be and how interested you are in the story.  The length isn't a big issue, as I was able to complete the game in roughly 4 hours. Its a solid length for the game as anything longer and it would start feeling very tedious. I highly recommend this game if your looking for a  good horror game."

Seemed to me that any aesthetic fidelity was hidden amongst the veil of darkness and although it is utterly dependent mostly on the use of your night vision function on your camera, what it does do is provide a fake window of respite as you watch some god awful things through the vista of your camera, false in the hope of any security.I've just completed the game and as a huge fan of horror in general, it's done a brilliant job of capturing the essense of fear with every encounter requiring a flee or hide outcome and I can't think how many hours I've spent hiding underneath beds, in lockers or behind desks, watching the terrifying pacing of a particular psycho brute, waiting patiently for it to go away.The voice acting of the protaganist is absolutely sensational, realised mostly through erratic, frantic and downright panicked breathing to give the player delightfully novel ways of recognising when something is nearby, together with the rapidly increasing heartbeat of your character.The screams, although frequent throughout, are well spaced, with some of the best story pacing I've seen, having brief periods of respite divided amongst some very unconfortable sequences.It's a great story very well told and even though I played most of it with only one ear covered by my headphones and one eye closed from fear, I still think I'm deserving of a congratulations.This game is tough, but absolutely brilliant and well told. Will look forward to grabbing the DLC.100% recommended."

,Recommended,238320,35432993,Posted: 2 October,all,Salty Juniper,"A slice of life game full of relatable characters.But, seriously, sinceI looked like a dumbass with 5 hours of gameplay and 0 achievementsHalloween is coming up, I decided to give Outlast a second playthrough to see if it was as good as I remembered it. And for the most part it is, although I did notice a few flaws. Here's what I got out of this playthrough:Pros+Outlast has some great atmosphere, which is held up by the fantastic sound design, unique characters, and disorienting location. Somewhat similar to Silent Hill, you'll be in a large area full doors, but nearly all of them are locked, which creates a combination of agoraphobia and claustrophobia.+The graphics are also decent. Of course, when you can barely see anything because it's so dark, it's hard to mess up graphics. But not much will beat turning on the infrared camera and seeing eyes glowing in the dark for the first time.+The controls are pretty smooth; running from enemies, jumping over obstacles, and looking over your shoulder all feel very natural. It's easy to get immersed with the level of control given to you. It's kind of like a very simplified version of Mirror's Edge.+And I personally love when you can collect notes to learn about the backstory in a horror game, which Outlast definitely provides, so that's a pretty big plus in my book.Cons-The enemy AI is both predictable and easy to manipulate. Once you realize that a stalker will check all hiding spotsexceptthe one you're currently in (unless you're an idiot who decided to hide while he's looking at you), hiding changes from you being scared of being found to you being annoyed that he hasn't left the room yet.-Some of the jumpscares are kind of weak. I don't mind jumpscares, but in a video game I don't think they're effective when they're part of a cutscene. Basically, instead of thinking ""oh no, I need to run,"" you think ""oh no, I need to watch something happen."" Don't get me wrong, there are some jumpscares that aren't a part of a cutscene, but there aren't many.-But here's probably my biggest complaint: no combat. Now, I'm not some nutcase who picks up a game of Tetris and yells ""WHERE IS THE COMBAT,"" but in a horror game I feel some level of combat is necessary to keep the player scared.Here's myranttheory on it: I think fear is strongest in the middle of a fight-or-flight moment. The harder it is to choose between the two, the more stressful and scary the situation is. Without any fighting, there's no real fight-or-flight moment, because the default choice is always to run away. Because of this, it's probably not much scarier to play the game than it is to watch someone else play.But don't take these complaints too harshly; the game is still very well put together, and worth a playthrough. I'd give it about a 7.5/10."

It may not contain a lot of jumpscares (only few) but in this case they're not necessary because everything else related to horror is pretty much on point. Hence, some spare pants or sedatives may be needed afterwards.The storyrevolves around a journalist who decides to investigate a remote psychiatric hospital. Armed with nothing but a camera you progress through creepy hallways, sewers and bloody hospital chambers. The asylum is surrounded by darkness with only a few exceptions. Your only way of seeing in the dark is to use the night vision setting in your camera which requires a constant battery change (you can find them scattered in random spots). As you learn more about the incident throughout the game, you can find out even more by collecting documents and completing recordings.Sound effectsin both horror games and movies are obviously essential for a  good thrill. Outlast has top notch sounds, ranging from simple door creaking and running on different surfaces to sobbing and screaming in agony.The musicis also great and fits the genre well, however, I couldn't hear the dialogue for the most part as you can't adjust the music volume at all. Overall, it's a quite short game, requiring around4 hoursto finish it, so I'd recommend buying this on sale.P.S. do yourself a favor and play late at night with lights off and headphones on.7.5/10"

Outlast puts you in the shoes of an investigative journalist called Miles; he wishes to explore an asylum whose name and address were specifically mailed to him by one of the asylum's employees stating there are horrible things going on and that he should promptly investigate.Upon arrival you immediately notice that the game gives you a camera and... nothing more. In the dark the device's night vision mode provides you with visibility but that's all - Outlast does not give you any weapons. Those of you who played Frictional Games' Amnesia may find the concept similar - yes, here, just as in Amnesia, the dark places are your best friend. When encountering enemies you immediately need to hide as you can easily die after a couple of hits.As your equipment consumes batteries you frequently need to search for these throughout the game. And while the game's story unfolds as you progress further it's worth checking every corner for collectibles - these are dossiers further explaining the things going on in the facility.The atmosphere is one of a kind! The game reminds you of those found-footage horror flicks that started in 1999 by Blair Witch Project. While in well-lit (or barely lit) places you do not need to use your camera it is still advisable as Miles takes notes only when pointing his camera at certain things / events. Through these notes can you really see how he's getting more and more desperate and crazy as he further ventures into the horrors of the asylum!The game is full of scripted events. While you think hiding is always successful, sometimes Outlast wants you to be seen by a monstrous, homicidal patient and deliberately puts you in a chasing sequence. Miles can easily vault over the obstacles  while running but nothing is more frightening when you have just escaped into a room and just closed the door behind you but you can hear the bashes of your enemy on the door while trying to hide!Graphics look good thanks to Unreal Engine 3. But the game's score and sound effects make it stand out! There is a reason why a lot of people say a headset is a must! While it is an indie game Outlast offers you roughly 5-6 hours to complete the story. Greater difficulty settings give you fewer batteries and those of your thriving for the maximum can complete the game on Insane difficulty: here there's no checkpoint so in case you die you can start it all over again!Outlast is a great game! It has a terrifying atmosphere not many horror games can offer these days. Its DLC completes the story for you and helps you with some unanswered questions.

Armed with only a camcorder that has night vision capabilities, you must survive.Set in a first-person point of view, Outlast is very much like a playable ""found footage"" horror movie; most of your time will be spent looking through your trusty camcorder, which will help you navigate immensely dark areas. Crazed lunatics and mental patients litter the tight corridors and open expanses of the game, most of which have some sort of deformity; be it mutilated flesh, or stumps where a limb should be. Many are harmless, and will chatter nonsensically, while others are out for blood... your blood. There are a small handful of primary bad guys that you will repeatedly encounter, all of whom are utterly gruesome and terrifying in their own way. You're no fighter, so you must run, hide, and outsmart your foes in order to navigate beyond them.Much of the interaction between you and the enemies in the game consists of a mixture of chase and stealth sequences. An enemy will burst in out of nowhere, and it's up to you to find the nearest place to duck into; a locker, under a bed, behind a shelf. Sometimes the only thing that you can do is keep running. While these intense moments will make your heart palpitate, and the hair on the back of your neck stand up, near the end of the game it really gets both redundant and expected. Found a key? Well, I guess I'll go hide in this conveniently placed locker because Mr. Huge Pecks is going to come stomping down the hallway any second now! This is really the only downfall of Outlast, and honestly with the deep atmosphere and immersive graphic quality of the game itself, it hardly takes away from the scare factor that the title has. Not to mention, each of these foes has a lavish background to indulge in if you take care to read the collectible documents and notes.While exploring the gore-soaked, entrail-laden rooms, hallways, and basements of Mount Massive Asylum, you will come across various documents and camcorder notes (if you have your camcorder on during certain events) that will give a large insight into the storyline of Outlast. It seems that the facility that you're exploring has been used for religious surgeries and scientific experiments that have turned many patients into unholy abominations. Many of the ill have been subjected to deranged forms of hypnosis, which has caused their mental state to deteriorate rapidly. Even the doctors have gone rabidly insane. It would be a travesty to suggest that this title relies on jump scares, but the ones that are placed sparsely throughout the gameplay are completely unexpected and scream inducing.The biggest majority of Outlast centers around navigating from one area to the next, although the game never feels like a walking or key-finding simulator. There are a few puzzles to solve, which usually involve turning a couple of things on or grabbing a couple of items to help you progress; typically while avoiding an enemy that's filled with bloodlust. While this may sound tried, true, and typical for so many horror games, Outlast just does it the way it should be done. This title really brings out all of the stops with AAA quality graphics, detailed atmospheric lighting, memorable characters, constant environment and AI interaction, an extraordinarily suspenseful soundtrack, excellent enemy AI, and some of the most dense atmosphere of any horror game that I've ever experienced; and trust me, I've played nearly every horror game that there is.Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Outlast is one of the greatest survival horror games since Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4. I would go as far to say that as of this moment in time, it is the best modern horror survival title. No, you don't fight. No, you don't have a gun. You're a regular journalist, and you must use your wits to survive truly insane, deadly enemies. If you're like me, and you love games that are dripping from every corner with blood and gore, boast noteworthy bad guys, have a captivating storyline, and pull you in with an impenetrable atmosphere, then Outlast is the horror game for you. Also consider picking up the Whistleblower DLC, which is a phenomenal prequel addition to the main game.Rating:5.0/5.0- An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Recommended,238320,9367072,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,Guy in the Chair,"The GameOutlast is incredible! It's a horrifying, psychologically-driven, intense game of survival as you, Miles Upshur, try to escape Mount Massive Asylum (and find out what happened there). What most of you are probably wondering is this: ""Is it scary?"" YES, scary like no other game before it. It does use jump scare tactics, but don't let that discourage you. There's much more to Outlast's fear than that. One thing to note: the game's ending won't please everybody. It leaves a lot of things unexplained. I thought it was a well-done, open-ended conclusion, but no matter what you think of Outlast's ending, the journey there is definitely worth experiencing. 9.5/10.The DLCOutlast: Whistleblower is this game's pièce de résistance. I'm not sure if I'd say it's better, but it's definitely more well-done in many respects. Whistleblower helps to clarify a few key plot points that weren't explained in the main game. Here you play Waylon Park, the source within Mount Massive that tipped off Miles, the original game's protagonist, to the horrors going on within the asylum. Whistleblower works as both a prequel, showing what happens leading up to Miles' arrival at Mount Massive, and a sequel, showing what happens after the ending of the original game. And there's so much fear to be had in between those two points. I'd venture to say that Whistleblower is scarier than the base game, but its extreme use of graphic, unsettling content (moreso than the base game) doesn't sit well with some. You be the judge. The DLC also opens up some new plot points and then fails to even address a couple of them. This is my only problem with Whistleblower, but it isn't a huge one. If you're going to get the game, get the DLC along with it or you're going to missing out on a lot. Also: the ending to Whistleblower is great and answers the burning question we all had about the base game's ending (and then some). 9.5/10."

The whole world just gives off this ominous feeling and you are unable to shake it throughout the entire game. If there is one game that I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone, whether you're a fan of horror-games or not, it would be this game. This game will ruin all other games for you and I am hoping that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (which is due for release in a few days), can duplicate the standard that this game just set for me for horror games, if not heighten that standard. I applaud Red Barrel Studios for this amazing work of art.This has renewed my faith in the Horror Genre of video games.UPDATE:So I have decided to update this for the DLC that just came out, Whistleblower.  Whistleblower overall was a good game and followed suit with the original Outlast feel and atmosphere (which is a good thing!).  It did however become repetitive in its nature and being able to consistantly run-away from the enemies (and know you can without being caught) really began to dull the game experience and take the 'scare' out of it.  I wil say that I thoroughly enjoyed the new enemies and the freaky environment jump-scares.Overall, up to the point of the DLC Whistleblower, I would give this game a 3-3.5 out of 5.  I feel that the game becomes too predictable after a certain amount of time and doesnt really push the importance of batteries onto the protagonist.  You can take pretty much all the time you want in the world and study the enemies patterns which makes it a lot easier/less scary.  I am hoping that the next DLC proves to be more unpredictable but I absolutely LOVED the ambience that was introduced during Whistleblower."

Outlast, which is a journey through an insane asylum that has become a true hell on earth, is Red Barrels' pride and joy, if you want my opinion on it. If you haven't played the game, allow me to explain how its scare factor is significantly high.Similar to games like Amnesia and SCP: Containment Breach, Outlast is a survival-horror game where you only have three options, which (as stated in the intro of the game) are as follows: run, hide, or die. While this may make Outlast seem like a sort of ripoff, there are a few major differences, the greatest being the camcorder and how it is implemented into the gameplay. Not only is the camcorder your only means of navigating the dark via infrared vision, it also gives you the ability to get info on what happened in the story by recording certain events as they happen before you. This, to me, makes Outlast stand out to the other horror games I have played.While the game does tend to get rather repetitive at some points, what with a find a few things while avoiding homicidal enemies in the process, this is only a minor flaw that can be overlooked if you try hard enough. Story, setting, ambience, and quite a few other things make this game feel like what a found footage film should aspire to be.What really sells this game to me are the enemies themselves. Known as the ""Variants,"" the enemies of this game come in all shapes and sizes, quite literally. The unique Variants are the most effective means of terrifying the player, and their backstories (explained via documents found as you go through the asylum) make them even more monstrous.If you're into scaring the pants off of yourself this Halloween (or any time of the year, really), I suggest you get Outlast. And if you have a little extra coin, put it into the Whistleblower DLC, which adds in a completely new story that ties in to the main game almost perfectly! This game is the scariest I've ever played, and I'm certain it will scare the pants off of you as well."

On the contrary, both those things are a major plus in my view and continue to be. My problem with it though is the game's dynamic. I'm all for Stealth-Horror gaming. I am. ""Forbidden Siren"" is one of my favourite Horror games of all time and that's all about stealth. However, there isn't really that much to elevate ""Outlast"" above the the rest of the pack in this regard, at least not in my view. The game is a simple case of open door, fumble around in the dark, cower in a locker while the lunatic looks for you and then edge your way out hoping in vain that he doesn't catch you.And, try as you might, the homicidal nutjobs almost always catch you, which would be fine if you could defend yourself somehow. Now I realise that there is a message at the start of the game telling you that your character isn't fighter. I get that. I get that in that sort of scenario most of us would be overwhelmed with fear and fly into a blind panic. However, in a game where you are being stalked by a host of crazies who want you dead and you are surrounded by potential weapons, you do tend to find it a little frustrating that you can't simplay pick up a lead pipe and cave the lunatic's brains in.It's probably also got a lot to do with the fact that, if you are going to make a stealth game, I think it makes more sense to make it in third person. First-person stealth games tend not to work very well in my experience because you really aren't doing very much in them so character detail is important to maintain audience interest.As I said, ""Outlast"" is great as an atmospheric experience and on those grounds alone, I know a lot of people love it. Me, not so much. I felt very similarly about SOMA as well, so I don't know...maybe it's just me?"

You play as a reporter, who gets an email saying some dark things are happening in an insane asylum (why didn't the person who send the email just contact 4 stoners and a dog?), and you try to find out what happened. The gameplay is similar to Amnesia, where you can't fight back, leaving you to hide, or outrun your persuers. What I loved about this game is that it uses jumpscares correctly, because they happen to suprise you so your defenses would go down, rather than trying to scare you. The graphics are great, and it makes the game feel more 'alive'. The enemies are quite horrifying, and the ones that scared me the most were the twins and the doctor (I forgot his name), not because they jump out at you, but because what they do to you. I would recomend this game to avid horror fans, and I am personally astounded by the game, but I am a little dissapointed at the length of the game, lasting around 3 to 4 hours long if you don't try to find everything. Overall, I love this game, and I can't wait to get whistle blower.(Update) I have gotten whistleblower on sale, and boy is it horrifying! I was not as scared playing outlast because I was playing with my cousin, and whistleblower gives you more reasons to be afraid. The main character in whistleblower is Waylon Park, who is a computer engineer for the mental asylum, who tries to tell Miles (the main character in Outlsat) about the happenings in the asylum. Before Waylon could send the message, he is taken and experimented on, but escapes and tries to find a way out. I have not beaten the game, but the enemies are really unpredictable, and Whistleblower is a great addon to Outlast. ONLY PLAY IT AFTER YOU HAVE BEATEN OUTLAST, AS WHISTLE BLOWER HAS A LOT OF SPOILERS! I will add more to the review after I beat whistleblower."

The atmosphere is phenomenal and extremely well put together. Paired with the music and sounds, it can't get any better.As for the actual gameplay, Outlast needs a little thinking involved. You shouldn't expect for everything to be clearly marked for you. Outlast does, however, get a little repetitive - grab your three items to unlock this or fix that and you advance, all the while a monster patient is lurking around. It can get to feel a little repetitive, but if you're like me, you won't exactly notice. You'll be too busy trying to keep yourself alive and complete the objective. One downfall I did notice, besides the repetitveness, was the length. I've realized that most modern horror games aren't incredibly long, and this game follows the rest. I do wish there was more story to find, more gameplay, and a change in pace - i.e. reduce the repetiveness and try something different with the flow of the game, which is something we can hope for in Outlast 2.Outlast was a terrifying experience for me. There are gruesome cutscenes, jumpscares, and chase scenes. The characters are certainly twisted individuals. You can almost feel the pain, fear, and adrenaline that rushes through Miles Upshur, the protagonist in the story. His emotions are very well conveyed to the player. Not only Miles's emotions, but the various patients' emotions, as well. Plot twists, unexpected events, perfectly conveyed emotion, and a fantastic story really add to the game's atmosphere.This is a game I will recommend one hundred times over. Very fantastic game with great features. It can certainly send chills up your spine."
,Recommended,238320,9466822,"Posted: 14 March, 2014",all,VictorSeven,"When I first saw Outlast, I was intrigued. In the midst of so many Slender clones and games full of cheap, ineffective jumpscares, I was craving a sense of depth with a horror game. I found that depth in Outlast.Taking the role of an investigative journalist acting on an anonymous tip, I entered Mount Massive Asylum and soon found myself creeping slowly through the seemingly abandoned wards, straining for any sounds beyond my own footsteps, jumping at my own shadow. The game's atmosphere is the best I've ever experienced, bar none. It forgoes the cheap horror tradition of relying on screams and musical stings, and instead uses your entire environment - creaking floorboards, closing doors, lightning and thunder, even distant, ragged breathing - to set you on edge and keep you there the entire time.The game is brilliantly rendered, with stunning visuals and graphic depictions that truly reinforce the feeling that you've just stepped into hell on earth. The effects of the game on the main character become more and more apparent, and you'll notice a few types of damage you sustain stay with you for the entire game. The broadness of the creativity I experienced in the multitude of different settings kept me guessing, and the changes in venue served to take me out of my comfort zone JUST when I thought I was beginning to calm down. The pacing was perfect.Gameplay was astonishingly spot-on. No glitches or bugs, and I was delighted to find that the main character, Miles, has a bit of parkour ability. Somebody put Mirror's Edge in a horror game? My character actually has a chance at running? I've never experienced that before, and the feeling of having a slight chance to survive while skillfully vaulting desks, hopping up to catch a ledge, and hanging out a window to avoid a pursuer, makes the experience both more terrifying and exhilarating when you narrowly escape with your life. The game makes you think, and if you forget to look up, you will die.The story was phenomenal. Mount Massive, even in the state of its decay, is a living, breathing thing. With characters such as Chris Walker, Rick Trager, Dr. Wernicke, the Twins, Father Martin, and the Walrider, I found myself morbidly curious about how they came to be, and was delighted to find many answers. The Notes and Documents system added a whole new dimension of depth that made many of these characters more than just ""the monster you run from."" Learning about Chris Walker's origins, his motivations, how the Walrider came to be, the project that put Rick Trager in charge of his own ward, the truth about Dr. Wernicke... the list goes on. There is so much information on the things you're running from that it begins to change your mind, and in some cases, you actually begin to understand some of these characters.Overall, this game is one of the most tense, terrifying experiences I've ever faced... and I'm tough to scare. Bravo, Red Barrels. I can't wait for the Whistleblower DLC. To see Let's Plays of Outlast, visit VictorSevenGames on YouTube. And buy this game!"

Not only is it terrifying thanks to an utterly disturbing atmosphere, finely-crafted jumpscares (yes, it can be done) and a forboding musical score, it's also relentless and will never let you rest. Need a breather? Too bad, cos the psychopath behind you wants to wear your head like a hat, and he ain't gonna take no for an answer. You reckon you've been in a situation game-wise that made you feel completely helpless? Unless you've played Outlast, you don't know squat, pal.Now some reckon that Outlast is a tad overrated, usually pointing out the flawed story and questioning why the protagonist doesn't simply leave the asylum. But honestly, in an era where every other horror game has either fallen victim to trends, turned themselves into an action-adventure game (looking at you, Resident Evil), or given up the ghost completely, this phenomenal game is a welcome return to decent, principled horror. Red Barrels (the development team) understands tension, atmosphere, and knows how to leave you beaten,  bloody, bruised, and begging for more.It's a staggeringly beautiful, lovingly crafted and deliciously creepy game that has well earned the praise it has received. Any self-respecting horror fan will have this gem nestled among the rest of their collection."

Whether it's movies or video games or a haunted attraction I'll be a part of it. Outlast is one of the few games to actually make my scream and afraid to play alone. Of course that is due mostly to the concept of having to run and hide from all my enemies. The design of the characters aren't necessarily the best however if you think ""What if I saw this in real life?"" You'd know you would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself. The game also has a minor story that is easy to follow if you read just a few of the personal notes. I found it interesting but nothing major or new. The worst part about this game was the repetition of tasks usually involving the ""Activate these 3 things to get this only so you can activate 3 other things!"" But the game isn't designed to be anything new, just scary. I give this game a 8.5/10, loses points for subtle story and repetitive tasks but c'mon you know your playing to get scared."

Theres no fighting, only running like Amnesia but you only can hide in preset locations like lockers or by cowering behind objects. Added to that is alot of trial and error where you come into a new area and immediately dudes start chasing you so you bumble around and then die a few times until you figure out where to go and how to get there unscathed (or maybe its just me?). In Amnesia you could compensate much more easily for ♥♥♥♥ups and explore more easier since pretty much every shadow was a place to hide. Makes this game feel alot more static in comparision.Theres bosses of some sort and i wish the game woulda kept to them for chasing you around or at least make the standard mooks disposable because seriously, after the umpteenth one those arent really scary anymore and id rather wander around looking at giblets sprayed on the walls or wondering if a corpse is only faking it instead of slamming face first into walls because i gotta run from some dorky freak with a piece of wood again.Also the night vision camcorder is a neat idea and graphical effect with an interesting impact on gameplay - as long as you get to use it sporadically. Unfortunately it gets very very overused in particular towards the latter third of the game. After an hour of having green burn into my retinas those sections of the game became a ♥♥♥♥ing annoyance rather than scary. The game made up for it with a maybe clicheed but nevertheless refreshingly different endgame section tho.So why am i recommending this despite trite gameplay and the developers being too lazy to do the lighting for a level or two or three? Because of the atmosphere. Great graphics, great music, the levels are diverse enough for being all in an asylum setting, the jumpscares are spot on and not too many and its also deliciously grody. Stinky corpse piles for the whole family!"

Don't know why I am here or what the hell passed in my mind that day. I'm a freelance journalist and due to economy crisis I had to find a good, impressive, fresh article to jump out of the mess and start to be someone again. There were stories about this asylum....stories never confirmed because no one had the guts to come here to prove them somehow. But that could be my only chance. The night I decided to come here it was dark and rainy, the desolation around the asylum got my attention immediately. I've opened the gate slowly, a shrill sound came from it. Suddenly something moving from one of the window, really fast I've pointed my camera and zoomed. A shadow, really fast, ran all over the room then it disappeared into nothing. I moved slowly towards the door, it was open so I went inside. My footsteps echoed in the corridor, when I've reached the hall a dead body on the floor, totally immersed into his own blood. My heart started to pump faster as I turned around and I've start running fast towards the entrance door. I've reached it but it was closed! Closed from the outside! In few second I've heard a laugh and suddenly a voice...""you are one of us now"", I turned around fast and I saw someone looking at me with blood eyes and an evil smile on his face. In total panic I entered a room and I've slammed the door behind me. ""There is no place to hide!"" Screamed the voice from outside, and few second later the light went off. I've searched my camera as fast as I could but It was too late.....there was something....or someone....breathing....BREATHING....near me...It was too dark, I wasn't able to see nothing...some footsteps, more and more close to me...my heart stopped for a bit...I felt the sweat running down on my forehead....suddenly a hand....A DAM HAND ON MY ARM...I could felt it....it moved up and down in my arm...then a voice...whispering ""....Don't worry...there is no turning back for you....you are us...you can't escape...""My breath started to be more and more hard as I runned away randomly inside the room.  I stumbled on something and I fell down as the voice started to scream ""WHERE DO YOU THINK TO GO?"". Fastly I grabbed my camera and by pressing randomly I've managed to activate the flash to light the room. I saw a door...but I even saw him...his clothes were dirty of blood...his face full of scars...and he was holding an axe in his hand...still dirty with fresh dripping blood...I jumped up and, with shaking legs, I've tried to reach the door, I went out and I've started running along the corridor. All the lights were  turning off one by one, I've looked at my back and he was chasing me! He slowly disappeared into the dark that, as an hungry animal, was eating all the light in that place!

And Outlast has scares in bucketloads.A thick atmosphere help sell the world and tension that you could cut with a knife makes makes this one of the best example of the genre in recent years.There are one or two collect-em-up sections that break the immersion somewhat as you need to use trial and error to avoid enemies, and end up being more frustrating than terrifying.In all, you should definetly give this one a try if you're a fan of survival horror.

,Recommended,238320,7989112,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Sam Hamwich,"Games of the horror genre usually don't hold my attention well, (either because I find them a bit over the top in the scare department, or they are lacking in anything but jump scares).  Outlast however somehow manages to keep me playing, and feeling nervous at the same time.Before I go into any sort of detail let me place Outlast's concepts in 3 simple steps.Step 1- Give players an eerie atmosphere with a basic creepy concept, such as I don't know, say an insane asylum? (Wait this does work, trust me)Step 2- Tap into the human psych and our deep down fear of being chased and hunted and place them in an interactive story 20 inches from our faces.Step 3- Continue to attack that primal fear relentlessly until we actually have to put down the controller/keyboard/mouse.  Then make us come back so we can experience this thrill as soon as our heart rate settles down again.This shouldn't be a working formula for a good game, but for some reason, this works fantastic for Outlast.This basic bit of thought pattern is what I call the ""Outlast Effect""(Yes i have been using this term out of the game!) The best way to describe this sensation is when you turn out the last light in the basement and quickly run up the stairs because you can feel or sense something lurking in the dark behind you.Given the fact that your character is only equipped with a video camera, which can record the horrors you face( and also provides you with semi-good night vision), the action can get quite intense.Outlast often makes you feel like someone is watching you, and this is usually the case.  You always feel as if around every corner you'll get a nasty surprise or find someone who wants you dead.  Yes, there are a bunch of jump scares, but they are very well placed and they seem to be placed strategically rather than in obvious spots.  The true horror this game provides is during its countless chase scenes. The game mechanics can add to this sensation greatly if you choose to use them well.  You can spin your head to look backwards to see if the enemy chasing you is gaining ground, you can also dive through doors, turning quickly to slam it shut on your pursuers. You can hide under beds, in lockers and sneak through small cracks that you can barely squeeze through.  The ability to hide from the enemy makes it interesting as well, and the AI reacts quite well to finding you.  Early in the game they rarely check for you in the correct hiding spots but as the game progresses the enemies seem to act more randomly and tend to catch you hiding more often. The game mechanics work excellent in this setting as well.  The mental hospital provides small narrow corridors, which are perfect for providing you with a claustrophobic feeling once the bad guys start chasing.The sound in this game is fantastic, from your character's breathing when you are hiding, to the sounds of the mumbling maniacs pursing you down the narrow corridors.  The different types of enemies come with their own sounds, some of the larger baddies carry chains, and one even has a massive pair of scissors.  You can often hear muffled footsteps in a room close by, or echoes down long corridors.  The music is very well orchestrated to fit the tone of being helpless and it seamlessly fades in and out according the danger.The visuals are also done well, the graphics are on par with any of the newer releases and the animation is fantastic.  When learning around corners your hand can be seen pressing against the walls or doorframes.  These items may seem like small detail, but that's actually what makes a good game noticeable in my opinion.Overall this is a fantastic addition to anyone's steam library.  The story is a bit lacking and considering the action is all about hiding and fleeing rather than fighting it may not be for everyone.Outlast gets a 9/10, and a big thumbs up!SamHamwich out."

,Recommended,238320,769669,"Posted: 5 September, 2013",all,Vegan Atheist,"It's uncommon for someone to finish a game in one sitting. However, this is one of those games. Yes, this game is somewhat average in length, 5-6 odd hours, however I believe it is the the most atmospheric game of 2013, after Metro: LL. You play as a journalist who goes to an insane asylum somewhere in Colorado with nothing but your camcorder and a handful of batteries to investigate allegations of torture and other misuses of inmates. 10 minutes in and you fight for your life. The only supplies that you scavenge are batteries. If use your camcorder as well as its night vision your battery will drain twice as fast.This game combines the best elements of Penumbra, Call of Cthulhu, Amnesia and forges a whole different monster of a game. The voice acting is outstanding, the level design is impeccable, the level of gore and nudity is unparalleled. This game does not attempt to scare you with cheap scares, it succeeds in terrifying you. There is necrophilia, torture, beheading, impalement, hanging, disemboweling, you name it - Steven King would stain his pants if he played this.The graphics are outstanding. Especially the realistic furniture design coupled with rich textures - a remarkable feat with the Unreal Engine.The gameplay: very few games from a first person perspective nail the concept of playing as a human, and in this game it FEELS like you are playing as a human in every sense of that concept. First off, you see your legs and you cast a shadow, THANK YOU. You cannot punch or kick, you are practically defenseless, you can climb up, climb down, you can crawl, you can peek from the behind corners while holding the wall with your hand, you can look behind you when chased, you can jump just far enough to be able to get a hold of that ledge 2-3 yards in front of you, you can hide under the bed or inside the lockers or inside the stalls and you can lurk in the dark corners waiting for your foes to pass by, you can hear your character's heartbeat as well as his erratic breathing and scream from sheer horror or pain and you can be wounded, permanently... No other game was able to capture this amount of atmospheric survival tension.Just when you think you grew enough balls to be able to withstand the next encounter the game proves you wrong, lest you are able to think quickly on your feet, discern boarded up doors from the unlocked ones and be able to run and not get cornered. When encountered by a brute, you get one freebie - a slight knock around. Second time you get caught - you die. Most asylum residents are docile and oblivious, some are frightened more than you are, some strut around with their junk hanging like they own the place, ready to punch you and gut you if necessary. When you play the game without dying for 30 or 40 minutes you truly feel that payoff - as if you yourself were able to avoid a brutal death and the game provides you plenty of opportunity to live long enough without reloading if you are patient and agile enough.The game is hard but it is also fair. Stealth is essential, noise is death and your ears are just as important as your camcorder. You won't always be able to see your enemies, but you should be able to hear them approach. The game tries its best to differentiate between locations, puzzles and succeeds in doing so for the most part.When hiding you sometimes have to guess which one of the hiding spots the enemy won't check out. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't, but it's always best to get the hiding spot as far away from the door as possible.The only few things that stand out is that you cannot turn the music off, which, actually fits in pretty well and helps build up tension although I'd prefer total silence when it comes to these things. Your character is pretty much mute when it comes to dialogue. Also, I would add the option of playing the game with permadeath mode.I am happy to be living in an age when these types of games can be made. This is the first time when I tried recording my reactions while playing this game much like those youtubers do with Amensia, Horror House 2, etc.We don't get too many well-made horror survival games and this is definitely it."

I wasn't too impressed and assumed I had simply missed out on the best parts, so I had to purchase it for myself during this Steam Summer Sale. It was a measly $2.99 so it wasn't a big deal, but I played through it from beginning to end in an evening and felt like it lacked severely. It was a cheap jump scare game, like a psychological thriller for teenagers. The Ring, or The Grudge, but the video game. I was bored, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has to be careful about how and where they invest their time.I played it with my girlfriend as the audience and she enjoyed watching it but also agreed that it was a cheap scare game."

,Not Recommended,238320,32732976,Posted: 24 June,all,dawhoopmaster,"Where do I start? This game isn't scary in the slightest (alright, mayne the Walrider is) but other than that, this game lacks fear, other than when you play it for the first time and fell scared out of uncertainty.Chase sequences are frequent and repetative, and are usually always having you followed by Chris Walker, there is very little enemy variety.Green was always my favourite colour, but after this, I'm honestly sick of it. It's a horror game, it's dark, I respect that. And since there's a camera, night vision was an effective way to let players roam the darkness. But this has to be used so often my eyes got tired of just seeing green everywhere.Going back to what I said about chase sequences, there more repetative gameplay to talk about. It's either ""Find a key (or other object) or  ""Turn on valves"" or ""Hide from Chris Walker.""This next one isn't necesseraly a problem, but don't buy this expecting you'll have plenty to play. I'll admit, I didn't finish it, but from what I've seen of gameplay videos, I'm pretty close. Yet I only started playing this morning, and since I've got an exam next week I haven't been playing all day.And finally, if you've watched AVGN you may recognise the term ""this is one of those where the f*ck do I go kinda games."" This sums up Outlast. Constant running around the same area trying to figure out where you're supposed to go next, and as for the objectives, they don't make it 100% clear what you're supposed to do. I ended up depending on switching back and forth from walkthrough video to game, playing what I'd just seen. I don't like to depend upon walkthroughs/let's plays alot, I always try to play a game myself before watching it. But because I had no clue what to do here, I really needed them just to get where I did, and it's not even the end!Overall, Outlast is ""Ok"" maybe. But once you get past the scene with Richard Tragger, the game really wears off and becomes the same thing over and over again. It's not a hard game, yet it's frustrating. I enjoyed it at first, but after playing it for only a little while, it became boring, repeatative and each scene really lacked in difference. The first half is good, but after that, the developers really began running out of ideas, and just began to milk the same and same thing, over and over again, until the end, where they got it back a little. (Just to note, no I haven't got to the end, just seen it, also, I do not intend on playing this to the end, despite being close to it.)(UPDATE: I have now finished the game. Outlast is good, but I still stand by a majority of what I said in this review. The first half is good, but then it just gets repetative until the final scene with Billy Hope and the Walrider breathes new life into it.)"

,Recommended,238320,832445,"Posted: 21 September, 2013",all,rgk,"Great game. Very intense, with a very good gameplay. Despite being an independent game, it truly feels like an AAA production.The chasing and hide-and-seek sequences inspired by Amnesia are actually way better than Amnesia. Though the level design is a bit too forgiving early game, making the encounters easier than they should. It gets better later, but at that point the player is not surprised anymore. Though I suppose it's to allow everyone to be able to go past the beginning.I tend to hate cheap jumpscares, but I actually found the jumpscares in Outcast very well thought out. They surprise but do not feel cheap, and they achieve the best possible result: scare the player when he feels safe, then keep the player on edge when there is nothing to fear.It all seems well, what's the catch?The game can feel a bit repetitive, though it's always enjoyable thanks to the good gameplay and the 'mirror's edge'-like body awareness and movement.The real bummer is the story that falls a bit short towards the end. It's all blood and guts, not a fascinating story and atmosphere. Unlike Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, that outdoes Outlast in the fascinating 'psychological horror' department."

If you are not a fan of the horror genre, do not ask if the game is scary or not. Even though it is a matter of preference what exactly you find scary, this game is definetly scary. It's got suspensful chase scenes, jump scares, and just plain general creepy-ness.BUTThis game is not only scary, but it also has a very intriguing storyline as well. Both the main game and DLC are linked together, and you will discover more about the universe within the game in Whistleblower.Though Whistleblower is a prequel (without giving away too much) towards the end of the DLC, the timeline syncs up with the main game and you see some of your actions unfold from the main game.Also Samuel Laflamme has done a magnificent job with the score to this game. It's an eerie mix of creepy and beautiful, which really adds a whole new level of immersion to the game.All in all this is a fantastic game, and is definetly worth full price."

It felt far longer. I played about 2 hours per-sitting ... that was my ""sanity limit"". This is the first true survival-horror game I ever played.The ""Dead Space"" series (and all the zombie genre) is an example of a very different survival-horror theme, one where you have a means of defending yourself, of fighting back, even of ""winning"".Outlast has no such illusions. In this game, you get a palm-sized camcorder with a ""night view"" option, and that option really drains the battery. And a notepad, that you can't control, you make notes as dictated by the game. You have nothing else. You will be scrounging for batteries within the first hour.You're just a guy. A struggling reporter looking for your big break. You can run, you can jump, you can crawl, you can try to hide ... that's all you have, those are your only options.You'll quickly develope a fear of everything ... you'll encounter horror's that you aren't prepared to view ... visceral, bloody, ... real. I can honestly say that you'll wish you did not see some of the things that happen in this game ... You will jump in your seat, you will shout out-loud, your pulse will race, you will know true fear ...Everything that I've told you will happen ... to you ... and that is what makes this game so amazing.Note: I honestly feel this game should be rated Mature with an NC-17 label. Even 17 year-olds may be too young.I loved this game. I'm 51 years old and I ran ""like a school-girl"" with my heart racing ... actually cringing and leaning forward over the controls as if that would help me avoid being grabbed by what was chasing me.The first 90% of this game will force you to the edge ... the last 10% ... maybe.You must play in a darkened room. You must use the in-game gamma to give you true ""black"" darkness. You really need a good pair of headphones ... using speakers will scare the crap out of anyone in listening distance.Outlast is the first of it's kind and I fervently hope that more games will follow. See, us real people don't have amazing powers and an arsenal of deadly weapons ... we have courage and a need to uncover the truth ...Come face you fear ... and take another stepI rate this game a very solid 9.0 out of 10."

,Recommended,238320,8407120,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,๖ۣۜR3BORN,"Outlast is a relatively well done survival-horror game which efficiently blends the thrills and chills in equal measure. However, while Outlast delivers an effective experience with the genre norm, it doesn't deviate from the set path for anything creative and unique. One can expect the usual set pieces, the usual enemies, and the overly used jump scares.Now, to be fair... I certainly had my fair share of scares throughout the game (most of which were creatively placed), but towards adventures end I had found myself becoming slightly frustrated and annoyed with the lack of creativity. It was the same set path, over and over. Find this, hide from one enemy, run away, repeat. Outlast's biggest issue is the lack of enemy unpredictability, as essentially every encounter is scripted and therefore predictable.That aside, Outlast is an extremely polished video game. The visuals are gorgous, realistic, and smooth. The audio is clear, crisp, and efficient at setting the mood. The use of the video recorder as night vision isn't anything new (and was a tad over-used), but was implemented and designed extremely well, and was definitely one of the games strongest aspects. Unfortunately Outlast is a short game, with limited (if at all), replayability.I would only recommend a purchase of the game if it is on sale and you're itching for a quick horror fix."

If you play a lot of horror games, you won't find this terribly scary.  However, if you have a low threshold for horror, you will probably find it quite gruesome.  It relies on gore and shock to get a reaction from the player, rather than pacing and imagination a la Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  There are also a lot of jumpscares, but they are spread out well enough that they don't become too predictable.While I didn't find this as scary as, say, the original Amnesia, I did find it extremely exciting.  There are no puzzles to solve in Outlast, so the gameplay never stalls due to some overly confusing puzzle.  It's easily the best-looking horror game I've ever played; the setting is very detailed and the levels are always interesting (particularly towards the end).  You'll be using a nightvision camera to see through most of the game; the camera effects are very well done and look fantastic.  There are also a ton of little details in the way your character moves and in the environment that add to the immersion.  The devs took their sweet time polishing this up, and it shows.The only thing I would knock this game for is being poorly optimized.  It uses the Unreal engine, which is quite old, yet I could only run it on medium/high settings (it goes from low to very high for reference), even though I have no problems running games like Bioshock Infinite and Skyrim maxed out.  Even on a mix of medium/high, I occasionally had dips in framerate in one of the larger levels, which was irritating.  I should point out that the game still looks great on medium, so this wasn't really a big deal.According to Steam I finished the game in 5.4 hours, but I'll definitely be replaying it.  I got this on sale for about $7 and it was totally worth it."

The main character ""Miles Upshur"".""Miles Upshur"" a freelance journalist, receives a tip-off from an anonymous source about Mount Massive Asylum, a psychiatric hospital owned and operated by the Murkoff corporation.""Miles Upshur"" is incapable of combat, except for certain scripted sequences in which he pushes enemies away. To navigate the environment, the character is able to climb to ledges, vault over low obstacles, crawl, and slide in narrow gaps. Except for vaulting, enemies are incapable of any of these maneuvers, which gives the player a certain edge. In addition, the player can survive encounters with the inmates by hiding inside of lockers or under beds, although certain enemies may search the room and attempt to locate the player for a short time before moving on.Since much of the asylum is dark, the player must use Miles' video camera to see, thanks to its night vision function. Using night vision consumes batteries, replacements of which are scattered throughout the environment.When injured, Upshur must avoid taking any further damage for a while, which will allow him to recover.Pros:- One of the best survival horror games with a good story.- Fascinating story told through documents and notes.- Scary moments will make you scream.- Very dark atmosphere.- Fast-draining night vision camera keeps tensions high.- Very good sound design.- Absence of weapons requires smart uses of hiding spots.Cons:- The graphic isn't the best.The Verdict:One of the best horror games i have played it made me scream sometimes. if you like survival horror games which include no weapons at all then this game is for you it delivers high horror story and atmosphere with a good sound effects. it takes a man to finish this game."

I've never played a game that startled me into actually physically jumping.  Well-done.This game is an auto-include to any Steam gamer's library.It has lore (little notes and documents that are reminiscent of Resident Evil 1-3).It has a horrific atmosphere (think lighting, setting, and music similar to Silent Hill 1-3).At the end, it's most important element that makes it what it is, is its feeling of hopelessness.  This game even tells you that you have three options: Run, Hide, or Die.  There is no fighting back, and it's what drives the horror in this game.If you're having second guesses, don't.

Not only does it contain a gripping narrative with gorgeous presentation, and the perfect example of a silent protagonist done right; it masterfully utilizes every method of horror to its highest capacity. Nothing in it feels out of place, and every second is memorable.- Atmosphere during quiet exploration is unsettling, while somehow adventurous.- Jumpscares are ruthlessly effective and completely justified.- With the brilliant camera mechanic, low brightness setting can really improve the immersion factor.- Material itself is sadistic and utterly replusive. Leaves a lingering sense of filth.- Suspense during stealth gameplay builds nearly unbearable, but addictive tension.- Each chase sequence delivers an electrifying rush, sometimes providing that rare feeling when your heart actually seems to skip a beat.The only complaint I really have is that the ending is complete crap. You'll know what I mean when it comes. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that it's the complete opposite of what I wanted to happen. I thought it over for a couple days after I finished it, and I still disagree with Red Barrels' decision.But it's about the journey, not the destination; and the journey is worth $20.

And wow, what a good decision I made. This game is one of the scariest games I have played in a long time and I am very glad I chose to play it. After the first day of picking it up, I beat it within about 4.4 hours of gameplay. So the main pros of this game is that it will scare your socks off, keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time, and even features some collectibles and a very detailed backstory to the game! One thing I found in terms of cons though is that the main scariest part of the game for me was the very first enemy I faced because I didn't know how the mechanics really worked at all. But once you get the hang of it, it's as easy as slamming a door in the enemies face and looking for a hiding spot! One MAJOR problem I had with the gameplay of this game though is that you must rely incredibly heavilly on your battery amount in your camera, it is near impossible to see where you are going for most of the game without the cabability of nightvision with your camera.So to wrap it up, this is the Luigi's Mansion of horror games for me. Incredibly fun, scary, and storypacked game with a pretty short amount of playtime available, this game took me, more or less, 4 1/2 hours to beat but I am dang glad I decided to buy it.I give outlast a 9/10"

Everyone wants more when it comes to video games, but in a survival-horror game you want quality over quantity and Outlast hits that nail. I bought it while it was on sale and was worth every penny (I can garuntee the length of the game is not worth the off-sale price). The game is short and can be beat in less than 10 hours, but the scares last a lifetime. When researching this game DO NOT form an opinion on how short it is (comes with S-H turf after all). The graphics are wonderful and the scares quite satisfying. Plot constantly twists and turn (like your head if caught sometimes XD) and the story is very in-depth and addictive. All in all, i give this game an 8.5 of 10 for scares alone. I do recommend this game be bought if it goes on sale again but wouldn't pay normal price for it."

They really know how to set the tone. The motif is a silent hill-esque investigation style horror. You play as an investigative journalist armed with only your video camera and a tip that leads you into the abyss of a psychiatric asylum.I love the creativity behind this game. It can be difficult to conceptualize survival games this isn't basically a never ending quest for resources, dulled by knowledge of predictable mechanics and action points. Outlast breaks the mould, and excells in these areas. Admittedly some parts are predictable and the motif, although not a widely used one, still gives you an idea that can't be too far from the truth without adding aliens or sasquatch.Having said that, the game itself is far from predictable. You'll quickly learn you can't play this like other games, with the exception of reload which are batteries for your camera. You find documents along the way which lays out the story. You have an assortment of maneuvers that allow you to negotiate your environment, my favorite being the ability to slide through narrow gaps... that one will literally save your life ;)Movement doesn't feel sluggish however there does seem to be some slight hangtime when jumping. The graphics aren't the best in the world as post processing elements are basically stereoscopic and there is a constant, migraine inducing noise overlay which worsens tenfold during the use of your cameras nightvision. The textures aren't spectacular but they aren't distracting either, they do the job just fine. And in all honestly, you'll likely be too immersed in the game to notice many of the lacking elements, post processing and overlay excluded.Now as I understand, this game isn't optimized for 32bit systems and requires a workaround.In summary I'd recommend this game to friends and horror genre fans. Happy Gaming!"

Essentially Amnesia-style gameplay in a new setting, it's good-looking, well-designed and doesn't fall prey to many of the pitfalls that remove the horror from supposedly scary games - it knows when to use silence and emptiness to full effect and doesn't ramp up the action as the game progresses, barring the weak ending.Jump scares come often and can get predictable, and aren't the main strength of the game. It's the organic horror that comes from being stalked or looking for a hiding spot in a panic that really makes it memorable. The sheer gore and disturbing elements, including sexual overtones to the antagonists, are uniquely unnerving though they might alienate some players. Good horror doesn't need to be gruesome, after all.Fairly short and with a very weak final act much less compelling than the rest of the game, it's not for everyone, but is fine fuel for those who love the unmatched rush of feeling genuinely afraid."

,Recommended,238320,7441509,"Posted: 21 October, 2013",all,AyJay,"Before I go forward, I need to start off with this:I didn't like Amnesia much at all.The story was interesting but the gameplay itself as well as the scare factor was, to me, very overhyped. The gameplay seemed very much minimal and out of body. The entire time I felt I was looking in, and was not much immersed at all. Add to that the scare factor was greatly exaggerated and well... I was left disappointed.And then I bought Outlast.While there are many things I love about this game, I do need to put out a few warnings:This game is really gory. Not much for the squeamish at all.This game becomes very intense. I had to break at points because I just got too freaked out, something that hasn't happened to me since being hounded down by Nemesis in RE3.I'll start off with the immersion.Even though you -know- you're another character, his background is left vague and the only true objective you have is ""survive”. In this sense, it really becomes easy for the player to integrate his or herself with the character. That YOU are being chased, that YOU are cramming yourself in a locker, breaths stuttering and heart pounding as the door to the room is broken in. It makes it a very real sensation. I suppose it also helps to see hands reaching out to interact with objects rather than them floating in midair as well.The second thing is the environment.Very eerie, creepy setting… and just about every little thing gets you. Floorboards creaking will leave you on-edge trying to determine if that was you, an enemy, or just those old floorboards. The lighting is also pretty dynamic and fantastic in this game, striking scattered chairs and disfigured faces leaving you with a feeling of uneasiness.But I would have to say the piece du resistance is the music. What a fantastic arrangement this game has. As enemies find you, a shrill shriek of horns and strings alert you that your presence has been noticed. As enemies wander around, low, lingering tones with the occasional, random rise reach your ears, lulling you into a calmed state as you adjust only to be jarred from it over and over. And when wandering around with a new objective, subtle notes run across your ears, masked by footsteps and creaking doors.If you're a horror nut, this is the game for you. If Amnesia just wasn't doing it for you, this will. And for $20, I couldn't ask for more."

I didn't really care for the ending at all but it allowed room for a sequel to be made which I would probably play.

I watched youtube gameplays from pewdiepie a lot and should know where the game would take me to when i bought it. But still when I played the game, the thrill, the horror, the scares were still fresh, always fresh actually.I have never experienced such awesomeness in any horror game, not even close to ""not a lot"". For Red Barrels to actually make something new and revolutionary, it deserves a hundred percent positive review.Now for the start, the gameplay of this game is pretty simple. it's just run, hide, or die game. Simply no puzzle, no mini games in the game, not an open world but there are parts where you are in a maze and the game forces the pursuer to pursue You. Another challenge is, you have choices that you will make for yourself, you want to be paranoic and scared by every single person in the game, or be selective and brave, or be consumed by murderous curiousity. This is one of the first things that you will then feel throughout the game. Others might find the game a little funny, but for me, those guys might have problems, I personally consider this game a nightmare.However, this game has the charm that makes the player want to touch that shortcut to hell again and again, and again they meet hell. This curiousity that they trap you in, is something that you cannot avoid after you buy the game.After finishing the whole game (including the DLC). I found the enemies not scary anymore (their physical appearance) and the game does not give you nightmares in real life. It's just the tension you get when you dont want the bad guys to find and kill you, or get you when they chase you. This is the charm of the game. So don't be scared of buying it, or emptying your wallets. I really reccommend you to play this! Enjoy your nightmare!"

He'll soon learn to regret entering this place of sheer and utter nightmare fuel; as the game becomes a desperate fight for survival and a dash for the exit.Outlast visually represents a Triple A title, with the minds of them behind the making; but its gameplay is similar to it's indie counterparts where combat is not an option. The game requires exploration, investigation that rewards us with further exposition of what is truly going on; aswell as more batteries for the camera you carry that is the only source of seeing in the pitch black hallways.Whether it's finding fuses, navigating vents or hiding from naked dudes with pipes; the game is a truly terrifying and polished experience; any issues such as a short length of about 7-9 hours and an abrupt ending; are for the most part shadowed by the exilirating thrill this game offers by combing  the best of the gaming worlds.Outlast raises the bar for every future horror game, indie or not.

,Recommended,238320,31705000,Posted: 12 May,all,zaliaazleen,"Just finished this game, so let's write a review since I am still jumpy from it.First of all, I thought I could never beat this game. I remember getting stuck in the basement when I played this game previously in my old laptop. I was so scared to come out from my hideout place and in the end, just gave up and put it down as another game I would let rot inside my laptop.Then, Outlast 2 came out and it just doesn't feel right to buy it without finishing the first game. So, I bought it - with the DLC - and I managed to pass the basement after my third attempt. Somehow, I felt like I could do anything after that. Sure, there are jumpscares here and there. Sure, I yelled like a banshee each time - my poor, poor grandparents. But I made it through.The game is quite short - which I don't really mind since another horror game I played, Alien: Isolation is really, really draggy. In terms of story, I still have no idea what is going on in here. I know they are doing illegal experiments on the mental patients, but what in the world is a Walrider? I guess I have to do some extra reading afterwards.Gameplay-wise, I found it rather easy - I was playing on Normal mode (which is because they do not have Easy as an option) When I say easy, I am not complaining. It's just felt like I am not being murdered a lot in this game compared to Alien: Isolation. It is pretty easy to hide from these patients as well (maybe because I have a night-vision camcorder and they don't)Apart from Chris Walker, the rest of the patients don't really make any sound when they move, so it is quite difficult to track them when you are trying to stealth from room to room. Other than that, I sometimes face issues where my game kind of lags but that was probably just my PC.Anyway, I am going to add more to this review once I have played Whistleblower, so let's just leave this review right here. My friend said Outlast 2 focuses more on running rather than hiding and I do not like that one bit."

I played through the entire game before writing this review. I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and it is very hard to find a game that scares me. While this was an amazing game, it was not very scary. This may be different for other people, but there were probably about 10 jump scares, and there wasn't really any psychological horror in it. The game was atmospherically horrific however, because 75% of the game takes place in the dark. The enemies in it were decently scary, and what I enjoyed was that you can not fight back. I loved the graphics on this game, they had their own king of feel to them. The gameplay was okay, but it got very repetetive because you were constantly having to find two things while being hunted by an enemy. One of the cool things about the gameplay was the use of the camera, which has limited batteries and has a nightvision mode. Throughout the game you can find bonus documents and read about different psychopaths and such, which was a very cool collectible experience. The story in it was okay, it wasn't too story driven, but there was a story. The game is not at all like a Silent Hill, or any other game that just uses psychological horror. Difficulty wise, the game wasn't hard, however there were parts that I died in over and over. The game should take at least 6 hours to beat without a walkthrough, so it was decently long. Overall, Outlast is a great game to play and I highly reccomend it.8/10"

DeveloperRed Barrelshas fulfilled the vision they had for this first-person survival horror game: to create an emotional and unforgettable experience.  I look forward to playing their future games.Under the broad umbrella of games that can be considered to have any kind of horror element, Outlast gameplay is closer to the subtlety of theAmnesiaseries than it is toF.E.A.R.orDead Island, because the player has no direct combat ability and is forced instead to rely on what survival mechanics the game offers.  In this case the only options are running and hiding.  Once in a while the AI disappoints, but most of the time it keeps you on your toes.  I can't say for sure whether AI gets smarter with higher difficulty since I stuck to ""Normal.""  There isn't much to say beyond this about mechanics or design; you'll quickly figure it out for yourself, if you can hang in there long enough to get past the first several scares!The game looks excellent, while not necessarily pushing the envelope for 2013 visual standards.  The audio & soundtrack are every bit as impressive as the graphics and prove for the millionth time that sound is crucial to any horror experience, be it film or game.  Outlast was blessedly bug-free and smooth for my entire playthrough.  My time played reflects a single playthrough on the easiest difficulty (Normal) of the main campaign.  After finishing, I felt no compulsion to explore harder difficulties or subject myself to that adrenaline rush again.  After all, I'm no horror genre aficionado, only an occasional visitor.  The story is enjoyable but super generic, pretty much pulled straight from similar genre films.  Depending on how quickly you progress, the campaign will feel short.  Not a big game.  I do not own and did not play theWhistleblowerDLC and so unfortunately can't comment on it.I recommendOutlastto any genre fans (obviously) and also to anyone looking for a quick rush the likes of which can only be provided by horror-survival.  Truly every step of the journey is a battle of will to keep going rather than save and exit.  As I said earlier, once you are inside for a bit and get the hang of the mechanics and AI behavior, the fear factor rapidly drops from debilitating to bearable--and by this I mean thepumping heart, rapid breathing, sweating palmsvariety of bearable.  It remains tense throughout, and I hate to think that even one person would miss out on the fun because they walked away after being startled once or twice.TIP: Don't waste any time while the camera is running, since you have limited battery life.TIP: Don't miss easy battery pickups due to being too rattled/rushed/careless to look around as you move through rooms."

,Recommended,238320,1568790,"Posted: 15 September, 2013",all,Tundra Scorpion,"Outlast is a picture perfect example of everything done right in a horror game, making the player feel completely helpless and hunted in an environment that makes them feel uncomfortable with a looming sensation of something just around the corner. With 0% of the budget on combat, Outlast has been made completely immersive with subtle and frightening sound effects, disturbing visuals and perfected first-person animations.The story of Outlast begins with a midnight drive to a supposedly abandoned asylum following a tip from an anonymous lead, the player takes the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he delves to uncover the sinister secrets of Mount Massive Asylum.Immediately upon entering the asylum the player gets a sensation of being watched, confined and exposed, setting them up for a start at the slightest bump, scratch or shed of movement seen from the corner of your eye. The atmosphere is perfected with high-quality graphics and sound assets, which build up in intensity until exploding in the players face in an intense climax of terror upon their first encounter with one of the asylums mutilated patients.As with any game, while Outlast is good there are some drawbacks that keep it from being perfect. Outlast's puzzle solving lacks variation, recycling the same old method of rushing to press a button or turn a valve while an enemy chases you. While contributing to the sensation of being hunted, re-using these kinds of encounters over and over with a lack of effective follow-up made the game feel largely repetitive and I felt took a large part out of the experience.Outlast has also unfortunatly indulged in the cheap shots that are jump scares, which require little-to-no buildup and I feel have no place in a true horror game as they only serve to provide opportunities for talentless hacks like pewdietard to overreact. In comparison with another terrifying game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which had no jump scares and instead relied completely on it's atmosphere to scare the player, this comparison proves to me that horror games worth their weight in gold do not need jump scares and should rely on their immersion, which is something that Outlast would have done very well.Finally, without giving away too much, the story felt rushed and incomplete in some places, which didn't leave a lasting impression on me and failed to avidly explain the reasoning behind the inhumane experiments in Mount Massive.So while Outlast is a very good game and a welcome addition to the horror genre, it suffered some flaws that kept it from living up to it's full potential.Amnesia: The Dark Descent remains the scariest game I've played."

I had a great deal of fun simply watching the inmates perform their rituals along with what the game had to really offer, which was a lot of atmospheric scares. But more on that in a moment. I like the objective approach this game took with the inhabitants of Mount Massive, most of them are trapped in their own little world, either too broken to be in touch with reality, or too tortured to realize the reality around them. some even help you in their skewed and twisted ways. especially the main plot point: Father Martin; while he's the main reason you are trapped in the asylum as long as you are, he's also a good chunk of the reason you stay alive. a good chunk of the people want you dead for various reasons, so there's still your danger of getting skewered.the game is rather atmospheric and relies a lot on opressiveness, capriciousness, and atmospheric and story tension to scare you a lot more than it uses jump scares. I never understood the rejection of jump scares: I know they are cheap, but sometimes the confusion and high intensity is necessary to break you out of the cautious lull you set yourself into. jump scares can be used to enhance an experience without relying on them and this game does a good job of doing that.the story was a wonderful walk into the dark recesses of the human mind and it's depravity. I was almost convinced the scientists found something they shouldn't have with their deep hypnosis trials. it was a decently profound story with a great deal of necessary unanswered questions for the mind to ponder... untill the last fifteen minutes of the game.once you decend the elevator into the laboratory, the game quickly changes from a deep psychological horror, to a cheap, clear-cut, action thriller. it's like they hired a different storywriter for the last part who thought any supernatural elements absolutely must be explained in full technicolor detail as to not let anyone believe in the silly ghost stories of the inmates. the game does an absolutely marvelous job of making you believe you just might be an inmate yourself. then strips it way with talk of nanomachines and a cheap as free chase sequence. truly, the last ending of Outlast completely tarnishes what should have been a great story to keep playing again and again."

A wave of imitiators and screechy Youtube reaction videos followed as it became clear how cheap and easy this kind of thing could be to put together.So there's been a lot of dross, in other words, but the occasional gem.  Outlast gets the formula entirely right.  You're unarmed, sure, but physically capable:  you can sprint, vault over desks, clamber into vents, jump over broken floors, and generally conduct yourself as a reasonably healthy person would if they were being pursued by a nutcase.  The game emphasises your physical presence, down to the shadows you cast in front of you and your hands gripping the edges of walls when you're near them.Not the longest game around, but the right length for what it wants to do, it does admittedly wear out its bag of tricks a little before the end - you'll begin anticipating things rather than being surprised by them.  This is a very minor quibble, though, and is kind of inevitable with this sort of thing.Genuinely unsettling and occasionally very scary, this is how this kind of thing should be done."

Great steps have been taken to avoid this game holding a single note from beginning to end. There is enough variety in the environments and scares to elevate a fairly superficial story to the nearest this gamer has been to a first-person, interactive horror film. I cannot count the times I have been lured increasingly closer to the screen only to leap backward from it in surprise or revulsion. There's an undeniable beauty to the game's human carnage which is both mystifying and frightful. The cruelty on display between characters and also towards you, the player, sets up a sense of incredible dread, of putting one's back to a window or door, of entering a room. So many times I wondered if I should just run away or shut down in the corner and wait for death. The game is gripping and certainly perfect for playing in the dark with surround sound. I dare anybody to play on Occulus Rift."

It puts you in a stressful situation, that often requires cat-like relfexes, and quick thinking. This is a great game, and I'll tell you why.Graphics: The graphics in this game are outstanding. The gritty realism and disgusting amounts of detail only intensify an already off putting experience. Whether it be detailed, high-resolution blood mixed with chunks of flesh leading you to the next change of pants, or the disturbing scars of the deformed residents of the now abandoned Mount Massive Asylum. The graphics were mindblowingly great in 2013, and they still hold up today. 9/10Sound: Good Lord, the sound in this game is good. Just the quality of every sound effect, the echos of water dripping onto the floor, the deranged mumbles and rantings of wonderfully voice acted mentally unstable scientific expirements, the heavy breathing and footsteps of the protagonist, Miles Upshur, as he runs from danger in the form of a madman. Just grab your favorite headphones and turn the volume up, and you're guaranteed to become immersed in the experience on a whole-new level. 10/10Gameplay/Fun to be had: This game is so much fun to play. The controls are responsive and oddly satisfying, despite how simple they are. The stressful, high-speed, escapes from the ugly, terrifying former inmates will pump adrenaline and fear through your veins as you vault over overturned desks, scramble into air vents just your pursuer grabs you, and slowly inch your way along ledges as you gaze down to the horrors below you. 8.5/10Story: This game has a great story on so many levels. It's obvious some serious thought, time, and effort was put into the writing of this game. The ending was a little disappointing, but I won't spoil anything. 8/10Overall: You don't just play Outlast.

The reason why it is effective is so obvious that I'm surprised more games don't do it. Here is the secret ladies and gentlemen. PACING. Yes, it truly boggles the mind, but PACING is the key to a good survival horror game. The game doesn't just start throwing you into an attack from a murderous zombie army with a shotgun in one hand and your♥♥♥♥♥♥in the other. You start reading about a strange facility, you travel there in your car, and enter it. Even after that you aren't attacked for about a half hour. Now, keep this in mind. The game does occasionally use jumpscares, but honestly I don't mind them. They are used sparingly and the scariest part is the anticipation of the jumpscare. They are only used about 3 times throughout the story. Now, I'm not going to spoil the story, so there won't be a breakdown on what I do and do not like about the story, but it is told fairly well through documents and notes found throughout the facility.

You often have to crawl through pitch black areas with only your camera's nightvision as your only source of light, and in many cases you also have to run from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out to ♥♥♥♥ you up at the same time. So it's more of a stressful game of making quick decisions in a short amount of time than pure creepiness.Especially if you play it on Nightmare difficulty as you only are allowed to have a maximum amount of 2 batteries compared to Normal difficulty's 10 batteries.You end up mad-dashing through the majority of the game really, which is too bad as it doesn't leave room for enough exploring to satisfy me.Though the areas you had time to explore and really let them get to you had you in a tightened state all the way through. The music and soundeffects are really playing with your mind and when you think the threat is over it's often right around the next corner.The few areas where you really could let your fantasy play and enhance the horrors lurking the dark halls of Massive Mount Asylum had you on your toes the whole time. You can almost feel your heart rate rise in sync with the protagonist's when you encounter the deranged events of this game.All in all I'd say it was too stressful and had you miss out a lot of environmental exploration and general atmosphere as you most of the time dashed through the darkest places since your camera batteries were running out. But the places where you actually could play without the nightvision on really had you captivated and in a tight grip of fear!I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a beautifully decent horror game."

Noah goes crazy from Satan himself, who calls himself ""Walrider"", and a man named Miles Upshur must go over to Mount Massive Asylum to help the poor fellow.  Miles is a journalist who happens to be a very proud follower of Christianity and tries exposing Satan of influencing the youth through ""rock music"" and ""mind control.""The game will help your children overcome the fear of the dark, as well as teach them about male anatomy, and how to hide from an abusive father wielding a table leg.If you don't believe me, listen to the reviews from parents themselves!""I honestly have no f*cking idea, why you gave this game to my 3 year old.

Element number 2, You should feel isolated an example would be how you're trapped in a asylum and your main goal is to escape. Element number 3, It should have tension, Your character can't just go around being confident there has to be stress some sort of mental or emotoinal strain and Outlast does that by having your not only problem being trapped in an asylum but you having to deal with multiple enimies as you progress in the game.  Element number 4, A good Horror game should have uncertainty like you being unsure of what's gonna happen when you open a door. Element number 5, It should have a Lingering fear something to stay with you even after you stop playing or finish it, Like a scary movie about spiders would give you a fear of spiders after you watch it. Element number 6, An unbalaced, Imperfect, Relatable Protaganist, Meaning you should feel weak and fragile and only should have to rely on your smarts and Outlast again does that with the no combat system and where you either have to run or hide. Well to sum that all up Outlast is a damn good Horror game and game overall and you should try it maybe you'll like it maybe you won't but I garuntee it won't be a waist of time."

This one is a bit traumatic for anyone honestly and if your son or you do not get freaked out then... you have issues.

It is just short enough and delivers enough content to be recommended, but it only offers JUST enough to be recommended. With the major competition of this game being the far superior Penumbra and Amnesia games by Frictional Games it has quite a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the gameplay and ""horror"" are barely enough to hold the average player through. It goes for the jump scare route roughly 100% of the time. The jump scares themselves work the first and maybe the second time, but after you see it's a sub-par ""one trick pony"" there's no horror left in it only frustration. The enemies in this game do not follow the wonderful template set by Amnesia where they seemingly come and go as they please instead they follow a set path they patrol until you pass that area. Along with that the A.I. that they have is rather dodgy to when they actually see you and trying to hide from them can be a pain. I personally discovered that the easiest way to get past the enemy is to simply run past them the second they bust the door down instead of wasting time trying to hide. Once you run past them in most places where you have to go to make them disappear is in that room they came from. If you do try the hiding route expect to waste time dying for reasons that shouldn't happen and getting spotted in places that really don't make sense. None of that is scary. It's frustrating. A better game for jump scares is Doom 3. A better game for weaponless stealth horror would be Amnesia or Penumbra. A better game for crazy psychological/paranormal experiments is F.E.A.R. or Condemned. If it was the guts and gore that scared you even Dead Space is better for that. This game really only serves as a way to kill a few hours if you have a horror itch and have already played all of the above games. If you haven't then what are you waiting for!Overall I give it a 6/10."

The game story overall is good, and has their share of plot twists.The graphics are highly detailed and realistic, matching the overall scene of Mount Massive Asylum very well. The asylum looks truly realistic, and I can't help being sucked into the game every once in a while.The only negative thing I would have to say about this game is its repetivity, like I recently stated, this game constantly requires you to keep activating engines and stuff, while evading the boss. You  can try rushing along, or you could use stealth, which involves alot of waiting for the right moment and eventually getting seen and running back.The game really fits as a survival horror, having only few ""fight"" scenes, one being when Dr.Trager last tries to kill you in the elevator.Overall, I would recommend this as a good horror game full of exciting ( and scary ) adventure.8/10If you're into horror games, go ahead and buy it, it's a good game to play."

,Recommended,238320,8086213,"Posted: 17 December, 2013",all,Carth,"Similar to the film Grave Encounters, the game is set in some kind of mental institution and you are armed with only a digital camera with a nightvision toggle that consumes the batteries. The story is told through notes you make when you have the camera out and through documents you find strewn in the levels.It borrows from the Amnesia series in that you can't actually defend yourself against any of the unpleasant things you might encounter. Your only course of action is to run and to hide. However, whereas in Amnesia you might have had something chasing you and you knew it would kill you so you ran until you were safe with your heart pounding, in Outlast you are required to backtrack past the same enemy over and over. Far from being scary, it just becomes an annoyance.There are many sections where you need to find a key (or other item) but when looking for it you will be seen by an enemy, then you'll run, hide in a closet, wait for him to leave, then go and search again, the same thing happens, repeat ad nausem or until he finally kills you. The scariness is gone and it just becomes frustrating. You know what you have to do; you might even know where the key is, but you have to get past something that will chase you and instantly kill you.There is functionality to look over either shoulder using Q or E. It is not very useful though because it is disorienting. I suppose that was the intention: when running from something you take a quick glance over your shoulder and see it just behind you. The trouble is, in real life we are unaware of the movement of our head because our brain processes it for us. We don't see the world spin when we turn our head. When the game shows you everything spin it's not actually realistic, it's annoying and makes the ""look behind"" function not very usable.The need to use the camera with its night vision to see does add some tension, which is helped along by your character breathing heavily etc. There is an outdoor part which is reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project in its atomosphere.If you like horror games then this is worth a play. It has a great atmosphere and some nice visuals. There are a few jump scares and to start with it's quite immersive until the gameplay gets a bit samey and you know what the threats are. But by that time you'll probably see it through to the end to find out what happens. The game is about the right length in that respect."

The fear of being chased and caught while I was running or hiding made my heart pump. It was actually very fun strategizing on how I should get past a ""freak"". Besides for a few jump scares here and there the game is not very creepy, especially when you figure out what exactly is wrong in the game. The environments are beautiful and the different places you explore at kept the excitement going. The game is more fun than scary in my opinion. If you're naturally good at games and don't get scared easily the game should take you about 6 hours to complete on hard mode. This game is not the best horror game I have played but it is for sure worth experiencing for yourself."

Although there are scenes of terror already seen, it's a good game. Obviously, horror games may scare some people very easily with one body that falls on the head after they opened a door. Instead, there are other who will find this game boring. In latin ""De gustibus"" or ""personal tastes"". A protagonist armed only with camera and his legs to run, it's certainly distressing that he can't do anything to fight enemies. But the game can offer much. It costs isn't high.Location fantastiche, grafica ottima, sensazione di paura e ansia costante durante l'arco di tutto il gioco. Seppur presenti gameplay e scene di spavento già viste è pur sempre un buon titolo. Ovviamente i giochi horror possono spaventare alcuni molto facilmente anche facendogli cadere un cadavere sopra la testa dopo aver aperto una porta oppure risultare assolutamente banali e noiosi da chi, anzichè scappare da un grassone invincibile che gli spezza la colonna vertebrale ci vanno addosso senza paura. Con un protagonista armato di solo una telecamera che funziona a batterie e le proprie gambe per correre è sicuramente angosciante non poter fare altro che scappare di fronte ad ogni possibile minaccia. Ma il gioco può offrire molto. Per chi si vuole avvicinare al brand Outlast è un titolo valido che costa anche poco.Vote/Voto: 7,5/10"

You do not have to hide, I even managed to simply run until they stopped following me. There are no puzzles. Plus, the game isn't scary.. like .. at all.

I've watched Let's Plays on this and even when I know what's going to happen this game makes me jump and completely forget I knew it'd happen. Just about everything is against you and it really makes you anxious while playing, thinking that in every room something is going to get you. Let's just say:  I love being terrified in gaming but alas very few horror games have been able to chill my blood to the bone and leave a path of sweat trickling down my back.It really captures being a Horror/Survival game, because you can't attack your enemies. All you can do is run and hide, and outsmart them (because, the's admit, some of the enemies can be pretty stupid).Taking place in a Mental Asylumn where everything is against you(what doesn't get scarier than that?), you take control of a journalist, Miles Upsher, who acting on a tip-off that things are not well at all at the Mount Massive Mental Institute decides to take look around to see if there is a valid story worth printing. As far as story goes that is about as much I will say - its better the gamer goes into this sick and twisted world with as little information as possible.Gameplay wise, Outlast employs the mechanics set like any other first person game (moving your character by WASD) but that the main character can now vault over obstacles in his course whilst fleeing from some of the most grotesque characters ever created for gaming. In between filming what you see you will be doing a lot of frantic running and hiding lest you forfeit your life.On a scariness level - Outlast succeeds admirably. This is truly a terrifying experience (up the ante by turning all the lights off and playing with headphones on) and with AAA style graphics truly immerses you in a world of horror that is coupled with a sparse but very tense soundtrack. The audio for Outlast and the various sound effects it employes to scare it players is top notch."

This game is terrifying in every meaning of the word - it makes you feel constanly uneasy, drives you to the edge by sending horrific monsters after you and tries to blow your heart out every now and then by throwing a massive jumpscare at you when you expect it the least.Talking about jumpscares - the way they're executed is simply state-of-the-art. You will never anticipate them - that's simply impossible. When they come, however... Let's just say the weak of heart should probably wear more than a pair of pants while playing.The graphical style of Outlast is simply perfectly fitting - the shadows constantly mix with the lit areas, forcing you to often stare into the dark thinking ""Was that somebody or am I just going nuts ?""The audio - especially the dialogue is brilliant.

Graphics and sounds are top quality giving it a realism sense and feel to it all. I felt generally scared at the beginning but towards the end I just ran around all over the place past enemies whereas at the beginning i was extremely cautious!Few problems may consist of that you cannot fight at all, i know this is the point of the game but i felt like such a wimp and after completing it I wanted some kind of reward for my success without fighting or killing an enemy but no…  Not one reward at all... Other problems would be that it dragggggggggggssssss out for too long, so many times i saw exit signs but there would be a task to complete before i was able to get out. Other than that I loved, story was of irrelevance to me personally, mainly because i didn't pay attention or was generally bored by it, but hey that was me! I just enjoyed the gameplay and atmosphere and proud to say I completed the ""world’s scariest game"" to date all on my own despite such a horrible ending!+ Great gameplay+ A true horror+ Definetly scary+ Blood so much blood!- Can't fight- Batteries (You will know what i mean when you play it)- Drags out for perhaps too long- Pointless plot7.5/10 from me!"

Altough the survival horror elements are well executed and there is a strong sense of being hunted during the game, I hoped for a bit more gameplay and scrounging for supply. While the game has supernatural elements, most enemies are ""flesh and blood"" and, other than pleasing the horror-snobs, there is no real reason why I can't bash an unaware opponent with a pipe over the head. But! A good combat system is hard to develop and the game keeps it fresh with the ""run and hide"" ""sneak and peak"" mechanics.  It has some very refreshing attention to detail such as a fully animated player character-body, heavy breathing effects and very wellmade sound.You'll be through with it in about 6 hours and it doesnt have the intellectual aspects of a Penumbra or Silent Hill...but screw it! Its fun. Recommended."

It seems to use ideas from cheap horror movies - desolate hospital, crazy patients and mysterious organisation behind it. However, the way that this game is created turns this overused scenario into pretty enjoyable plot, which we reveal by collecting documents on our way through the building. Music, surroundings, even dialogues and scary events, all these create a unique feeling of anxiety as we walk past cells of this forgotten place. Not to mention fear when our battery dies in the middle of a dark, narrow passage."

,Recommended,238320,8693812,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,mmm!5NATCH,"Your heart will be racing while 'Outlast' delivers an extremely thrilling experience.The 'first person horror' seems to be trendy at the moment but 'Outlast' is definitely a strong leader of this recent genre.If you're considering this game, but just not too sure what to expect, please read on...The story begins with our hero, Miles, a freelance journalist who gets a tip off to investigate an asylum that for many years had closed down but has recently opened up as a charity organisation. Curious to discover whats inside, Miles discovers the place has been over run by various inmates who are victims of scientific experimentation. Stuck inside he must find a way out and along the way he will collect documents to reveal more history, writes notes about what what he witnesses and has a small video camera to record everything inside.Fear generates well in games where players cannot defend themselves against threats. 'Outlast' mastered the ability to make players feel emotions of anxiety and panic complimented with intense pursuit moments.  Miles cannot attack the dangerous mad men inside the building. They are much stronger and bigger or armed with deadly weapons. This takes away the players ability to defend themselves and will force players to focus on swift decision making, evasion and hiding in various furniture in rooms or even in the pitch darkness. However, Miles' camera features a night vision light which can be used to navigate in the darkness but drains batteries and players will hope to find them scattered throughout the adventure.The environment is breath takingly stunning and effective in producing an isolated atmosphere. The grain filter provides a realistic look of an old vintage mansion and adds a misty view to where ever you roam. Nightvision is slightly blurred staying true to the realism of a real camera and details provided on body parts are truly gut wrenching. Shine on viscera gives it a fleshy look, well shaped blood stains look remarkably accurate and inmates faces look like actual mutations and burns. Assisting the visuals is a fantastic soundtrack. There isn't too much music in the game, but if you play this game with headphones (I played with a 7.1 surround sound headphones), you will admire the creaking floorboards, footsteps from down the hall, and rain patters on the roof. If you're hiding, music adapts to your surroundings and creates ambience to your current scenario.  You'll hear scratchy violins and deep brass play to intensify the dramatic moment of fear nearby and if you don't feel like screaming, don't worry, Miles was provided with a voice actor who does an amazing job of trying everything he can to breathe quietly while hiding, gasp for air while running and panic while fleeing.The game is only four hours long, but could be much shorter on a second play through. Many players will be tested on their patience to move from place to place while a threat is randomly patrolling and  bravery will be needed when encountering a few various characters who no doubt will have you cornered if you make that wrong step down the hallway or picked an unlucky hiding spot.'Outlast' pushes 'first person horror' to a new depth with its graphic atmosphere, chilling enviroment and incredible detail. It's not a game for the casual player as you'll need to be very good at FPS navigation if you expect to do well in this game.  You won't play this game comfortably regardless of how many lights you leave on and the lingering fear of the unknown never leaves you. You will always walk cautiously and quietly hoping to avoid making the slightest sounds but the game is truly unforgettable and suited for dare devils. Try it with headphones, in the dark and home alone but even if you don't do that, it doesn't matter anyway...You will still be frightened."

,Recommended,238320,23715541,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,RankedUpGamer,"It's a really good horror game and all, but in comparison to other horror games I played it wasn't the scariest. The second half of the game's pacing slows down (after the Trager section) and the story takes a 180. It's probably best to play on the higher difficulty modes as the game is relatively easy and as long as you break line of sight, you're pretty much in the clear. Higher difficulty modes not only make batteries harder to find for your nightvision camcorder, but also makes the enemies more aware. That said, there aren't too many good horror games on Steam and this is one of the best of them. Also when purchasing get the DLC as it is arguably better than the main game itself; the story and pacing is much better, and it resolves the somewhat dissapointing ending of the vanilla game quite well. If you're from the future, this game is a good start if you're getting Outlast 2."
76561198045180742,Recommended,238320,8563791,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,Paintmail23,"I decided to pick this game up since it was on a deal during the Christmas Sale, and I also enjoy playing the occasional horror game. Normally horror games don't usually give me many frights and I thought Outlast would be exactly the same as the rest. However, Outlast definitely made me eat my words.You play as the male protagonist Miles Upshur who, according to the start of the game, is a wimp when it comes to fighting. All you're equipped with is a camcorder. No guns, no knives, no weapons whatsoever. You're an unarmed, athletic journalist. Throughout the game you have to accomplish multiple goals in an attempt to escape from the asylum. Most of the time you'll have to sneak around in order to not get brutally murdered, and trust me it sure is brutal. If you get seen, the tense music will kick in, the adrenaline will start rushing around your body, and you'll make your character sprint and jump over obstacles as you head towards the nearest point of safety, whether it's in a locker, under a bed, or hiding under a desk. You'll also try to make sure you have enough batteries for the nightvision feature on your camera, which you can only find lying around. Otherwise you may end up being in the dark, waist deep in sewage, trying to find the way out of the sewer while an enemy, who will rip you apart if he finds you, is hunting you. Trust me, you don't want to have that problem, otherwise dying is probably the best option since it's the quickest way to get your batteries back.In my opinion, trying to sneak around enemies while also trying to complete objectives is the biggest fear factor present the game. i'm sure for most people who have played this game, it's quite nerve-racking when you're trying to see where the enemy is, the music is slowly building up, you move round a corner to get a better view and ""BAM"", the enemy is right in front of you. The panic will be there immediately, you'll turn around to go back into the room and attempt to duke the enemy in order to escape. As soon as you're safe, and the music has settled down, and there's a high chance that the above process may occur again, provoking the same response. There's also many jump scares present in the game, which adds to the fear factor already present when crouching around dark corridors with nightvision as the only light source present, with only your footsteps and breathing being the only sounds to accompany you.I wouldn't say the story of the game is too complicated, but I wasn't really into the story that much. I did care for my character and for the events that caused this place to become what it is now, but the way to sort everything out, to ""fix"" everything, didn't grip me that much (which is the only negative thing I can think of, other than some framerate issues which I think is due to my PC having exactly the minimum system requirements). The documents you find throughout the game will help you understand the backstory, and the good thing about them is they're not a long read, and I've got the same opinion for the notes that you're character makes. Even though I had to run the game on the lowest settings, the enviroment and graphics are very well done and I was certainly impressed considering Red Barrels is a company I've personally never heard of.Overall, the game is very well done and certainly a great horror game.

There is a sound story, visuals were good, and of course there was a good amount of scare in it.  Most enjoyable in a dark room with some friends.  The ending has some loose ends which makes a sequal possible, and also leaves room for co-creation of the ending, meaning it is left for interpretation.  Not many glitches, however it is pretty easy to avoid the monsters, their patterns are pretty easy to figure out.  Some parts are confusing as to where you have to go.  Overall good game.

Using a video camera to navigate dark and dank coridors while keeping on the look out for terrifing monsters. I love that feeling because it makes you feel like you're in a horror movie.Game mechanics are done well. Movement is fluid and didn't have a problem transgressing through the horrific areas. Your night vision runs on batteries and the game will give you plently of bateries, although the times where you a running out on your last battery, that is terrifing.The setting is fantastic. You feel a more sense of how ♥♥♥♥ed up this place is as you progress further. With scenes becoming more grotesque as you progress. At time you encounter npcs who actually aren't there to kill you and they provide a good scense for what this place has done to them, enhancing the story.However the one thing that was lacking was the story. I play horror games because of the rich story that is underneath all the scares and increased heart rates. A prime example of this would be the Amnesia games. For Outlast though I felt it was lacking. The story should have been flushed out more. I felt like certain points of the story didn't add up and couldn't remember key points. Your character often writes down his input after witnessing scenes, and I thought they were poorly writen. It is kind of in the style of just some guy off the street, but sense he is a reporter I figured he would have written better. Also in his writing he often reciprecates key points of plot, which is handy, but imo uneeded.Aside from that, this game absoultely excells in its horror. I was absolutely terrified the whole game. No joke. In summary I woud recommend this game highly for it is a unique horror experience with some details that can be over looked"

,Recommended,238320,7635755,"Posted: 11 November, 2013",all,woodiland,"Warning:Outlast contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.---ABOUT---In Outlast, you're a news reporter, and you've gotten a tipabout something fishy taking place in a mental asylum, so youtake the trip out there with your trusty video camera, and set out todiscover the dark and disturbing truth about this place.---REVIEW---After finding a way into the mental asylum, you quickly realize thatsomething has gone really wrong. You'll quickly start to explore the placeand try to piece the truth together, by talking with some (not murderly insane)patients of this welcoming and warm place, recording stuff (recording stuffaquires notes about what your character, Chris Walker, is thinking and seeing),and by finding documents, spread around the place.The story in the beginning iscompelling, and it's interesting enough to go around exploring as muchas you dare, to find these documents. The story does tho, take a ratherweird and awkward conspiracy plottwist, which does seem out of place.Luckily this plottwist won't happen untill the very end.This game has alot of similar game mechanics as Amnesia: The Dark Decent.You can't fight back, what you can do is run, and hide.Your cam-recorder is your way of seeing in the dark, by using yournightvision. The nightvision runs on batteries, which you have to findscattered all over the asylum. On the harder difficulties, batteries are rare,and they go empty quickly, forcing you to use it as little as possible, resultingin some very, uncomfortable walks in the dark.If you're unlucky enough to get spotted by one of these patients, you couldclose the door behind you, to slow him down to give yousome time to find a hiding place, which could be in a room, a locker,toilet or under a bed.The game relies on randomly wandering enemies, you don't knowwhen or where you'll encounter them, and they will be looking for you,and the game has it's share of jump-scares. But most of theseare not of the lame kind. Most of the jump-scares used in this gameis down-right creepy as hell, and scared me out of the chair.While the horror mechanics in this game is superb, the gameunfortunatly suffers at some areas. For an example, your tasks in thegame is really repetitive, it's mostly about ""Find this key"" and ""Turn this valve"",and the mental patients sometimes fails at seeming random and unpredictable.You can figure out their route, and easily pass them, and sometimes theyget stuck searching for you at one specific area/hallway, whichcoincidentally, is where you need to go, so you HAVE to meet upwith the person wanting to murder you.The sounds in this game is made, tailored, to creep you out.From the thunder, the sound of things falling down, distant screamsdown the hallway, squeeking from the wooden floors and doors,it makes it so that you will never let your guard down.The music in this game is also, brilliant. Taking use ofcreepy old school The Shinning-style music, and powerfull tensecreepy music when being chaised.The graphics are nice. The camrecorder effects are nice, the nightvisionlooks real. Dark places are actually DARK, the asylum looks old, ruinedand creepy. Dead bodies lies everywhere, intestines everywhere,detailed intestines... It sure is a ultra graphical game, with alot ofgore and blood.The game does suffer from bad modelling of characters.There's few character models, re-used alot. The ones that are used,vary from normal looking people, to really mutilated scary unrecognizablepeople. But they are re-used alot.---CONCLUTION---The game does has some faults, but this is oneof the scariest games I have played in a long time.It is a super horror game, with great horror mechanics. One of thefew real horror games released in the past years, in my opinion.And with a price tag at 18,99€, it gave me 6-7 hours worth of panic,anxiety, paranoia and fantastic horror.---SCORE---Graphics: 8.0/10Audio: 9.0/10Gameplay: 8.0/10Story: 7.0/10Value: 8.0/10Score: 8.0/10"

,Recommended,238320,7845208,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,boltronics,"Works reasonably well under Wine (v1.7.7, with GTX660M graphics @1920x1080, Debian GNU/Linux Wheezy). Had to turn the ""effects"" setting all the way down to avoid graphical corruption, but everything else can be cracked to maximum so game-play still looks very nice. Menus were slow and probably dropped to ~10 FPS, but quite usable and a minor annoyance. In-game performance was fine.Throughout the campaign, I had the game crash at two points, but am not certain that either was Wine-related. One was about 1/4 of the way through just after a cut-scene (right after Father Martin gives you a sedative) where the game terminated with a crash report box, and the other was when I clicked the Exit Game option from the main menu (the game locked up). In neither case did I lose any progress.I did experience a Wine issue whereby the mouse would occasionally (usually after a cut-scene or climbing a ledge) appear to hit a virtual wall and would not turn the character past a certain point. This is solved by left-clicking, and is not an issue unique to Outlast. A minor annoyance, but worth noting.As for the game-play, there were some minor annoyances. There's a lot of walking along ledges involved, but sometimes the character won't actually snap to the ledge as he should, causing you to fall to your death and return to the last checkpoint. At one point, I wasn't clear how to proceed since the player would not cling to a ledge which otherwise seemed like the only obvious path forward, so I wasted some time looking for an alternate path that didn't exist.There are also occasions where you must jump across from a ledge, and those are even harder because the jumping controls on ledges don't seem to work reliably. At one point I think I repeated attempts at jumping from a ledge about 6 times (spending about a minute resuming from the last checkpoint each time I fell to my death) which was quite frustrating.I did appreciate that you have the ability to look behind when running, however I would have appreciated this more if the option were available when walking as well. Looking through the camera is a nice gimmick, but it doesn't appear to use battery power unless you enable night-vision. Further, certain events in your diary apparently won't be recorded unless you actually film them. All of this makes me wonder why there is even an option to put the camera down? You basically would never want to, and instead just toggle night-vision on and off.You won't have any issues running out of batteries for your camera for the entire duration if you take time to look around. My play-through was 9 hours to completion, so I clearly spent a lot of time exploring. There was one point where I was down to two spare batteries, but upon completion I had 10 spare batteries and there were more around which I couldn't pick-up  due to a 10 battery carrying cap.Not having to worry about running out of breath was quite refreshing. Running speed only slows down if you are injured, but you recover after about 20 seconds. Even lightly injured and looking through a video camera with night-vision to see where you are going, you can still outrun probably any enemy.There is an interesting story here, and there were scares big enough to make me knock over things on my desk and hit wrong buttons! It seems that only indie titles are capable of scares like this, as I don't recall atmosphere and frights from any AAA blockbuster reaching these levels.If you're interested in Outlast (which you are if you've read this far), I'd suggest checking out the Penumbra series and Amnesia: The Dark Descent first. Those are similar in many respects (perhaps the biggest difference being that they involve puzzles whereas Outlast instead adds cut-scenes), but Penumbra and Amnesia have native GNU/Linux builds. Having said that, Outlast is quite enjoyable under recent Wine releases and provides plenty of good scares.[Update: This game now provides GNU/Linux builds, so it is no longer required to use Wine. I have yet to see how the native builds perform in-game, however I notice the main menu continues to perform very slowly on the same graphics card.]"

I mean I literally was bouncing out of my chair a few times.There is absolutley no letup in this game. Unlike other games where you can take a ""breather,"" in a safe zone, this one is constantly on your back, and the NPC's behave randomly, so sometimes you think you're gonna get it, and you don't. Or sometimes you do! You never know when!The first thing you find yourself doing is mapping out an escape route when you get to a new area cause you know you gotta run at any second.Villians are super creepy in a way that sticks with you, especially with the sexual overtones that add an even higher level of disgustingness to them.Also, it gets high ratings for total WTF moments, think Human Centipede style.Storyline is cliched but well executed.My only criticisms were:1) found micromanaging the camera and the excessive night vision annoying, the game was scary enough that it didn't need it (in my opinon). I found it just slowed down the pace.2) Also would like to see less of the big dude. DLC has much more variety of villains.3) Some of the chase scenes lost their shock value when you played the same scene 10 times in a row to finally find that little escape hole (usually overhead).Only reasons I'm not giving it a 10. Will buy Outlast 2."

The mood is set perfectly with creepy moments with alot of tension and shocking and frightening jumpscares that will make you fall off your chair. The game is excellent at building tension, especially when you are hiding. I do find a flaw in the horror aspect of things which how there is no form of defense which means that if you make a small accident and fall back there is no form of defense. The controls do sometimes feel very stiff especially when trying to go on a window and when turning corners.The sound design and soundtrack is very good with the music syncing very well with scary moments. Overall the game is very well made with very few bugs and a good story. There are some small annoyences like the controls and how stiff your character feels. 7/10 Great Game"

This game was advertised for it's scariness but at least it had a solid story as well.I really like how this game's story was set up, almost movie like. Right away I felt completely immersed, and I was always keeping myself in check. Should I be exploring in this crazy place, or should I just try and get out? I sometimes felt conflicted however when having to explore for batteries, or trying to find all documents for completionist sakes. Being helpless in this game was justified as the protagonist is a journalist, and having the camera to record the asylum's happenings reminded me of my motivations.Outside of great storytelling, I found myself getting extremely annoyed by certain gameplay segments of the game. There aren't many of these parts, but failing repeatedly just annoyed me to the point where I felt like saying ""ok, that's enough for today"". The basic layout is there is an enemy you really want to avoid partroling, and 2 switches scattered off in different rooms. You flip a switch, this always alerts the enemy on patrol, you hide in a locker, and repeat. I found myself failing a lot to certain enemies, and being chased while being so helpless and having made progress just fried my nerves.I never found myself without batteries in my playthrough, but I probably scared myself a lot anyway sneaking around looking for them. The documents and notes were really well written, I didn't feel like any of them were just fodder. Every note had one really important thing to say, and as someone who doesn't like a ton of reading in a game I didn't mind at all.I really think there is something here for both horror fans and just people looking for good immersive storytelling."

The documents and notes your character takes throughout the game just add that extra level of realness to your situation. The enemies are terrifying and had me having to pause the game at more than one point to just calm down.The perfect match that the story and gameplay have is unseen in most games and the DLC really was the icing on the cake.I seriously cannot recommend this game enough.10/10

It combines old school running away from the killer horror with intense horrible gore and some amazingly created characters. you play as Miles Upshurr a reporter who recieves a message from a 'whistleblower' (Waylon Park) that mount massive asylum and the murkoff corporation are commiting experiments that are illegal and that the horrors need to be exposed. you need to record everything you can while dodging varients such as Chris Walker. nevertheless the game is very very scary and has so many amazing elements about it. the only flaws with it are the model of Miles (it has no head and its possible to see this without actually dying) and the AI can be buggy at times but this is a fantastic horror game and its recommended by me10/10 ""LITTLE PIG"" - Chris Walker"

In fact, for a long time, I avoided them as I found them too intimidating. I guess something changed as I got older. After playing games like Alien: Isolation, I started enjoying the genre more. I got some strange kind of satisfaction out of being scared.After reading so many positive things about Outlast, I figured it was worth a shot, especially at the discount price offered during the summer sale. So I bought it.Outlast is not for the timid. I don't have a lot of experience with horror games, but it has to be the scariest game I have played. The fact that you are only equipped with a handheld camera really says it all. You do not face a horde of enemies, but you never know when they show up and when they do, all you can do is run or hide. This creates a tension and claustrophobic atmosphere that makes your visit to the asylum all the more nerve-wrecking.Some of the scenes are extremely graphic, but I assume those who invest in the game are aware of this. The fact that the game world (the asylum) is so grotesque naturally adds to the horror. The game isn't very long (I finished it in about four hours), but the ride is worth every penny. Seeing as the experience is so terrifying, I doubt many people play it through without taking some breaks.The graphics and the sound effects come together really well, lifting an already great game to a higher level. I believe the game is best experienced with headphones as it really immerses the player in the hellhole that is the asylum. However, being a bit of a wimp myself, I used the speakers occasionally. If it gets too scary, playing it during day time also helps!Recommended for fans of the genre."

The atmosphere was brilliantly executed, with the video camera's found-footage aesthetic giving the game a unique style while still evoking snapshots of your favorite handheld horror films.

The graphics are very believable, while the brass stabbing music and sound effects add to the already tense atmosphere.I also like the way that you can hear the characters heartbeat and heavy breathing when he gets scared or runs for his life. Your character can also peep around the corners and look behind him while he is running. Very realistic indeed.This is NOT a monster mash up - In this game... You are trapped inside a world of hurt. All that you are armed with is a video camera with night vision capability, and the strong urge for self preservation. You have objectives to complete and no way of defending yourself.YOU... Are now the hunted. The only way to survive is to run for your life when you have to; creep about quietly sometimes, and also hide inside cabinets or underneath beds, and I find this approach extremely refreshing and very addictive.I’m a seasoned video game player of many years experience. I started off by playing on the arcade machines in the mid 1970’s, and have been hooked on video gaming ever since. I have grown up during the evolution of video games, and have bore witness to them evolving from arcade machines, to home consoles, to home pc's that todays younger generation now expect, demand, and also take for granted as soon as they learn to walk and stop burping breast milk!So - I have been around long enough to now expect extremely high standards in all of my video games today; and this one definitely does NOT disappoint. It is very believable and immersive to play.I give this game a very easy 9 out of 10.If you like this sort of stuff - What are you waiting for!!!Be warned though - This game is best played while you are all alone and in the dark, with headphones on while sitting on a BROWN towel.Most importantly of all – Outlast is so good; it’s not going to be one of those Steam games that you download and then shelf after a couple of hours play."

Armed with a camera and your ability to run fast you must investigate what has happened. What you will uncover is both shocking and terrifying. Outlast is probably one of the most frightening games I have ever played. The graphics are crisp and horrifying and the sound effects/sound track just add to the horror.This is one of these few indie games that come once in a while and throws caution to the wind trying to innovate upon a pretty dead genre. The fact that you have no weapons and you can only rely on your camera to see in dark further adds to the sense of impending doom that resonates in this game. There is never as sense that there is hope for Miles.I would recommend this game to anyone who loves story driven games. Outlast is not only pretty and scary it is actually a great story.9.5/10Ticklepants

You only have a handycam and half the time its so dark you have to use the cameras infared vision.you have to collect batteries through out the game to keep your camera going.beware the less you use your infared vision the less you will have to replace the battery.Hiding under beds and in lockers really adds the suspense as crazed patients break down doors trying to find you.This game is very realistic for its age.every noise you make is heard by these things so when hiding you must wait a while for them to walk away, be to quick to follow them and next minute you turn a corner and they are heading back your way.I found this out the hard way when i was trying to sneak through the water.All in all really cool game and fully worth the money."

Playing this with headphones on is a plus into the experience since the first view brings you the feel of you going what your character Miles Upshur goes thru as he investigates.

I was bored and wanted to play something new, so i bought it, expecting it to maybe bridge the gap till i find something better. I was presently surprised that this game was better. What makes it great is A: the actual quality of the game, and B: the fact that it was quite scary. The atmosphere is amazing, and amazingly creepy. Lighting and sound are stellar, and i found textures to be above my expectations (although not the best). The setting alone is enough to keep you on edge. You are defensless in an abandoned lunatic asylum. Blood and gore are everywhere, along with crazy people (kind of wild cards, some are trying to murder you, others stand still....not hostile, but suceeding in making you paranoid of them). Jump out scares are spread well throughout the game, but arent over used. There are a few ""find three keys to proceed"" segments. They arent that bad, and as tedious as they can be, the scare factor persists as the enemy stalks through the corridors, waiting and watching. The story is.... well lets just say that it isn't as bad as it could have been, ive seen many worse. To get most of it, you're gonna have to read found documents and scrawled notes. Its decently consistent, not to interesting... putting myself in the shoes of Miles Upshur (the journalist that the game is played through the perspective of), I dont think i would care much about the story anymore either, id be to worried about staying alive. That objective of ""staying alive"", i think is meant to be the focus and this game succeeds at making that a hardship, which is the point."

It has a few things in common with games like Amnesia, where the inability to kill your enemies really hightend the experience and makes it so much more of a dreadfull joy.The videos on youtube does focus on jumpscares but the game is so much more than that, allthough it does use jumpscares masterfully (even better than games like Dead Space 2).In this game they really put some effort into the characters you meet and interact with, even for the ones who basically acts like a part of the background and the ""little"" trick, adds a LOT to the atmo of the game.The puzzles are not too clever but they work and seems logical, even thought they from time to time seems a little too convinient. but hey, its entertainment and fiction!..nuff said, get it!9/10"

There is an incredible sense of atmosphere yielding moments of intense fear that last for quite some time, such that the only thing stopping you from closing the game out of fear is the chilling anticipation of what will come next and the deep need to survive the horrors that exist within the asylumOutlast offers a huge amount of gameplay that is almost doubled with the DLC Whistleblower. The story is gripping and shocking at the same time and is progressed through collectible documents and notes. The scares rely less on gore (although there is plenty) and more on atmosphere. Most horror games have a few good jump scares and that's it, Outlast is not like that. While there are several very good jump scares they are not the focus, they are just highlights, accents to the games creepy and horrifying narrative. The only downside to this game is that it has a somewhat cookie cutter style gameplay where you hit a button, hide from a monster and repeat. Nevertheless I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes to scare themselves silly. It also works great for group play because it is very fun to watch. 9/10."

It's one of the best ones I've played in awhile (since Amnesia: TDD), and the story line is interesting enough to keep you playing. You have to use the environment and your intense parkour abilities, since you can't fight the enemies you face. You just have to either hide and hope they don't find you, or hope you can out run them.The only issues I can think of with this game is overall, it's not as scary as it's made out to be (a problem I've run into before with these kinds of games). There are jump-scares, and some of the enemies you face could make you uneasy, but it isn't one that I lost any sleep over. That, along with the continuous need to find batteries for the night vision function of your camera gets kind of tiring because it functions just fine without batteries. Your sight is just more limited and it isn't worth the hassle of finding the limited amount of batteries that spawn.Overall: 7.5/10"

LovecraftOutlast scares me! Thus far I have been able to play it in 20 minute sessions, not for a lack of time, oh no, I am limited to 20 minutes because I lack the nerve to continue. Alone in a dark room, late at night, my nerve is quickly whittled away.Last night I sat down at 8:45 Pm. I can reasonably play until 11:30. This time I leave the lights on in the room. My wife is sitting on the couch only six feet from me. I can do this!The game play is simple. Walk around pick stuff up, click on buttons and open doors. Oh god, opening doors! I don’t know what’s on the other side, it could me nothing… but it could be… something! If there is something behind the door, I will run and hide… because… those are my options.Run or Hide.I have no gun, no strength, and no Fighting chance! I’m not Marcus Fenix, or Master Chief, hell I’m not even as tough as Luigi. I’m a reporter, a writer, an average Joe. This helplessness it what makes Outlast truly terrifying, helplessness in the face of the dark unknown.The atmosphere is tense and the visuals are clean… well, not clean but crisp, or… Horrifying… Yah, Horrifying. For example, after I walk through a puddle of blood, I trail bloody footprints on the floor behind me.I move through Mount Massive Asylum, carefully traveling from dim lamp to dangling florescent light. I’m forced to travel in the darkness. Terrible, terrible darkness, filled with the ruinous remains of the hospitals contents… and the hospitals staff… and the hospitals Patients…  Patients, some dead… some living. Living patients, pushed past the point of insanity. They are now prone to mindlessly inflicting Violence on anyone they can find. If they can’t find anyone… then they will inflict violence on themselves. Violence has become their total being, and their only form of expression.Darkness is an ever present pressure, forcing itself on me… an inescapable weight on my mind and soul. I’m given one tool to combat the darkness. My ever trusty video camera, with a built in night vision setting. At least… it’s trusty as long as I have enough batteries… which I don’t. I never have enough batteries. I am always looking for more, but while I look, I must conserve the precious juice I have. So when approaching a long dark room, I click my night vision camera on, take a quick glance around the room to get an idea of the layout in my mind. Then I turn off the camera… and I run. I do this again and again, always panicked, always terrified.But it’s not just me that is terrified, it the reporter, the character…he becomes overcome with fear. As we run through the darkness we hear the splash of a puddle at our feat… oh god... It’s blood… we push forward his breath intensifying, becoming erratic… Short gasps, punctuated by trembling exhalations… we stumble over something lying in the blood… We don’t stop to see what it is, because I know what we’ll find… the source of the blood, and the reporter knows it too. His breathing is becoming so intense that it is affecting our vision; the screen sways with each rise and fall of his lungs.  The world around us seems to tremble with a terrible fear.Fear overcomes us. Both the reporter and I are paralyzed with it... unable to face the shadows at the end of the hall. We stand motionless for an eternity… unwilling to move forward… unwilling to face the horrible unknown that fill Mount Massive Asylum… I can’t take it.I save the game and quit. The reporter is on his own. I abandon him to wait in that ever oppressive darkness… I look at the clock…It mockingly displays the time as 9:04 Pm.Sigh…"

I have experienced Vapor, survived many Slenderman games (First time i played slender was on Halloween...at midnight...with headphones...in the dark. Yea, not too fun.), and I have nearly had heart attacks from some indie horror games.Outlast trumps every single one of these combined.This game is absolutely engaging. It keeps you involved, making it seem like there is always going to be someone...or something breathing on your neck behind you. One quality though that Outlast has that many horror games or even horror movies these days is that it has PSYCHOLOGICAL horror characteristics. The character that you play is delved into a world of torture, evil, and nightmares...play this game and you will be tossed in as well!"

The devs of this game objective was to scare you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they achieved there goal. First lets talk about gameplay. The gameplay is unique for this type of genre. Outlast brings back the true survival horror aspect by only giving you a camera to survive with against the insane freaks of the asylum. Besides that the mechanics are pretty simple in my opinion. Let's talk about visuals. This game has some of the best graphics to ever be seen in a indie game and is better then most of today's games so it raises the standards of what AAA games graphics should be. Now here is what drops my rating from a 10 to a 7.5. The STORY. Warning may contain SPOILERS. the story is so generic and bland that it takes your overall game experience. You arrive at a asylum to document the events that have been happening and all of sudden there is a mad priest that orders you to tasks. There is this giant pig creature that always manages to find you. Then you meet a doctor who cuts off 2 fingers. Then there is a ghost who haunts you. There is some other stuff in there that just throws the story off like 2 naked guys who appear out of no where and insane people crucify and burn the priest. The worst part is that the ending is really bad and I am not going to spoil that.Outlast is an overall fun and terrifying experience. If you like to get scared at night when the lights then this game is for you.

My brother (who loves horror movies but can't stand playing horror games) wanted me to play this game so he could watch.It is a first-person survival horror game.  You don't actually fight anyone, you just have to run and hide.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story, so much so that I picked up the DLC Whistleblower for it (which I am still yet to finish).  If you like horror games then you will most likely love this game.  As difficult as it was for me, I was able to finish the main story (which I am quite proud of!).  It can be a little bit repetative at times; you will be sent to find something or to fix something and each time you are in a dimly lit locale running and hiding from some disfigured, psychologically disturbed manianc trying to kill you.  Admittedly, at one point I got scared so good that I jumped and through my mouse across the room, resulting in me not being able to escape and obviously being hacked to bits.I was playing on my ASUS G46 Gaming Laptop hooked up to a TV via HDMI cable.  Everything ran smoothly on the highest settings and the graphics were easy on the eyes, so to speak.All-in-all, if you like survival horror games or if you're looking for a challenge you will enjoy this game.

Fear is what it's all about and that's what you're going to find inside Mount Massive Asylum, and it already makes the game a success. With a very well-made storyline in spite of a touchy ending, Outlast is definitely a reference title rivaling Amnesia or Forbidden SIREN. In spite of some problems which are largely due to the tight development budget, hence the small retail price of 20€, the game will provide gamers with a deep dive into the most dark horrors, which will make you forget the ultimately minor faults that Red Barrels let slip pass.

The camera where you can record events see in the dark with the night vision mode to navigate in the dark. What outlast does with jumpscares is they give one that scares you then you become cautious with every door u open after awhile nothing happens so right after you start to get a little bit cocky with door opening and rounding corners they hit you with a jumpscare then you learn your lesson. Thats what makes this game scary espically with the crazed maniacs trying to kill you. As well there are eneimies that just sit and watch you, but they dont attack you so this makes you aware of eneimes or any variants (crazed people) so this makes it alot more scary might get repetive at times but the atmosphere keeps the game alive most of the time.

Interesting story and very good hiding mechanics but sadly an extremely short game.The gameplay is very solid and hiding mechanics are very intuitive and fun to use. The level-design is very straight forward and sadly does not offer a lot of exploration or other ways to solve objectives.The camera-vision is a very cool idea and its night vision mode with all this battery use is a nice interpretation of the well known flashlight mechanic (but ultimately absolutely the same).Your first playthrough should take you about 4 hours or less.

,Recommended,238320,20880675,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,JackxBlack,"TL;DR - 7/10. Lots of jump scares, but as a person prone to them, I was scared. However, it doesn't rely on them only.So I guess I should start off by saying that I am very prone to jump scares. Even though they might not necessarily actually scare me, I will jump in my chair and think about punching the thing that popped out. Luckily I didn't punch my monitor.The game has lots of jump scares. There were times when they were obvious (yeah, dude on the wheelchair, I know you'll stand up to grab me in 0,2s), sometimes a bit less. Sometimes you knew something is going to happen, but not sure exactly what. And I liked that. I know a lot of people think jump scares are the cheapest, least scary things, but they do work on me. So if they work on you too, you might like it as well. On the other hand, thankfully, jump scares were not the only scary thing. The mood was there. Perhaps it's one of the most cliche settings - an asylum overrun by it's patients after a failed experiment - but it was presented very well. The models (as long as you didn't look at them for too long), the environment, the music and the green-ish nightvision postprocess made the (almost) whole experience very heavy and creepy. Overall, the horror part was very good on many levels. One exception is described below, but IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER.Sadly, aside from being just a horror, it's a horror game. Sadly, that was it's weakest point, that also made the horror part worse, sometimes. Lets start with the least important stuff - there were bugs. Mostly graphical issues of assets popping in on low distance or visibly switching between differing LODs. Sometimes it's also possible to spot how sloppy the artist were, placing buckets that were supposed to be on a table, slightly too low which caused them to clip through it, or by putting some kind of document slightly too low, which caused it to constantly flicker. Another rather technical issue, that made things less scary, were poorly done animations. Multiple times opponents were walkin in a silly way, hovering over terrain etc. The multitude of those issues is a problem, but rather small compared to the others.The biggest faults of this game, gameplay-wise, were it's globally used schemes and mechanics. Almost every level was a sequence of objectives - follow the blood (with jump scares and creepy stuff happening, but nothing lethatl) > figure out that to progress further you need to find/turn on/switch X > get chased by an opponent while doing so > activate the thing that you were supposed to initially, that was inactive > cutscene. Sometimes there was also a ""final chase"" that led usually to climbing a vent. It was extremely repetitive on that side.Opponent's AI is another issue. Their behavior is as predictable as it goes. They move along a very simple, hand-drawn path unless they spot you. Then they chase you, without the ability to catch you as long as you're running, until you get away. Being clumsy dummas they are, they get slowed down a lot by closed doors or obstacles that you jump over, which means you need a couple of those, then some shadow and you're safe. Then they go back to their predefined path. Additionally, some of the obstacles are a safe haven for you - enemies cannot pass narrow passages, climb vents or tall furniture, so you can use them as the area reset if necessary.Last two things that annoyed me were - lack of ability to fight back. I understand that I cannot harm the 2m high, 120kg monster, but why can't I at least try to fight back normal sized, crazy people that were experimented on and are most likely weakened by it, when I am a perfectly healthy male? Why can't I grab anything and make it a weapon? Sadly, that is the concept of horror walkers. Other thing is - if I can parkour so well, climbe ledges etc. why, in order to escape the asylum, won't I just break the window (that has no bars!), climb down and the hell out of there? That was the kind of logical issues that annoyed me.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD, I WILL TRY NOT TO ACTUALLY SPOIL ANYTHING, BUT SOME MIGHT NOT LIKE IT ANYWAY.Final issues. Typically to almost all of the horrors, The Big Evil is no longer scare once you show it. Sadly that was the case in this game as well. Fortunately, despite being present since more or less half of the game, it was only the most important thing in the last chapter. Unfortunately, the last chapter gets in my opinion the worse the further we progress, making the very last couple of seconds of the game not logical, considering what we found out previously. I'm not going to spoil anything more, I just think it contradicts the notes, journals and emails that we have found.END OF SPOILERS.Despite those issues I enjoyed this game, got scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiple times and I think it's worth the money. If it would be more polished and if the logical issues would be removed, it would be one hell of a game. Sadly it was ""only"" good."

76561197990921513,Recommended,238320,29494154,Posted: 25 January,all,seblecaribou,"The people at Red Barrels are pretty smart developers. Because if, to all apperances, Outlast takes most of its ideas from Amnesia: The Dark Descent (or the Penumbra trilogy) in terms of gameplay ideas, it puts it in a far less elegant environment and lets that dictates the flow of the game. Forget the gracious verbal jousting of Alexander and Daniel and the self-conversation, because your new nickname is now going to be ""little pig"" for almost eight hours - nickname given by a seven foot tall, disfigured killing machine, that rips people heads off with its bare (bear) hands. That is the ambiance here. Extremely stereotypical creepos in lieu and place of normal human beings with mental illness inhabit the biggest asylum you've ever seen, complete with a prison section, a church, sewers and all that with the flimsiest electrical instalation conceivable. The first steps in Outlast are made to freak you out with a pretty violent imagery, dismantled bodies, blood all over the place and all rendered in a surprisingly gorgeous engine for a team that small. You, a journalist that clearly as suicidal tendencies, simply follow the remarkably well paced and extremely linear story to uncover what went wrong.So the gameplay is pretty much Amnesia. Except you are not finding tinderboxes to light up the place or oil to replenish your lantern; you are only searching for batteries to fill up your video-camera that happens to have a night-vision mode. Because the protagonist is filming all this. Despite the brutality of what he sees and suffers, he keeps on filming. You have the choice to play the game without looking in the camera, but the zoom-in and out and NV are your saving graces here to navigate the dark hallways. It also is your only advantage over the enemies in the game, that consists in the same kind of lethal stalkers that Amnesia had. You can't bit them, except for scripted events that the game will explicitely show you. So your only chance at surviving is finding the next door or crouching in the darkest place possible. Which is, again like Amnesia, a great way to create tension, forcing the player to either listen to the psychopathic a**hole in complete darkness, or looking where he is through the lens of the camera, wasting precious batery that could help finding the next place.The story is delivered through environmental clues as much as the classic notes from RE. But contrary to Amnesia or RE, Outlast has some NPCs that can give short but efficient exposition.And overall, I think that ""efficient"" is the best term to describe Outlast. It isn't a ground breaking game in terms of mechanics, that pretty much consists in light exploration, navigation, and light stealth. It isn't ground breaking in terms of art direction. It isn't amazing in terms of story either. But each elements is really well done, and well done enough that it creates tension from beginning to end. You are not going to be surprised by a second playthrough, since due to the linearity of the game you will see 95% of it in one run. But you will have some fun spooky moments. Not the lingering uneasiness of a Silent Hill, but a cathartic stream of build-up and pay-off, jumscares and stressful shunks of gameplay. It is pretty light in terms of mechanics but never to its disadvantage. Simply put, it is a fun horror game.TR;DLProof that linearity and scripted gameplay aren't doomed to be associated with sh*tty triple A yearly releases, Outlast is the best example of a good (if not great with its excellent ""Whistleblower"" DLC) spook-house. The atmosphere is really neatly built thanks to an efficient art direction that aims somewhere between realism for the technical aspect and its decorum and over-the-top representation of insane people for the occupants. Not the most replayable horror game to boot, but a great and fun ride nonetheless."

The graphics are amazing, the player models were very well made, certain parts are very suspensful, and the monsters tend to come out of absolute nowhere.

It combines the ambiance of a terribly frightening environment, well placed jumpscares, as well as an in-depth story to keep the player interested throughout the entire game. The DLC is also well done as it further enhances the story as well as adds additional game content so it's definitely worth a purchase as well.I do not recommend it if you dislike extreme gore, violence, profanity, nudity, or just horror games in general. However, I believe these elements made the game even more believable and actually drew me into the whole concept.The only con I could find (and it might just be me) are framerate drops when the game saves, loads, and during some of the cutscenes. I'm not sure why this happened but I found no other flaws in gameplay.In short, an extremely well done (and an extremely terrifying) game that I more then recommend you try if you like the genre."

And I can gladly inform you that there are plenty...wait, you didn't wanna know that? Oh, well how about this, is the game scary? I can also answer yes to this question.The strongest part in the game is the atmosphere( what a twist right). Walking around the creepy Asylum can really be  spooky at times. 1 thing that improves the atmosphere is the camera, but I will talk about that more when I get to the gameplay part. Visually the game looks quite nice. The sound desing is great and even the soundtrack and voice acting are suprisingly good and creepy too. All these things combined create a truly creepy atmosphere.Now let's move on the the gameplay. First of all the camera. They really put that thing to good use. You will be spending most of the game using the cameras night vision mode, and when they take that away from, you feel even weak and vulnerable. Speaking of weak, there is no way to fight back in this game. If you see an enemy lurking around, you better hide( the whole hiding thing was also really well done) or run away as fast as you can.The makers of this game really nailed the 1st person view better than most games out there. The character movements seem realistic, and you never leave the 1st person view during the entire game. This can really draw you into the the game.Now to the bad stuff. I do think that the game has too many enemy encounters and the problem with this is that you start getting used to them towards the end, so they get far less scary. There are also quite a bit of jump scares, which do get kinda cheap a couple of times. The game is also a bit too short for my taste, I got through it in about 4+ hours. 1 thing that kinda bothered me(not sure if anybody shares my point of view on this but oh well) is that you don't die easily enough. You can survive multiple hits from enemies, which is something I don't like. It would have been more exciting if they took you out in 1 or 2 swings so you would have to be really careful all the time. But instead you can just tank dem hits.And last but not least, the story is nothing to write home about, and the last act of the game and the final ""twist"" are both quite weak.Overall, Outlast is an enjoyable yet terrifying experience, that all horror game fans should try out. It has it's problems, and because of the last 20-30 minutes, I had a really hard time giving it a score. But in the end, it still is 1 of the best horror games I have played in quite some time. With some minor tweaks, the sequel could be something truly special"

The only item you have on your person is a camcorder which has night-vision capability, which you will need to utilize quite a lot to maneuver throughout the poorly-lit asylum. Of course, this requires battery power, those of which can be found scattered around in various places in the game -- use them wisely.As terrifying as all hell as this game is, it's rather cliche as far as horror goes, and it's repetitive and very predicatble with the Variant encounters; you can usually always tell when an encounter is about to happen, sometimes just by simply surveying the area. Regardless, I still get scared because you have to move around through the darkness stealthily, having poor judgement on where the gore-lusting nutjob is lurking. This game also has its share of pop-out scares, which I hate and give me a heart attack every time.The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. The game was inspired by mental asylums and real cases of mental illnesses, so the level design feels very genuine and authentic. The unnerving dark ambient soundtrack is excellent and really helps compliment the atmosphere of the game, There is heavy detail and lots of corpses, blood and guts lying around everywhere -- I often find myself staring at them because of how detailed they are.Outlast has truly impressive graphics, very detailed sound effects, and is overall very dark and immersive.

Графически Outlast радует глаз: освещение, эффект зернистости камеры и ночное видение сделаны добротно. Эффект присутсвия в игре выше всяких похвал, анимация персонажа от первого лица, тряска камеры - все сделано очень натурально.Огрехи ,на мой взгляд, заключаются в следующем: геймплейно вся игра строится    по принципу ""нажми три кнопки или собери 3 штуки попутно убегая от разных психопатов чтобы пройти дальше"" , не была замечена уникальность каждого прохождения как уверяли разработчики, игра довольно заскриптована. Подача сюжета проседает в середине игры, но под конец все же набирает обороты, развязка происходящего удивляет. Но все эти недостатки можно простить, так как ниша жанра пустует и редко выходят хорошие коммерчиские хорроры и в целом игра очень крута, полностью стоит своих денег. моя оценка 8.5/10.P.S. рекомендую играть небольшими порциями по вечерам, т.к. игра постоянно держит в напряжении и начинаешь привыкать, ощущения от игры начинаешь получать уже не те."

The mansion you escape to at the very beginning of the game is a safe haven compared to the dangerous woods surrounding it. It makes sense that, rather than try to escape, your heroes explore the mansion's twisted corridors. When those warm, luxurious locales eventually lead to an underground laboratory at the heart of a zombie virus outbreak, it also makes sense that they would blow everything up and finish the job.Outlast, for all of its merits, doesn't feature a character who seems to understand his peril. The first hour of the game is nearly perfect, introducing you to the horror at just the right pace, leading to a deep sense of immersion and utter fear in ways that no other game has yet done for me. It was so successful in making me feel like I was there, in fact, that I truly, deeply, wanted to get the ♥♥♥♥ out. It was too much. This is not a place some idiot with a video camera should be hanging out.Think about this story grounded in reality. An incredibly brave journalist walks into a seemingly abandoned mental hospital, only to capture actual footage of a couple of psychotic patients and a few mutilated bodies. He spends a half hour walking around, realizes this is a dangerous and completely insane place, breaks the nearest window, and jumps out of it, running as fast as he can to safety. He submits the footage to his boss the following morning, leading to a full government investigation within hours, garnering national media coverage in the process. The journalist is now borderline famous, gives a late-night interview with Conan O'Brien about his harrowing experience, and is set for a very lucrative career.You would have to be a complete goddamn lunatic to spend more than a minute in that place without a weapon or several well-armed friends. I found myself wishing I could open a window and just jump the ♥♥♥♥ out, risk a couple of broken legs in exchange for not getting mauled to death by some lunatic. The last thing I would do is Resident Evil.Yet this is what you do - delve deeper and deeper into the mystery, against increasingly insurmountable and supernatural forces, all for....video footage? To be honest, I'm not sure. I completely disconnected with the character.It's fitting then, that as soon as I started figuring out the mechanics of the game - running, hiding, exploiting the AI - I began playing Outlast like a video game. Just another video game. A good one, don't get me wrong - but that unique immersive experience was mostly gone, and I was left enjoying the story, the setting, and the ridiculous plot that (MINOR SPOILER) doesn't really tie up too nicely (END MINOR SPOILER), as a passive observer.I liked the game, but I would have loved the experience."

,Recommended,238320,13755335,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Gandhi,"Outlast is one of the best survival horror games I have ever played! The atmosphere is genuinely creepy, with great ambient effects to really draw out the effect on the player. I would recommend getting this game (maybe not the DLC). This game is also VERY graphic, so expect that if you plan to pick up this game. Guts and gore EVERYWHERE and there is some male nudity (minor in the main game and significant in the DLC).If I had to nitpick, I would say that the character models could have used some more detail as most of them aren't super detailed and the scarring looks a bit simple. That isn't to say that all the character models are this way, just the average ""patient"", if you will.The DLC is a big question when it comes to this game. I think the developers did a pretty ok job with it, but it uses many of the same elements (scare types, etc) as the main game. As the DLC is a prequel to the main game, I found that the main game lost some of its zing after playing the DLC. There are also some glitches in the DLC where two main baddies are spawned, a few of the jump scares are not exactly done super well, among a few other minor things. The DLC also has some really great things about it as the ""Gluskin"" enemy is pretty creepy I really really enjoyed how the story was filled out by playing the guy who originally leaked information to miles upshur (your character in the main game).In the end I highly recommend getting this game; however, it doesn't really have much replayability and the main game is about 2-2.5 hours in length. The DLC adds about an hour or so, which still ends up leaving the game pretty short. Ultimately, you are likely going to be playing this game once and then maybe whipping it out to scare your friends once in a blue moon. My advice is to pick it up while it's cheap, as it really is worth it."

Boring. Yawn. We've all seen it before. Actually, if it hadn't been for the 80 percent discount, I wouldn't have looked at Outlast twice. But I decided to give it a go.Boy, was I wrong.What Outlast loses in its boring premise, it gains back in gameplay. Run, hide, or die — love it! Not being able to fight back adds a whole new level of despair and horror ito the game. Knowing that the enemy could be lurking behind any corner at any time, and knowing that you have no way of defending yourself really makes the adrenaline kick in.The typical ""your flashlight might die"" -scheme has been replaced by the camrecorder — and it works. At times, I truly did feel like an investigating journalist trying to capture the horrors of an asylum. At times I was more worried about my camcorder batteries than I was about the patients trying to take my life. And, at times — if not most of the time — I felt scared. Just like a horror game should make you feel."

You play as Markcus Jerpons otherwise known as his callsign Dippus Chipper, a member of the Outlast group. The Outlast is a para-military group dedicated to wiping out all the paranormal activity in the world. You're sent on a suicide mission to Big Mountain Asylum in New Jersey after getting a tip (see Whistleblower DLC) about some zombie mutants that have taken over the asylum and taken your wife, Maryland Choe, hostage. It's your mission to use the advanced technology at your disposal to lead a team of Outlast specialists to find the infamous Doctor Richard and bring him to justice as well as finding your wife. You'll have to use your surroundings to your advantage if you want to survive. Trigger massive avalanches with C4, call in an AC130 gunship and more.Review:I really liked this game. It seemed like much more of a military simulation from the trailers than the actual game ended up being, which I believe ended in it's favor. I bought this game the day it came out and expected another ARMA clone, but was pleasently surprised. There was one mission I really enjoyed when your commanding officer Staff Sergent Charles Burkens climbs a radio tower while you defend from the milita and zombie army below. Normally I'm not a fan of protect missions but this was done very well and the explosive ending where you both go crashing down the roof of Big Mountain really surprised me.Conclusion:I really enjoyed this game and recommend it to anybody who likes a military shooter with minor spooks and ghouls."

This limitation really forces you to listen and pay attention to the environment.  This is not a game for shooter fans.. there is no shooting.  Much of the game consists of moving from QTE to QTE, slowly.  The QTEs however are the best I've seen, requiring you to interact with the environment under stress, and resulting in many novel escapes and near-misses that make sense.  There are also some cool misdirections (things that seem scary but which aren't actually a threat).  Overall the environment is effectively enerving, which is probably great if you like horror stealth games.  I found some of the scariness softening overtime as it became clear that enemies path in a very mechanical repetitive way, but the uncomfortableness the game stirs up are undeniable.  I found myself not wanting to play because I wasn't in the mood for a tense experience, and ended up uninstalling before completing the game.  I still remember several moments from the game as if they happened yesterday, and that to me is saying something.  If you like games of this type, it is worth 5 bucks."

,Recommended,238320,17604279,"Posted: 18 August, 2015",all,Mint,"What's to say about this game that every webcamming Youtuber hasn't said in the past few years. There really isn't a whole lot so I'll just be straight forward. Outlast is SCARY! It has a slightly different take on horror with some of it's mechanics, which is nice but, even to this day I still see the game as nothing but an Amnesia knock off. I'm sorry but Amnesia and Cry of Fear are still going to be my top favorite horror games that I've ever played, but back to Outlast.Outlast definitely spooked me the first time I played it, but at times it felt a bit more suspenseful than scary, which if that's what they were going for they did a great job at it. It's definitely terrifying/exhilarating to be chased by crazy inmates or Chris Walker and it's definitely not fun to hide in the locker until an enemy goes away, while trying to conserve your battery life on your camera. Speaking of which, the first time I played this game I had a big issue when it came to finding batteries and trust me I explored as much as I could (which could be the reason for why my batteries died out so fast).One big problem I had with this game came to the puzzle sections and it got disappointing of how simple they were. This is where they failed for trying to captivate what Amnesia did. In Amnesia you're required to collect objects and mix them with other objects and use them on other objects and to solve puzzles (it was basically a first-person point and click adventure), all while trying to reserve your oil and sneak past enemies. Outlast on the other hand requires you to sneak past enemies and press some buttons, flip a switch or collect some item and make it back to safety without getting killed. While the puzzles for the game are not innovative, surviving encounters with enemies definitely comes close to a whole new level of scariness for me. 1st) the hiding spaces that you have are pretty limited which isn't very fun to handle, 2nd) it's almost beyond pointless to turn off your night vision in the game, especially when you need to see enemies from a distance, 3rd) the sound design is exellent and 4th) there were a lot of times in this game for I literally thought I was not going to be able to progress past enemy because of how scared I was or because of their walking patterns being completely random/unpredictable. While that may sound like a good thing it really isn't, there was one time where I had to hide under a bed and I was completely trapped in this hallway because Chris freaking Walker kept walking past the hallway into a dead end every 15 seconds and gave me little time to escape, it was complete luck that I got out of that situation on un-hurt, which could be a fault in game design, but I'm going to put this on myself because I'm a pretty big wimp when it comes to this stuff despite the fact and Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Cry of Fear are both some of my most favortie games ever.So in my opinion Outlast doesn't do everything perfectly, but in the end I still felt really scared which is what the game overall meant to do.Basically, I enjoyed my time with Outlast and I'm pretty excited for Outlast 2!"

In my opinion it might be the best horror game I have ever played. If you like horror games, you will probably love Outlast. (Particularly if you like to be trapped inside an asylum where something has gone very very wrong and the most of the people you meet will be dead people and/or people you wish would be dead, or at least not there to chase you and kill you. Oh, and also - You can't defend youself. Just run and hope that you wlll not run out of batteries for the nightvision of your camera.) This game will probably scare the living crap out of you. It's brilliantly horribly scary and disturbing and Red Barrels have done such a fantastic job, especially considering it's such a small indie game studio."

It has one of the best DLC that I ever played. Whistlelower in my opinion is the better story. Whistleblower has the the better character's in it like the Groom and Cannibal.

It has the perfect amount of creepy atmosphere, music and psychos to keep you afraid but on the edge of your seat wondering, is he down this hall? wanting yourself to find out you may just get a good amount of jumpscares. In most horror games you're armed with flashlights or lanterns to keep the rooms more lit but in this one you're only source of light in some areas is your camera with a small but helpful zone of light to see in, but as all cameras die you need batteries. All I can say is dont waste your batteries , it gets real dark real fast. Personally I give Outlast a 9/10 . If you think other games get scary oh just you wait..."

,Recommended,238320,19002129,"Posted: 10 November, 2015",all,Scrubsauce,"If I could sum up Outlast in one word, it would be, uh, I dunno...one word? Hmm, I'm drawing a blank so I'll stick with...sticky?  Oh man that's a terrible pun...  I suppose that in the literal sense, the walls, and floor, and all the gore splattered surfaces of the inner chambers of the asylum are probably way sticky.  In the metaphorical sense, some of the more intense imagery has stuck with me weeks after I completed my playthrough of the main story.  Wait- that's the word, intense!Outlast has the usual rising and falling of action you'd expect from a horror-thriller.  You'll spend most of your time on the run or hiding from the enemy AI.  The enemies are pretty decently varied, considering the setting being a locked-down asylum.  Red Barrels still manages to make a nice lineup of crazies trying to murder you without falling into the trappings of other horror games where the ""fear"" tends to dissipate from the enemy becoming too familiar to the player.  The saving grace for the enemies of Outlast is there's no question of their intent, if they get ahold of you they will beat you to a bloody pulp, and in some cases tear you to pieces.  So like any air-breathing human you'll be motivated to RUN.Thankfully there's some breaks in the ""omg omg, please don't let him catch up to me"" bits to do a little exploring of the various sections of the asylum you tour.  Playing the role of a reporter, your goal is to document some shady stuff going down in the mountains of Colorado.  The plot exposes itself slowly via minor tidbits uttered from NPC's, and various notes scattered around the game, but the moment you enter the asylum you know something is wrong.  Red Barrels doesn't create a traditional horror atmosphere, instead opting for what I'm more inclined to refer to as terror.  Yeah, there's a difference and that's probably subjective, but I digress.  The graphics are gorgeous, especially for not being a AAA experience.  Outlast has almost set the bar too high for me, making other Indie horror titles seem kind of fake, or cartoony.My favorite parts of the mechancics are the things that Outlast does that I haven't experienced in a horror game before.  The ability to pick a hiding place, under a bed, in a locker, etc. is a welcome change to the Amnesia-style ""hide in the dark until the music stops"", albeit that's still a perfectly valid strategy.  The thing is, the hiding spaces aren't always safe, and those moments where the bad guy enters the room hot on your tail, and decides to check the ONE bed you elected to hide under are terrifying and will send you running back out the door yelling ""NOPE NOPE NOPE"".  The other main defining characteristic of Outlast is the camera.  Keeping it running will expand upon the story by creating notes by the protagonist and giving their take on the events.  There's also a night vision mechanic that requires traditional resource management fans of Amnesia and Resident Evil will be familiar with.  If you run out of batteries, you won't be able to see in the dark at all, but thankfully neither can the baddies, making the pitch black areas a double-edged sword.  The only part of the gameplay I wasn't very in favor of was the reptition of certain sequences where I knew exactly what I needed to do to progress the plot (usually consisting of turn X valves or pull Y levers to unlock new area), but was having to constantly deal with the hassle of a big baddie trying to squish my head under his big thumping boots.The story nearly becomes irrelevant later in the game because I just so desperately wanted the main character to escape and have a happy ending.  The plot stays competent to the end, though I can see some of the explanations of the more mysterious parts rubbing true horror fans the wrong way with its reliance on more traditional sci-fi tropes.  If you're looking for a more realistic, adrenaline packed NOPE-fest then Outlast is probably a good call."

Batteries are scarce on Insane mode.  You'll stop dead in your tracks as enemies pop out of the shadows before your eyes.+ Great for speedrunning.+ The Whistleblower DLC (sold seperately) is well made and pushes the envelope further than the base game.  Outlast's DLC is a worthwhile expansion if you want more.- Mostly linear.  Outlast has been described as a ""virtual ghost train"".  Not entirely fair as there are various rooms, hiding places, and strategies you can use to survive, but in the vast majority of cases, there's one path out of each danger zone.- Story is mostly cliched, typical horror stuff.- Unskippable cutscenes.  One mid-game cutscene lasts around four minutes.  Great the first time you see it, not so much if you're constantly replaying on Insane mode.- Quite short.Personal recommendation:  As you can probably tell, I think the value here is in Insane mode.  Play it on Insane mode until you complete it, then go achievement hunting on the lower difficulties if need be.  The game really thrives when death is something you fear.  You don't get that with checkpoints.  The Whistleblower is also a worthwhile addition if you want more, especially at its regular sale price."

It's nearly impossible to play without fearing a mental patient chasing you down hallways. The story is quite good and the game has great interaction using notes and doors to prevent getting caught. The idea of the camera being your main way of seeing made the experience very interesting, as it means you want to constantly use it to see attackers, but can't because you need to save battery. My only problem is that in my opinion I find the game pretty difficult, but if you're looking for a terrifying challenge, Outlast is my top recommendation."

,Recommended,238320,29552826,Posted: 28 January,all,Tuckyove,"This game is an instant classic of the survival horror genre, in my opinion. I picked it up for $5 during a sale and which I can honestly say was one of my most worthwhile purchases on Steam. At first I was too afraid to even open it, but after promising myself I'd play the first ten minutes just to say I tried, I was hooked. The gameplay is great, the scares are intense and the excellet blend of lighting and audio make it truly atmospheric. The story is masterfully written and in my experience, keeps you invested despite wanting to back out in fright. The camcorder being the sole usable tool is such an creative and innovative idea that I wouldn't be surprised to see used in other future titles. In addition, the DLC is a great continuation of the story that answers a few questions left at the end of the main game. If you're a fan of the genre, you're doing yourself a misdeed not playing Outlast."

It's oozing with atmosphere, and everything from the soundtrack to the character design lends to it.There are a few levels of difficulty to choose from; the differences between them are how many times an enemy can hit you before you're dead, and how many spare batteries you can hold onto at a time. Each decrease in the difficulty is turned up.The enemy designs are grotesque, and the environment is creepy in its right, especially in any segment where the game forces you to go outside. It is outdoors where low visibility and ambient noise become your waking hell.Chase segments and the stealth oriented segments where ""boss"" enemies are patrolling around looking for you are nerve-wracking in the best ways.Outlast is a disturbing little romp through a spooky, scary asylum and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys stealth gameplay, stressfully spooky environments, and heart-pounding chase sequences."

Von dem Fakt, dass der Protagonist einen Körper besitzt (man sieht beim Runtergucken den Körper, die Beine, die Füße...), einmal abgesehen, ist es möglich, anch Waten durch Blutlachen Fußspuren zu hinterlassen, während des Rennens nach hinten zu schauen und mit seinem Camcorder alles aufzunehmen, um Notizen des Protagnoisten zu erlangen. Die Kletteraufgaben, vor die einen das Spiel stellt, werden durch den Körper und die Kameraführung umso besser und neben einigen Jumpscares herrscht generell sehr viel Spannung in der Luft, da man nie weiß, was als nächstes passiert, oder ob einen der Suchtrupp versehentlich doch noch findet und in Stücke reißt.Die Story, um die es sich dreht ist interessant und wirft einen Blick in die Abgründe menschlichen Daseins, wobei die ""Testsubjekte"" einem doch irgendwie Leid tun. Auch, wenn sie einem Leid antun wollen.Spieler, die sich bereits bei Amnesia in die Hose gepisst haben, kommen bei Outlast voll auf ihre Kosten. Das liegt am Gampeplay, an der Spannung und am Gorefaktor. Wehren kann sich der Protagonist auch nicht, rennen und verstecken sind das Ziel zu einem verlängerten Leben.Als Horrorspiel definititv zu empfehlen.Ich selbst allerdings habe mich nicht wirklich gegruselt, aber ich kenne genügend, die alle halbe Stunde ihre Hose wechseln müssten.

Jumpscare games with tense anticipation.This game is scarier than anything I've played. Spent nearly 15 minutes real time sitting in the TV room with a bunch of the inmates staring at the blank screen of the television because I was too scared to roam the halls after a nasty encounter with one brute. The bad guys didn't bother me in there. I was tempted to stay.The immersion level of the game is amazing. The sounds and sights are cued so very well it's impossible not to get swept up in the nerve-wracking tension. In addtion to the expected ambient sounds of an old building riddled with who-knows-what monstrosities, the main character also makes noise. His camera makes noise. He breathes heavy when he runs or gets surprised by something. He makes noise when he bumps into things.The game jumps between normal vision, camera vision and night camera vision, dictating the visual experience you get. The night vision is especially creepy to me and very true to what I've seen on paranormal hunter reality shows. All very sense-convincing. Only thing that's missing is the smell of dust and fear-sweat in the air.Excellent game so far. Dunno if I'll finish it, it's so intense, but it was worth buying during the President's Day sale."

I actually felt like I was driving that red Jeep Wrangler, parking it at the asylum, walking in the asylum, and everything!The biggest problem, I have with this game is the camcorder is apparently powered by what appear to be AA batteries, despite also appearing to have a rechargeable battery of its own, and the protagonist is somehow able to find AA batteries around the asylum to reload the camcorder with. I think it would make a lot more sense if the camcorder actually worked like most real camcorders, by being powered only by its rechargeable battery, and if the protagonist actually brought the charging cord along with him to plug into power sockets around the asylum to charge his camcorder with, and if the game skipped through time to when the camcorder is charged up, so the players can proceed, shortly afterwards. But other than that, this is a great horror game!"

Other than that there are some scenes with full out nudity, thank Gods for the terrible lighting or I would have saw what hangs between my legs.

Depending on how brave, fast and smart you are this game can last anywhere from 4 to 12 hours in gameplay.  Now a big issue with this game like all ones it the main kinds of times you get scared are from scripted jump scares, like all Horror games these happen sadly. As I remember there are only a handful of the scripted ones but the ""hunting"" parts of the game are horrid. (Horrid in a good way.)  The hunting sequences are when an AI (Weather a standard enemy or a ""boss"") is in the area where you need to solve a puzzel or get a key etc. etc. patrols around looking for you usually in the pitch black.

I knew from the start that Outlast was an intense horror game and I was excited to play it myself, but I didn't quite realize the level of immersiveness until I put on headphones. Instantly, I was placed in Miles' shoes with my camera in hand, creeping cautiously through corridors and around corners, praying my batteries wouldn't run out while I was lost in the darkness being chased by the mutated criminally insane and hearing his heartbeat and breathing react to the stresses of the various situations you find yourself in throughout the game environment. I would soon find my own heart beating in synch with his, my breath catching in my throat while my eyes were glued to the screen with paranoid alertness to the horrors that surrounded me. It would take pulling my headphones off and looking around my room to pull me back into reality and remember that it was just a game.....an incredible, horrific and well-done game.So much can be said about this game that can sum up my approval, but I will limit it to as few as possible; with a storyline that isn't so obvious and characters that can be as unpredictable as youd'd expect real lunatics to be, the first-person perspective and protagonist reactions make this a game that truly transports you there and terrifies you to your core. I can only imagine what this would be like if played on the Oculus Rift....10/10 in my book, with the DLC included. Two different perspectives during the same timeline and both equally as disturbing.

You will especially love this game if you like being scared in a game as there are countless moments in the game that will have your heart leaping out of your chest! The atmosphere in this game is horrifying and each scary moment is set up perfectly.The game also has a marvellous story, although first-time players may miss out on some story elements since they may not collect all of the documents scattered throughout the asylum, each of which will give the player more information on aspects such as some of the patients, the asylum staff, the asylum itself etc. However, the characters in this game more than make up for that as they are so terrifyingly memorable in that they will scare the living hell out of you (especially when you first play the game).Furthermore, the graphics in this game are phenomenal, especially for an indie game. The asylum almost seems real and the visuals give a raw and gritty look, and it definitely suits the atmosphere and story of the game. However, this game also contains a lot of gore as you go through the asylum since you'll be seeing a lot of blood pools and corpses throughout the game, as well as some gruesome death scenes, so if you don't like seeing blood and guts or gore in a game, then you may want to pass on this game as it contains a lot of gore as I said.The only other flaw I have with this game is that the ending felt somewhat anti-climactic, but I won't spoil it for you. Even then, the game is still very scary and lots of fun to play, especially when using headphones and having the lights turned off xDHowever, the developer (Red Barrels) have announced a new DLC (The Whistleblower) that could possibly fix the issue of the anti-climactic ending since it will ""actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.""(source:http://redbarrelsgames.com/games.php)Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a horror fan and/or wants a really good scare. 9.5/10"

Everything fits it's environment and it creates a really amazing atmosphereThe characters look really great. Amazing design choicesGameplayNot much to say here. The gameplay is very, very simplistic. You're not able to attack so everything you do is walk, run, crouch, press buttons and hide from possible threats. Simple and efficientI love the fact that the game auto saves every so often and not only when you're nearby heavy intense sections of the game. This made a huge difference, since on most games, the game auto saves right before a boss or right before an important section of the game.

I really love that series because it's such an amazing way of how they set up the game with psychological terror instead or half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥scare jumps. To wrap it up really fast and not lose more time with Silent Hill, I love how they make you afraid of what you can't see, messing with your head with little details and sounds, so I kinda dislike horror games that just use and abuse scare jumps because it really is the easy way to make someone scared...With this said, Outlast is one of those games that use scare jumps but these are so amazingly crafted that I can't even be mad. Almost every scare jump is set up brilliantly that it almost looks like art. This is scare jumps well made!As I already said, the sound takes the MVP title.

It constantly kept me on edge with hiding, chase scenes and jump scares. The game flows really nicely giving you objectives to complete. Playing this game when it is dark and with headphones on loud really makes it a scary experience! 9.5/10.As for the DLC I was a little dissapointed at the start; I felt like I had no chance to hide and it was all just chase scenes which got a little repetative, and in the end lost its scare factor. I also had a moment where there was supposed to be a ""jump scare"" but I was facing completly the wrong way lol. However, once you get to the 2nd half of the DLC it really starts to pick up again and you once again see signs of the brilliance from the main game. 8/10.£14.99 for the main game, I think this is a fair price, it has quality content and great graphics as well.

The whole experience feels like a nightmare from the get go, forcing you into creepy situations you would never choose to do normally.  Your character meanwhile, breathes and chokes as he encounters increasing horrors.Despite the tension, exploring the game, with it's nearby creaks, thunder, and whispers in the dark - is oddly relaxing.

Each part of the game has a special tone about itself. The presence of AI in the game is awesome as it doesn't just entail the moments of fear but moments of judgement and questioning your path. As you sink deeper in to the gameplay, the game delivers at first the fear of the unexpected, something behind the door, something hiding in the vent but then all of a sudden, you are the mouse that starts running. You leap, run, crawl, and hide your tail as fast as you can closing doors behind you and figuring out the next move. While they are pounding on the door to slice and dice you, your heart starts poudning louder, you feel your anxiety creeping up and your palms are always sweating.Don't look back.

I thought to myself ""This game isn't that scary I won't♥♥♥♥♥♥myself"" Boi was I wrong. This game has made me reached levels of anxiety I have never reached before. But enough ranting here are the pros and cons of the gamePros• Great story mainly focuses on it unlike Outlast 2- Gameplay elements really give you that immersive experience- The soundtrack will keep you up- You won't need a good Pc to play this game. Happy they added optimization for crappy pc's like mineCons• Too short 5 Hours max 6( I finished it in 4 but it all depends on how you play the game)•Some glitches here and there but it won't affect gameplayOverall I think this game for just $3 is a bargain. It doesn't matter if your scared of horror Games for $3 this game is more than worth that. My score: 9/10"

My logic with shelving it was that, yes the game is terrifying, but I anticipated that the game would continue to have this pattern right up to the end: Play the game, be completely terrified, die. Go back to last checkpoint. Less terrified now. Die. Back to last checkpoint. Game isn't scary anymore because you know what's going to happen. Advance to next stage. Rinse and repeat.I was wrong.The reason I was wrong is that there are a lot of checkpoint saves. A lot. The game saves really frequently. I am so glad I finally decided to just beat this game, because it's about the most disturbing and one of the scariest games I've ever played. Like, holy crap guys. Why are you even reading this review when you could be buying, installing and playing this game with the lights out and headphones in. I wish I could wipe my memory of this game, just so I could play it again.The DLC ""Whistleblower"" is just as terrifying as the main game, but even more disturbing. It's about half the length. Definitely worth it.Start out on hard mode, as normal mode just means the normal enemies can hit you 5 times with a baseball bat with a nail in it before you die, which pulls you right out of the immersion because that's ridiculous. Just don't get seen or hit, which is completely managable."

It has a great, unsettling atmosphere that it introduces to the player with great pacing and wonderful immersion. While playing, I would pretend I was taking part in a ""found-footage"" style film, and rarely put the camera down. The game's scary atmosphere is complemented by the stealth gameplay. Sometimes I would find myself running for my life, but most of the time sneaking was very effective. And then I noticed that not many of the scary things around me really hurt me. Most of the things that did were easily avoidable.And then I realized that I wasn't really scared anymore. Without fear I was left playing a sub-par stealth game, totally lacking any desire to continue. Pick it up for cheap if you can, I'd definitely recommend it. I just got bored."

,Recommended,238320,12106738,"Posted: 15 September, 2014",all,TJX2045,"9 out of 10:Some of the original Silent Hill games, the first F.E.A.R. game were among the few horror games to truly scare the $%@! out of me and make me really uncomfortable.  Now that I've finally played Outlast (which I luckily got during the summer sale) and beaten it today, I can add it to the list of games to actually scare me and not use only cheap jump startles like some other ""horror"" games (because being startled is different than being SCARED).There are definitely jump scares in this game, but the real terror comes in the tension in the atmosphere and the build up.  After the jump scare, the terror is made worse when you find out what is chasing you or see it up close.  One of the most terrifying moments I had in this game was in the beginning when I was being chased by the first prisoner and I decided to look over my shoulder.  Turns out this was a terrible idea as he was RIGHT BEHIND ME and I screamed bloody murder.Silent Hill is the only other horror game that actually made me scream out loud before this.  Normally I just curse a lot when I play horror games or make a loud gasp, but even in times where I tried my hardest to bite my lips together and stifle my sound, the game somehow still got me to scream.  The way the atmosphere and the ambient noise #%%s with your mind is absolutely insane.  But I love it and no matter how scared I was, this game was definitely worth it.The only negative I can think of is It will be frustrating and you will die many times.  You may even become a little numb to certain scenarios once you have to repeat them after death, but the levels and areas have enough differences between them to keep you on your toes the entire time.  Claustrophobic?  The game has it.  Agoraphobic?  It has that too.  Something that might be considered negative by others would be the battery duration, but unless you're playing on Hard or higher, most of the time you can find plenty of batteries if you're not too chicken to explore.Regardless, this game is worth it and you must play it the only way that I believe it should be experienced:  In complete darkness, with a pair of headphones (surround sound or amplified gaming headphones recommended) and a controller.  Make sure you crank the volume up and you're in for a wild ride."

Outlast has been criticised, Outlast has been praised.. Some people say that it isn't scary, some people are scared by it.. Fear is quite personal if you think about it.Firstly lets take a look at the history of Survival Horror to just prove a few people wrong about this game. The original Survival Horror, or rather the first game to be defined with this genre; Resident Evil for the Playstation, is that game scary to you? Because it isn't to me, yet that is the game that made the genre, so why do we forget that? Then criticise this game or other games as to how they are not true Survival Horror.Let me tell you about what, to me personally, a Survival Horror game is.. The fear of subtelty, knowing that somewhere out there someone is stalking you, the andrenaline you feel when you are being chased, the fear of being found when you are hiding, there is no guarantee of you being safe, and no guarantee you are in danger... But your main goal is to Survive, to push through each area of the game and survive, get through the story, take in the information from your surroundings alone, set an atmosphere for you to actually feel emotions from, that to me is what a Survival Horror game is. And Outlast delivers on that.(I have heard other people say similar things about Resident Evil 1 funnily enough)Now I have played through this game, more than once, however I got it originally on a different platorm, I played it on the PS4 when it came out for free in February for PS Plus (A service that gives free games monthly on all platforms which include PS4, PS3 and PS Vita) I enjoyed it immensely, I had seen gameplay of the game from various YouTuber's and I didn't actually enjoy watching it that much to be honest, but playing the game I thought ""I'll give it a go, after all, IT'S FREE!"" and as I said, I enjoyed it immensely. The game was just so incredible for me considering I have never liked a Survival Horror game before, so you can imagine my surprise as to how good it was to me, also I'm not easily impressed might I just add, the game set a creepy atmosphere, yet because of my intrigue about the game, I press forward, I get through the game, I love it, I play it another 3 times on higher difficulties, try and get all the files, fail, but stil enjoy it. Every section of the game to me is perfectly timed, from the introduction to the mechanics to introduction of each psychopathic character that stalks you throughout Mount Massive Asylum, the area's, lore, even the music.Let me talk about the characters for a while shall I?Firstly, I would like to go through the characters in a random order, rather than the order you encounter them, that way it doesn't truly spoil it if someone reading this review (Who am I kidding?) decides to buy and play the game with my review in mind. (Again..)Right, Father Martin, he's an interesting supporting character to me, he sets the mood at certain intervals, gives you a sense of direction even, he never truly interferes, never truly guides you, but he gives you informaiton, tells you things, drops you hints when you see him, that sort of thing..The Twins.. This creepy rapey looking pair stalk you at times with Machetes... They are also Naked so that adds to the creep factor.. Two guys (Brothers mind you) following you around, butt naked, with blades.. Yeah. Creepy as ♥♥♥♥.The Doctor.. What can I say about this psycho?! He is ♥♥♥♥ing insane, thinks he's helping people almost, tries to get to know you before he kills you, he acts jokey about the fact he's chasing you as well, I enjoy his one liners when he loses track of you I can tell you muchChris Walker... Now he is, by far, the most enjoyable character in the story for, me, he follows you throughout the whole game, and you almost enjoy it, I would love to know who his Voice actor is (I really should have looked it up before now, but I will after this!) because his lines are just great. The feeling of knowing when he specifically is stalking you, and it's better when on Harder difficulties because you'll die in one hit from him, a large brute of beast, he stalks you, muttering away to himself.I love the atmosphere he creates simply by being there, my immense joy for having experienced this character in Outlast is one of my main motivations to have bought this game again on PC and of course picking up the DLC whilst I was at it. I also went ahead and got all the Trading Cards for this game, crafted the badge and got a Chris Walker emoticon.. I did all of that, just for Chris Walker, I love this game and I would reccomend it to anyone.. They should make some Outlast ringtones XD, especially if the voice actor for Chris Walker makes one :P ""LITTLE PIG I HEAR YOUR PHONE RINGING, YOU CAN'T HIDE NOW""Buy this game people, I would talk about the DLC but I won't right now, (Which is goddamn incredible too!) So please people, don't judge this game, for me it was incredible, I can't make others like it but I can at least say, don't bloody judge it.. Enjoy Outlast!"

If I had played the game with earphones, I would probably even have felt a bit more scared due to the game's amazing sound design and creepy environments.The game will try to gross you out many times, but to me there was only one part where it was annoying to watch, even though it's blurred.This is not a game for kids, nor for the faint of heart.

The whole environment is terrifying, tons of detail, and the ambient noises were very creepy, like the screams of the insane patients and loud footsteps coming from behind or above you. Even though there wasn't too much of this, the dialoge for the characters you meet in this game was done very well. The graphics are pretty nice and the gameplay was smooth. They didn't go overboard on jump scares, which is a good thing because they are usually just a cheap way of making a game a ""horror"" game. But they were done very well in here, places you will never expect to get jumped at and there wasn't too many where it got annoying. I highly recommend trying to collect all of the files and record all of the main events and read the notes your character writes, it really makes the story more clear and even better! The outside parts of this game were done pretty well, it was a bit difficult to find my way through it, but you don't want a game to be too easy. And that reminds me, I recommend playing no lower than hard difficulty, in fact, I say go up more! I really don't have too many complaints on this game. I honestly took a good few minutes to think, and came acrossed nothing. If you are into survival-horror games with a good story and fun gameplay, highly detailed environment, I would absolutely recommend this game! But I definitely recommend getting the DLC along with it too, but play the main game first! I think everyone needs to try this game that hasn't already, and don't look anything up on this game, playing without knowing anything about the game is the best!"

Kinda.You play as Miles Upshur, a journalist that has come to investigate an asylum after receiving an email, pretending that strange things are happening in said asylum.And so you are armed with nothing else than a camera (brand not specified), allowing you to 'see' in the dark with an infrared feature that sucks batteries faster than a succubus can suck your soul.And thus, with your camera you bravely dodge, hide, run for your life and overall try not to die horribly in that asylum !You meet many enemies, well, two kinds of enemies that is ; the basic goon, armed with an axe, a wood plank or any other homemade weapon and what I call 'bosses'. They aren't much more dangerous that the basic goons...oh wait, yeah they are. They can kill you instantly !Suffice to say that you avoid any and all enemies in this game, and at some point I thought it was more annoying than scary !Talking about scary...The game is not very scary, basically good old fashioned jump scares that never failed to make me jump a bit (yeah I'm sensitive to those), but I would say that if you remove all of those you remove every scary element of the game.The ambience is well made, but not so oppressing, at least it didn't affect me the way I imagined it would :oBut there is one element, one thing that happens in the game that really disappointed me...I won't be too specific about it, to avoid any spoilers, but I will just say that it felt like a scenaristic laziness. The guys that made this game just had to use that overused, overrated, crappy plot twist that has never worked, and never will, and it's a damn shame...I shall now summarise my experience with this game :Pros :- The devs kept their concept to the end- Good feeling about it all- Very stressful situations- Basic but efficient gameplayCons :- Lazy plot twist that kinda killed it at the end- Overused situations (get the key to open the door...)- A bit frustrating sometimesOverall it is a good game, a very good game to some extent, but it could have been a great game if not for that plot twist at the end...I recommend it nonetheless !PS : The DLC Whistleblower is basically the same as the main game, so the review stands for it also :)My commented playthrough :https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLffYB9tYe2fzPb2z9ByvqfdoQLHM2e30r"

The best way to describe Outlast is a modern day Amnesia: The Dark Descent. You spend the game exploring the dark environments while running and hiding from phsycopaths galore.THE GOODOutlast is good in many departments, but the place it shines the most is the presentation. Outlast is one of the best looking games  I have seen. Even if you were to put it on the lowest settings, the game still looks amazing. While it is not the best looking game ever, It is one of the best looking games I have seen. Another great thing is something that is vital to make your game scary: the characters and environment. Whether your being pursued by the intimidating yet interesting Chris Walker, or the disturbing and absolutely insane doctor, you be constantly on your feet for the majority of the game. (Keyword being ""Majority"") Another place the game shines is it unique camera system, Which gives it a found footage vibe. While you can explore the game without barely using the camera, you need it for two things: you need it to learn a bit more about the story, As the Protagonist will at times make a comment about the situation at hand in the form of notes. Its also used to get around areas with its night vison camera, which is vital to getting around in the game.THE BADWhile there is more good than bad, there many problems with the game. One of these problems are the length of the game. The game (depending on how good you are) took me and others about 5 hours to complete. This is by far the second worst problem with the game. Another problem is the final boss. While most enemy's in the game are memorable and well designed, the final boss is as bland as they come. I do not want to spoil anything, but you will know exactly what im talking about. Finally, the worst part about Outlast is the 3rd act. To me, the game at that point became very repetitive, and just not scary. And to top it all off, we get a ending that's complete s@#t.VERDICTOverall, Outlast is a very decent game and you should defiantly buy it: During a sale.SCORE:6.5/10I also apologize for some of my poor grammar in this review :)"

Outlast starts off with you going into Mount Massive Asylum, where your only goal is to explore the abanonded asylum and try to escape.The game can be completed in only about 4 hours even if you spend time looking around. The gameplay itself is pretty mediocre and the tasks it has you do can get pretty repetitive. It basically has you do ""quests"" where you need to find 3 objects or turn 3 valves to move on, and it has you do this multiple times. While it's not the worst thing in the world, it would of definitely been nice if they spiced it up a bit.   The atmosphere of the game is the only thing that kept me going and wanting to see what waited for me in the next hallway.All in all the game is worth the price if you happen to see it on sale for 5 bucks, but I certainly wouldn't suggest you spend full price for it."

Not only the graphics are superb, but also the sound adds to the eerie feeling you have all the time. I also liked that the character clearly shows his fear by fast breathing and whimpering - and trust me, it is all too natural to do so when you experience such terror.The controls are also very good. It is most of the time quite easy to manoeuvre through the asylum. Only once in a while, I tried to jump over or crouch through obstacles and it did not work because I was supposed to take another route.The story and the background information you learn about throughout the game are also very intriguing and fit nicely into the scenario.I can absolutely recommend Outlast to all horror fans who are not too afraid of running like hell from various atrocities that will be encountered in that asylum. And you often have to either run or hide because you will never fight as you are a journalist, not a soldier.I will always remember Outlast as one of the most frightening titles I have ever played. So, go ahead if you are prepared for a sinister joyride."

I don't really remember writing a review for a Horror-game before, and I'm sure that, somewhere out there, are a bunch of adrenaline junkies hollering at me: ""YOU CALL THIS A HORROR-GAME?"" Yup. Damned Straight. No, it's not Resident Evil, or Doom 3, or Evil Within, Left 4 Dead Part (insert number here) or whatver else you base your thrills on. It's a walking simulator, I noticed... You don't GET an arsenal of weapons to kill all MF'ers. You get a camera with an infrared function, a journal you don't even have to write or read, you get dropped of at the front door of creepy asylum that looks big, but IS HUGE, you find your way inside, and AWAY WE GO!I'll try and be careful with spoilers here.Dark rooms and halls, flickering lights, plot scares that not only work, but actually managed to scare me AGAIN 2nd playthrough, even though I knew it was coming. And then there's the ""nice"" people you meet; the patients and staff of this fine facility are not only scary, they are down right DISTURBING! You can't fight them (nor should you... You're a skinny, white reporter with a notebook, a camera and a probably a name tag that says ""little pig"" or something.) You RUN from the big bad wolves. You HIDE! And even when you do, you still have to be smart about it, 'cause they're LOOKING for you! And they WILL find you!And then, of course, there's how the story develops... - Like a horror game/walking simulator SHOULD! - Running, panting, heart-in-your-throat, out of one hopeless situation into another. Running away from some VERY bad people, WHO DEFINITELY don't have your best interests at heart, right into the waiting arms of somebody WAY worse!!! And, (even if you don't even take the time to read the story or the journal along the way,) there are still some gutwrenching, tongue-biting, crap-your-pants twists in the plot that'll have you thinking twice about playing the game by yourself.Controls: Not perfect. But they aren't hard to learn or master. And while you will make mistakes with them, they're more likely be because your under stress and don't get the controls right, rather than the controls glitching out on you.Graphics: Gruesome. In the good way. It's juuuust simple enough that you won't fry your computer unless you actually TRY, but juuuust detailed enough that you'll probably wish it wasn't.Story: Brutal, Disturbing, Suprising and VERY Creepy, obviously. Tip for 1st playthrough: whenever you think you've seen the worst scare this game has to offer, you can be damned sure you're wrong, and you will find out. (Whistleblower adds even more.)Overall: For a walking simulator horror-game, this game sets the bar. 10/10 (And the sequel's cooking as we speak, so they just might jump over it, grab it, and beat us all scared stiff with it.)Ok. I'll hand out the big compliment the more twisted of the dev's probably want: ""WARNING! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION!"" I'm no medical authority, but I'd feel bad if I didn't warn you..."

None of them was special, they only contained jumpscares and some good stories, however Outlast is different,though Dead Space was also great but it couldn't beat Outlast.This game is a 'must play' for every type of gamer or even human and here is why this is my best horror game and my favourite game of all time:1-Outast contains unexpected jumpscares. And every jumpscare was related to the story, !SPOILER!honestly the most scary things are the chases.2-Incredible story. I'm really shocked about the story!, it's fantastic!, it's fabulous!, is there any greater word to say?From all the stories I've either heard, or read, or listened, or watched, or played. this game's story on top of all of them.Especially when I played the DLC, It was the greatest prequel I've ever seen in my entire life!.3-Quotes. Sounds odd; but here are some of the greatest and funniest quotes I've ever heard:We have to contain it!Somebody has to win and somebody has to lose here, I don't make the rules.Let me sell you the dream!I want a family, a legacy. To be the father I never had.I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad.If this is you on the honeymoon, I'd hate to imagine our anniversary.Heavier than you look. A little cardio wouldn't kill you.Hey, nobody likes a quitter!4-Awesome villains. Unlike any other game, the villains in this game are really well created. every single villain has its own pros and cons, and its own story. It's impossible to find useless props or pointless characters. Everything is a part of the story and explainable.5-Unforgettable soundtrack. Much respect for Samuel Laflamme on this work.The only parts I hate about this game are:Violance, sexual scenes and language are so extreme, it's not suitable for any age."

This review is posted for those of like mind.  I don't play video games to act as I would in real life...I play to do amazing things.  I play Total War because in real life, I'll never command a massive army and build an empire.  I play Fallout and Metro because I'll never actually live in a post apocolyptic world where amassing weapons and slaughtering bandits is the means to my survival.  And I don't usually play Horror-Survival, because in real life...I'd run away and hide from these threats.  So I don't want to do that in my gaming.Having said that...many die-hard fans of the genre may disagree with my review, and that's ok...I would not dare to challenge the assessment of more experienced players in this space.  Personally, I didn't think the game was ""scary"",  but that's a pretty subjective term.  What one person finds frightening, another may laugh at.  So I'll just say that I found the game to be an awesome excersize in stealth.Regardless of what anyone may think about the 'horror' aspects of the game, it boils down to the ability to effectively sneak past adversaries, gather intel or items, and get out without being detected.  And the tension and anxiety that accompanies those efforts is delightfully intense.Bottom line, I enjoyed the game start to finish.  Die-harders may take issue with my comments, and as I said, I won't take exception to the opinions of more experienced horror-survival players.  But for those of you who are NOT fans of the genre, I would suggest you pick this one up.  If nothing else, it's a good way to expand your horizons.P.S.  Just finished the dlc, Whistleblower, and it contains the most disturbing scenario I've seen in 20+ years of gaming."

From the very beginning, the warped atmosphere will leave you looking over your shoulder.UPDATE:  I've now played Whistleblower, and my opinion hasn't really changed towards the main game.  See my whistleblower review for my thoughts on it.Pros:-The story is interesting.  However, it honestly isn't interestingenoughto make you really care.  (See this continued in cons).  I think this is because the game is more focused on gameplay.-Night Vision Camera!  It's a cool take on the light-giving tool mechanic.-The environment made me feel genuinely scared at points-Less Jumpscares, more Psychological Horror-You can look down and see your whole body! (Great attention to detail from the developers).Cons:-By the end of the game the story is, without spoiling anything, open to interpretation, I felt confused and wanted to know more.  Perhaps that's just me, but I think it could've been better.-The game does at times feel like a rendition of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, with more annoying enemies.  In Amnesia, Enemies tend to permanently disappear after an encounter, not roam.  In Outlast, they roam.  This may be a pro to some and a con to others, but I mention it in my cons list because after a few times the game felt like hide and seek in the dark.-The hide and seek parts make completing objectives while tip toeing around enemies annoying rather than scary or adrenaline-fueled.  Because of this, the game took me over a year to actually get around to finishing (I started August 11th, 2014 and finished November 7th, 2015), mainly due to being annoyed that after making so little progress, I had to stop and play hide and seek again.-A very interesting type of enemy that could have been a nice addition to the overall game only appears at the end, which was disappointing.I always try to list around the same amount of Pros and Cons, so don't take my opinion as too negative.  Outlast is definitely something worth playing if you're interested in the Horror Genre.  8/10 from me."

The sound design is superb, with little sounds indicating the presence of nearby enemies and tense ambient music when something significant happens in the game world. The attention to detail is another factor that creates such an effective atmosphere. The walls look real, lighting has a full spectrum of dark to light, and animations are realistic.The camera is a nice gameplay element. The night vision is the most realistic I’ve seen in games and extremely creepy when navigating pitch black environments (plenty of those).What I enjoyed most about Outlast was the disturbing story. I won’t spoil anything, but it’s very well done and there are certain moments that really shine. The only problem was how quickly it finished and left me wanting more.Buy this game. It’s short, but very well made.♥♥♥♥ THE SEWER PART."

It's about 4 hours long, if you can rush through certain sections, which is pretty straightforward since you can just rush past certain enemy types. Hiding is only ever so optional as the enemy AI is pretty tame and tends to ignore or look past you.The game mechanics are somewhat lacking in this game since it revolves around your camcorder where you have to acquire batteries for which are scattered through the maze-like asylum. The asylum itself is pretty huge and where about 80% of the game takes place (other sections being the sewers and the underground labs).There are also documents and notes to collect, but on a generic playthrough, they're hard to miss (unless you're an achievement hunter).I enjoyed this, but it doesn't have a big replay value to me.

Reminder tho: this is more like a personal experience than a decent review. I start with an unimportant intro, followed by a complete ♥♥♥♥♥torm of words about my own experience with the game, but at the end I sum up some pros and cons. So if you’re not really into reading a lot of unimportant but straight-out-of-the-heart commentary, you can directly scroll down to the summary.I bought Outlast during the Steam sales last October (Halloween and stuff) and I was so excited to play the game, just because of the trailer. So when I finally jumped into it - together with a friend sitting next to me ofc - I was very excited and curious. Sadly, after the 2nd jump scare (no spoilers, there is more than one jump scare in the game) my friend and I screamed like two little ♥♥♥♥♥es and I turned off the game, without playing it for a couple of months.After a few months, I restarted, accompanied with two more friends, hoping we would outlast a bit longer, but now I got stuck in the 1st ""hide mission"", you know, those objectives when you need to sneak around without getting detected or else your head will be ripped off.. So yeah, I had a bad start playing this game. BUT: one summer day, in my attic during a great storm, I finally found the man - or woman, no sexist here - in myself and completed Outlast in just a few hours.The thing I loved the most about Outlast was its ambience. Sure, there are a bunch of jump scares and all that, but what made the horror in this piece of art was for me everything else: the environment, the music, the NPC's, but let’s start with the gameplay. I got used to playing “the vulnerable victim who can't fight back""-thing, since I played Slender and Amnesia and all that, but this game took it to a whole new level. First of all: THE ♥♥♥♥ING HANDCAMERA! It's such an amazing idea, and was executed very well. (NOTE: remember to put on your camera after a cut scene, because sometimes that doesn't happen automatically and then you forget recording and the game won't add notes to your journal.) Second: the parkour. Although sometimes a bit unrealistic (""Oh no, I'm followed by murderers, let me just wrench myself between these racks and they'll stop following me"") it was really amazing to know that you have a force - your agility - to outsmart your pursuers. Technically, it also worked very smoothly. I don't have a gaming laptop, so I couldn't play it on high settings - which I recommend, ambient feeling, y'know - but it almost never lagged or glitched or whatever. As said, the true horror of Outlast isn't in the jump scares, but in things like the environment. I remember myself thinking ""Oh really, an asylum? How original"", but boy oh boy original it was.!!!MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!!Although it all started very cliché, with the crazy people and stuff, you'll learn after a while that there is something MORE to it, and with more I mean supernatural... That's what I actually kinda disliked about the game, since I am not a big fan of supernatural stuffENDING OF SPOILER ALERTBut then again, how amazing is a game when you get to love it, even though you're not a fan of the storyline?I also deeply recommend playing The Whistleblower DLC since it gives a lot more information about the storyline, which is a bit unclear after completing the normal game.To sum up (for all the lazy people who did not read my interesting opinion)PRO:- the gameplay (camera, parkour, hide and sneak)- the music- the NPC's (they are REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up, I can tell you that. They are also very memorable. There won’t pass a day without you thinking about Chris Walker, Trager, Wernicke and – ofc – Eddie “The Groom” Gluskin. They were given so much personality! )- the ambience and environment (especially the truly disgusting parts, they make Outlast Outlast)CON:- the unrealistic aspect of pursuers stopping to pursue you after you wrench yourself between racks- the story (my humble opinion, one of the main aspects of the story is something I don't like)- THE MOANING!!! For real, let me explain this quickly. Although it adds a lot of tension, hearing your character moan and his breath trembling, it got kind of annoying after a few hours. On the bright side, the game doesn't take more than a few hours, so that's fine.I can't wait for Outlast 2 hihi #shamelessfanboy"

,Recommended,238320,17851524,"Posted: 2 September, 2015",all,FinDefaulted,"Tiny spoiler alert.Kind of like Amnesia. You navigate through a dark and scary asylum. Gameplay is rather interesting and there were lots of times that I got jump scared, but the overall ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; feeling disappears quite fast.This is a rather short game and to increase the gameplay time, there are ""puzzles"" in which you need to ""get x items""or ""open/close x stuff"". I don't really see the point in forcing the player to avoid some big bad guy while trying to find/use something to advance. It was kind of thrilling the first time when you escape the fat guy and end up avoiding one mainiac to turn on the valves, but after that it starts to feel annoying, since it feels forced and breaks the flow of the game.[SPOILING A LOT HERE]Then there is the super mega ghost, walrider. I kind of feel like they got inspired by F.E.A.R. but I think the game would have been more enjoyable with just the crazy maniacs.In the end outlast was a good horror game and you'll propably like it, but I wouldn't call it the scariest game ever."

With solid graphics, excellent atmosphere, and intriguing characters, Outlast does what many AAA games cannot: genuinely frighten their audience, and leave them wanting more."

Once you get inside you get stuck and you are forced to look for an escape.I do recommend this game for horror-game enthuisasts or people who just want to play something ♥♥♥♥ed-up and scary. It has got all of the most vital elements of a good horror game and while I do find the story to be a bit unclear and confusing in the maingame, the dlc ""Whistleblower"" makes up for it.So my advice to you if you decide to buy this game is toBUY and play the dlc as well.It will make the story feel more complete and it's also a really nice experience.Horror: 8/10Story: 9/10 (8/10 or 7/10 without the dlc)Gameplay: 10/10Music/Sound: 10/10Immersion: 7/10"

People were playing it left, right and center. And for a very good reason! This game is bloody good!It's set in a first person perspective, where you go around, nervously turning your camera on and off to see any glimpse of salvation using the night vision esque effect on your camera, which from time to time you'll have to reload with a fresh batch of batteries. And I swear, whenever a dark area came up, I seemed to be on my last two and couldn't find a single damn battery anywhere to help keep my nerves in check. Now that right there, is not a good feeling to have when you're navigating a house of horrors!The game does a very good job of creating a nice, dark, scary atmoshpere. Certainly so when a big, insane guy comes chasing after you with the intent of doing horrifying things to your corpse!When I think of popular horror games, the first two in my head, without question is Amnesia, and of course, Outlast. I personally enjoyed Outlast a whole lot more than I did Amnesia. Hell, I even beat, Outlast and I expected it to be one of those games that I would never finish, and boy am I glad I pushed through and continued to play. The more I played the more I seemed to enjoy, and a little part of me was dreading when I finally beat the game, and another part of me was thinking, thank the lord I won't be terrorised anymore. But when I think back to my time with Outlast, I can't deny how much I really did enjoy the game.Honestly, Outlast is a game you need to experience if you're even remotely a fan of horror games. It just does it all so well, and most certainly deserves your attention."

The game is extremely dark, mostly pitch black so you'll need night vision on quite often.  The night vision is incredibly well done and looks very nice.  The game is linear but very well paced.

The gameplay is simple but the variety of enviroments and enemies make for enough variety to keep things interesting.  As well, there is an added weight to the game as story events that hurt your character can be felt as you play which really adds a sense of danger.Outlast really is over the top in blood and guts, and it does those things better than actual horror.  That isn't to say the game isn't scary, but if you are only looking for scary there are better games.  Outlast gives a nice mix of fast pace, horror, and intensity as it tries to be as disturbing as possible.It's a solid game.  Not huge.  Not a lot of replay value.  But the first go of it is quite memorable.  I'd recommend it to horror fans.  Maybe not as much as some other games such as Amnesia which is much scarier, but I'd still recommend it."

Also the fact that the game does not solely rely on events and cutscenes to tell the story but mainly the collection of documents made me want to explore more and enhanced the whole experience. The use of the camera helped too because I didn't just feel like I had to keep going through the motions but I needed/wanted to record as much as I could in order to recieve the notes which showed the thoughts of the character that you play as.

Then have a good think about how the creative industries as a whole use reviewing to part you from your cash. Theft really is not the word for it.I like a good scare. This game is good at scaring. However it is not the immersive terrifying experience that  some (paid?) reviewers have been prone to bill it as. The best games ever produced had fantastic scripts written by very talented people balanced with superior game mechanics that match the intended experience. This feels like its a level below that. It relies on in your face frights and atmospheric noises just a little too much whilst neglecting, a little too much, a truly terrifying script/game design that will fully engage your imagination.After a few hours the scared stiff breathing of the main protagonist gets more than a little annoying. The inablity to fight back is, to begin with, a treat to get the adrenalin running. However I'm often brought out of the game immersion to simply get annoyed at the noises he makes along with the lack of retaliation or even... I don't know! maybe effin knock something over behind you as you run or hit that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a plank in the dark as he comes through the door. DUUUUDE do something to survive you moron. I have more than once died trying to get through an open door in a hurry but then again at this point I barely care if he lives or dies. Terror has been suspended by annoyance.One immersion breaking point is watching the characters move in the dark, sure footed and as if the room is brightly lit.It often becomes apparent that the other characters follow a rigid script that can be exploited, until you realise that it's not exploiting, this is simply the game. AI feels like it is almost non existent. The plot feels like it too obviously advances in a number of set scenes. You intuitively know when you are safe to run around because you know that you have just 'finished' the latest scene.This could have been the single most scary game ever released but it is unable to sustain fear due to there being so many immersion breaking points.All of the parts are there, quality graphics, quality sound, quality programming but it misses on bringing all this together. Not by far, but enough to make this game good, not great. Once again hype and fanboy aggression trumps fact and for some ruins the expectation.Having said this the game is very playable. Play it in a dark room, with decent sound then engage your imagination and it should give you some nice chills/scares.Finally it should be noted that having the camcorder light as your only real tool is not very original. It is a variation on a number of games, perhaps the most obvious being Alan Wake. Its inclusion produces a wry smile to those of us who have played video games on dozens of platforms, for decades. We just keep seeing the same music, films and games coming around in shiny new packages to suit the next generation. Sad really but a lesson we all learn as we transition into grumpy old ............7/10"

In the game outlast, you venture to a psychiatric hospital playng the part of a journalist, Miles Upshur. Upon arriving at the hospital, things start to go bad, very quickly. Freekish Zombies Or Patients will attack you in many levels of the game, many of which are jumpscares. You have no way of fighting back, so the only way to evade them is to do 3 things:1. Run. 2. Hide. 3. Or Die.That is pretty much it, in a nutshell. In this review or comment, I am not going to give too much away from the game itself, because this game is one really should experience for themselves. Anyways, there's my review guys.

(From Normal to insane)About the game.You are a journalist investigating a crazy psychaotic Mansion. You have to try to find secrets and clues to reveal, why everything is behaving so weird lately. You have a video camera with you, to record and have vision in the dark area. You have no weapons and you are only able to Run and hide from enemies. You have to find batteries from time to time to refill the camera's light vision. You will have to jump/squeeze through and doing other obstactles and puzzle to complete your path. It is not required to find every collectable, unless you are doing it for an achievement ofcourse. Collectables do tell you abit more information about the story. There are alot of puzzles to complete or you have to go to a certain location and activate this to activate that. and so go on. Do make sure you close the doors behind you, to slow down the enemies. However they might destroy the door instead.Great Dark atmosphere.Great soundtrack.Music/Sound changes whenever an enemy sees you or is nearby.Deep and maybe interesting Story.You can zoom in and out with your camera to see incoming enemies or area's.Your health Regenerate overtime.Enemies have sometimes Night vision eyes.Enemies walk and wander ALWAYS around your area.Has many (Different) collectables.Has nudity.Has Chapter Selection. (There are 8 Chapters).Has some Jumpscares but mainly the scariness is building up.Other things.Enemies are trying to find you if you are hiding. Stupidly enough they are not checking everything even if there is just a locker next to him. He will only check one thing and then he leaves the room even if the room is Dead-end.Make sure that you always hide if you have activated something. Enemies will always check out the ""activated"" item.Im always surprised that enemies can't hear the extreme breathing sound from the character.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10"

This review will contain no spoilers for neither plot nor story.-TRIAL AND ERROR SIMULATOR-CHASE AND RUN AWAY SIMULATOR-♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI AND HIDING SIMULATORIf you buy this game, prepare for sub-par gameplay. You have little  to no influence over whether you survive an enemy encounter or not - as aforementioned, in obnoxious CapsLock, when you encounter an enemy, all you can do is run away  - which is all well and good, right? ""Many games, especially of the Horror genre, do this"", you say.The short answer would be yes, but the problem is that there is often ONE PATH to slip away from an enemy, often involving opening doors and closing them again, and it's IMPOSSIBLE to tell whether the door is actually locked or not, meaning you'll die 19 times to one enemy because you just happened to ""make the wrong guess"" as to which way was the right one.In general, you have very little control over the main character's actions; oftentimes, when tense action is happening, it involves first-person cutscenes of the events, with you just sitting there watching. In essence, all you have control over in this game is:-Movement (limited due to the aforementioned)-Picking up certain items (involving batteries for your camcorder, files/journals and certain progress-vital items)That's it. Quite dull.""But Shape - why are you recommending this game then?""Because of three major points, which, in my opinion, easily compensates for the aforementioned flaws:1) The plot: Many Horror games, and especially movies for that matter, have an incredibly dull and boring plot, and only get small points for cheap jump scares and similar tropes. This game is not one of those. At all. While there certainly are jump scares, the plot of this story is easily one of the most interesting, fascinating and most well-fleshed out ones I've experienced in any Horror game, being up there with classic Silent Hill, classic Resident Evil and the first Amnesia (note that I'm not comparing this plot to those games, it is in no way similar, it just delivers the same amount of quality). It puts you in the setting, ranging from fairly peaceful-looking to fishy to ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on?"" to batshit insanity. And it does so in a very smooth way, with no try-hard scares and forced plotting like you occasionally see in other games of the genre.2) The design: This is mainly focused on characters - both their aesthetic appearance and their personality. You are presented with a wide array of interesting characters, all done in a way where you're never quite sure whom to trust and whom to oppose. You're going to be falling through the cracks attempting to figure out who is good and who is bad - in other words, the characters are what presents this great plot in its own way: a complete and utter moral greyzone.3) The atmosphere: The story unfolds in an old mental hospital, and you might think it's cliché, that you've seen this all before, that it is an overused setting. And you might be right - but assuredly, it has never been presented in the way Outlast manages to: grim darkness in every corner, the palette of clinical instruments and brushed steel paired with horrible gore and bloodstains, spiced with deranged freaks walking around everywhere, unpredictably, makes the raw experience of this game easily worth both your time and your money.Overall, I would certainly recommend this game - if you manage to read this review while there's a sale, there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE not to buy this game if you're a die-hard Horror fanatic like me, and you've got money in your pocket. And don't worry about my initial remarks about the gameplay: they're effortlessly overshadowed by the great story, you're in for."

,Recommended,238320,23135606,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,Dalek:.,"Outlast is a fantastic horror game, which had me on the edge with tension from pretty much start to finish. You're visiting this mental asylum (a very big one I should add) which is full of secrets and is sealed off from the outside world with no internet, and no phone signal. You're a journalist that has gone to investigate what it's all about.You have no weapons, and are only equipped with a video camera to gather evidence and use it as nightvision. Unfortunately however your camera seems to be one past its expiry date with batteries that leak faster than the BP oil spill, so you have to be careful as to when you want to see in the dark at various points in the game.That's all there is to it really, it's quite scary and definitely well worth playing if you want to have a challenge of getting through a horror game. In some ways the game reminds me of Penumbra, which is also another great survival horror game series I recommend. However, there are a whole lot less puzzles in comparison in this game."

I am 39, so I remember having to use the ole imagination on timecreepers like ""Haunted House"" for Atari 2600. For scary games, I think my golden moment was resident evil 2 where your character is seen from outside the house and a creature crawls across the window right before you encounter that first licker. That was scary way back then! I think it reached its zenith with Silent Hill 2, just absolutely perfect. Sublime. And scary.I never cared for the Amnesia series much, but this game Outlast scared me pretty bad. It was going along, boo here boo there, kinda creepy, nothing major. THEN I turned out the lights, turned up the sound, and wow I got the Krep scairt out of me 2 times. I say it again: 2 times, 2 different in-game situations. Not even 1 hour in.I think this game, though, like most non-combat scary titles, is best tasted in small sips, like 1 to 2 hours max, and yes, this game is fun and scary. It is also probably short, but again, with a non-combat scary game don't expect a long campaign, this isn't Doom 3 jump scares here, this is quality terrify-ication.My advice on games like this is: if you think you are a tough guy and if it makes you scream like a girl, or if you ARE a girl and it makes you bellow like a lumberjack, then hey, give it a rest, it did it's job.

I really hope this game was intentionally written as an absurdist comedy, because it's hilarious.Outhouse tells the story of Miles Upshur Without A Paddle, an investigative journalist who recieves an email from""10260110756@mutemail.com""and decides to still take the contents of said email as fact. The email literally contains the line ""Terrible things happening there. Don't understand it."" and instructs Miles to head to Mount Massive BS Asylum where he'll come face to face with the ""terrible things"" that lurk within. These 'terrible things"" include, but are not limited to: A crazy bald guy that thinks he's a priest, a pair of crazy bald twins that run around nude and make you envious of their massive dongs, a crazy bald guy whose size is an anatomic impossibility, a crazy bald guy wielding giant scissors, a crazy bald ghost, and Alan Turing's long lost geriatric homosexual bald Nazi lover. The developers allege that this is a survival horror game.Outlast was written and developed by people whom I would describe as competent idiots. Mechanically speaking, their game is well done. It suffers from no obvious technical errors, and while the environments are generic, they are still well designed. The gameplay isn't even remotely scary and I struggle to see how someone could be scared of this, but we don't really play these games for the sake of playing them; we play them for their story, and the story here makes no damn sense whatsoever.This is where the ""idiots"" part of ""competent idiots"" comes into play. The story is so unbelievably stupid that it blew my mind and kept me laughing for days. I'm honestly at a loss for words. It's incredibly original, I'll give it that, but only because it's so stupid there simply isn't a way it could've been done before, or ever again for that matter. I'm struggling to come up with a way to explain it. It's like the video game version of M. Night Shyamalan's the Village. It's best if you just experience it for yourself.In ConclusionOutlast is a mess you need to play. I'm most certainly not recommending this game for the right reasons, but that's okay, because a recommendation is still a recommendation."

Considering that the game is 2013, there is nothing negative to write about that. Controls good, graphics good, madness good. It took 6,5 hours to finish it. I will try insane mode...  So, keep the panic and buy Outlast."
,Recommended,238320,9011773,"Posted: 7 February, 2014",all,that's what she said,"The game of many logic faults and impressive yet outdated a bit visuals.May well worth your time, even be revelation. Or may not.My guess is that more casual horror-fans will enjoy it more. So if you like Amnesia or something that modern and don't know what the hell was Clock tower, Forbidden siren, and Silent Hill is just a s**ty movie for you - then you'll enjoy it. If you want something really scary and psychological (because monsters within us are a lot scarier) - pass, you'll get bored to death.Yeap, players don't lie - Outlast looks good, performs well and cam effects are pulled out right. Sounds are great. Yeap, seems like a good start. But it's not.Horror aspect maybe will scare 14yo girl, but it's actually nothing in comparison to any horror game from the past. It's just another 'run-like-♥♥♥♥♥' game without any believable logic in it. Sadly sometimes game has it's moments when you are like 'omg jesus' ('you like watching, don't you?'). But then it goes back to 'run from the guy' and finger-cutting-scene or something else uninspired. And it goes worse and worse till the very end when it gets borderline dumb.You can stand some serious beating, but you can't fight back. Because... it's gamedesigner desicion. Yeah, grown up guy that runs like hell from some lunatic and hides under the bed. Yeah, really?Your cam eats batteries for breakfast. And dinner. It drinks them like russians drink vodka. So you'll be pants down in the dark in no time. Maybe it was intended to encourage me to use night vision less, but it was bad decision in the first place.Actual gameplay is a mix between 'do what gamedesigner says' and stealth. Somewhat stealth, because there is no proper stealth. I must admit first encounter was tense, but it wears off in that same encounter. *turn Benny Hill theme, you'll get that kind of running*. And next time you'll be turning valves/pushing some buttons again.For some reason Asylum feels absolutely sterile cardboard cutout for game's mechanics. There is nothing to explore, there is no believable layout, there is nothing at all in it. It feels like it was made around the player to the point when you can actually imagine how director says 'cut' and character shake hands with some psycho and they go to get a drink. It is that sterile and synthetic. And definitely will not add to experience to anyone who are into story games (story is pretty predictable and poor written), who wants to study game's lore (there is none, don't look for it), who wants absolute immersion (there is nothing to immerse in - it's just body-horror hollywood-style rollercoaster ride). And that terrible secret mentioned on store page... is laughable. I mean it, scenario goes brain-dead at some point, don't dig into it.So in conclusion - don't take this game for more than it is and you'll be fine. People say it's a horror miracle. No, you'll be disappointed. It's a decent game, but there is nothing new and nothing really amazing. Just your weekend slasher movie. Bring some beer."

,Recommended,238320,31146125,Posted: 14 April,all,December Man,"*This is a review of both the base game and the DLC*Entertaining game, with an enjoyable camera gimmick, having to record to unlock the character's insight into the events he witnesses. The story was obviously created around the setting, not the other way around - first, they decided to place he game inside an insane asylum, then they built a story around it. It starts relatively down to Earth, only to introduce a supernatural element which is handwaived as not being paranormal in nature because a character said so - literally.It's atmospheric, but it's not scary in the least, especially when you discover the main character is essentially an Olympic level athlete and can run for an indefinite amount of time leaving the antagonists behind with little effort (not only that, at some pointhe loses his fingersand does not bother to stop the bleeding or get himself a bandage at any point in time - he's that ""badass""). The only thing that might startle you are the jumpscares which are the cheapest of the cheap. The first one you encounter was the cheapest jumpscare I have seen in years - it's the level of those old troll flash games with extremely loud sounds and ""scary"" images hidden inside of them. It's also repetitive and uses probably every horror game cliche ever.At its best the game is not disturbing and horrifying - it's disguisting and revolting (it tries so hard to shock you that I find it pretty amusing; it's the ultimate edgelord game: lots of blood and gore, cannibalism, necrophilia, masturbation, genital mutilation - all with the subtlety of USSR). It's the Hostel of video games and Red Barrels are Eli Roth. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but Eli Roth's movies are not revered as masterpieces of horror, but what they are: gore / exploitation flicks.I don't know if I should recommend it or not. If the developer's intentions were to shock their audience, they succeeded. If they attempted to create a genuinely scary experience which doesn't rely purely on jumpscares, they failed spectacularly. By the end of the day though, no matter what they tried to do, I was entertained (in a guilty pleasure, so-bad-it's-good sort of way) so thumbs up it is.<edit>I would like to add that I'm going to be disappointed if the sequel doesn't have something akin to baby eating - I mean at this point this is the only way this developer can one up themselves.</edit>"

I’ve played this game 4 times to get this review just right. This game had the tools to be the best horror game out there, but lacking when it comes to my options to survive. It only has two options run and hide (just like amnesia and other new games with this formula) In my opinion these two options do work for all horror games.How it doesn't work for horror games like Outlast is because of theme and the character you play as.Miles Upshur(Outlast)He is an Investigative reporter ""always willing to risk digging into  the stories no other journalist would dare Investigate."" by reading that this should tell you that this isn't miles first dangerous case he's been on. So having some kind of combat element would have hurt the game at all. It wouldn't of surprised me if Miles went into his glove compartment and got a teaser or gun. Also being that the taser would've added not only a way to defend yourself, also a fear element because you would have to make hard choice to  use the batteries for your taser to defend yourself or your camera to help you light your way through this game.When I was playing the main game on INSANE MODE I thinking it would’ve been more interesting If this the only reason you had the run and hide gameplay (because Insane mode turns off the way to defend yourself). There were only Two Antagonist I understand to run away and hide were Billy hope and Chris walker.So all n all  like i said at the beginning of this it had some potential to be the best but when it comes to the characters and lack of options to survive I really can't say its good just only neutraI do hope some modder finds a way to add way to defend yourself or something."

The start of the game is quite tense but after playing for about 2 hours I found the recipe very basic....try not to  be seen or if you are, either run or hide(there is usually a bed or cupboard somewhere near by).The scariness soon wore off. Not being able to fight back is fine by me...lets face it...in a real world scenario the majority of people would leggit when confronted by spooky looking insane killers.Not being able to throw an object to distract or confuse the fruitcakes is out of order.There isn´t an awful lot to do in this game in the form of problem solving, most of the time you have to wander onwards with a few minor hurdles  along the way.Thankfully I bought this while it was only 4,99...if I´d have paid more I would have been disappointed.I´m the kind of person who likes to explore a game to the fullest, in saying that...I managed to complete it after 10 hours.I didn´t even know that I´d come to the end of the game when suddenly the end credits were rolling...hmm.This game is alright but definately not as scary as it´s been hyped up to be.I don´t think I´d recommend this game because it hasn´t really achieved anything more than Doom did years ago.For 4,99 try it out...maybe I´ve played too many scary games to feel that this had something the others didn´t.Best summed up... Atmospher is good. Graphics are dated. Weak story. Nearly No dialogue. Hardly any interaction with surroundings."

Hide and Hide Some More DLCOutlast is indeed a visually appealing game with decent sound effects, lighting and design however it’s not enough to veil the many its many flaws.  As anyone knows horror, it’s a very hard medium to get right and this game didn’t go all the way for me in terms of what makes horror so fascinating.  Sure it contains violence, nudity and profanity like a typical horror movie, but what’s lacking is the originality, the risks in playing with taboos subjects, connecting with the protagonist(s) and see how far they’re willing to go make it to the end.  I’ve played this game four times (twice for the main game and twice for the DLC) to filly analyze the game, collect all the goodies and fully immerse myself into it to the point that I can even talk about it.  That being said, the game suffers from repetitious puzzles that utilizes little to no thought at all, the AI is extremely predictable and stupid to the point where once you understand how they’re program, they come less threatening, and wish I knew more about the characters I’m playing I can remotely care for them or even allow them to make choices that’ll change the outcome of the story.Overall, the game feels incomplete and truly wished they step it up in their upcoming game and take risks.  Even though I may have selected not recommend, I actually wanted to select both because people have to play this game to really know why I critique it the way I do because of its setting. Also while playing the game I felt like I was riding an intricate escalator with twists, turns, ascend, descend, go backwards and forwards, but ultimately it’s just one path I’m forced to ride on with a few stops on the way to the end or what others say a “walking simulator” with jump scares like some small time fair ride.  Anyways, the lists below are my thoughts on the game, so I hope they’re helpful and illuminate why I think this game is holding back.  Here they are:Both characters in the game aren’t interesting enough to empathize with (maybe Waylon because he’s married with two kids and that’s motivation enough to survive for him, but there’s virtually no introspective with him or Miles in regards to their situation or a dark side)Speaking of Miles, we really don’t know much about him other than his occupation and wants to get his hands on a juicy story, but that’s it.  It’s either reactions from his notes or hearing him breath heavy when hiding from malnourished psychos, Chris Walker and Rick Trager.  Billy is the only one the player can’t hide from.Speaking of the Camcorder, why couldn’t we use it as a puzzle element to allow to player to record stuff and then play it back for helping out for clues or anything?  The camcorder’s two functions are recording and night vision.  Can’t rewind or fast forward for whatever reason on it either.Using Asylums in horror genres been done to death and wished the game was more creative in its approach. I also wished that what we do in Mount Massive have an effect where the game changes depending the choices we made rather or not they were good or bad outcomes since horror loves the unexpected and the unknown.I’m fine with having no weapons or being combat focused, but wish I had the option to defend myself with the use of tools or use my surroundings to stun my foes, potentially kill them or have them trapped with clever puzzle solving elements and making player think outside of the box.All I can hope for is that the sequel to step up its game and take risks.In many ways, I’m glad the game exists and will give credit to credits is due for its visuals, sound effects and the character models.  That being said, why didn’t Miles’s finger suddenly stop bleeding after Rick cut two of them?  Wouldn’t it be a good objective to find bandages to not only stop the bleeding, but also to prevent Rick from finding Miles easier from the blood trail which make hiding not an option?While playing this game, I felt that there was some turf war going on and Miles was reluctant to be a part of Father Martin’s team by appointing Miles to be his “witness” and when to all that trouble to drug you and place Miles into his cell in the prison ward where he seems to have control over.  If that’s the case, then why are his “lambs” trying to kill him?  Chris I understand since he’s a free agent along with Billy, Rick is in charge of the medical ward, so that his turf, but wouldn’t make sense for Miles to interview these crazies since he’s on Martin’s team.  When you get to the administration again in the game, you’ll see what I’m talking about and wonder why were they’re trying to kill Miles in the first place.Again so much they can do with this game, but unfortunately from other critics of this game, it does feel like a walking horror simulator where what the player does has no real effect at all, see this jump scare and that jump scare and then do some filer to make the game longer.Regardless of my critique, try it out for the first time and then if anyone have the patience, play it again to see  why others are being so critical about the game."

The elements that come into play are in great balance. And the graphics - textures, models, colors, light, visual noise, the two camera views, ... - are all top notch. There were also all kinds of physical exercise: Walking, running, crouching, jumping, climbing ladders, climbing up ledges, squeezing through small openings, walking on small ledges with the back to the wall, hanging from ledges and moving sideways - and all the time, you can see your body, fully rendered, and the ""camera"" moves in a very natural way, feels a bit like the Dark Engine games (Thief Gold etc.). If they'd make an actual Thief game like this, it would be a really great product.I paid 6.45€ for Outlast don't regret it in the least. I've only played 2-3 hours yet and just arrived in the sewers, the experience so far has had great variety.I have read in another critique about flaws, and I agree: While the breathing-effect that expresses your panic is quite realistic (Imagine how you'd actually feel in those situations, hiding behind something while personified pain and death walk right in front of you, and you don't know what they'll do.), it's somewhat loud and, in combination with the very well done music effects (which I believe are synthetic instead from a real orchestra, but it took me over an hour to realize that), impedes on your acoustical awareness a bit, so it's sometimes hard to listen to footsteps and such. There should have been a key for holding your breath like in sniper games, that would have fit very well in this game. Also, the breathing indeed sometimes gives away if there's a dangerous guy nearby, even though I myself hadn't realized that yet, but that's only a very minor problem.Then there was the complaint about the formulaic game-play: Do some tasks, and while you're at it, a hazard will be around that you have to avoid. I now recognize this in the sewers, because so far it hadn't occurred enough for a pattern to emerge. I don't know if this will be a problem, but even if so: Then just play the game in bursts of at most 3 hours (which isn't exactly little - then again, the checkpoints are not too close by, and ""save & exit"" does NOT exactly what it says, so better play until you saw ""saving..."" in the left bottom corner), and you should be fine. It must also be said that this formulaic approach is only one layer of the gameplay, and the other layers are very well done. So, this complaint, too, is only minor. You really have to experience the game: It's so well done that any flaws you might find can only be considered to be nitpicking.There is no FOV (field of view) slider, but you can easily and lastingly adjust the FOV by editing a file. Make a duplicate ofC:\Users\[your user name]\Documents\My Games\Outlast\OLGame\Config\OLGame.iniand then edit the original. Search for ""fov"", you'll find ""DefaultFOV="" and ""RunningFOV="" (the latter being slightly higher than the former). I set mine to 120 and 130, which is not as high as it sounds, the game interprets them a bit differently from what we're used to. Save the file, done. Use any value you like. You could also change ""CamcorderNVMaxFOV="" and ""CamcorderMaxFOV="", but I didn't. I found the claustrophobic too-narrow default FOV of the video camera to be ok, even though I am an absolute FOV-Nazi. There are other tweaks you might want to try, but I ignored them so far. I got all my tips here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/238320/discussions/0/846963710902292389/So. All in all: A great game in the category and quality (maybe even higher) of ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent""."

Play it even if you are scared of the dark, because once you have seen what is in Outlast, you will never be afraid again, as nothing that horrorful can exist in real life.Outlast is the master of horror games. I finished it and it lingers in my head still, both the story and the characters. You know that you have played a good h o r r o r game when you think to yourself that you wil never play this again. Because it is that horrifying.Game should be played in complete darkness and with proper headphones, or at least a good surround system.The game masters mostly everything. It is very cleverly built. The usage of light and complete dark is used to an extreme advantage here, and done so very well. There are lots of surprising elements. Your character doesn't have any weapons and can do only two things: run or hide, often a combination of both. But still, when escaping an area successfully you get this great feeling of mastering something: you survived.The scares in this game are endless. What I loved the most was that some of them were pretty silly, the game obviously mocking and laughing at you for scaring you. That said, the game is mostly very serious and deals with the theme of insane asylum in a proper ""not safe for life"" way, but it doesn't take itself too seriously through certain funny moments.Monster and scare-wise Outlast is like a hyperactive Amnesia. What I loved about it is that certain enemies are the same characters that keep following you through the whole game, trying to catch you. This adds alot to the immersion, which otherwise is top notch.My only tiny minus side was that a few areas were too dark, even with light turned on in-game.

If you like horror games then this is definatly worth your attention and time.Whistleblower DLC is also a worthy addition and completes the story out from a different persons perspective and couples with the first part well, good adult horror and one for lights out and headphones on!Now with outlast 2 coming soon a great chance to grab a super deal on a top game and get a look at what its all about!"

It's not because I'm scared or anything but because most horror games are boring. However, this game isn't like the other games in the same genre. Unlike most Slenderman games, which involve collecting lost pages and lots of running from Slenderman, playing Outlast doesn't seem pointless. The game's story and lore are really interesting. It's not that scary anymore after you've spent more than three or four hours in the game, although it's still fun and it still gives that weird creepy feeling."

Honestly, I can see why, it's a very well done psychological horror game. However, story wise, it's very confusing in some parts. Most plot issues get resolved but some don't especially at the end. One of the things that bugs me about the game is the relentlessness. There's very few moments of peace of quiet where psychological horrors are supposed to shine. I believe that if they had spaced chases out more than the expereince would be a whole lot more terrifying and suspenseful. Quick to note (Spoiler Kinda):The Twins are two of the best villians in a horror game and it's a shame they didn't get more time in the game to really make them flesh out."

Unfortunately my computer is laggy and the graphics aren't as great as they would be due to that. I repeatedly run into things, can't move due to lag, and end up dying.But anyhow, it's a great horror game, although I scare easily. The music's really nicely done. It creates anticipation, atmosphere and anxiety. While there are the cliché jump scares, setting, and artwork for rooms, it's still a very chilling game. Gore, blood everywhere, fire, darkness, chase scenes, corpses everywhere are all cliché scares and we all know it. But the fact that you don't exactly know where to go and do makes it scary. It's unpredictable and twists and turns are everywhere throughout the game. (Quite literally.) When you have to use the night vision on your camera, it's super creepy. You don't know when the darkness will go away and you don't want to use up batteries. You don't know when the next battery will show up.Although the repetitive tasks are a bit annoying. (Pull levers, drain water, etc.) And at those points the game isn't really even scary and the enemies just become immensely annoying. And when you're not playing on insane difficulty, you would prefer to die and start over at the checkpoint rather than continue from your current place.But so far, this game is really interesting and keeps on making me want to play.

The only reason i didnt give it a 9 or 10 was because i felt sometimes the game developers were running out of ideas on how to scare the player so they added chase scene after chase scene.

Nowadays, games whether it be a horror game or an action game, no longer give you an adrenaline rush. After buying it, I was pleased to say it gave me that rush. However, it was very scary. I asked for a refund for the game just because of how frustrating it got for me at times. But, I am going to re purchase it now as I have not yet found a better game out there."

Amnesia only tops this game because of length and the noncoherent story. But overall, if you're looking to get scared, this game is crazy scary. The soundtrack is great and the ambiance is masterfully executed. The graphics are quite good for an indie game, and the scares are always unexpected. And it's not all about the scares, it's also about the constant feeling of dread waiting for the next scare. This is something that this game does perfectly: it thrusts you towards what's scary rather than having you run from it, and you're not alone in this asylum, you're surrounded by inmates that at any moment could kill you. Every second of this game leaves you on the edge of your seat hoping that something won't jump at you (which, inevitably, it will). So buy this game if it goes for 10 or less, and you're in for a real treat. 8/10"

It pulls no punches by throwing you right into the action before you can even tell your nightvisions from your zooms. The fact I had multiple instances of being put on edge by the sounds of the protagonist moving around is enough to say that the dark corridors of the Mount Massive Aslyum really got to me.However there were a handful of jump scares that soured otherwise tense areas of the game. One or two is fine but the fifth one on had me merely frowning after the initial fright wore off.

,Recommended,238320,16571847,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,ElevenMink3,"This is a must have for horror fans and has an excellent scares and chase scenes. The story is okay, and is pretty straight-forward. The game gets a little repetitive with the predators, because the only thing you can do is hide, and if your presence is already known, you can only run into a room, close the door behind you, and THEN hide. But don't get me wrong: I DO really love this game and the bad guys make me scream every time!The main storyline is that you are Miles Upshur, an  investigative-reporter who plans to sneak/trespass inside Mount Massive Asylum with his trusty camcorder to film some illegal goings-on that was brought to his attention by an anonymous email sent by someone working within the prison. Then you notice blood and such on the walls, the big menacing gates close behind you, and then you realize that the murderous and deranged inmates escaped, and you feel a strange need to escape!The game really puts the ""jump"" in ""jumpscare"", but it only has, like, TWO or THREE in the whole game, and it gets you when you forget about the last one. It isn't known for jumpscares is the thing, but the game is startling throughout the entire experience.The intense gore and vulgarness is what makes the game unsettling, as you come acrossblood and intestines splattered all over walls, watch in terror as many people are slaughtered, get two of your fingers cut off by an insaniac with huge scissors, and I've even seen somebody ♥♥♥♥ a dead body.Yes, quite disturbing.As for the Whistleblower DLC (DownLoadable Content) it is just probably just 1 hour short of gametime as the original, and is much more disturbing/discusting,as you come across two more sensative topics: cannibalsm and polagamy. Yes, you do come across a person eating another fellow person, who even stuffed the other guy's head in an open microwave and promptly digs into him and eats his stomach. Then there is a deranged guy who gives surgery on men and... let's just say... he does his best to give sex changes. He tries to turn men into women so that he can raise a family with them. It is very inhumane and sick stuff.It's pretty traumatizing... I may never sleep again...The main storyline of Whistleblower is that YOU are the guy who sent the email in Outlast to Miles to tell him about the illegal stuff that's happening in the asylm and then your boss realizes you are a traitor, so he deals with you in a manner that would spoil too much of the story. Actually I'm just too lazy to explain it and put spoiler text over it.Since Whistleblower is just Outlast from a different perspective, there isn't mush else I can say about it. They are both good games, but pleeeeeease don't play if you are 11. I've made that mistake.so 9/10 wud pervertedly watch corpse get f*cked agin"

It does something right that other games does not.The atmosphere, the ambiance, the music, everything is to scare you. If all of that still is not enough though, the numerous jumpscares will finish the job. Also, unlike other horror games out there, Outlast does not entirely rely on jumpscares to scare you which is a big thumbs up.All in all, Outlast is my personal favorite when it comes the horror genre and I believe that after playing it, it will become yours as well."

,Recommended,238320,11467731,"Posted: 29 July, 2014",all,Melon,"Personal Rating: ""Worth playing""Traditional Rating: 10/10Genre: Survival HorrorI originally bought Outlast from the Steam Summer Sale 2014 for £4 and it was the best purchase of the year! This game brings hype in every part of the game and the jumpscares are really well planned.  Then comes the story.The games takes place in a Blood Thursty Asylum, you take control of Miles Upsher, a Journalist trying to get a story worth printing. But is it easier than he thought?As for the comparison of Amnesia, it has the same game mechanics apart from the fact that you can vault over objects inbetween running from the most fearful characters of gaming. You will find that you will be running to save you're life and continue the story!On a scariness level -Outlast suceeds as for being a good comparison to Amnesia. The lighting in different parts of the game gives you a more horror feeling and a more realistic thought as you continue. The sound affects with the creepy music that plays when getting chased is a good example to watch where you are going.If I had to make one complaint about the game then that would be the length. For a horror game it is very shortened down and as for the scary experience that you have throughtout the game, it only lasts for a few hours on a normal based difficulty. Thats where the DLC comes in to action. The Whistleblower DLC adds a new character and longer storyline to play when you have completed the original!The DLC - called Whistleblower - The Whistleblower DLC is a great add-on for the game. It adds a nice, new and longer story for people that want to carry on playing Outlast and have already completed the Original game. On Whistleblower you play the character ""Waylon Park"". This game is a sequal to the Original but Whistleblower storyline stretches out from the Original in the ending.As it stands - Outlast is my favourite all-time horror game for me, it has all the scary features in it for me. Jumpscares are perfect along with the Sound effects. Hope they make more awesome horror games like this"

THEY ARE AMAZINGMiles upshur: our valiiant reaporter, a bit of a mostly silent-protagnist, but his charecter is reveld from notes he writes down after cam-cording specifc in-game eventsChris Walker: Big,Fat,ugly, ex-milltary police who wants to rip off you ""little pig"" head, Main antagonistFather Martain: one of the few people who dosent try to kill you, he is a preist who, actually wants to help you, memorble dialouge but his end... 1up's jesus christ in ""stupid ways to die""Richard Trager: tired of licking your own stamps? wanna sell a finger of two? wanna hang out with your buddy for the old two martini lunch? well thats the crazy doctor in a nutshell. id argu he is the most meomerble charecter between his dialouge and grusome end getting jill sandviched in an elevatorThe Walrider: main source of all this madness, although a ghost or spirt, his life is held together by a patient named Billy HopeNow for the bad things....1. If youve seen the scripted jumpscares, they are only scary the first time, every other time beyond that is...meh2. although scary if you dont expect it, the varriants who chase you, get progressivly less scary the more you get chased3.this game is semi-short, i beat it in 6-9 hours, but you can always go back to play on a higher diffculty or try the 1-life run4. Although Rare for me, the AI can glitch up where you can walk by right infront of them and they dont seem to care, but it usally fixes itslef in a few secondsoverall, this is a great game that should be purchased by horror fans or anyone jooking for a good scarei do recomend buying whislteblower for the full story and meet even more crazys :DOUTLAST: 8.5/10"

76561198087507270,Recommended,238320,11165702,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,Suspect,"Today I am reviewing an Indie-horror game called Outlast.In this game, you play a man named Miles Upshur, a freelance journalist who has the balls to get into any situation. An anonymous tip sends him to a mental hospital which is named Mount Massive Asylum (I know, it's a stupid name for an insane asylum). This specific asylum is owned by a company which is known for it's corrupt dealings. And has been rumored to be doing secret experiments inside the asylum itself. Upshur finds this rather interesting and decides to go to this hospital and prove whether said experiments do take place. Or not. When things quickly descend into darkness, Miles becomes more eager to get out of the building, with his sanity intact.When I first bought this game, I was excited to play it. I'd finally bought a game which only gave you limited supplies, complex puzzles and things to be afraid of. I bought it, it ran faster than  I would've expected first off. I honestly believed it would be rather slow, perhaps it's because I play it in a windowed mode, maybe not.As soon as the first chase began, I was excited, I loved the thrill of knowing that the one thing your were fighting was always behind you. And you had to do whatever you could to hide whatever was chasing you. The puzzles were fairly frustrating, I had some trouble with certain bits. There was always something stopping you and you never got all the hints at first which gave the player more to discover.The atmosphere showed clearly how such a game like this should be portrayed. And it shows it realistically. For these events could actually take place in the modern day world. It had graphic scenes which not many horror games actually let you view for instance Amnesia or Slender. The fact that it's at night time (which most horror games are) makes it even more gloomy than what it should be perhaps. The dismembered bodies and the disturbing faces makes the horror game a much more memorable experience, whether you like it or not.Now for the cons: A few things bothered me about this game. Only a few, trust me, there are more pro's than there are cons.I found it rather annoying how the batteries used to charge the camera ran out in a couple minutes or so, only when you're using night vision, thank god. And they had only ever shown up where convienent, not in some random place, only where you'd most need it if you're lucky.And I found it kind of stupid that when you're in a place, hiding from the current antagonists, when they see you, they go in the same route every time, they never mixed it up a little. And I noticed that if you were hiding under a bed in a room which had numerous amount, the game tries to make you heart pump by having them go to the bed beside, in front or behind you. And I found it annoying how they'd always go to the same places when looking for you, it all seemed rather robotical.Finally, this is only my opinion by the way, it isn't the same for a number of people. In my opinion IT WASN'T SCARY! I know what you're thinking now, ""what?! how could he not find it scary? it was scary as ♥♥♥♥!"" Well my opinion is, it's not scary buddy. I have played the entire game and this is a game which is supposed to be filled with jumpscares, I only jumped ONCE. ONCE. I was kind of amazed myself. It wasn't a game which kept me awake at night thinking about it. It was a game I found exciting to play when I was being searched for or chased after. I bought the game expecting myself to♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. Well, that didn't happen. At all. But I didn't like it for the frights, I liked it for the thrill.So here are my pros:1. Thrilling game.2. Gives complex puzzles which you actually have to use your brain to figure out.3. Gives a unique atmosphere which makes the game independent from other games.4. Has a realistic feel which can make you think if this is possible.5. Lets players with lower graphic laptops or PC's join in (if you dare).6. Provides challenges which gives you the rush that every horror game needs.And here are my cons:1. Supplies are used to fast.2. Items and information only shows up where convienient.3. Enemies don't stretch their minds when looking for the player.4. Tries to make you afraid they'll find you, but doesn't exactly succeed.5. Not scary enough to fill my lust for horror.I recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a fun ride in the horror genre and can handle seeing disturbing images, I would say it's for the people 16 and up. But if you got the guts then 12 and up.So, in the end. My rating out of 10 for this game will be 7.9.Outlast, you give a thrill, not a chill.SusOnMe, signing off.  Game on Gamers."

Its much like amnesia in that respect and thats a good thing!over all a great game and well worth buying. a solid 9/10.

There are a little too many jumpscares, but they keep you on your toes and create a feeling a dread as you wonder what's around every corner. A+ graphics, great controls, good story(it kinda winds down during the end), not being able to fight back and the hiding from monsters will give you goosebumps. Nightvision also causes the monsters pupils to glow a eerie white,  a feature that I really liked. And for only 20$ with like 7-8 hours of gameplay this is a steal, a must play for any horror fan.8.5/10,  great beginning and scares, but really dies down during the end with the scares becoming predictable."

I normally can't stand the Unreal Engine, but Red Barrels made it work, part of it comes down to the filmgrain, and the fact that you are using your cameras nightvision mode a lot of the time. Which really adds to the gritty look and feel.I really dug the story too, a decent horror story with good excecution, i especially enjoyed the ending.The game is probably around 2-4 hours long depending on how much you fail, or how slow you take it. But its the perfect length any longer and it would have been too much. Like you wouldn't sit and watch the same horror movie for 4 hours."

I'd give it more credit if enemies didn't know where I was every single time and only hover/patrol in that small area.Still, it was pretty scary, almost too much. It forced me to pull myself out of the game experience and view it as a video game in order to tolerate its jump scares. I'd much prefer it if it offered something new as you progressed.Often times I found myself looping around while being chased in an almost comedic fasion, hoping I'd spot the right ""exit"" from that ""zone"" on my next run around.All in all, its a fun game, but too transparent on how video-gamey it is.

I've played horror games since the original Resident Evil and honestly, most horror games in the present don't impress me much (Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs), but this game ""Outlast"" has changed my outlook entirely for the survival horror genre. The game from start lets you in control of everything that can happen to you. The game doesn't let you catch a break ""ever"". You are constantly on edge of your seat in alertness wondering what is around the corner.              The coolest part about this game is how the story is unfolded. The beggining gives you a summary as to ""why"" you are there. That is all. The rest of the story is up to you, to record, discover, and explore the asylum in order to actually ""know"" what is going on. They give very good use of the camera recorder and make it your most valuable tool. I won't explain the horror of the game, you just need to buy this for yourself. It is in my opinion the best horror game I have played since the original amnesia launch, which outlast makes Amnesia look like Kittyland. I give this game a 10/10. Perfect score. PS: The immersion is flawless, if you are into roleplay, this game will suit your needs perfectly! Enjoy this game in the dark! Good luck."

While other similar games such as Amnesia are psychologicaly disturbing to the player, Outlast has the immediate effect of scaring your wits out, as your only option is to run away from the pshyco freaks that are trying to murder you and slice you with various weapons.Outlast is one of the most popular games for a reason, as its unique horror scenario in a horror psychiatric hospital (a horror fanatic's wet dream) is perfectly well crafted, and leads to a riveting story. While the story is very linear and does not let you explore the hospital at your own will, the charm of the story and its various characters make the entire experience worthwhile. Some of the characters throughout both the original game and the DLC will make you remember their names in awe, as you remember their intense moments of horror and shock all well as some of their most popular lines of dialogue.Outlast and the WhistleBlower DLC is one of the greatest combination of any video game to date, and I would like to congratulate Red Barrels on their wonderfull work."

Just think for a second: Do you want a horror game that will scare you like Amnesia did, but a hell of a lot better? If you answered yes, you should get this game.But lemme praise 3 things about it before I do the cons. First, the first person view is actually first person view. You see your hands, shadow, etc. There's even proper head bobbing. Normally first person games tend to render the hands with no lower half. This game really makes you feel like you're a person. Second thing: The camera works fine, but only loses battery power when you use the night vision. Batteries means you can't keep nightvision on 100% of the time and it puts pressure on you. Third is roaming enemies. In Amnesia, the monsters would give up and vanish. In Outlast, they keep looking for you, which makes getting from room A to room B a lot harder, knowing that they are STILL out there.As for complains, I wish the game was a little longer. Also, the  two ""naked brothers"" should have been in the game more. Yeah, I'll let that image sink in.This game goes out of its way to scare you and it doesrather well. I wonder how Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs will fair after playing Outlast."

The title plays on all the best horror tropes in a fresh and exciting manner, with a story that keeps you searching for hidden documents and notes in an attempt to unveil what exactly is happening.I recommend both the original game and the Whisteblower expansion to capture the full experience. My only critique of the title is the running and hiding gets a bit repetitive after finishing the original game and playing the expansion, but the unique take on the similar environments navigated before definitely make it worth completing everything."

This is by far the best and scariest horror game that I played in a very long long time.  It is technically very well made. Fantastic graphics and sounds, stable frame rates, found no bugs, responsive controls. The gameplay can best be compared to Amnesia, but in my opinion Outlast is doing everything better, in all aspects. This feeling of doom and helplessness is just fantstic. You never know what awaits you behind the next corner and horror and insanity are ever present. And yet Outlast is surprisingly fair at all times. I've never come across any frustrating moments where frustration kills horror. So yet I've died a few times but that's been my fault as there have always been realistic chances for me to escape or hide. Only the story is a bit thin and weak, especially the ending, which is why I definitely recommend playing the DLC ""Whistleblower"" as well. There, a lot of questions are being answered, and it provides a satisfying ending as well. It took me almost 13 hours to finish main game and DLC. It's probably possible to rush through the game much faster, but those 13 hours felt perfect for me - not one minute too long, not one minute too short. It's an intense game, a brilliant game, and definitely worth each cent!"

If you can catch this game at a SERIOUS discount ( less than $5 ), then it's a decent deal.  Otherwise, do not pay full price for this game.  I'm not giving any spoilers, but this game is SHORT.  I think I got through it in about 5 hours, with some AFK time padded in there, and there is no replay value whatsoever, unless you feel like being a completionist.  Or unless they come out with a sequel and you're looking to refresh your memory on the story.The game does have its good points.  If you're into a strange story, eerie feels, and lots of darkness, then this game is for you.  Graphics and sound are surprisingly good, and there were definitely a few points in the game where I jumped.  It's a first-person perspective and done mostly in the tradition of movies such as the Blair Witch Project, or Paranormal Activity.  The rest of the goodies I'll leave up to you to discover.Conclusively, again this is a very short game, but if they come out with a decent sequel to follow this game up, it might be worth it to pick this up on a decent Steam sale.(Disclaimer:  I don't hold any arguments about dollar per hour of entertainment as valid.  A short game is not worth as much to me as a longer game in 99% of cases.  Your opinion may differ.  GL&HF)"

I doubt they'd even feel the pain of it if you stabbed them. (My way of justifying the ""survival"" part of this horror game)Your only advantage is your nightvision camera which allows you to see in the dark and also makes the game a lot more photorealistic with it's special effects.To be honest i'm surprised how good this game was, it seems like half the budget was spent on the soundtrack/audio and the other half on the graphics. It's like the rest of the (quality) content was available for free!One of the two bad things i can say about it is that while the story was good, i didn't feel particularly ""connected"" to it like i did in Amnesia. I couldn't relate too well with the protagonist although i could sympathize with him, and while the game was disturbing, it was more disturbing graphic-wise than story-wise (blood and guts all over).The other bad thing is that the game flaunts a sexual content warnings at you in a very serious fashion, and the only sexual content in the game are two naked guys that still just so happen to have a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attached to their bodies.

It's terrifying having naked maniacs chase you down while whispering nonsense about you! They're talking about me and they're hunting me! Yep I was sure I was gonna♥♥♥♥♥♥myself while panicking and letting out squeaks of fear. The music and darkness are great for an anxious atmosphere. It invokes the 'I need to hide now' horror. I also have a little soft spot for Colorado. Worth it and would panic again! I plan on picking up DLC and 2.

The game plays similar to amnesia or alien isolation which is never a bad thing in my book and it does this type of game very well.  The graphics are topnotch and so was the atmosphere.  The creepy asylum dwellers are enough to make your butt cheeks pucker as you've run for your life and each of the main bosses (or stalkers or crazy perverts if you prefer) all have some unique way they want to kill you or cut off your genitalia.  And nothing scarier than someone trying to cut your junk off, just ask john Bobbitt.  It all takes place in an asylum but it never got boring to me.  As far as performance, at least for me, this game runs awesome and the frame rate never dips.  I can't find any complaints about the game and I look forward to the sequel.  This is now become one of my favorite games in my collection and I would recommend it to anybody...  As long as you like horror games...  And aren't overly sensitive...  And don't mind creepy naked men chasing you with knives...well, maybe I wouldn't recommend it to EVERYBODY."

,Recommended,238320,22435979,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Zladnyl,"Simply amazing game, great story but it is yet to be finished in the second one coming soon! This game will scare you to near death many times before you finish it. I just hope the second one lasts a little longer than the first. I have finished it about 7 times and i have only had it 2 months now. The next game just needs to be longer but as far as story, graphics, gameplay and all that its amazing! Perfect in every way and worth the money for such a great horror game. The DLC has mature content in it other than blood and thats my only problem. I love a scary game and the base game is the best i have ever seen. The only downside is that in the second game it won't be in an asylum or any facility, i liked the limited area of the original game with being in small rooms and halls. It made most of the scares for me sometimes when something is right around the corner but in the second game your outside in an open and less limited area. Another thing is that this game stayed realistic but the second game looks to be more supernatural and less unique compared to the first. And of course we will all miss Rick Trager and Chris Walker. But as far as this first game goes it beats all other horror games into the ground and I don't think it will ever be beaten as far as how good it is, even by the second one."
