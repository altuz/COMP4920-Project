But I was glad I did this with someone as I could see it becoming tedious playing solo story mode. The humor was great though. A very well-constructed and entertaining game to share with others. :)Rating: 9/10If you like co-op and love platformers, you must save Hatty!"

That's usually when you want shut your brain off and play something amusing and stupid.  If you can find a buddy in a similar state, play this game together.The trick to enjoying this game is to not take it seriously.  Learn to enjoy killing and being killed.  If you can pull that off, you will laugh until you cry.  Play for about an hour or so and then quit.  Come back another day when you both are out of it again.  Then just repeat this cycle.If you don't enjoy poop jokes, stay away.  If blowing youself up again and again makes you smile, this is the game for you."

The gameplay is exhilarating as you run through these obstacle courses set up by devious cats. The thing that makes this game the most fun is playing on hard mode where the most will come out of you as a player and even though it can be annoying or tough, it's what makes the BattleBlock Theater experience better. Also, I would like to add, even though I have little time played on steam, I have owned this game on the Xbox 360 for years, and I could still come back to it and play it again."

During the game he will pretty much tell you what is going on and what you shouldn't do: Dieing mostly.In cutscenes he will progress the story and tell you all kinds of things in a fun fashion.The gameplay is nothing that spectaculair but still really good. It's a puzzle platformer as much as it can be a platformer. In 2D, you will run, jump, ride and slide across blocks of various elements, collecting gems to open the exit. The difficulty progression is steady and with the amount of levels, the final ones will/can be really frustrating but certainly do-able.The music is happy and upbeat as the game itself and with the great visual style, jokes and voice-acting, I believe this is certainly a game looking into.Additionally, it has multiplayer, so you can even go nuts with your friends in existing or self-made levels!"
,Recommended,238460,11013010,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,Elfee,"The Behemoth’s 2D platformer BattleBlock Theater is full of quirky humor (like in Castle Crashers which is also a Behemoth game).This game is not only for platformer-lovers. It's for all who like great entertainment, for gamers who love to play alone, for those who love to play coop, for the creative people and level builders, for the achievement hunters, the item collectors and people who want to own others!Humor:I really enjoyed the opening monologue and all the other little movies between some levels. You will also hear funny comments when you are playing. How to describe the jokes? I would say it’s a mix out of poop jokes with pop-culture references. About some jokes you will laugh and about other jokes you will raise your eyebrow. In harder levels when you are frustrated because you die so often the speaker also makes some taunting statements which motivate you or make you wanna find him and kill him. :o10/10Sound:Narrator: The narrator talks clearly and with a great accent. I’ve understood everything and my english isn’t the best. So he did his job very well! ^^Music: The songs are always convenient and make a funny, peaceful atmosphere.Settings: You can change the volume PLUS how much you want to hear from the talker.10/10Graphic:The game has an amazing quality of animation. Even too the characters have a simple design it’s still cute and clearly what they represent. It animates you to collect more characters in a curious, partial addicted way. And there are so many character styles to collect that everyone will fall in love with one! If you don’t get your favorite with your green diamonds you can also swap with other players.10/10Gameplay:You have so many possibilities and different game modes that you don’t know with what you should start. lol Seriously if you really want to do everything in the game with a perfect result you can spend aplenty of your time there. For example there is a storymode (playable on normal and insane difficulty) for singleplayer and a bit different one for coop where you have to throw your partner to some places or to pull him up. Sometimes you just have to jump on his head to reach a gem and sometimes you have to shoot him somewhere… which is really funny especially when your mate dies cause of an accident (stupidly). xDYou can play features and levels made by other players. PLUS you also can create OWN LEVELS… There are no limits!Besides you can play with 2-4 players in the arena (choose a fast game or a special game mode). Some modes you can play versus other players: Capture the Horse (it’s like capture the flag in other games e. g. “Booster Trooper”), basketball, teamdeathmatch, soulcatcher and so on!In all game modes you can get ‘Gems’ and ‘Yarn balls’. With Gems you can buy faces, with yarn balls weapons. The weapons all make different stuff (e. g. freezing someone into an ice-cube) and different damage or they just blow the enemy away. There are also different ways to make combos with. So you can evolve your own tactic.For so many possibilities and no lags in multiplayer I give:10/10Tradesystem:You can see all your items (faces, weapons, gems, yarn balls…) in your INVENTORY in Steam. So you can make your trade in-game or with the steam trading system. Means even when you are out of the game you can send someone a trade offer about which items you want to swap. You can also sell some of the items (those which are marketable) or buy some of them. So also those who have no luck with the drops in the game can reach on every way what they want.That’s just awesome!10/10Conclusion:I am totally in love with this game and I highly recommend it! ♥"

,Recommended,238460,11236008,"Posted: 14 July, 2014",all,Canti,"BattleBlock Theater is an updated port of the XBLA version released on Xbox 360 in early 2013. The ""Steam version"" (as it likes to call itself) adds a wealth of Steamworks features, possibly the most of any game released so far, as well as a few gameplay and visual tweaks. These Steamworks features include Workshop for creating, sharing and downloading user-created levels, Inventory support for item trading, online multiplayer and SteamOS support just to name a few.The game comes from The Behemoth, who you may remember as being credited with Alien Hominid (as far as I am aware, the first example of a Newgrounds Flash game making a leap to a commercial gaming console) and more recently with Castle Crashers. Two well-received games under their belt and you’ll be happy to know that you can count BattleBlock Theater as their third.You control a miniature Pillsbury Doughboy lookalike, who along with his friends have crashed their “Friend-Ship” onto a mysterious island. Taken prisoner by a legion of insane cats inside a derelict theatre, you are made to run the various obstacle courses (formed of various blocks) and collect gems as you go, purely for their amusement.During the story mode, your goal is to run through 2D platforming stages, collecting any gems and balls of yarn you see as you go. Not only do these collectables contribute to your overall ranking and score for a stage, you can also spend them in the theatre gift shop. Spending gems will free your captive friends (and allow you to play as them) and the yarn, which is usually the trickiest item to find, can be spent on new weapons. Fitting with the crazy theme the game has going for it, weapons range from guns that fire top-hats, to marching frog dancers that explode. Both weapons and unlocked characters can be traded either in-game or through Steam’s own trading system.Your character comes equipped with the standard platforming skills. They can perform double-jumps, duck and slide to avoid unpleasant things happening to their head and a basic set of melee attacks for the odd occasion where a villainous feline blocks your path.As you progress, the stages become increasingly difficult and complex. The blocks you run and jump over may help you get from start to finish, but not all of them are helpful. Block with spikes, blocks of water (you can’t swim!) and even blocks that fire lazer beams will become more and more numerous as you advance through the 8 chapters the game offers, with 13 stages in each.The puzzles also increase in their level of dastardliness, requiring some extra precise jumps, timings for triggering certain switches that can open new paths or create bridges and some time-trial stages where time is certainly not on your side.The story is narrated by the absolutely wonderful voice of Will Stamper who manages to synergise his unique energy with the quirky and slightly demented theme the game has on display perfectly. Add to this that the majority of the spoken dialogue is exceptionally funny, it works wonders to break up the monotony of what would otherwise be a rather mundane platformer.The graphics are vivid and colourful, the animations fluid and adorable, capturing The Behemoth’s trademark style that is in itself a thumbs-up to the Flash games of yesteryear. Despite the trailer claiming near infinite FPS and resolution support (made in satire of the “PC master race” mostly), the game is locked to 60FPS and does not scale to non-standard resolutions such as ultra-widescreen displays… I am also guessing you shouldn’t take the “Oculus Rift support” seriously either.The audio mixes bouncy sound effects with a great soundtrack, with Will Stamper lending his vocals to a couple of the song “lyrics” for added hilarity. These are usually limited to the ends of chapters and bonus stages, so as not to overdo it.The campaign alone is rather lengthy, but being able to replay stages to get a better ranking, find missing treasures and unlock more goodies really adds to the replayability. To top it all off, there are plenty of great user-created levels to download and a comprehensive level editing suite included, as well as a special event list of downloadable levels released every Friday with a unique unlockable friend as a reward. There are also a heap of multiplayer modes, both competitive and co-op for up to 4 players. These range from classic “king of the hill” and “capture the flag” modes, to races and even basketball. Some fiddling with your firewall may be required to get the multiplayer working, though.BattleBlock Theater delivers a fantastic package of content that is both highly polished, well-paced and with enough variety to keep you coming back even when the main game is done and dusted. With its delightful audio/visual aesthetic and solid controls on both gamepad and keyboard, this is a platformer that anyone can enjoy.Pros:~Great presentation and consistently funny~Amazing value for the price~Well-balanced difficulty, suitable for all skill levels~Incredible number of Steam features supported~Developers still actively supporting the gameCons:~Multiplayer connectivity can be fiddly on certain routers and firewalls~Can’t rebind controller buttons (can rebind keyboard keys, though)"

,Recommended,238460,13337149,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,ownosourus,"It took years for developer The Behemoth to put the finishing touches on its latest platforming masterpiece, and it’s easy to see why. While it would have been easy to simply rig up a basic menu and some customisation options to string all the levels together, The Behemoth has carefully crafted an outrageously humorous and addicting experience that will keep us entertained its next project is unleashed on the world.It’s not only surprising that BattleBlock Theater has a story that is more than an intro cutscene, but it’s surprising just how funny it manages to be at the same time. It's juvenile, but it's funny.The game's story follows Hatty Hattington who is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with hundreds of his close friends. Hatty is then taken captive by the island’s feline natives, and brainwashed to become their leader as his friends are forced to participate in deadly theater performances.This rather bizarre setup paves way for the hundreds of levels, which make up the majority of the game. Each level plays out on a theater stage, with catlike silhouettes creeping in the foreground, standing in for a ‘virtual’ audience.It’s ironic given how creative the setup is that the actual gameplay is simple, but what BattleBlock Theater might lack in novel mechanics and flashy gameplay is made up for with tight controls and excellent level design. Every level is laid out on what is essentially a grid, with various block types making up the floors and walls you maneuver your little avatar on.However, levels aren’t as simple as racing towards a finish line or taking out a certain number of enemies.Weapons, along with a standard repertoire of punches and kicks, can be used to defeat enemies, but to be honest, the fighting system never felt as tight as the platforming did.BattleBlock Theater wouldn’t feel right if you weren’t able to tackle the game with a friend by your side, and The Behemoth hasn’t forgotten its Castle Crashers roots. Playing the campaign solo works perfectly fine, but BattleBlock was designed with co-op in mind, and it shows.BattleBlock Theater feels like it was designed for the child that still lives inside me. It’s juvenile, colourful, and silly. But more importantly, it achieves everything it set out to do, with a near masterful level of execution. The addictive multiplayer and excellent level creation tools are just the icing on the cake."

I can't believe how much I laughed at the music, the presentation, and the jokes. There is so much fun to be had here. Customization is plentyful, you can collect various heads for your character, ranging from skulls, triangles, kings, and so much more. You can play with friends and create your own levels. It supports main game multiplayer co-op, two people couch coop, and you can also make your own stages, which is very fleshed out and extremely straightfoward.The main game is a puzzle platformer. You will probably fail a great deal. The stages are seperated and you can go back at any time. It will grade you on how many collectables you have obtained, if you died, and how fast you completed the stage. You can pick this up and play anytime for a short burst of fun.The music and graphics are stylized, bright colors and intresting charecters are abound. The music is a bit like a musical, where it describes what is going on with the story with humor and wit that I have not experienced in many games.

And I can happily say this game is heaps of fun! However, it is also heaps of rage. You will try to beat those levels over and over and over again. Some because they are timed, others for the best level grade. My advice is to get a gamepad for that because, while keyboard gameplay is okay, it hurts your fingers a lot more. There are 8 areas and each has 9 standard levels, 2 timed boss levels and 3 timed encore levels. You can even find some secrets levels. You can unlock some new weapons (for yarn) and character faces (for gems) along the way to finish each area. The story is funny and will entertain you with narration and videos. Playing alone is nice but where the game really shines is co-op play. The levels are somewhat changed in co-op to emphasize on teamwork of both players. The game is NOT easy, it will make you angry/frustrated a lot, escpecially in co-op play. I played this mostly with my sister and our stress levels were through the roof. After you are done with the base game there are TONS of user-created levels to play. They are of various quality but most are fun. I did not like arena matches that much but it is up to your preference.

You need to run around fight/dodge bad guys and navigate these block correctly. If you die you are simply teleported to the last chcekpoint.

Once you collect a gem or yarn, it's yours to keep. So if you kamikaze at a really tricky collectible, you're free to die and keep it. It's not very challenging (although I have yet to play it on insane mode...), but it's still worth it.

It can be played both competitively and casually and has a wide array of additional content other than the main storyline to keep you entertained. This game has a really good sense of humor and the levels all feel entertaining and unique. Also with the addition of the workshop it means that you can download even more levels offline which means limitless fun. If I have one main problem with this game it would be the combat. Don't get me wrong the combat isn't horrible but at the same time I feel it could have been a lot better. All in all this is a very well done game that offers lots of content for a fair price. 9/10

A simple, but elegantly surreal platformer. The love child of Super Mario Bros. 3 & a Monty Python sketch.You'd be forgiven for thinking that the game is way too easy when you first start playing. Not before long though, you'll start to see the delightful complexity that underlies the cartoony veneer.BT is a game that oozes quirkiness, satire, and wit. This is exemplified by the sharp & catchy writing, brought  to life by the talented Will Stamper.

The music fits the game perfectly as well being just the right amount of upbeat. The gameplay is simple and the level design is simpler still, but all in all it is an amazingly fun platformer that no platforming fan should pass up. It has major replayability, tons of user added content, lots of collectibles if you are into that, and a beautiful co-op mode. I truly have no complaints about this game at all."

,Recommended,238460,23027491,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Harley,"Hatty Hattington and his friends were enjoying a nice sailboat ride when suddenly their vessel became caught in the middle of a serious storm. It crashed against the shore of a nearby island, and the survivors soon found themselves imprisoned by a race of giant cats that made their prisoners battle for their lives in a dilapidated theater. Meanwhile, Hatty watched in silence, sitting in a chair with a malevolently glowing top hat resting on his headThe story in BattleBlock Theater isn't especially memorable once you put aside the creepy imagery of homicidal cat people. What really sells the tale is the energetic narrator, who tears through one line after another of cheesy exposition littered with enough poop jokes to fill an adult diaper. Hopefully, you don't mind that sort of juvenile humor, or you're at least willing to look past it so that you can enjoy what is easily one of the most satisfying downloadable titles to arrive on the Xbox Live Arcade.If you've been playing 2D action platformers for years, one of the aspects you'll appreciate most about BattleBlock Theater is its refusal to hold your hand unnecessarily. The interface and objectives are designed to communicate their purpose clearly, so a tutorial is neither needed nor provided. All that you must do to win the game is reach your friend, which you do by clearing one portion of the theater after another. As you work toward that end, you explore more than 100 carefully constructed stages that put your platforming and puzzle-solving skills to the test.As each stage begins, you jump out of a cage that is positioned somewhere within an arena. Your specific goal is to pass through a glowing exit gate, but first you must collect a number of emeralds that are located somewhere in the vicinity. Collecting three of them is enough to do the job, but you can also gather additional ones to use as currency at theater gift shops. An oversized ball of yarn is also stashed in each zone--usually in a fiendishly clever place--and there are sometimes bonus stages that are hidden behind portions of the landscape in out-of-the-way places. Though you don't always work against a timer, you still want to hurry because completion time and any optional items gathered both count toward the letter grade that you are awarded upon completing a stage.You encounter new hazards and more demanding situations as you advance. Figuring everything out usually takes only a moment, and then negotiating the additional obstacles becomes second nature until you're faced with a particularly devious area and find yourself pausing to ponder the best course of action. Such moments come up quite often, since BattleBlock Theater can be quite the difficult game. By the time you're partway through the sixth chapter, you're wall jumping, dashing, sliding, and double jumping like a champion, and you still might not be able to avoid the buzzsaw blades, spike traps, and grenade-launching cats thrown your way.Fortunately, the normal difficulty setting includes a generous checkpoint system that prevents you from ever losing much ground. You can try your luck at some of the more challenging gauntlets a few times over the course of a minute, until you get everything right, and the feeling when you come out the other end is exhilarating. If you prefer a less forgiving system, try insane mode. It doesn't play a lot differently than its standard counterpart--until you die. Then, you have to collect all those gems and that pesky yarn ball all over again because there was no checkpoint to catch you when you fell. Considering how crazy things get by the end of the adventure, you'll likely be doing yourself a favor if you start with the easier default setting.Although the charismatic narrator and the thrill of each new stage are ample incentive to advance toward the closing credits, the developers also included a bunch of unlockable content that lets you personalize your experience. In addition to a variety of special attacks that include vacuum cleaners and exploding paper airplanes, you can choose from one of four head types for your character. That's a nice touch since the head makes up about half of the hero's body mass. Most of the available options are wonderfully zany; there's simple pleasure in watching a ragdoll with a giant, triangular head and curlers leap around an arena while launching fireballs and narrowly avoiding homing missiles fired by oversized robots.Personalized characters make sense in BattleBlock Theater, especially because the game features a robust selection of multiplayer modes. There are eight distinct events that place you in similar arenas with unique objectives. In one mode, you attack your foe to knock his soul loose so that you can carry it, while you avoid letting him do the same thing to you. The longer you possess your adversary's spirit, the more points you accrue. In another attraction, you must tag more blocks than your opponent does within the provided time limit. There's also a mode where you grab a ball and score hoops on your opponent's goal, while in yet another selection, you ride your rival's steed back to your goal to score points. You can also work with possible allies to complete stages, and even take a break from the action to trade collectibles with friends.Multiplayer modes allow as many as four people to participate at once either locally or online, but it's also possible to interact with other players less directly. The game includes an intuitive level editor. A tutorial is included, but you'll barely even need it if you've already played through the game. You select dimensions for your desired arena, then place blocks and objectives as you see fit. Once you create a ""playlist"" that contains three stages, you can upload your creation and other players may vote it up or down. Your creation could even be featured as a top-rated community selection if enough people like what you've done. Though there aren't as many creation and sharing options as you'd find in something like Little Big Planet, the tools could keep you and others entertained for hours.Even if you find BattleBlock Theater too challenging after the initial stages, you'll want to keep playing just so you can see where the story goes next, or because you're every bit as addicted to the platforming action as expert players are. There's no shortage of ways to play, whether that be alone, cooperatively, or competitively, and the capable level editor is the icing on the cake. Hatty Hattington and his friends may be living through an absolute nightmare, but you're bound to be so thoroughly entertained that you won't have time to empathize.The GoodHilarious narrationChallenging, freewheeling platformingExtensive multiplayer options enhance the nuttinessIntuitive content creationLots of great, expertly crafted levelsThe BadJuvenile humor can occasionally grate8.5Great"

There is a never ending supply of user made content through the Steam-workshop, as well as a hard mode included for the main story too.One of the most attractive features about BattleBlock Theater is that you can play local Co-Op, a feature that these games often skip over.I absolutely loved the cinematic in between each stage as well, the dialog had me in stitches the whole time.I wouldn't recommend doing what I did and powering through this game in 2 sessions as you will end up wanting to scream the walls down, but you should definitely pick this game up, even when it's not on sale its a huge bargain for the amount of content and giggles you will get out of it.More Reviews at -http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/"

It might ruin the game for you. And that isn't fun at all!Before I tell you a bit about the game, please grab a blanket to keep yourself warm as I tell you a bit of a story as kind as a mother's kiss. You'r a part of a crew on the ship S.S friendship. You and all your friends on board leave your town to go on another exciting adventure on the S.S friendship. But something horrable happens. A storm hits the ship and its not very happy to you and you'r friends. The storm strands the S.S Friendship on a unknown island with a building looking like a theater. Where did your friends go? Where are you? What exacly happend after the storm? And most important of all, where is hatty? You gotta find that out yourself, by playing a cruel act in the theater!Pros:+ The StoryIt migt not be the best of storys out there, but its good enough to keep you going. It fits with the games style.+ The NarratorThe Narrator of BBT (Battleblock Theater) is constantly with you through out the game, telling you what happend in the past, talking about what might happen ahead and even commenting about you dying.(""Congratulaions, upon dying!"")+ The MusicIt might not be the best of music in games but, it fits the games style. It's quite unique compared to other games.+ Online Game modes And Online Co-OpMan, this game is way more fun with a friend, it was fun before but its even more fun with a friend in co-op story mode or just having you and 3 friends playing other game modes. Like capturing a pig to score points for the team or play basket or just fight to the death.++ Furbottom's FeaturesThis is the area where you acces other game modes, and aswell where you can play custom made maps from the steam workshop, there are maps for evrey game mode.

I played the entire game solo so I can't comment on the multiplayer, but it seems intruiging. All together, this is a very solid platformer with tight controls and a good sense of accomplishment. 8/10."

Это платформер, который придётся по душ любому, т.к. он прост в освоении и прохождение. Тут наверное заиграет что то внутри хардокрищиков, говорящие из глубин их мозга: ""Да как вообще можно создавать платформер в котором ты не будешь постоянно умирать?"". А вот так вот. Первое: В BBT ты постоянно умираешь. Постояяно. Второе: нужен хардкор - всё просто: включи режим ""Хардкор"".Как уже говорилось выше, игрушка представляет из себя ненапряжный платформер, с полным, кооператвным прохождением. Стоит отметить что 1 игру пройти реально, но это  не доставить столько удовольствия, поскольку игра сильно ориентирована на кооперативное прохождение и для этого созданы все условия (и ачивки). Нужно кинуть друга на другой берег? -Делай подсадку. Не нужно кидать друга на другой берег? -Делай подсадку. Нужно достать золотой клубок на другой части карты? -Делай подсадку. Хочешь потерять друга? -...(думаю сами поняли).В игре так же есть какое - никакое ПвП в виде арен или соревновательных мини - игр, но про них я расписывать не буду, т.к. никогда не пробовал. Игра полностью поддерживает workshop что не может не радовать. Прошёл всю игру? Пройди ещё несколько десятков тысяч уровней, созданных пользователями! (Кстати ещё один плюсик в копилку хардкорщиков. От хардкорщиков, для хардкорщиков). Редактор уровней прост до невозможности - это развязывает руки многим пользователям.В игре присутствуют класные фичи по типу кастомизации и оружия. Кастомизация тут ограничивается выбором типа головы и её формы. Хоть это и единственный способ украсить персонажа (Здесь я опустил выбор цвета игрока), но его вполне хватает, учитывая что тут несколько сотен этих голов, которые надо ещё и открыть, а играете вы в конце концов в платформер, а не в sims (тут могла быть шутка про кастомизацию современных MMORPG, но её не будет). Следующий пункт - оружие. Его тут около 20 видов. Оно нужно для того что бы изничтожать (какое хорошее слово) котов. Либо что бы  помогать себе и товарищу проходить уровень. Или же что бы мешать. Или же что бы мешать товарищу проходить, изничтожая котов. Либо же что бы изничтожать товарищей, попутно мешая котам проходить вас. И т.п. (ну вы поняли)Структура уровней тут везде одинаковая: На карте расположен выход, который открывается когда вы соберёте 3 гема (гема, потому что огранённый изумруд - длинное словосочитание). Всего на карте от 6 до 7 этих гемов (редко - 5). Собирать их или нет - на ваше усмотрение. Так же на уровне всегда присутствует 1 золотой клубок. Обычно он запрятан в каком - нибудь труднодоступном месте. Зачем собственно всё это нужно? Ну во первых за прохождение уровня вы получаете оценку по пятибальной шкале от A до F. Так же есть A++ но что бы выбить эту оценку нужно умудриться собрать всё на уровне, да ещё и уложиться во время, которые тут в принципе не ограничено кроме финальных уровней глав (об это чуть позже). За гемы можно покупать головы - по 10 за шт. При чём голова даётся рандомно. Вы выбираете только её форму (Шар, куб, цилиндр, пирамида). После 10 купленных голов одной формы цена возрастает до 15 за шт. Золоты клубки тратятся на покуупку новых оружий, по 5 клубков за шт. К слову все виды оружий открыть куда проще, чем все головы.Теперь немного о прохождении самой игры. Игра делится на 8 глав. После прождения каждой главы вам открывается доступ е следующей, и рассказывается часть сюжета (Да, это платформер с сюжетом). В каждой главе 9 основных, 2 финальных и 3 дополнительных уровня. По поводу основных уровней всё описано выше. Финальные уровни, схожи с обычными, но у вас всегда есть ограничение по времени, по истичению которого вы проваливаете прохождение уровня. Дополнительные уровни устроены по принципу финальных, но для того что бы открыть следующую главу проходить их необязательно.Отдельно стоит отметить саундтреки к игре. ЭТО ШЕДЕВР! Я никогда не слышал ничего более подходящего для платформера, чем данные произведения искусства. Не буду больше ничего говорить, это просто надо слышать.Игра очень часто светится на распродажах по 69 р., хотя свою полную стоимость игра окупает.Вроде всё сказал, не думаю что многие прочли до конца, но спасибо за внимание!P.s: В игре много шуток про♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥P.p.s: Мне просто нужно было написать обзор для значка"

,Recommended,238460,31910956,Posted: 22 May,all,Doctor Pyro,"BattleBlock Theater’s wildly inventive stage design is undoubtedly its greatest draw. It offers up some of the most clever, satisfying, and varied 2D platforming in years. Eight worlds are loosely sorted into gameplay themes, each stage building and tweaking ideas established in the previous one. My favorite set of stages are all designed to force two runs – once with a (relatively) easier set of challenges, and then a second time after hitting a trigger to activate lasers, disappearing blocks, roving saw blades, or some other added bit of trickiness. No idea is used twice; if an idea does repeat it’s sufficiently escalated to really put your platforming skills to the test.Stages alternate between pure Super Meat Boy-style skill and puzzle-platforming ala Braid or Toki Tori – sometimes within a few moments of each other. The variety is welcome and well-executed, and does a great job of propelling you from stage to stage. But the platforming feels better in other games, and the puzzling is lacking a hook like Braid’s time mechanics – it’s mostly pushing blocks.BattleBlock Theater doubles down on its jack-of-all-trades nature in its sheer ridiculous size. This is a truly gigantic game, guaranteed to keep completionists busy for literally dozens of hours. After clearing the seven- or eight-hour campaign, you still have 24 tossed-in-just-because bonus stages (three per world) to run through. Each stage also has a gold-medal time and eight hidden collectibles, all of which are needed for the coveted A++ score. These doodads aren’t afterthoughts, either, as most are hidden behind clever mini-puzzles or optional platforming sections. After all that’s done, true masochists can do it all again on Insane Mode – a difficulty that removes the generously placed mid-stage checkpoints. Whew!Release Date Trailer01:36This would already be an incredible amount of content, but The Behemoth decided to throw in the kitchen sink while they were at it. A complete set of level-authoring tools is also included, letting anyone create and share their own custom creations. Curated playlists of the best fan-made levels are promised for months to come.And that's just the single-player portion. BattleBlock Theater also includes a robust collection of cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes via local play or Xbox Live Arcade. Multiplayer, especially the seven competitive Arena modes, doesn’t ever feel like more than an added-on curiosity, though. I enjoyed the frantic fun of knocking opponents off my turf in King of the Hill, but the iffy combat controls make it unlikely that these modes will be more than one-and-done diversions. Some of the other platforming-centered multiplayer options, such as level races, feel like they have much more potential for longer-term fun.The VerdictBattleBlock Theater’s lack of focus keeps it from being a true XBLA great, but this platformer still kept a smile on my face from beginning to end. Extremely clever and inventive stage design, a well-honed difficulty curve, and wealth of extras and bonuses make it another winner for The Behemoth. Who knew keeping cats entertained could be so harrowing, and so fun?GOODBattleblock Theater is a gigantic, inventive, and satisfying platforming romp."

After your boat crashes the cats kidnap your best friend Hatty and force him into running the theater. You and all of your other friends are now prisoners being forced to perform for the audience that will pay a good amount of gems to see you get destroyed in any way possible. To complete a level you must evade all the obstacles and collect gems along the way, until you reach the exit (Note: The exit will only open if you have collected three gems or more) Like I said before this games story is hilarious but that doesn't mean the game itself is all that soft. No, the difficulty grows higher and higher until you get mad of seeing your character blow up, drown, get pierced by spikes and get eaten. The closest i can compare, in the case of despicable enemy/trap placement, is Mega Man. But don't worry your not just some helpless little performer, because you get to carry two of many insane weapons that may come in handy to kill something or to reach some areas. Control wise this game has really responsive and tight controls, but it would be best to play with a controller and not your keyboard. The multiplayer part of the game is fantastic, you can play through the story with a friend or get four people together to play a new form of basketball or challenge each other  by creating your own levels in the level creator.This game is great for when you just want to try something different that’s  fun but at the same time challenging, so if you have money and you dont know what to do with it I really suggest buying BattleBlock Theater."

,Recommended,238460,11866288,"Posted: 25 August, 2014",all,Bucchus,"Great & funny platformer. The solo campaign could be compared to Super Meat Boy except it's not as merciless and doesn't require that much incredible precision. Don't be fooled by the easy first chapters, it does crank up the difficulty around the middle of the game. There's also puzzle influences with lots of levels utilizing switches.The co-op campaign seemed fun too, with hilarious friendly fire accidents. The arena modes induced lots of yelling with the 2v2 local multiplayer modes that were more like chaotic brawler games instead of skilled platforming. Since there's an editor built-in you can play random assortments of uploaded levels if you find the official levels dull.In addition to the gameplay, the main draw of the game is the comedy side. The story makes no sense but it's really entertaining, mostly thanks to the narrator. The cartoony animated artstyle is great (very similar to Castle Crashers), the soundtrack is awesome and the excellent constant narrator quips make everything funny. There's hundreds of stupid looking unlockable heads to collect. Check the Steam store trailer to see if the game's particular style of wacky lolrandom crazy works for you.As a pure platformer I'd most likely gotten bored before finishing the game, but the cartoony aesthetics carried it and I finished the main story because every raving cutscene after a chapter is a treat. The 4-person couch arena chaos is a fine addition to Broforce and Gang Beasts evenings."

Now, after quite a wait, the third popular title of The Behemoth's games is released, but does it live up to expectations? Yes, but not by much.Story time? I believe that would be a yes. The story, believe it or not, is humorous and pretty enjoyable. I'll try and not say much, but I'll explain the main plot: Your best friend, Hatty Hattington, you, and other friends go on a trip on the S.S. Friendship, but get shipwrecked on a mysterious island run by cats. Yes, cats. They give Hatty a corrupt top hat that makes him betray his friends and make him the leader of the cats. Especially when you add the humorous narrator that is quite underrated, great story overall.Release Date: 15 May, 2014The GraphicsI'll start with visuals. It honestly isn't much different from Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, but I still do like the simple style of the game. Oh yes, and it does have the ""1,000,000,000p graphics with high resolution super texture technology that modern human eyeballs can't even see."" Trust me, that narrator does NOT lie. The graphics in this game make my eyeballs melt at times. It's so simple that I can't see the amazing hyper realistic textures this game has!The GameplayNow, I'll move to the gameplay that includes the ""state of the art ragdoll physics."" Sorry to doubt you Mr. Narrator, but there isn't much ragdoll from what I've seen. Is there ""particle physic future systems?"" Yes. The gameplay is simple, if a bit dull. The combat is somewhat clunky and can be annoying when playing PvP. Not much to this platformer, especially from Behemoth.The AudioNow we move to the audio. Okay, there isn't much to the audio, but the narration is very humorous and well done, despite not getting much praise compared to The Stanley Parable and Bastion's narrators. The music is above average, and uses choir in some rather creative ways. Oh yeah, and there's people make sounds when you do stuff.All in AllBattleBlock Theater®is a really funny Game!9/10 From MeSweep"

,Recommended,238460,11079299,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,Yezzdia,"I was honestly really skeptical of BattleBlock Theater in the beginning, but I had to buy it simply because of the trailer. I have played through the story on co-op and have gotten all As and A+s except for one B. Let me be the first to say I was absolutely wrong to be skeptical. This game got my expectations, blew them out of the water, caught them, pooped on them, then punched them into spikes and lava. It is an absolutely amazing game to play co-op. I would recommend getting this game even if you do not enjoy platformers, though I would suggest getting someone to play it with. Single player is still very fun.Pros:-Difficult levels. They start easy but get much harder later on.-Co-op is fun and works well for the most part (will explain in cons).-Steamworks and player-created levels.-Smooth controls and very easy to learn.-Nice controller support.-Good and well-made game mechanics, but still very silly and enjoyable.-Some gems and yarn (collectibles) are difficult to find and get.-A lot of different faces to unlock.Cons:-Keyboard controls aren't the best, but are tolerable. (Me and my girlfriend went through all of co-op, her on a keyboard, so very much doable and tolerable, but controller is recommended)-Boulders. If you are playing with an internet friend that is relatively far from you (probably 100-150 ms), the non-host can sometimes be killed by simply picking up a boulder and doing nothing with it.-Yarn becomes useless after a while. It is used to purchase weapons, but you can buy all of your weapons by chapter 5 or so.-Not a lot of replay value aside community maps.-Some weapons are essentially useless, but can still be fun to mess around with.Overall 9.5/10. One of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long while. It's honestly just pure, straight fun. Especially when I can punch my girlfriend into spikes."

But I just had a co-op game with a relative of mine, and what I played was enough to clinch a recommendation out of me.This is Super Meat Boy lite - much smaller levels, much scaled back in terms of difficulty and without uber-hardcore gymnastic moves you have to pull to pass the levels (except for the ♥♥♥♥ing double-jump. Grrrrr.).Usually when a game goes ""It's like (insert game name here), but easier!"", it usually ends up playing like a damp squib, like a pat on the back and a reassurance that you are totally good at video games! Not so with Battleblock Theater. It has smaller levels, but they are more creatively designed, do more with their set of tricks, and the game itself has tons more atmosphere - mostly in the form of the Narrator, who makes silly quips to egg me on to continue playing. They could have ♥♥♥♥ed up and made him immensely irritating. But the writing and the delivery of said wrting straddles between irritating and flat, hitting the sweet spot between the two.And, most importantly - they've made different sets of levels for single and co-op experiences, which is all I need to recommend a co-op game to other people. Seriously, have you seen some of these co-op games? They pretend to have single player modes, but those modes are actually the co-op modes with a huge amount of restraint to keep from screaming ""YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE? WHY NOT GO BACK TO READING BOOKS, YOU BIG DUMB FAT DORK, AND LEAVE THESE COOL VIDEO GAMES TO THE HIP FRIEND-HAVERS."" The fact that the developers actually bothered to create campaigns to differentiate between the two is an automatic recommendation by itself. Kudos, The Behemoth. Battleblock Theater is the game for co-op hating people who want to play the game without friends, and then play later with friends if they so choose!"

If you have a weird sense of humor like myself and can be open to oddities, this game will be great for you. The only frustrating thing is that I find it VERY difficult to go through a level without dying a lot (I have done it a few times but not many), but either way the deaths don't really count against you (other than taking a hit in time trials). The whole concept of the game is strange with cat creatures holding you and your fellow creatures captive  and you earning them back by putting gems into ""prisoner dispensor machines."""

One welcome feature in this game is the level editor feature, with that as is sounds you can create your own levels and you can play along with freinds once the level is published and laugh at your freinds trying to work out how to survive.My main issue with the game is the 1 life restart feature.To put it simply if you die once you have to gather all the items again.Personally I would have a 2-3 life per level and grade the person on how many of their lifes they use.Highly reccomended but be warned this game is nothing like Castle Crashers so don't buy it expecting to be."

,Recommended,238460,10668429,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Boom Box,"Let's begin with this, would I recomend this game? Oh hell yes I would, are you kidding me. I never actually heard of BattleBlock Theater until I had a friend who told me that this game was coming out for the PC, and so I was curious about this game and decided to find out more about this game. Just watching the trailer for this game alone got me hooked on the game, but what got me even more interested about this game was the voice actor that doing all of the hilarious remarks. Since I actually knew about Stamper before I ever found out about this game I admired Stamper for his voice, cause his voice is pretty Godly, if you ask me.... I wish I could speak like that. Never the less when I had figured out that Stamper was the voice actor for this game I was absolutely thrilled about this cause it would be hours upon hours of listening to Stamper's voice constantly mocking you as die absolutely hilarious deaths. But enough about the voice acting, I'll get back to the rating of that later. To continue, the graphics on this game was in my opinion very good and very fitting for this game the layout style or genre of this game also was very fitting which does play into the story quite a bit in all honesty. So in the end I would deffinetly give this game 10/10 in graphics. Now the game mechanics I can't complain about what-so-ever, so 10/10 in game mechanics and style and so on and so forth you get the idea by now I hope. The story, oh the story. I love the story and with Stamper doing all of the voice overs you simply can't go wrong with this game's story and the humor tops it all so I would totally give this story a 10/10, which overall rating of this game would have to deffinetly be a 10/10. So back to my original question, would I recomend this game? Of course I would yet again, now in my opinion is it the best game I have ever played? Not really, but it would totally be my second favorite game that I have played (first one being FTL and third one being The Binding of Isaac). In my opinion it's just one of those games that sparks memories of me being 8 years old and playing Metroid Fussion on my Nintendo GameBoy Advance SP and constantly raging at that one dammed spider boss for some reason. But enough about my memories, just go get the game and as always, enjoy your experience."

It took the behemouth 6 years to port castle crashers over and the key bindings were not that great. I believe they've bettered themselves with porting over to the PC because I was able to bind my keys the way that I wanted, and the overlay tutorial for using said key functions for certain things, whether it be punching cats into water or sploding yourself, or purchasing an eyeball from the store.These are the things you need to look for when purchasing Battleblok theater including the options, they are rather minimalistic as any normal 2D sidescrolling game, you got options for turning down the teture qualitly of the background, Vsync options thank goodness including multiple sound options and optimises for the narrator and audience as you play(I reccomend keeping Stampers voice tunred on for the main enjoyement of the game)as the port stands I say it does pretty good, I was still able to enjoy the game and the combat is smooth as it ever will be.the one gripe I guess I have about it is for some reason you have to hold down two keys to climb up the ladders, one to hold on and another to move.

Game mechanics are really good and it has a easy learning curve. When you pass the story you can go replay it for achievements and if you get bored with the story there are a lot of community levels.

BattleBlock Theater is a 2D game with  fun levels full of new things, and don't forget the parkour. The narrator is hilarious, and you can get a few good laughs out of him. This game also includes a level builder, so you can make whatever you wish. This game has a great story and plenty of levels, even when you beat the game there is still levels to be played made by members of the community. Also, did I mention each level has two different versions for both co-op and singleplayer? I have also enjoyed trading heads and collection them for my character. Overall, Battleblock theater is a fun, cheap, and awesome game that is only 15$ and can give you so many hours of great fun. I would recommend this game to all my friends!."

This, ladies and gentlemen, is a very well constructed game, that will not only make you laugh, but also give you alot of cooperative experience (if you have friends to play with ofc). The game supports multiplayer up to four players and is very stylistic in the form of bright colors.The game has its own story, and it really fits well with the style. Along with the story, you can also play Arena mode which features 8 gamemodes: Soul Snatcher, Muckle, Challange, King of the Hill, Color the World, Grab the Gold, Ball game & Capture the Horse. If you play online, it offers 3 additional gamemodes: Furbottom's Features, Community Teater & Grab Bag. There's two different ways to play Arena mode, Co-Op and VS, which is both fun. The game also has Level Editor which lets you create your very own Levels and Arena modes!In BattleBlock Theater, players control a prisoner while they are forced to play game levels, devised by Hatty Hattington, the main antegonist in the game. Controls are simple and the levels are built up with blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes. The deadly spikes are... deadly, and theres more... deadly stuff such as deadly water and deadly, scary, but at the same time cute creatures!While playing, you will be introduced to the to the Gift Shop! Here you will be freeing prisoners with help of the gems you've earned. The prisoners you've saved are selectable to play as via the player setup. You can also buy weapons from the Cat Guards with Golden Yarn that you also collect while playing, some are more usefull than others, but it's all fun and games :).Wiki for the game:http://battleblocktheater.wikia.com/wiki/BattleBlock_Theater_Wiki"

It's just a shame that every other world is exactly the same same with nothing to really make each level special. Style wise this game is cool, but it stays on the same style until it becomes stale. The multiplayer in all of the vs modes is an absolute mess of who has the most OP weapon.

The game has a rather twist when the storyline is being told. It's both comedy and a sense of despair in it as you try to save your friends while becoming part of a show to cats watching a theater as the name of the game is called. Overall the game is worth playing it either solo or in co-op. The graphics remind me of Castle Crashers and the music sits the enviornment.I would give it a 9.5 out of 10.

So, now it's been released on Steam a year later, and I completely believe that it was worth the wait. I appreciate the amount of love and effort was put into this game, and making it unlike any other game I've played (yes, it's a platformer, but it's more than that). The only thing I can criticize is the amount of players on the ""Online"" mode. This might just be because people are in Private Lobbies, but I'm not sure. Even if that's not the case, it has nothing to do with the quality of the game.The storyline is fantastic (in my opinion) and it shows character (just like Castle Crasher's did, but with actual narration. Probably more so.). I enjoyed the narrator (StampyTV) throughout the entire game, and laughed a bit each time he had something to say. The multiplayer is great. Unlike their previous title (Castle Crashers), Battleblock Theater has many more gamemodes (both Co-op and competitive). All of them are fairly entertaining.

76561198091067271,Recommended,238460,10226136,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,TheWayfaring,"Two words for this game: silly and fun. Oh, wait, that's three. Oh well. Did I mention it was fun? But in all seriousness, this game is really rather addicting due to its unique personality. Being a platformer, the basic gameplay style is the same: jump platform to platform and avoid death. There is combat if you so wish to kill the cat guards that try to end your fabulous jumping spree, or very little if you choose not to (though you'll miss some gems, used to unlock prisoners (new faces), for that perfect score!). There is a decent variety of melee moves and a good armory of weapons, each with different effects both harmful and helpful. For example, the acid bubble: as the name implies, it's acidic, and you or any enemy who gets caught in it or going through it is killed; however you can jump on top of it and bounce off to reach new heights for some more gems or maybe the ever-so-precious yarn, used to unlock weapons. The silly storyline (it involves a boat of friends appropriately called the S.S. Friendship) and annoying-but-not-in-a-bad-way narrator are enough to motivate you through the solo campaign, though the option of the co-op campaign (same storyline, new levels) is really rather tempting, and is rewarding. Both players earn all gems and yarn earned in every level, except for the mysterious, shiny, golden hat, which keeps a slightly competetive feel to it, even though you're best friends now! There are separate achievements for beating the game on normal difficulty, co-op normal, insane, and co-op insane, so there are reasons to replay it, besides being outstandlingly fun that is. And once you tire of the storyline (or at the very least want a break, because who can ditch Hatty? Nobody, that's who.) there are several different ""arena"" modes and the exclusive features to play through. Arena games (including King of the Hill and a silly form of Basketball) offer a competetive PvP side while the Furbottom Features offer more co-op rewards and player integration through the Steam Workshop. There is a level editor of course, meaning that you can endlessly spawn new challenges for you and your friends or to listen to the tears of the other players who don't realize you put some invisible block somewhere (I don't think that's possible, and if it is...don't be heartless, we're all friends here). If you're not big into silly, happy, carefree, happy-go-lucky-e-t-c. games, well, deal with it, because this game is worth every penny you'll spend on it. It's a good platformer with incentives to replay and to do more than just the campaign, and I suppose you could mute it, if you're masochisitic. Another valuable point I think is worth mentioning is that this is a semi-popular game, and it's on Steam with an interactive community and game developers (Chicken Toucher achievement anybody?) so this game has really good potential of being updated frequently. With a base game already worth the full price and more, additional content really pushes it over the edge. Hope to see you on!"

I never got the feeling that a certain level was hard enough to get me frustrated at the game, which you would think with a game like Battlelock Theater its a given. Playing with your buddie can really test how well you and your partner work together. You can play to help your partner or play to screw them over and get them killed at every turn just to get a good laugh. I must admit I am gulty of doing that a few times myself. The weapons are very cool using them in different ways to help you complete levels and fighting off the ''Cat Guards'', and you can not forget about that hundreds of heads that you can unlock by using the gems you collect in the level. Hundreds of possible heads can pop out for you to wear and every one gets better and funnier then the last."

Everything is more fun with friends, right?Besides story mode, there is arena, that contains many PvP modes like King of the Hill, Capture the Horse and more - not just made by developers, but also player-made. There are also player-made adventure playlists. Multiplayer can be played locally or online, which is currently weaker, but you can usually find some games.Story mode and official arena maps will earn you diamonds and yarns, which you can use to buy new head skins and weapons.

The result is that it feels like you are playing a party game which is wonderful when playing punishing platformer puzzles.The Positives- As a platformer the puzzles are excellent and there are many levels/stages- big variety of new and old platformer gameplay mechanics; eg. enemies that chase you and bump you around- a story in a platformer, yes I know 'who cares', but it is a delightful non-sequitur intermission to the rest of the game.- whimsical humour - from the story narration to commentary on your deaths & level completion- 4 player co-op online or 2 player local- great soundtrack & Voice Acting- Cartoon-y art style is pleasingI didn't feel that a gamepad was necessary, so that means if you do have a gamepad then 2 player local co-op will be easy.The only real problem I/you have is that the game strongly prefers to be online. You can't get all the bonus gear if you are not online (largely cosmetic items which you trade for with in game collectable gems).Steam Cloud Sync is buggy and you may all lose progress switching between online and offline. If you discover you have to start over again (i.e. saves wiped),immediatelykill the game so it doesn't autosave - then resync online. Got me twice, sigh.Conclusion:A very good spin on the platformer genre - highly recommended if you want a platformer or a 2 player ""couch co-op"" game."

,Recommended,238460,34720509,Posted: 3 September,all,Peep,"This game is a fantastic platformer, and has lots of replay-value. It is similar to LittleBigPlanet in that it has user-generated levels and co-op, as well as competitive modes. The story is quite interesting, and the narration can be quite funny. Multiplayer is fun, but playing locally with someone at your side is where this game truly shines, and even without that, it is still very good. There are plenty of customizations you can add to your character, and you can even make your own head and use it in-game. The game is quirky, often made me chuckle. Even the music can be a little catchy, although other times the music can be a little drawn out if you've been playing a really long or difficult level, but you can always mute it. The weapons you can acquire can also shake things up a bit in both co-op and competitive. Say you can't reach a certain spot, well there's a certain weapon that can allow you to bounce off of it and reach higher places. The game can also run on nearly any computer. The Level Editor is also very easy to understand, you could make a level very easy, or you could make the level infuriatingly hard, it's all up to you.Overall, this game is definitely worth the purchase, as it will make you laugh, cry, and be absolutely furious, sometimes all at once. Would certainly recommend."

But when I found out it was on Steam, I instantly bought it. I only have 5.9 hours, but I played the Xbox version so much I think I have a very clear verdict:This game is amazing!!! Incredibly fun, hilarious and charismatic. The game itself shouldn't take longer than 2-3 weeks to complete, but there's still much more to do. Co-Op, multiplayer VS matches, building your own stages to ruin friendships. I won't say much about the story, other than it's completely nonsensical and bizarre.To get the most out of BBT, I recommend an Xbox 360 controller for maximum enjoyment. If you've thought getting the game, DO!!! But be warned.......the story has 8 different chapters, and they get increasingly difficult. 6 and 7 especially so. 8 not so much, but that's probably because you're used to the game at this point. But if you're still not satisfied......You give a cat some yarn and he gives you an exploding frog.SCORE OUT OF 10: 9.0/10"

The game haves a super massive collection of body part to unlock so you will need al the gems you can find if you want to unlock them all. What makes it fun to collect because the game generate sometime the item the Golden Head and will grand you exra of 10 gems and the end if you can finish the stage with the item.And what makes this game extra cool is that you can play alone and with a friend in full story mode co-op offline or online and this is a lot of fun because you will NEED to work together.Otherwise can not complete the stages because you need the partner to help you.There is an support for 4 player offline / online main problem this is that you only can play mini games fun still co-op 4-player would be much better and much more fun.The game supports many challenges for many and many hours and if you are done with these you can even make your own if you like totally massive download stages so you can not be bored with this video game.Controls:=======For the casual player this will need some practice because of some crazy jumps over time you need to take if you want to reach the last gem of need to jump over spikes.Beside that it’s an easy to learn videogame and will give you no frustration if you look to the controls.I try’s the game with an Xbox 360 controller and everything works perfectly even the button layout has been supported by this game.Overall:======If you like me are a big fan of the The Behemoth Studios games you will love this game to.It is not an Beat ’em Up like the Castle Crasher series still it’s a freaking good and fun game for young and old.Score - 9/10.http://store.steampowered.com/app/238460/== For more reviews go towww.gamegrin.com==== Please don't forget to like my reviews =="

Buckle your pants, because there's a lot. You'll get a platformer, but with middle school fart jokes that you (admit it) still love to laugh at. You're going to die, a lot. You're going drown, get stabbed, exploded, eaten, and incinerated. You're going to kill your teammates, a lot. You're going to want to throw your controller across the room after trying to finish one section for the last half hour. You're going to yell at the other person in co op. You'll play long enough to unwittingly sing along to the soundtrack. You're going to obsess over gems and yarn. And over heads. (What do they do? Nothing, but there's a deep-seeded need to collect themall.ALLof them, I say!)Only downside is that multiplayer is a bit dead, so you'll want to have friends that you can connect with.

Each level is a puzzle-Amazing soundtrack-Amazingly fun SP, even better MP-Co-operative and competetive multiplayer, a couple of moves are there specifically for the co-op experience-Easy to use level creator, making an endless supply of content at 0 cost-Game recommends you use a controller, but keyboard controls are fine-Insane difficulty option for hardcore gamersMy only gripe with this game is that it's horrendously difficult to get the level awards for completing a level quickly.

The story is such a big and intense tale, sprinkled with a ton of dark humor, where a block character will fight through different scenarios against the malevolent oppressive force of sturdy and big cats, hoping to save his friends of prison and the slavery of giving a good show for the mighty and rich cats (yeah, all game is passed on a prison and on a theater) and the most important mission that you must do: save hatty from himself, taking off the ""cat-devilish"" hat of his head. This game is full of surprises, has hard scenarios full of tricks that you must do, has a ton of characters that are your friends and will help you along the game and characters that are just evil and will try to make you fail and has the most unstable and funny narrator that will make you smile once in a while.Sincerely, i didnt like the multiplayer mode, its a little bit boring but the co-op mode is great. The co-op mode give you the opportunity to play with another player or a friend and to do the story mode together, which make the game easier and entretaining."

With the editor you can create your own map and share it with your friends , which means that they could like it or not . Depindes on what are your skills as an editor. The story makes u feel like laying a lot , just to save your dear friend hatty. (Spoiler) Who in the final dies anyway , but who cares , If u finish the story it doesn't means u finished the entire game. I mean u still have characters to unlock , and u still can play just for fun with ur friends or help one of your friend if he is just at the start of the game. And!

Let me just preface this by saying how easy, and just, accessable this product is to use. As a busy, newly single parent of two, I hardly have any time to play modern computer games, what with their 500+ button combonations and 900+ hours of gameplay. It's tough to find a nice computer game that I can easily pick up and play for 15 minutes or so (but not around my young ones, it's a little inappropriate in my opinion), and then get back to my normal, repetitive, day by day life.But enough about me! You probably want to know why this game deserves your time, don't you? Of course you do, even I knew that. So I wrote this to tell you why you should pick this up (not really LOL. It would a digital download version of the game). Simply put: This game has a lot of content for it's price. Not only do you get decently sized, replayable campaign, you also get an insane (or ""hardcore"" as the hip kids say) mode, a few online arena game modes, numerous head customizations to unlock, and access to community made maps so the fun never ends. WOW! WHAT A BARGAIN!It sure is a whacky, zany game that you really should check out for yourself! You can believe in my words when I say that Battleblock Theater is a wonderful game that anyone should add to their library. Seriously, don't be a doof and not buy this game!

If you enjoy fair but difficult platforming with interesting gimmicks, this is a great game for you. The style of the cutscenes and the narration are hilarious, overall the game has Behemoth's unique styling and quality, which makes it a winner.The game recommends you play it with a controller, which makes sense as it was originally on XBLA. But I've been playing it with a keyboard and enjoying myself a lot. Still, it IS made for controllers, so if you want to get all of the the time bonuses for completing stages then you may need to get one. Recommended, but not required."

,Recommended,238460,11188199,"Posted: 11 July, 2014",all,ASH+Vocaholic,"It is to be expected that a game from the same team that brought us Castle Crashers is going to be filled to the brim with humor and other random silliness. I'd say they hit another nail in the head with this one. Unlike their previous title, this game is essentially a platformer but still has some forms of combat that often involves infinite hilarity and mayhem on both friend and foe.I can list the pros and cons but to be honest I don't think there's any con to this game whatsoever. There's a plethora of levels which you can play on normal or insane if you fancy more of a challenge and to prevent you from easily getting bored, it features a variety of game modes that can all be played solo, cooperatively and/or against friends or other players online. On top of that, the game includes a level editor integrated with the Steam Workshop to give the game even more replayability and every Friday a different playlist created by the community is chosen to be featured, which players can then play to gain extra gems/yarn and new prisoners. The items you collect in the game (gems, yarn, weapons and prisoners) can all be traded with anyone through either the in-game lobby or Steam's very own trading system, which means you can even trade against cards and items from other games. If all of that is not enough, the game's comedic value more than makes up for it.To sum it all up, the game is quite expansive with more than plenty of things to do, sights to see and stuff to collect in an environment that can be enjoyed by one and all. The game is definitely worth it's price and even if you're usually not into platformers, I'd say it's still worth a try as it offers a lot more than just platforming."

It has a humorous theme to it, making the game great for people who want to sit down, play a game, and have some good laughs. I've never been a fan of 2-D platformers, but this game has led me on and on, having me sit down for hours on end. It is by far the best game I've played by Behemoth games besides Castle Crashers (I haven't played Alien Hominid HD, I'm hoping for it to be published on Steam!). I think that anyone who has interest in this game should buy it no matter if it's on sale or not. This game is worth every penny, and I'm still looking forward to spending many more hours playing. Sadly, there are some cons though, but every game has some negatives. I'll be straight forward with my review.Pros: Very funny and humorous, good replay value, fun co-op, fun multiplayer, and hilarious narration.Cons: The story can be repetitive over time, and at times it's difficult to find a multiplayer game to join.There are plenty of other pros as well as cons that I could add, but I'm finishing up my review here. This game is amazing, and I think that plenty of people would enjoy this game if they bought it. I'm hoping to see more games made by Behemoth in the future.9/10"

After playing a little bit of the game in co-op, i completely loved it. This game is hilarious if you have the right people to hang out with, considering you can kill each other about 74 billion times. The story for the entire game is also hilarious and very different from other games, the narrator is the most funny guy in the world too. I love the collectibles because you can get such a large varieties of heads, and so many of them are funny looking. My personal favorite is Willie the Kid (a triangle head). The puzzles end up getting difficult in the end, and I just have to collect every emerald or else I will go completely mad.

76561198071882152,Recommended,238460,10293246,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Faraine,"This game is incredible. Is it as great as the powerhouse Castle Crashers was? Perhaps. It's got the same humor as Castle Crashers, but amped up big time. This game feels like a behemoth game should.(I know I only have about 9 hours when I posted this review. I played it lots on the Xbox version though.)First off, the graphics. They may not seem impressive, but it's not just quality we are talking here. I'm talking about how the game looks, and it looks great. All of the prisoner heads have their own personality, and it's pretty awesome the diversity. Not just the prisoners have this personality though. The cat guards, for example, are cute and look friendly, although they can (and probably will!) kill you.But graphics aren't as important as gameplay. Good thing the gameplay here is great. In the game, you take part in nasty plays after crash landing on an island, in which you collect gems and balls of yarn. Playing single player isn't as much fun as multiplayer however. I'll be talking mostly about the multiplayer, which is pretty unique. It is a ""co-optional"" system in which you don't have to always help your partner, or you may need to kill them to progress. There are also many different weapon types you can use, each granting some cool abilities. You can use the pop-gun to fire a projectile at a wall that will stick there for you to jump on. You can also wield a primary and secondary weapon, which is a nice touch. There are 10 weapons in total. In addition, there is a fun arena battle mode consisting of many different modes you can play.On to the story. It is mostly told through cutscenes, but it isn't the kind of cutscene where once it starts, you think ""ugh, another one?"" instead, you'll be thinking, ""Awesome! Another cutscene!"" because they are just so funny. The narrator for the game, Will Stamper, also narrates these cutscenes.And, there is a level editor installed. It is easy to use, and is fun to work with aswell. Creating levels can be somewhat of a challenge if you aren't creative, however. But, this is what happens in any game with a level editor.And that'll wrap up my review. Sorry it was a little lengthy, but I had lots to say. It's a very fun game, and stays funny while doing it. If you want a score, it gets 9.5/10."

,Recommended,238460,11206662,"Posted: 12 July, 2014",all,TangledAlmond,"This game has over 100 story mode levels and like 15 game modes there's so much content. The level design is very well done and many levels will have you on your toes, as well as being satisfying to complete, especially in insane mode. (warning: insane mode could drive you, well, insane) The sheer amount of multiplayer content and simple customization provides an entertaining multiplayer experience, with either co-op or vs modes. It's also very simple to connect with both friends and/or strangers, just select multiplayer and host or join a server. The level design, again, is very well done in all game modes, with different stages for each mode that fit the game mode well.The collectibles are very fun to collect as well. These include weapons and tools to use in levels as well as different prisoners which allow you to change which character you play as. This meshes very well with the provided trading system, allowing you to trade characters and weapons with others, and can be done with friends and strangers alike. With the large amount of characters you can unlock you're sure to find many you like playing as. The generous number of characters to unlock also ensures it'll take a long time to get them all, meaning there won't be extra gems in your wallet doing nothing for a whiiiiiile.One more thing that's great about this game is the narration and quips. The writing is very clever and amusing to listen to; it has me looking forward to every cutscene. As for the quips (which are basically comments made by the narrator during gameplay), it's as if there's multiple ones for every situation, in every game mode, which make gameplay even more lively. And if they bother you or start sounding repetitive, then you can simply turn them off in the menu.Basically, the game has great gameplay, multiple game modes to keep you playing, many fun collectibles, easy and amusing multiplayer, engaging writing, oh i forgot to mention the LEVEL CREATOR. well, there's one of those tooAlso, the secrets are fun to find, especially the secret levels (because of the secret music, mostly)."

Insane mode has a difficulty curve for an enormous challenge if you want, and the story is wonderfully adorable.So Buckle Your Pants, and prepare for the tale of a lifetime- of friendship, cats, hats that cats can't wear, and loss.

Battle block theatre is an amazing blend of humor, puzzles and challenging platforming. The cartoony graphics are amaing and I always have fun seeing them. The puzzles combined with the platfrming make the perfect blend of gameplay, but the thing I like best about this game is the humor. During gameplay Hatty will comentate on your performence, critizing you when you die, congratulating you when you get a gem, spouting out random, fake yarn facts when you get yarn. The cutscenes are done in a puppet on a stick fasion and with the way the narrator talks during them will make you laugh every time. I often find myself rushing through levels just to see them!

For example, every weapon you obtain has a purpose, and using each weapon for that purpose in certain scenarios can make clearing the level much faster, ensuring you a better grade for the level.This game is hilariously fun and its co-op mode is complete insanity (in all the right ways). I enjoyed every minute of doing online co-op because of the sheer insanity that comes when 2-4 people clear insane levels and battle in the arenas.The soundtrack is wacky and fits the theme of the game perfectly. Furthermore, with the addition of level creation and the Steam Workshop, there are dozens of additional content for you to spend hours playing through.This game receives a 10/10 from me. I highly recommend buying this game for you and a friend so that one of you becomes prison food while the other laughs as if he's not next.Battleblock Theater is worth the money, and I would definiteIy buy this game while it's on sale. I guarantee that you will enjoy this game."

In story mode you beat levels, collect gems and use them to buy more playable mini-characters. All characters are pretty much the same, you just collect them as if they were trading cards. So, in short, it's a co-op (preferably) puzzle platformer where you beat increasingly difficult levels and collect funny, albeit useless, mini-characters. Plus, it has a level editor.A must have!"

,Recommended,238460,13061473,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,LS-Kun,"What do you get when you take a puzzle platformer, add in a Lemony Narrator with enough wacky lines to make the Anamaniacs blush, mix it all up with gross and crazy humor, and then garnish it with pinch of HEADS? You'd get a little game called BattleBlock Theater. What's the premise? You and all your friends crash landed on a mysterious island where you are quickly captured by a group of cats who force you to participate in a series of crazy and deadly perils for their entertainment. Now it is up to you to go through every puzzle, collecting gems and yarn, preferably within the time limit, in the hopes of rescuing your friend, Hatty Hattington, and escaping from the island before you are all killed.Pros: I absolutely love the humor in this. The narrator has a great voice, especially for all the crazy stuff that he says, from his unusual fixation on butts and farts to him commenting on smelling beef stew. The puzzles are also complex and can be very difficult to get through as time goes on, so it won't be babying you the entire time. The story is pretty easy to follow and has enough wackiness to it to also make it quite fun. The cinematic animation in this is done with a paper puppet sort of feel to it, which I feel rather fits with how wild it can be. You also have plenty of weapons to use, from blocks of ice to freeze your foes and boomarangs to stun them to grenades and frog bombs to blow them to bits. You also have a lot of heads that you can collect as the game goes on, each one having their own name and personality that you can learn about if you check your item inventory here on Steam. You also have the ability to make your own stages for people to try out, so you aren't just restricted to the levels given to you. And, what can be really fun is playing this game with a friend, whether you be helping one another get through a level or just blowing one another up because you feel like blowing them up.Cons: The humor and style, something that is very much shared with games such as Castle Crashers and others by Behemoth, might not be your forte. It can seem very juvenile at times, especially those about bodily functions. It also becomes tiresome to get all the different heads, which will require a LOT of gems to get, gems that aren't buyable. You have to earn them yourself. And this isn't exactly easy, even on normal mode. Some puzzles can require players to be pain stakingly precise, which is especially frustrating for the few timed missions you have. So be ready to die a number of times.All in all, I really enjoyed this game. I can definitely say that it's not a game for everyone, similar to other Behemoth games, but if you ever get the chance to try it out, it's definitely worth a shot. Try watching playthroughs of it, you'll get a fairly good idea on what you're in for. But I personally loved it and will happily play more."

I played the game to completion and it never failed to put a smile on my face. I obtained all of the circle heads and all of the square heads before starting on the other head shapes. This game entertained me for hours. When I ran out of things to do (which took a long time) I stopped playing every day and I began playing new games.Then - after a few months - I heard that the game was coming to steam and my love for this amazing game was rekindled, I was happy to pick this up on the summer sale and get back playing. My only problem with the steam version is the controls, playing this game with a keyboard feels un-natural to BBT; however this problem can be resolved by using a controler which I highly recommend.The trading system is better than I had expected it to be, being able to trade singular heads and items for other in-game items or trading cards. Each item also has a description delivering a smile or a slight chuckle to the person who gives time to read, this game being on steam has allowed some of my friends - who use playstation - to play and experience this delight.Although I have not played it for long on steam, I have experience with the Xbox edition and I say that this game is well worth it. It would definately be in my top 10 games due to the addictive gameplay and hilarious commentary by stamper."

From the plucky little story, to  the suprising violence of this seemingly cute game, or even the hilarious scumbaggery of the multiplayer. I have around 50 hours in this game and every time I play it i notice somethign new and lovely about Tom Fulpe's ultimate masterpiece.

(note: I still find rooms all of the time, usually it is only 1 or 2 at a time though)Host's Wifi may determin your smoothness of gameplay______________________________________Overall, I give it an 8.5/10 (great game), I would probably say 8.8-9.2/10, but I haven't had too much playtime to fully experience this adventure.

Unlike other games, you don't need to practice for hours and hours to be good at online matches.  Two hours tops is all the practice you'll need to be a worthy opponent.  The game itself is also amazing, with so many vanilla levels, and much more workshop levels to keep the game fresh.  It has an easy to use level maker where you can make your own levels for the workshop.  Online play can be a bit bad when you run into an annoying player, and the syncing isn't the greatest.The game is at it's best when you gather a whole bunch of friends irl and play local multiplayer together"

Each puzzle is significantly unique from one another, allowing the player to sense the different between scenes and it keeps the player on their toes when searching for elusive gems.

76561198110546006,Recommended,238460,30626179,Posted: 19 March,all,cookiecruncha,"This game is the third brainchild of those weird and wonderful game developers known as The Behemoth. Centered around puzzles and platforming, you find yourself having to jump, bounce, dash, punch and fight for your life when everyone's favourite best friend is forced to run the hostile Battleblock Theater, by angry sentient cats.That's the most about this game that I can say without spoiling you senseless. I could do worse.I could point out that the commentary of Will Stamper is the only thing to comfort you when you get blown to bits.I could point out how nearly every community-created level can be played only for LOLs and not for more loot to collect.I could point out how many of the story mode levels seem to be designed deliberately to test your patience.I could point out how many of the unlockable heads are just plain weird, even by The Behemoth's standards.(These are from the same guys who invented Newgrounds, but still, would you play as a character who looks like he is constipated? Check Captain Crysanthemum on the steam market, you'll get what I mean.)But aside from such minor quibbles, I enjoyed Battleblock Theater a lot. These guys seem to have mastered the formula of creating a challenging but addictive platformer. If I had not completed the main story on my own, in a matter of months, I'd probably still be playing it right now.Oh, now that I think about it, me being late on the bandwagon might explain why there's hardly ever anyone who wants to join in with online play. If it were not for the lack of staying power this game seems to have, things might have been different. The arena mode is a good way to play with friends (before your relationships sour like they do in MarioKart, LOL).If you want to give the game a try, then I won't stop you. Paying for it at full price may be a bit of a stretch with so few people still seeking online play, but even then, it is quite a fun challenge while it lasts."

The narrator is great, adding a huge amount of humour to the game - Be sure to change your narrator settings to blabbermouth; He'll yell insanity at you almost every time you die, and it almost makes all the death worth it. The art style is really great and simple, which really fits the game and adds to it's enjoyableness. It's also great to play with friends, but doesn't lose too much quality single player."

76561198062521561,Recommended,238460,14797973,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,snurfsnarf,"Alright, so there are a few bases I'd like to cover in this review.  The most important thing is a USB Gamepad.  If you don't own one, I highly recommend purchasing one, not only for this game but for Steam games in general.  BattleBlock Theater recommends using a controller, and I second the notion.  I do have a couple friends who play with the keyboard, but I personally can't get used to it.So, how's the game?  Well, it's a 2D platformer with both familiar and new elements, and a surprising amount of depth.  It's a fairly difficult game, especially for completionists, but it's engaging enough to keep players from giving up easily.  Where the game really shines, however, is in its co-op gameplay.  BattleBlock Theater supports two-player local and online co-op, and boy is it fun.  While the game can be played in singleplayer, it was clearly designed with co-op in mind.  I highly recommend purchasing a copy for a friend to truly enjoy what this game has to offer.  The co-op will simultaneously bring friends together and tear them apart in a fantastic paradoxical combination.  And as if all this wasn't enough, the game even has a level editor.  Let your creativity run wild.BattleBlock Theater was originally released on a console, so how well does it port to PC?  Well, simply using a controller can basically emulate the functionalities of the console version, and menus support navigation via mouse if that's how you roll.  As mentioned earlier, playing with the keyboard is not recommended, but might still be worth a try if it's your only option.  The most significant port issue, in my opinion, is the level editor.  Creating levels with the mouse is generally easier than using the controller, but the interface can feel a little awkward at times.  It is still fully functional, and creating levels is a huge joy, but it still feels like it could be done a bit better.  Don't let that deter you from enjoying the level editor, though.All in all, this game is an awesome and enjoyable co-op platformer with enough features and community interaction to keep you coming back again and again.  If you're still not sold, this game features the glorious voice acting of Stamper.  What's not to love?EDIT: I think Hatty needs a hug."

The graphics are really fantastic and i could see that just from the main menu and also the gameplay i knew they would be fantastic as they were in Castle Crashers(added bonus hatty is now in Castle Crashers if you got at least 1 achievement in that game! :D). The gameplay of the game is very addictive and its hard to not play this game as its a platformer thats full of action and its really fun in single player and co-op as in co-op you can throw your buddys to higher places to get to a switch but you could also throw them into goo or water etc. by accident so that can be funny :),speaking of funny the commentator adds a lot of comedy to the game also as his phrases just fit into the game and i think he is really great at his job as he says things like ""of all places you die there"" he is reallly brilliant and does an really awesome job :). Theres also other modes like arena where you can play a variety of modes with buddies or other onliners 2 of my favriotes are time trials and ball game and you can be on same team as your buddy or compete but either way you still collect a lot of gems which is awesome and a good excuse to revisit arena mode to collect more gems :) i also find it really fun to collect the gems and the yarn and discover secrets/shortcuts in all levels they are so collectible :) this game is a top seller and to be honest i can really see why and expected it to be a top seller Castle Crashers snd Alien Hominid were probably top sellers as they do a really awsome job on there games and i wasn,t in the beta but the beta was sucessful i believe :) they gave steam beta testers the game for free but gave people who weren't in the beta(like me) got 30% launch week and 35% loyalty discount if you have Castle Crashers so i got 35% off thanks to that which i think is genorous + kind of them to do as the game at full price is £11.99 but getting it for £7 was great i,d get at full price but still :D if you can you should defo get this game you won,t regret its a game where you,ll say just 1 more level but you end up doing more its well worth the money and im so glad they this and Castle Crashers were added to steam due to all the features,content,graphics etc. well worth the money (ps over 400 levels and also over 300 prisoners to free and of course weapons and the ability to switch between the 2 and tons of community levels this game is endless with that added) :D"

Play by yourself or with friends. With it's extremely responsive mechanics and challenging maps this game is really fun. If you like platformers and laughing it is definitely the game for you. Music is fitting but not anything substantial. Art style is very comical and will have you giggling as you work your way through the maps.-Personal Experience-Honestly I'm already hooked on this game, and I've only been playing for about an hour. It has been an amazing hour of laughs and trying super hard to run through the levels as fast as I can collecting ALL the gems. The comedy is really well put, I think this game (by itself) has made me laugh more than any other game I've ever owned.The movement is what you would expect from a platformer, and there are plenty of hilarious obstacles. I also thought the level editor looked cool, haven't touched it.The Art looks like it came straight from the internet with all the funny lookin' faces.Also the narrators voice, and comedic timing is perfect, I should say.All in all it is a very enjoyable game by yourself, and much more fun with a good friend.

It's not a lie when I say you'll literally be holding onto the ceiling and acting like Tarzan as you make your way through some of the more challenging puzzles. If you love sidescrolling 2d platformers with puzzles this is definitely a game well worth buying and playing. Seriously, why are you reading this? How have you not bought the game yet!? Buckle your pants because it's going to be quite the ride."

You are imprisoned on this strange island and forced to find gems and yarn to escape to your next act. It's a unique concept i'll tell you that. You are pretty much forced to perform, and hopefully, not die, until you can rescue your dear friend, Hatty Hattington. Not only is the Solo and Co-op fun, but you should give the arena a try. The arena is very fun with varieties of mini-games. Not to mention already that the community for this game is awesome. There are many people that create level packs for anyone to play and there is always tons of people wanting to play with others. In the least, you'll enjoy this one. In the most, you'll love it. Bottomline, If you came to see what The Behemoth has been up to, you might as well get this one too. If you have Castle Crashers, you'll get some exclusive heads and such.

This game blew my expectations out of the water when I first started playing. In between screaming, crying and shouting ""Whaaaaaa?!"" I got hooked on this game.Twice as fun with a friend, and up to four times the fun if you fill the four person game with friends. Uterly hilarious to connect with random people, who you can't comunicate with at all, and watch them try to figure out what you are doing and vice versaThere is about the same level of story as in Castle Crashers, which is just enough reason to keep going. But the levels are so fun that you don't even care about the story. You just want to keep on playing.I would fully recomend this game to anyone who enjoys fun games that aren't very serious, anyone who is fond of playing in coop with friends and anyone who likes to laugh at their characters getting thrown into spikes and lava time and time again."

,Recommended,238460,26516073,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,RyderFPS (changed profiles),"Why I Spend Most of My Money on Indie Games.  9.6/10BattleBlock Theater is an indie game developed byThe Behemoth, the creators ofCastle Crashers.  Released on the Xbox Live Arcade on April 3, 2013, and on PC on May 15, 2014.BattleBlock Theater is a simple to understand, but less simple to complete, platformer-puzzle game that can be played singleplayer, or multiplayer.The storyline, albeit strange, is fairly well written and does tie into the gameplay nicely.The story begins with you and hundreds of your friends, which includes everyone's mutual best friend, Hatty Hattington, sailing the ocean on the S.S. Friendship.  Due to a large storm, the S.S. Friendship wrecks and everyone is washed up on an island.  You and the squad are taken prisoner by large mobster cats, with something terrible happening to a good friend of yours.  You are then put through trials, or tests, for the cat's amusement, collecting gems, balls of yarn, and the occasional Golden Hat.""Oh no! This isn't going to be good. Clench your butt! AHHHHHHHH""Combining the fantastically written dialogue, the talented voice of Newgrounds contributor, Will Stamper, and the silly popsicle stick puppets, every cutscene is one that will have you laughing hard enough you'll be ""pooping yourself to death on the way to the bathroom"".  The witty one liners and nonsensical sentences had me laughing, even when the cutscene ended and I started playing the game again.  One of my favorites has to be, ""Even the word 'hopeless' has the word 'hope' in it! And if you rearrange the letters it spells 'peeslosh!'""The cartoony art style makes you feel like a kid againSo many games today are trying to create a realistic feel.  When you start playing BattleBlock Theater, the vibrant colors, and silly animations make your heart feel giddy and excited.  It allows you to take a step away from the realistic shooters or intense MOBAs and have a good laugh while basically playing an interactive cartoon.Addicting music and an impressive Scat SoloBattleBlock Theater features user-generated music from the Newgrounds community.  With an old swing feel, mixed with synth, the soundtrack of this game is by far one of my favorites.  It has very memorable beats and melodies that will get stuck in your head for hours on end.Team building exercise, whilst tearing your friendship apart.Like most Co-op games, especially puzzle games, teamwork and coordination between players is crucial.  You can play through the main storyline with a buddy and try to A++ everything, or you can screw with each other accidentally and have a good laugh until it's been three hours and what they think is ""funny"" makes you want to commit heinous crimes.  BattleBlock Theater also allows you and your friends to play in 8 different multiplayer game modes giving you hours upon hours of fun.40 hours in, $15 to purchase, $0.38 per hourI have spent 40 hours playing this game, and I still end up coming back to it when I don't know what I really want to play, or if I only have 15 minutes to spare.  I've beaten the game all the way through once, and I am currently going back through it trying to A++ every level.  Then after that, I still have the Insane difficulty to play through and then A++.  So that's another 40+ hours of great gameplay waiting for me.  I would highly recommend this game to you and your buddies."

I absolutely love the cutscenes because for me they were kind of an incentive to keep on playing and every word from our fellow narrator is just pure poetry to my heart and ears. Battleblock Theater is one of those games that makes me laugh harder and harder the further I play and it's something that shouldn't be ignored.Oh, the platforming and the puzzles don't cause me to pull my hair, so that's a good thing (unless you're playing with one of those friends that love to see you drown, zapped, get eaten alive, and all those lovely things)."

The amount of replayability in this game is absurd!

The Campaign is fantastic, mainly because of the expertly done comedic cutscenes. The visuals given in the strange cardboard puppet show format help add to the amazing voice work done by Will Stamper, who is also the narrator throughout. But the multiplayer is where this game really shines. I reccomend playing this game over a skype call with 3 other friends for maximum hilarity. The rage this game will bestow upon everyone (especially in multiplayer modes like capture the horse and soccer) is staggering, and I think watching and listening to everyone lose their minds and have the hate flow through them is singlehandedly the thing that keeps me coming back to this game the most.10/10 would throw chair again"

You have up to 320 diffrent skins, the story mode is difficult and challenging as all the games should be, the puzzles are inteligent and overall i can only remember fun and laughs while playing this in my mom's house in my vacation. Got the soundtrack on spotify and got completely stuck in my mind. You can create your own avatar (steam has all the guides) and create your own levels to put online or challenge your friends. The level editor mode is as fun as the game itself, and the versus mode has more then 10 tipes of minigames, like the good old mario party, with 'king of the hill"", ""best man alive"" ""capture the flag"" and all those modes that will crack your friends up. It became one of my favorite games, im totally not parcial in this. I don't even know what im doing here anymore.

It contains VERY hard puzzlles and platforming by the third level. The co-op system is fantastic my friend and I have a blast killing each other over again, while completing levels, that were all remade to be harder in co-op. The story in this game is entertaining, silly, and pure awesome, one of my favorite stories in video games. The only problem I have with this game is if you play it for a long time it starts to get a little repetitive. All in all, i give it a 9/10, for these reasons, fun gameplay, great co-op, fantastic humor, challenging levels,  awesome story. I had to take a point off for the repetiveness. I did have to buckle my pants."

I've played both on Xbox360 and on PC and I have to say, this game is among the most hillariously fast paced side scroller platformers I have ever played.The game is silly, it's supposed to be over the top insane, and I wouldn't expect anything less from the creators of Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid. I remember back when they started Alien Hominid, they've really kicked it up a few thousand notches!The gameplay is tight and the mechanics are loopy and hillarious. The game is hard to get frustrated with because everything that happens on screen has a comedic quality about it. I have yet to find the game to be truely repetitive, but I have only played up to the second stage for now. I'll definitely update this once I've completed the game. But the multi-player really sets this game apart from the rest. Nothing is more fun than forcing your friend to drown or die a horrific deathrepeatedly......What?It's a game.You want a fast paced casual that the whole family can enjoy? Want something to play with your non-video game inclined significant other? This game fits perfectly in 99.9999% of the ""do want"" categories, that it's not even funny (Really though, this game is hillarious fun for the whole family). Don't forget! It has support for up to 5 simultaneous oculuses*, video cart mega ram throttling*, 1000000000P video* and super awesome amazing extreme texture 9000K HD graphics*. It's future proof!**Note game does not actually support these features because it would be too awesome and blow your mind.Seriously, if you're on the fence about getting this game, just.get it. This is a fun title that everyone should have in their library."

It's simple, funny, full of plenty to do, and sports a very entertaining cooperative mode, with cooperation certainly being optional. The level editor offers a great set of easy to use tools, which fits well with the fairly straight-forward and simple design philosophy of the game; player characters are mostly made out of simple shapes and levels are made out of basic blocks. The levels themselves are interesting and fairly well varied with plenty of solid platforming moments. The ""combat"" is a little finicky, but luckily it is not central to gameplay. The game can start to feel a bit repetitive at times. However, it feels appropriate to play the game in chunks of 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there rather than playing for hours on end.All and all, another unique and comedic title by The Behemoth that's certainly worth a look in this reviewer's opinion."

Levels are modified depending on how many players tackle them.There is no penalty for death, which encourages trial-and-error exploration, as well as throwing your friend into a fiery pit to get that last gem.Go do the thing where they get your money."

They tried to scam people with the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" Bundle where the price of bundle of Castle Crashers + Battleblocks Theathre costs more than buying them individually ($7.50 for the bundle vs $3.75 + $1.50 = $5.25 individual buy).PROS1. Easy to playJump, slide, call a pig, call a boat, attack. Very easy to play.2. Co-opLittle or no lag and you get to toss your friend3. StorySilly but funny.4.CONS1. No PS4 Controller supportWorks for Castle Crashers not for BBT.2. Redundant backgroundsThe same background just before each boss level which does nothing and every level has the same theatre background with the 13 doors. Makes you feel extremely bored looking at the same thing over and over again.3. Lousy MatchmakingYou can hardly find a game online. Quite empty surprisingly.4.

This game has great controls that will make the game much less frustraiting than some other platformers. It has an amusing, fun, and indeed ridiculous story line, very well made levels, and don't forget that if you get bored with the main storyline, there are more than enough minigames to keep you glued to the monitor.

The level layout changes to suit the method of play and there is endless replay value due to level editors/etc. The storyline and narration are absolutely hilarious due to their over-the-top nature, which I enjoy, not to say everyone will, however, the commentary continues during the play of the level, where when you die the commentator taunts you in a way reminiscient of GladOs.Pros: hilarious storyline, gameplay works well, endless replay value, full controller support, local and online multiplayer available.Cons: the game can feel a bit tedious at times, since the goal is essentially the same: grab the gems, get to the exit.All in all, It's definitely worth 3.74, I bought it on sale last Winter Sale and I'd definitely say that it's worth that. Depends on your taste though. If you like games that overexaggerate the humour, and I quote: ""It was as if Poseidon himself reached his hand out in friendship and you spat in his mouth.""

There are way too many glitches which can p1ss just about everyone off (and just about everyone has seen these glitches because just about half of the people who still play this game are pro players who exploit these glitches, and the other half are people who are victims of these glitches).Glitches may include:-On an online match of muckle, people can respawn repeatedly in one place and thus can be spawn killed nomatter what.-On ball game, you can jump on front of the goal and press ""Y"" or ""Ctrl"" to immediately score a goal.-On ball game, if you spike the ball in the general direction of the goal while you are close to it and someone is coveringit, it will go through their body and score a goal.-On a few multiplayer maps some unfortunate player can get killed at just the right place and spawn inside a closed inarea that is designed for controlling blocks on the map and face almost certain death due to there being a saw movingback and forth.-There are also a few invincibility glitches, and at least one way to be permanently on fire in the gift shop (weak againstice though) which makes for a very intense troll.-If you press ""RT"" or ""W"" while holding the ball from ballgame your character will freeze like a statue.... that's only to list a couple...Disregarding the loads of glitches that need to be patched, this is an overall great game! the story mode is well balanced, and the game modes are unique and fun!

I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. It was surprisingly difficult at parts (especially if you're a completionist) and might make you want to kill yourself as you cry tears of anger and potentially break vital parts of your computer. Is that a bad thing? No. Sure, some could argue that incredibly difficult platformers are a tad overdone, but none of them hold the charm or crude humor that this title throws at you as much as it possibly can. I loved every moment of it. Online multiplayer is a bit lackluster unless you're playing through the campaign, however. And on the note of bad sides, the game might start to feel monotonous eventually, so you'll have to put it down at certain intervals. One last thing- in certain levels you will find questionable enemy placement, but its nothing seriously major, especially if you're not playing on the hardest difficulty.I got this game on sale, and if I had to, I would've payed the full price. I believe this game earns a 7.5/10 for getting a bit repeititious, but doing everything otherwise right."

,Recommended,238460,17013794,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,sarysa,"What bad can you possibly say about a labor of love from the same indie Newgrounds group that brought us Castle Crashers? Battleblock Theater is a puzzle platformer, with less emphasis on combat and more on puzzles. The story is ridiculous, the narration is ridiculous, the music is ridiculous, and that's what makes it awesome. Not to mention it's pretty inexpensive and any bugs that exist are minor. If you find certain puzzles difficult to complete, by the time you get to that point you've probably unlocked the green bubble goo gun (which allows you to jump up to 5 tiles high) and the hat-plunger? gun, which allows you to scale walls. There are other sequence break weapons as well, but those are the two that are least likely to get you killed by the omnipresent environmental hazards in the later levels. Though in spite of these, all collectibles and secrets can be reached without these. Adding deliberate mechanics to the game which allow sequence breaking is probably one of the reasons this game made it to AGDQ so quickly.I have one minor complaint, and it's that level selection is a chore once you've unlocked everything. It takes over a minute just to walk to level 8...you always start in the first room of the level select area. It's annoying when you're trying to pop in for a short, 10 minute session.Oh, and despite the prominent ""we recommend the controller"" graphic when you start up the game, it plays just fine on a keyboard. I use a WASD and numpad control scheme with my Logitech G110 keyboard and I've had no issues."

It is the perfect mix off all those great platform games that you can think of such as Super Meat Boy, Splosion Man and N / N+. The game has the artstyle of Castle Crashers as it was made by the same developer The Behemoth, but ups it in everyway from the level designs of the theatre to the individual heads that you can unlock, trade and sell.The cutscenes alone are worth dropping $15 USD from the hilarious voice over, with the wacky animations. The narrator is one of the strongest parts of this game as he is always talking over what you are doing in the game especially if you are in the middle of a very tense difficult level, he cracks out a joke trying to distract you and send you back to your last check point.I am never good with reviews as I want to say so much I end up saying very little as I don't want to be to wordy. I am about half way through the game and loving every minute with every chapter throwing new elements into the game, continuously making the game feel fresh.The Behemoth are the pinacle of Indie Developers never disapointing anyone who purchases their game. If you want a fun game with great humor, great writing, fun gameplay, coop, pvp, collecting items.I am always horrible at writing reviews but this game is the best platformer in recent years and worth the money even if it is not on sale.

Basically, you collect Gems and then buy people. each perso has a unique head. you can then wear it at anytime. Kind of like CS:GO but in this, the skins don't make you money poor. They make you gem poor. The levels are also extremely well done!All in All,9.8/10"

It's really funny, like in that stupid sense of humor of inside jokes with your friends stuff. And, is a very creative and exploratious game. It encourages you to find gems, they are vital the the story.THE STORY: (Your Character) and about 100 friends board the S.S. Friendship, and set sail to, well, be friends. Out of all the friends is the most friendly, Hatty Hattington, who wears a very classy hat and is recognizable. Your ship is caught in a storm and swept out to a island where mean cat guards rule, and Hatty seems to be corrupted as he now works with the bad cat guys. It is up to you to save your friends and Hatty by escaping dastardly mazes and platforms!This game is fun, frustrating, and awesome. Completionists like me will find all the gems and stuff. Good luck!Muliplayer also included, but who cares?9/10- A excellent choice in gaming."

But when I found out it was on Steam, I instantly bought it. I only have 5.9 hours, but I played the Xbox version so much I think I have a very clear verdict:This game is amazing!!! Incredibly fun, hilarious and charismatic. The game itself shouldn't take longer than 2-3 weeks to complete, but there's still much more to do. Co-Op, multiplayer VS matches, building your own stages to ruin friendships. I won't say much about the story, other than it's completely nonsensical and bizarre.To get the most out of BBT, I recommend an Xbox 360 controller for maximum enjoyment. If you've thought getting the game, DO!!! But be warned.......the story has 8 different chapters, and they get increasingly difficult. 6 and 7 especially so. 8 not so much, but that's probably because you're used to the game at this point. But if you're still not satisfied......You give a cat some yarn and he gives you an exploding frog.SCORE OUT OF 10: 9.0/10"

Seriously the opening intro is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a game, and indeed any media. It will depend on your style of humour, I suspect, but for me it was just hilarious.The gameplay itself is non too shabby either, starting with the basics to settle you in but quickly providing a challenge that just about manages to fall on the right side of frustration and rage, though at times it will certainly threaten your ability to keep your composure. Later levels could be described as fiendish but you always seem to finish each level on that one last go, where being forced to do it one more time would doubtlessly end in a panicked scramble to find another working controller or mouse.I'd also argue that the game ends at about the right time as well. It never feels too repetitive as each chapter is different in its dangers and enemies, and just about manages not to outstay its welcome, though if the game were any longer it might start to drag.It is a game I would say is best played for no more than an hour at a time; any more tends to get a bit too much. That isn't a bad thing as such, some games are just like that and this is certainly one that is best enjoyed in short bursts.I would recommend anyone who enjoys silly humour in games to buy this. For the type of game it is I would say to pay £5 at most, but I've always been frugal and personally I picked it up in a previous sale for less than £3, IIRC, and it is worth every penny.I have only played the main solo storyline, I will add. I did have 15 minutes playing some online 2vs2 arenas or free-for-alls but I've never really been in to online gaming that much. I suspect for those of you who do enjoy that side of things, that another sackful of hours can easily be spent either mercilessly killing strangers or working together with them.All in all, it's a thoroughly enjoyable game, it's humour is fantastic and raised a smile on more than just a few occasions, the gameplay is just about the right level of difficulty and it has cats. Evil cats. And hats."

I'm already at stage four.So.This uh...this platformer.I got it under the impression that it was quite funny.The impression couldn't've been more correct. Its a silly platformer that introduces new blocks almost per level.The narrator is amusing as well.The main villians are cats.I hate cats.I love dogs.Fix it.You can find balls of yarn that you can then hock over for weapons to use within the levels.What do they do? Who knows. the game never explains it to you.They're worthless anyway. I can get through any level without them.Some guard cats exist to simply get in your way and smack you about (But they do not kill you. Its worth noting that.)In general whatever kills you also kills them.And apparently there are some melee moves you can use to dispatch the cats.What are they and how do I activate them? Who knows. The game never tells you about the melee moves nor explains how they work. I only know they're in there because of an achivement I'll never get, asking you to master all 100 melee moves.Is it fun? Yes.Does it old after a while? Heck yes.Is the platforming good? Yes.Do I hate cats?

Controls are simple, with the game largely consisting of running, jumping and punching. Levels are made up of various types of blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes, and also feature hazards such as water and deadly creatures.Sporting an interesting story, the game actually feels like a mix of Super Mario Bros. and Sonic the Hedgehog. You run around the Mario Bros. levels while collecting Green Chaos Emeralds. You can either play Story Mode or any various Online Multiplayer Modes.When you collect enough gems, you can Free the Prisoners or “Unlock” different uhh…. Heads... for your character to wear. When you collect enough Balls of Yarn, you can Bribe one of the Security Guards for new weapons to help you win the game.The game is fun, but, it feels just a tiny bit generic.

This is basically Behemoth's take on the Platformer genre. First, they made a shoot em' up game, now they made a beat em' up game, now it's a Platformer.  Battleblock Theater is a really great game. My only note here is that you must buy a USB controller for your computer as just in like Castle Crashers, you need a USB controller. The keyboard controls are ok but just buy a USB controller. The levels are kinda easy, though I'll accept it as I'm just in Chapter 3. If you do beat the game easily, the game contains great replayability such as Furbottom's Features, Community Theater, a Level Maker, and really good multiplayer gamemodes! I don't really have many things to say about this game so the final score is a 10/10. REALLY GREAT!"

Don't take the story serious because it isn't. The strengh of this game is the narrator, he makes jokes and comments on what is happening in an entertaining way, which makes playing really fun.What makes the game fun as well is the character customisation, you unlock new faces by spending jems and get weapons for balls of strings, each weapon is different and has its on use for PvP(multiplayer 2-4) and normal plattformer level, which has multiplayer (up to 2 players) as well. The different faces look cool, funny, weird or all combined, which makes it really hard to choice, which one you want to wear.The story isn't that long, 6-10 hours, but for people, who want to play more there are 21 encore levels, which are really difficult and time limited, also each level can be mastered with an A++ rank, which takes a few replays and are often challenging or even very difficultto get.Overall a funny and rewarding plattformer."

Controls are tight enough for fast paced platforming with silly yet challenging levels. Overral the levels are easy but prove tricky when trying to get rating of A++.Music suits the atmosphere and I honestly can't remember last time I had ""fun"" playing a puzzle platformer.I haven't touched the co-op or arena modes but if you have friendfaces and want your fists to meet their faces this should be a game for you. For silly times.One thing that I wasn't aware before buying was that the levels are short and you have lot's of checkpoints so the game isn't as punishing as super meat boy or other puzzle platformers. These forementioned puzzles are quite simple so don't be afraid of that.Overral BattleBlock Theater is a game for those that like casual platformers, speedrunning platformers, for completionists and for those that have those REAL FRIENDS (or internet friends for that matter) for co-op cravings."

This game is for those times when you've got friends over or when your friends want to annoy you from far away. You cant enjoy this game by yourself and make sure to play with a friend you know closely. You will blackmail, threaten and bribe eachother through each level just because this game is built that way. Its not meant to be played with dead serious people but instead people who would leave for 5 minutes in the middle of the game just to annoy you.Its frustrating, funny but NOT a good singleplayer experience.Buy only if you have a friend willing to play. . . ."

When you collect enough gems the exit opens and you can proceed to the next level.  Depending on how many items you collect and how fast you complete the round depends on the score you get at the end.  It's pretty simple.  And obviously the levels get more challenging as you go.  But the fun part of the game is the cartoony animations and the funny narrator.  The narrator makes the game in my opinion.  This is a great time-killer game and very fun with friends.ProsComical NarratorGameplayAnimationEasy for anyone to play but gets more challengingUnlock customizations for your characterUnlock weaponsConsAs soon as you read the title 'BattleBlock Theater' you should have started playing it.

I hate playing with strangers, and finding friends to play local coop isn't too easy for me.My worst complaint about the game is being unable to clear your cloud save, and not able to play with a local save that can be cleared. I played it once or twice a few years ago. I come back to it and I can't get a fresh start. That option is literally not built into the game.It's great for multiplayer if you've got people to play with, but as a single player game, I'll have to suggest passing on it."

Weapons can also be bought, found and bought with real money on the market. Thankfully, the game is generous with this and it isn't P2W in any way.Lights, Camera, Action!Let's talk about the level design. Levels in BBT are made withfinesse, thinking, and just plain love. Sir Harry Hattington has built an elaborate deathcourse live on stage for you to traverse, with some of the most intuitive and ninja-ery ways to finish.

76561198067964464,Recommended,238460,32850170,Posted: 27 June,all,cmaexi,"All Behemoth games have featured laughs, usually in the form of sight-gags and others jokes lurking beneath the surface. Battleblock Theater brings this humor to the forefront, and it successfully permeates the entire experience – from the narrator’s manic opening monologue to the multiple songs that play over the end credits. The writing mixes poop jokes with pop-culture references, punctuated by higher-brow, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it self-referential humor. Between-world cutscenes in most platformers are good opportunities to get up and grab a snack. Here, they’re a highlight.When your ship full of friends (BBT makes sure to point out that this is a true ""friend ship,"" har har) crashes onto an island jail run by intelligent cat guards, your only choice is to platform through 80+ levels for their feline amusement. It sounds crazy, written out... but it works. The Behemoth fully commits to the premise and has a ton of fun with it. Balls of yarn hidden in each stage can be redeemed in a prison black market for power-ups. The narrator promises “sandpaper kisses” for doing well.You command your customizable prisoner with standard platforming controls – jump, double-jump, wall-jump… nothing out of the ordinary. Everything feels snappy and responsive, and I rarely felt like the controls betrayed me and caused my death, even in the hairiest segments. But BattleBlock Theater’s moment-to-moment movement doesn’t compare favorably to recent 2D platforming greats like Super Meat Boy. Movement is a little stiffer, the physics a little less intuitive.The simple hand-to-hand combat system is more disappointing. You can dispatch enemies (or fellow players in multiplayer) with simple punches, kicks, and special attacks, but it lacks the precision found in the jumping. With no real attack priority, combat rapidly devolves into random button-mashing. Luckily, the bulk of the single-player campaign focuses on spot-on jumps and not enemy cat combat.BattleBlock Theater’s wildly inventive stage design is undoubtedly its greatest draw. It offers up some of the most clever, satisfying, and varied 2D platforming in years. Eight worlds are loosely sorted into gameplay themes, each stage building and tweaking ideas established in the previous one. My favorite set of stages are all designed to force two runs – once with a (relatively) easier set of challenges, and then a second time after hitting a trigger to activate lasers, disappearing blocks, roving saw blades, or some other added bit of trickiness. No idea is used twice; if an idea does repeat it’s sufficiently escalated to really put your platforming skills to the test.Stages alternate between pure Super Meat Boy-style skill and puzzle-platforming ala Braid or Toki Tori – sometimes within a few moments of each other. The variety is welcome and well-executed, and does a great job of propelling you from stage to stage. But the platforming feels better in other games, and the puzzling is lacking a hook like Braid’s time mechanics – it’s mostly pushing blocks.BattleBlock Theater doubles down on its jack-of-all-trades nature in its sheer ridiculous size. This is a truly gigantic game, guaranteed to keep completionists busy for literally dozens of hours. After clearing the seven- or eight-hour campaign, you still have 24 tossed-in-just-because bonus stages (three per world) to run through. Each stage also has a gold-medal time and eight hidden collectibles, all of which are needed for the coveted A++ score. These doodads aren’t afterthoughts, either, as most are hidden behind clever mini-puzzles or optional platforming sections. After all that’s done, true masochists can do it all again on Insane Mode – a difficulty that removes the generously placed mid-stage checkpoints. Whew!This would already be an incredible amount of content, but The Behemoth decided to throw in the kitchen sink while they were at it. A complete set of level-authoring tools is also included, letting anyone create and share their own custom creations. Curated playlists of the best fan-made levels are promised for months to come.And that's just the single-player portion. BattleBlock Theater also includes a robust collection of cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes via local play or Xbox Live Arcade. Multiplayer, especially the seven competitive Arena modes, doesn’t ever feel like more than an added-on curiosity, though. I enjoyed the frantic fun of knocking opponents off my turf in King of the Hill, but the iffy combat controls make it unlikely that these modes will be more than one-and-done diversions. Some of the other platforming-centered multiplayer options, such as level races, feel like they have much more potential for longer-term fun.The VerdictBattleBlock Theater’s lack of focus keeps it from being a true XBLA great, but this platformer still kept a smile on my face from beginning to end. Extremely clever and inventive stage design, a well-honed difficulty curve, and wealth of extras and bonuses make it another winner for The Behemoth. Who knew keeping cats entertained could be so harrowing, and so fun?"

You get an extra discount for BattleBlock Theater. Breaking down to $9.74 instead of 13.50, currently."

THere are also tons of game modes to play online with random people or with your friends. You can also create your own levels that you or anyone else can try out.

This led to me buying the game.Although I haven't played the game extensively, I've played enough to say that overall this game is very good and is fun to play,  and has elements of humour scattered throughout. The character customisation is especially good as it lets you modify the core elements of the character's body and items it carries quickly, unlike most customisation menus I have seen. In addition, there is a lot of replay value in this game as there are plenty of levels and game modes to keep you busy, and a chance to improve your 'grades' for the game stages by replaying them.Overall, Battleblock Theatre is a very good platformer with the correct ingredients for fun, so it gets a grade B+ from me."

,Recommended,238460,21036106,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Ian Beale,"Firstly, I love this game because you can drive all over Europe. You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree."

,Recommended,238460,14088520,"Posted: 20 January, 2015",all,Joaten,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?""We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for whites only.""We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims' pride, from ev"

The writing is hilarious with several laugh out loud moments, even if the plot is one of the most insane things I've ever seen.  (it's supposed to be though, so it gets a pass.)Pros:-Tight platforming controls, could be tighter, but any problems with the platforming aren't the fault of the controls.-It's the art style you expect.  It works, and is well done.-Lots of level variety, including differences in the multiplayer and single player versions of levels.-Some well done puzzle-platforming elements to get elusive gems and yarn.Cons:-The collision is a bit off, especially for the hazards in the levels.  You can set them off and die from them without even clearly touching them.-The checkpoint system, especially in multiplayer levels, can be VERY buggy.  Getting sent back halfway across a level even though you've hit several checkpoints since then can be rage inducing on the timed levels.  There's nothing like having a solid run, screwing up once and having the whole thing shot because the game wiggs out and sends you 3 checkpoints back.-The combat controls can be a little clunky, but are thankfully not needed often."

The value of this game comes not from the actual gameplay, as honestly, it's just a stripped down, flashier version of super meat boy with less reliable controls. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay isn'tBadit's just no anything special. The goal is to collect gems in a platformer level while beating the clock and finding hidden treasures. The levels are short and getting an A++ Rating on the first handful is not hard, and feels pretty rewarding to be honest.While we're on the topic of the levels, this is where the game's charm comes in: The atmosphere and design. Everything from the hilarious cut-scenes to the fascinating ""set-design"" has me entertained, a strong point for the game is the announcer, who comments on almost everything you do, from simple lines like ""Wow, you got them all!"" to ""Don't mess up, Don't mess up, Don't mess up, DON'T MESS UP"" while navigating a particularly tricky jumping puzzle. Over all it makes the game fun, immersive, and exciting, hearing the audience clap when you pickup a gem is simply childish fun.The story is told in an entertaining way, but to be honest is a little boring and contrived. I'll be honest, I haven't beaten the game, but so far the story is predictable and dull, almost seems like an afterthought. It's not that the story is awful, it's just average.One more thing worth mentioning is that this game also has steam workshop support and a level editor, I think this is a great idea, although to be honest I haven't touched the level editor yet so I can't comment on how easy it is to use. It's great to get extra value out of your game, as portal 2 showed us with it's level editor and workshop a game can be vastly replayable when you crowd-source the replayability.Dislike: Uninnovative Gameplay.Like: Enthralling Atmosphere and DesignNeutral: StoryLike: Steam Workshop Support / Level Editorbattle blocks is above average, but just barely, it's a good game to get drunk and play with friends, and it's even great for single player if you're the kinda person who enjoys completionism, getting A++ on every level is rewarding and there's a ton of weapon and characters to unlock. I wouldn't pay $15 for it, but honestly, it's not an awful price for the amount of entertainment you could get out of this game, my suggestion would be to buy it on sale.---Battle Blocks is a solid 6/10---"

Brush six 9-inch-round cake pans (or as many 9-inch cake pans as you have, reusing them as necessary) with shortening. Line bottom of each cake pan with parchment paper; brush again and set aside.In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and sugar. Slowly add egg whites and mix until well combined. Add vanilla and mix until fully incorporated. Add flour mixture and milk in two alternating additions, beginning with the flour and ending with the milk. Mix until well combined.Divide batter evenly between six medium bowls. Add enough of each color of food coloring to each bowl, whisking, until desired shade is reached. Transfer each color to an individual cake pan. Transfer to oven and bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 15 minutes (working in batches if necessary).Remove cakes from oven and transfer to a wire rack; let cool for 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto a wire rack; re-invert and let cool completely.Using a serrated knife, trim tops of cakes to make level. Place four strips of parchment paper around perimeter of a serving plate or lazy Susan. Place the purple layer on the cake plate. Spread a scant 1 cup buttercream filling over the first layer with a small offset spatula so it extends just beyond edges. Repeat process with blue, green, yellow, and orange layers.Place the remaining red layer on top, bottom-side up. Gently sweep away any loose crumbs with a pastry brush. Using an offset spatula, cover the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting (also use any of the excess frosting visible between the layers). Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.Using an offset spatula, cover cake again with remaining frosting."

I was shockingly disappointed considering how much I had enjoyed Castle Crashers which seamlessly combined side scrolling arcade and RPG elements.The game is a puzzle platformer with short levels. Your playable character obtains gems and balls of yarn which can be exchanged for in-game prizes and you are given a grade for your performance.  The absurdist humour characteristic of Behemoth Studios is enpointe and is enjoyable. The disappointment arises in the game play which becomes tedious very quickly. The tedium of the game play is compounded by slow reactive controls --crisp controls make the platformer.Overall this game was a solid meh out of ten."

It is a fun platformer where you jump through an obstacle course littered with spikes, rotating sawblades, giant cats, lasers, and more. The cartoonish art style and silly narrator add to the goofy and fun theme of the game. The difficulty curve is light and if you feel it's too easy, there's a hard mode to try as well. There are over 100 courses in the single player story plus a level editor with a few years worth of community maps to download.There is also multiplayer where you can play through a coop story mode, try out downloaded maps, or play some minigames where you murder each other. For the insane collector in you, there are tons of collectible heads to unlock.

I had the same feeling with Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends which I find very similar to this game.To me the repetition lies in the fact that you will repeat this exact pattern all the time: start the game, start the story line, move to the next level, start, the environment is all blocky and every block had a behavior and all the levels share the same layout so everything look so similar. Find all the crystal, exit.On the bright side:I believe the game is more fun in multiplayer. The humour is very cool. The music is great.Overall I think it is an incredibly repetitive game."

,Recommended,238460,18051050,"Posted: 15 September, 2015",all,time to cry #2,"Before you play this game, make sure you have a partner or a friend to play with. I guarantee you it's twice as much fun! My review will also be based on the multiplayer experience I've had rather than single player.STORYThe story is, I'll keep it short and simple without any spoilers,hilarious.I don't know, most of the jokes here are crude and childish but it just sounds so weird, I think it's because of the way the narrator says it. Oh yeah speaking of the narrator, the voice actor was an excellent and perfect choice for this kind of a game.GAMEPLAYYou basically have eight sections consisting thirteen levels (I think) each. All levels are designed to be inside a square box and they're all tougher than they look and demand a mediocore level of teamwork to complete, especially if you're a hardcore gamer and want to collect yarns and emeralds hidden in the levels.There are three types of levels in each section; standard, speedrun and encore. Standard ones are self-explanatory. There is only one speedrun level in the game and as the name suggests, you must complete the level under the given amount of time, and the encore levels are unlocked once you beat it (They're basically the same as speedrun). There are community made levels available as well so it pretty much grants you infinite amount of fun.By collecting yarns and emeralds you get to unlock tons of things which can be addicting for some people. You can buy weapons and tools to help you out in-game with yarns, and you can unlock hundreds of faces with the emeralds.GRAPHICSNow, there really isn't much to say about the graphics since you can pretty much tell by looking at the screenshots. But I wanted to write about it because I thought they were very catchy and cute. I really like the animation of every single thing in this game; from water waves to cats throwing up hairballs. It's so satisfying to look at, seriously."

Like a manchild putting another manchild to sleep, Will Stampers narration manages to soothe players into watching the entirety of the story.The game itself is brilliantly designed, which given the creators backstory of making arcade-style games makes perfect sense. Players hurl and leap around levels using various blocks and objects, find secret blocks, solve puzzles, and other fun things. Death is a slap on the ol metaphorical wrist, you reincarnificate immediatly near a flag or your nearest frenemy fairly close to the fray and alleviating the usual issue with die-a-lot games (repetitively losing progress). Plus, you can usually use your friends corpses as momentary stepping stones. Thus, unlike other platformers you actually have a startlingly high amount of control and movement.Oh, and there are tons of versus maps too. They are fun, if derivitive. Like the story mode, maps vary from boring to intricate hellholes of suffering and misery but normally somewhere inbetween. Weapons are unlocked slowly (or bought on the steam community market for mere pennies) and also vary from boring to downright dangerous. The frog bomb is easily one of my favorites. After awhile, the custimization and loadouts can become so varied it's fantastic.Buy this game, just do it. Especially if you have friends with 360 controllers. In general, Behemoth is a great company worth supporting. I grabbed a keychain from them at comicon years ago, the damn thing still looks like new."

But there are some stupid bugs that just are real easy fixes but their still there. There is no curser lock so half way through a map you will randomly minimize the screen or exit out. Check points won't save ( Which sucks in a hard Side scroll plat former that Is made to make you rage). As well as character glitches like; your will be stuck only going one way and can't make it stop, or you can't use you attacks or tools for no given reason ( which also sucks in a SSP). I wouldn't mind these kind of amiture hour mistakes in a ""Free to Play"" game. But when you pay $20 USD Kinda pisses you off."

As a result if you want to get A++ on a level you have to collect everything over and over again. If they want to make speed a factor then award it for just completing the level quickly, don't make the level as long as possible.2) Some levels have time limits. These are a thousand times worse than regular levels because if you're too slow on regular levels you only miss out on the A++. In these levels if you're too slow you lose everything you've collected and have to repeat the entire level. These levels pretty much made me give up on this game.3) My controller doesn't work with it so I have to use the keyboard. So far this is the only steam game it doesn't work with."

Seriously; they amp the difficulty up artificially by actually hiding the objectives half the time, and it's impossible to get anything higher than a passing 'B' grade, leaving me thinking ""Well, what was the sodding point of the level if you're just going to rig it in the first place?"". Stamper's narration gets repetitive and tiresome after a while; you can turn it off, but I don't, because I can't be bothered to turn it on and off every level  for his quips. I miss them, then they come back and I want them gone.All in all, the devs really should have focused on making better levels instead of just amping the difficulty up artificially by placing annoying as hell enemy NPCs and actually hiding objectives. It's good on skin-level, but it leaves so much to be desired that I'm insulted that such a good looking game with good humour in it can be so bad."

Jumping and getting bumped around feels natural and works just well.However, the game feels unfinished. You don't really get a good tutorial and I learned I could actually attack in Chapter 3 (28 stages in). Keystrokes to perform an attack is complicated and it contradicts other movement keystrokes. The game also has bugs where I get stuck (literally stuck in weird places, not being unable to finish a stage). In general it is ambitious to work as an open world where you can get your own weapon/stage setup but in reality it's just kind of broken. It's playable, but can be annoying with bugs and lack of instructions."

Terrible OSX Port""I really didn't want to give this game anything shy from a five star rating, I bought it on the xbox and has proven to be a lot of fun. Every element of this game is great, from its artwork, gameplay, soundtrack and narrator, so much so that I found myself talking about it and recommending this to the everyday casual gamer to the hardcore video gamers.I instantly bought a two license pack once a friend of mine (a windows user) said he had never heard of it. Two downloads later, everything was running smoothly during gameplay and set up, we were in a call and each of us had a pair of headphones on. We did this a few times and within the week other friends of ours were forced to purchase the game too and join in the fun.However, without realising anything until playing the game by myself, I realised my 2014 Retina MacBook Pro was overheating and the game was running at 113% CPU Usage at least. It's not the only part of the port to go wrong either, when changing the games resolution in game it doesnt revert the resolution back to the system, which can really make your mac look interesting, leaving you to change your system display settings upon every time you quit the game (and possibly restart the system if the icons don't revert back). As Retina display's aren't designed to exceed their allocated settings (1920x1200,144ppi (instead of the standard 72ppi) on a MacBook Pro, running any program,hack or similar tool to obtain the displays full resolution of 3840x2400 would infact void your warranty.Upon submitting a helpdesk ticket to the behemoth, going back and forth for over 2.5 months and hearing nothing back from a month, i'm going to have to urge all mac users to avoid purchasing this game until an announcement is made by the Behemoth. I feel as if I should've posted this review sooner to OSX users and wish someone posted one before I made the payment.I've sent screenshots (in which were never viewed), offered to help, given technical details and have in response been to 'simply turn your mac on and off again, make sure nothing else is running', until my case was completely ignored.I wouldn't be surprised if i'm the only one with this issue. My windows friends have found no errors with this port and everything seems to run smoothly for them. I'd end this with a desperate ""PLEASE FIX THIS GUYS!!"", but if you haven't already gathered, I've given up trying."

That’s a bit funnier than the actual game, but should give you an idea if you’ll enjoy the humor here. If so, it might be worth it to pick up the game to get more of that. I only ever found it mildly amusing though. Other aspects of the presentation are good too: the art style, background jokes, etc.The main problem is that this is a  just another puzzle platformer that doesn’t have anything to distinguish it. Jump over spikes, climb rails, bounce on blowers, flip triggers, portals, etc. The platforming is never really interesting. The game relies way too heavily on blocks being invisible so trying to get all the gems involves rubbing your face on everything. Otherwise the mechanics just aren’t that interesting. The controls feel slightly floaty, and the “combat” is thin.I wanted to keep playing to see some more of the story, but I didn’t actually want to keep playing since the gameplay itself is mediocre to boring.Note: I only played the single player “story”. I’m personally just not interested in the multiplayer stuff."

,Not Recommended,238460,17001149,"Posted: 11 July, 2015",all,WaaghMan,"Me resulta muy sorprendente que este juego esté tan bien valorado.Battleblock Theater es un puzzle platformer sencillito con unas pocas mecánicas básicas (doble salto e interacción a base de interruptores, ventiladores, plataformas que se mueven, etc.), llevado al extremo. Al extremo del aburrimiento.En serio, ha sido uno de los juegos co-op que más nos ha costado terminar, no por dificultad (que la tiene), sino por desgana.Ya parte de una base bastante chunga, ya que el objetivo es simplemente recoger gemas esparcidas por el nivel y llegar a la salida. Basta con 3 gemas para activar la salida, pero hay hasta 7 y una bola de lana que suele ser más difícil de conseguir. Todos los niveles cumplen la misma premisa, y hasta los ""niveles de jefe"", por llamarlos de alguna manera, se desarrollan parecido, sólo que en esos hay límite de tiempo en lugar de gemas.Y ya está, eso es todo. Sin jefes, sin niveles especiales, sin carisma. Por favor, si no cambia ni el entorno de los escenarios. Tiene alguna cosa visualmente destacable (los gatos y las plataformas móviles), pero no compensa ni de lejos el tedio de tener que superar nivel tras nivel haciendo todo el rato lo mismo.Hay que reconocer la creatividad de los diseñadores de los niveles, para hacer tantísimos niveles (unos 100) con las pocas herramientas de que disponían. Ojo, he dicho muchos, no buenos. Pero el problema principal es que la base es mala, y un buen diseño de niveles no lo lo arreglaría demasiado.Oh, sí, puedes desbloquear nuevas caras para tus personajes, e incluso nuevas armas (cuya utilidad dentro del juego es cero, excepto la pistola nerf y algún que otro proyectil arrojadizo en ocasiones muy específicas).Es cierto que en el género de juego de plataformas cooperativo hay poca competencia, y por ello puede ser un punto a favor, pero se queda muy por detrás de otros juegos como Rayman, Splosion Man o Spelunky.En resumen, un juego bastante olvidable. Una pena, viniendo de los creadores del fabuloso Castle Crashers."

Too many times I have rage quit this game out of pure frustration with the game really not offering anything in the way of helpful design.The level design ranges from superb, where everything is very well placed and you can just eek by everytime, to absolutely infuriating. Some parts seemed to be determined strictly on luck, or random chance, which goes against what a platformer is supposed to do. And sadly, these parts become more and more frequent as the game progresses. Often times, the levels incorporate challenges that don't feel so much of a test of the player's skill, but of a mocking showing that the designers in the end have control, and there isn't anything I can do about it.And this is a real sad issue. The game's writing is witty and hilarious, but the rewards given to the player are not worth the time and effort the player puts in, especially in the levels where the players amount of control seems minimal at best. Playing this game in co-op versus singleplayer was incredibly different, but in the end, many of the same core problems remained.I give all the respect to the developers on this. At times, I can see what they wanted to do with the design, but at others it is overshadowed by what would seems to be more internal issues.For now, I must recommend you play there previous game, Castle Crashers, which, despite having tough parts, was always fair. Also a lot easier to mess around with your friends and have it end in laughs and not strangulation."

I like how everyone calls it ""challenging"", the game is unfair, like those other games like unfair sonic, unfair mario, its exactly like it. One funny thing is how you have to try the same tactic about 12 times till you actually suceed, the is usually only 1 way to get trough a puzzle, and you'll have to repeat it many times before it works. Another thing would be luck, you'd think a platformer would be about skill and timing, nope, it depends on how enemies will react, and how your standing, stood 1mm too far away? dead! stood 1mm too close? dead!

,Not Recommended,238460,13550278,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Taleweaver,"Despite the many other reviews, I'm going to vote for a 'not recommend' here.Others claim it to be the best in co-op mode. I admit I haven't tried that, so keep that in mind.But the game gets repetitive very fast. Pretty much all levels seem like simple copy-paste jobs from a 2D editor. There is no variety in themes (at least: the first 30 levels were interchangeable) and once the basic gameplay elements were introduced, you're just doing what you do the whole time.I also get the impression that the game originally wasn't meant to have a double jump (perhaps it's not there in co-op?). It sure made the game to easy on the platforming. Ironically, this sort of makes up for the clunky combat system. And that mechanic where you can call a ship to you comes accross as more of a lazyman's effort to forgive bad level design.Now, the game certainly has its plus sides: the narrative and the cutscenes are hilarious. The setting of a cartoonishly theater also plays into that 'it's a spectacle'-feel. And aside from the abovementioned, it doesn't do anything wrong. There are plenty of checkpoints, you run fast but controllable, and you respawn instantly, so some parts that could have been frustrating by themselves can just be passed with multiple efforts. Oh, and the music's fairly good too. :-)But still...whenever I'm actually playing, I find myself being bored quickly. There's no sense of achievement or real goal to work towards (how many people are you rescuing anyway?). There's no sense of growth or anything that astounds me. And using lava blocks as jump pads and water as instant-kills...the joke on that wears off faster than the actual game.This certainly isn't the worst game I've played, but when it comes to recommending...I can quickly name a handfull of other games I'd rather recommend (including castle crashers, btw). It doesn't lose much points in terms of frustration/bad design...but it doesn't gain much either. All in all, I'd give it about 5.5 or 6 out of 10. (again: this is counting for single player only)."

I mean, your mileage may vary, especially considering how easy you get into the first few levels... but boy does running around in a maze get old fast. They don't even hide it: you play a prisoner forced to race through a maze like some laboratory rat for the amusement of entitled fatcats. A story which struck close enough to home for me to stop playing in favor of something affording mereal liberty of options.THAT'S how I broke out of your little prison, teamBehemoth!InBattleblock Theater, your options consist of a double jump and unlockable weapons. Problem:Battleblock Theaterincentivizes you to race through the level and it's faster to avoid enemies than it is to defeat them. There aren't even any rewards for defeating the cats, so the weapons become entirely optional! Even if you come across the one weapon that could be used for platforming purposes (the Dart Gun), firing deviation makes for an unreliable platform generator! There would be good ideas such as the Vacuum, the Electric Fan or even the wallhugging frog with a bomb inside of it... But you should always run instead to get the best time possible and collect all the jewels all the time. What a waste of design space...Weapons are cool, and not encouraging their use is a cardinal sin of gaming. Weapons provide you with control over an environment which antagonizes you. Ever since the Power Pellet inPacman, there was a triumphant feeling of payback in chasing those ghosts once you finally had the upper hand!Battleblock Theaterdoesn't get that! They treat weapons as collectables, bought with Yarn icons hidden throughout the stages, with little intrinsic value of their own! They're treated as rewards rather than gameplay mechanics, showing howBehemothjust doesn't understand how a game works!Other cardinal sin: Story Mode is artificially long. There are 8 chapters of 13 levels... but so much of it is essentially the same! Do you really want to do 100+ races of jumping, avoiding, looking for and collecting jewels? Really? What for? Then what about this: stages require you to collect 3 jewels to unlock the exit although most of them contain about 7 or so. Jewels are used to unlock prisoners at a cost of 10 per prisoner released. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PRISONERS TO FREE. WHY? When did grinding become a game feature??? This isn't replay value, this is just tiresome!All the prisoners are the same blob figures with different heads. All the stages are hop and skip challenges over various deadly dangers. There are puzzles, but few puzzle mechanics. In fact, I'd say that the level editor might be more fun than the main game itself... I've started building a couple of maps, my heart half in it; there's definitely more depth in map building than in level completing but I guess when you're bored by the main mode, you can't really make good maps, now can you? I've also tried to complete other people's maps but this ended up as an exercise in frustration. What do you do when you can't complete a player-generated map? You downvote their creation and move on, it's all you can do.So much missed opportunities! When playing these player-generated maps, you hunt for worthless ""strawberries"" rather than the jewels used for unlocking the prisoners. Why limit the rewards offered to people who'd explore everything a game has to offer? I can understand how some people could build maps for the express purpose of jewel farming, but if a portion of the game is so tiresome that you have to use exploits to get through it, then maybe it wasn't adequately implemented to begin with! Personally, I'd think it'd be fun for someone who enjoyed the Main Story to look into other people's maps for their ""New Game +"" experience. Finished everything that we offered you? How about trying these stages other people have made so as to unlock all the prisoners!Online Play is similarly better than the main story because of greater interactivity between players BUT BEWARE OF LATENCY ISSUES! Even with all-green connectivity, your character WILL spaz about uncontrollably. Neat novelty factor that wears out its welcome even faster than Story Mode. Weapons gain a clear definite purpose now that you're actively seeking to defeat an opponent but this just leads to every player using the same loadout of insta-kill weapons. Physics altering weapons such as the Electric Fan and the Vacuum have absolutely no use inBattleblock Theater.A whole lotta words for a Flash game sold on the cheap but I still regret my purchase. It's not incorrect to say that at such a low price, it remains good value for your money if you don't take everything as seriously as I do. Finish the levels you want and move on. Regardless, this is not an engaging gaming experience (and you can see I tried everything to get engaged) and thus I cannot endorse such a product."

The single player is not necessarily bad, but it gets VERY boring (unless you're the kind of person that would play a platformer with an almost non-existent story like Mario). If you're planning to play this game by yourself, it's not even worth to buy this game regardless of a huge sale, I'd say. The multiplayer though, is engaging; And the level design for co-op is meant so that player cooperation is necessary to progress.Story/Structure: Simply throughout this game, it is filled with levels. The game is very linear; you complete stages after stages. After you complete a chapter, the narrator will ""storytell"". His sentences are silly and practical, but he never once made me laugh. As for the story, it is absolutely useless so do not expect any plot from this videogame.The Gameplay: ... ranges from mediocre ..to.. sometimes having a good time playing with someone.Unlockables: When it comes to unlocking things and whatnot, you simply unlock random head-sets (to customize the head of your character) and weapon-tools (which can help you in combat as well as platforming) from the gems and yarn-balls that you collect during gameplay.In Conclusion: ... I would rate this platformer as mediocre. It is very simplistic and your only incentive to play this game would be to kill time. Seriously, you could be doing something more productive with your time.Misc: But wow; I cannot believe that I spent 8.9 hours playing this game... I have absolutely no life at all. Anyhow... of the 8.9 hours I spent playing this game, I spent around 2 hours on single player and the rest is in multiplayer.All in all, I do not recommend this game especially if you're above the age of 15. When I look at this game, I think to myself that this is the kind of games that my nephews would play... mindless games like Mario.If you badly want this game, I suggest to get this game only when it is on sale sale. But if you've listened carefull to my review regarless of the overwhelmingly positive reviews that this game has, you should know that your cash could be used for something that is worth more your money.

I thought it would live up to its predecessor, castle crashers, but honestly it does anything but.  The singleplayer campaign lacks variety and is so repititive, and the multiplayer was basicly the singleplayer game, but with more people. It can be funny at times, but really doesnt capture that hillariousness of castle crashers. The dialouge in game is repetitive, and doesnt even make me chuckle. The controls in my oppinion are horrendeos, mainly because your attacks are W, A, S, and D keys. I constantly get confused when i have to do an uppercut or just a normal attacks, because you have to remember which key does which, and it just gets so cumbersome. My least favorite part of Battleblock Theartre is the fact that there are even enemies in the game. Since attacking was so difficult, the enemies stood as an artificial game difficulty, and are just there to slow you down on the time trial levels. This game could be worse, but not much. The Xbox version is so much better.BattleBlock Theater Steam Version - 3 / 10BattleBlock Theater Xbox Version 7 1/2 / 10"

The graphics, music, and sounds are all extremely well done.  It has such a fun style and the narration is great.  There is a ton of content to unlock and secrets to uncover.  That said, the game's core gameplay is hampered by some pretty generic platforming, uninspired level design, tacked-on ""combat"", and just boring mechanics in general.The general platforming mechanics work fine.  I prefer to have a bit of acceleration/momentum, but different platformers have different feels.  The core platforming movement is fine, but there are some really weird parts to the game.  You normally have 100% air control, but for some reason if you jump off of a box of ice you can't control yourself in the air at all other than making you grind to a complete stop.  All of the game's platforming feels a bit one-dimensional.The combat is ENTIRELY tacked on.  It's seriously some of the most awkward and boring combat I've experienced in a game.  You have no incentive to fight at all except for a few parts, so I guess that's OK, but the enemies just run at you and attack.  You only have one actual damaging attack, and by default you do a ""slide attack"" that seems to do no damage if you are moving+attacking.  You can jump on enemies, but it has no effect... no bouncing, no damage, and you don't even move with them, you just sort of slide off.The levels are all ""fine"", but honestly they all feel very samey.  I got to the 4th world, and I had NEVER really been challenged.  I'll need to try ""insane mode"" and see what that changes.  Deaths mean nothing, you just teleport back to your checkpoint.  There's no challenge to picking up items, and most of the ""secrets"" in the level are the same, you just run through a block that looks solid and come out on the other side to find some gems or a ball of yarn.I'm pretty disappointed in this game.  It's just so damn CHARMING!  But the gameplay ends up being extremely repetitive and easy.  COOP might improve this game, but honestly there are better platformers out there."

Also, without a friend to play co-op you're forever doomed to take even longer to unlock all the prisoners... a severe setback for someone who hates co-op modes (this game is especially annoying in co-op as the levels are harder to complete)It almost feels like the devs didn't give you enough gems, even for ranking A++ on each stage by yourself, just to prolong the game play... seems a bit redundant considering the game has way too many levels as it is, a level editor and custom maps featured each week. It's pretty stupid that you can't really unlock everything playing solo on a single playthrough.If you can muster the energy to farm more gems you can try Insane mode (basically a no checkpoint mode) but I was too annoyed with it by then.

,Not Recommended,238460,11308124,"Posted: 18 July, 2014",all,Cyril,"Oh, BattleBlock Theater, what do I think about this game?Simple. It's one of the worst platformers I've played on steam.The issue comes down to a few really, really bad mechanic choices more than anything, though. First, the good: The level design is usually competent enough, if a bit uninspired. Graphically the game's alright and the music's alright. The story is meh and the announcer gets annoying far too fast (an excess of toilet humor especially, which is not necessary nor funny.)More than anything though, the inherent randomness of the game's mechanics keep this from even standing a chance at being decent. Because, yeah. There's far too much randomness for a platformer. When a level loads, all of the potentially random elements will load at a different position ever single time, so there's potential for some scenarios to waste your time or be downright impossible on a few rare occasions. Heck, the entire last encore level is 100% randomness, with dozens of cannons all shooting at different times and sometimes in patterns where there is no chance of successfully clearing them. But this issue taints so many levels in the game that it's downright impossible to take the game seriously in terms of platforming; which basically undermines the entire point of the game. I feel like Behemoth wanted to make a game with the concept and announcer thing, but didn't know what kind of game to make, so they just made a platformer because it was ""easy"" for them. I don't feel like they *wanted* to make a platformer. The only thing about the game that makes it stand out from other games *is* the announcer and plot which are completely, entirely detached from the gameplay. This game fundamentally shouldn't exist, is what I'm trying to say.In terms of other design problems... levels are each a string of unrelated obstacles that just start and end at random. There's no cohesiveness to any of them, so instead of ""the bouncy level"" and ""the laser level"" you get lots of levels that try to shove as many different ideas together and end up all blending together as a result. The difficulty curve is almost non-existent, as well. The first two worlds gradually scale up in difficulty but by the time you hit world 3 the game's basically done getting harder. Maybe a slight increase in difficulty as the game goes on but never enough to be truly challenging in any way that doesn't involve getting screwed over by random elements. The combat system is not particularly strong, either. Half the weapons are no more effective than simply punching enemies, and only one weapon that *can* kill is particularly useful; the bubble weapon not only has a significantly low chance of backfiring but can also be used to cheese platforming sections so once you have that one you hardly need anything else. Enemies can pretty cheaply kill you though and often there are rooms with 4-5 enemies just placed haphazardly and called design.It is entirely possible to have fun with this game. I actually quite enjoyed the majoity of world 7 as it avoided the major issues of the game and seemed to have a consistent gimmick to it of looping levels. Maybe it's more fun in co-op, too. But the game doesn't have a single original though in its head and doesn't do anything better than other games, and just strikes me as a game that shouldn't exist. It's not the platformer I've had the least fun with by any means but there were far too many infuriating moments in it.Also I would like to point out that Adventures of Shuggy predates this game by a year, has the same collect-green-gems + level-in-a-box motifs, and has tons more ideas. Play that instead of this, honestly; the alternate modes actually have different levels, too!"

76561198053378039,Not Recommended,238460,10377482,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,Octotron,"I think this is a good game, but... there are currently too many bugs and minor problems with this game such as the checkpoint spawning you further back than it should, instead of simply spawning you on top of the checkpoint itself. The Frog and Dart Gun are both exploitable and are probably the most overpowered tools in the game. If the frog was not able to walk up walls or traverse spikes and water, perhaps the frog wouldn't be as strong as it is. The finale is disapointing, there is no boss fight or extreme challenge to the ending, the story sets up a relativaly... understandable... storyline but lacks a true villain in the ending. So the entire game is just levels without a boss. The Hat? Hatty? A Cat? The Souls of the Previous Owners? The Honey Hug Bear? any of these could have been possible bosses, perhaps with stronger versions of the weapons you own. I hope they fix these problems, and if so it will become a more solid game."

I picked it up kind of on an impulse, and really have not been that impressed. I have played it single player, local co-op, and just a bit of online multiplayer. The storyline and graphics are fine enough, but the core gameplay is nothing special. The platforming 'puzzles' are not difficult or challenging at all, and the actual goals of collection have all been done before. Local co-op was a bit more fun, but still nothing worth all the hype.I like the gem collecting and spending, except there is nothing spectacular to buy. The 'new' characters are simply re-skins. The  few weapons I have unlocked are not really that fun. Combat is also a bit wonky - which makes me think that combat was not meant to be a big part of the game."

,Recommended,238460,10414269,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Citizen Marioparte,"Battleblock Theater is what a modern platformer should strive to be like. A near-perfect mixutre of precision jumping, classic platforming, and puzzle-solving. Combined with the clausterphobic level designs, Battleblock Theater is both challenging and fun.That isn't it. Behemoth's ever appealing cartoony style is back again, combined with an excellent soundtrack and the lovingly spoken narration of William Stamper, Battleblock Theater is also legitimately funny with a constant stream of jokes and puzzles so stupid hard yet so slap-your-face simple when you finish them.Compared to some other platformers like Dustforce, or (Sigmar preserve me) trapformers like Eryi's Actions, Battleblock Theater is one of the best platformers of its genre, but that doesn't mean it has no problems. Like I said, some of the puzzles are very hard, yet very simple, death has very few drawbacks because if you get all of the gems and find the yarn you still get at least an A. Online connection has also been choppy at best, but that is likely the fault of my own poor router.All in all, Battleblock Theater is a fun, charming little game that will give a couple of laughs, and also keep you, and maybe even your friends if you have some, entertained for hours on end."

Be warned, it is easy to grief other players, my son found it funny to keep moving the boat everytime i was trying to jump on it, which had us both laughing and me shifting a glare saying ""come on bud, let's just get through this LOL"".

Very, very fun, and it feels great to absolutely destroy a level.- Great soundtrack, it's varied and upbeat.- A lengthy and well-paced singleplayer and multiplayer campaign gives the game a lot of length and replayability.- Great level design for the main campaigns. You never feel like you're making leaps of faith or are dying because the level was unfair. (except for the last encore level. ♥♥♥♥ that level.)- Comprehensive level editor, giving you full access to every kind of tile in the game.- Steam Workshop support, giving the game potentially infinite replayability.- Custom head support. Don't need to explain why that's awesome.- Lots of unlockable stuff.- Various multiplayer modes to even further increase the replayability.- Will Stamper.CONS:- The ""insane"" mode is a little underwhelming: I assumed there would be level differences, or certain objects would act differently, but instead we got 1-life mode. Feels like padding when you're going for a 100% playthrough.- The Cat Guard AI is almost too aggressive. If there's more than one enemy on the screen, have fun being thrown into a corner for extensive periods of time.- A timer on the regular levels, along with a par time, would have been useful for 100% playthroughs. Since all levels have a time requirement, which is automatically met on the timed levels but not on the untimed levels, having a timer for these untimed levels and a par time for the level would have streamlined the A++ process. Instead, you have to run through the level, see if you got the par time, and if you didn't, restart from the beginning.CONCLUSION: You already have the game. If you somehow don't, HOW and WHY!?"

In addition to it's silly character customization and humorus storyline, the gameplay is very addictive with it's multiple play styles and competitive mulitplayer which requires you to work as a team. Even with all this good things however, I would like to point out that there are a few glitches that occur every now and then. It also the difficulty spikes after about chapter 3, just be wary of that while playing. All in all, I'd give this game about a 4.5/5. It's an almost perfect playforming experience."

Obviously there aren't many games in that genre (e.g. the original GCN version of this, New Super Mario Bros Wii, Magicka, and Octodad: Dadliest Catch) but the outstanding quality and unique variety of social fun make it clear that we need it.I still fondly remember the original version of this on the Alien Hominid disc for GameCube and it's great that they brought back some of the memorable sound effects and music for old-timey fans like myself. I don't think I ever got around to convincing many people to play that older minigame with me back in the day, but I knew all the way back then that the devs had something special. I'm so glad they revisited and revived the concept.Thanks to Battleblock Theater and the new Magicka: Wizard Wars open beta, the world is now a much better and paradoxically more friendly place."

It's great.One caveat: this game has an annoying ""feature"": when you play things from the workshop, upon exiting it will spawn the steam overlay, and bring up the workshop page for the custom level. This is done to ""encourage"" feedback. It's not like Portal two where it's part of the game itself, the steam overlay has to be actively shif-tabbed away. Not a reason not to get this game, but it is an annoyance of sorts. An option to turn off this behavior would be nice, but I don't expect it will ever happen. That said: setting Battleblock Theature to not use Steam Overlay in the properties is a way of doing away with this behavior.Other than that, this is a fine and awesome game. Well worth the money."

Like the New Mario platformers, your allies are just as much of an obstical as the cats and robots on each level.The thing I love most is the story. I am sucker for good stories, and man is this one funny. The Narrator's voice is just hilarious and the story is a great dose of dark humor.The only minor complaint I have is the lack of weapons, compared to how you unlock them. You need to collect golden balls of yarn on each level (1 per level) and trade 5 at the black market to get new weapons. I have just finished area 3 (note that I went over areas 1 and 2 with my bro in coop) and I have almost every weapon in the game... so there is not a WHOLE lot of them.Other than that, well done Behemoth.(Also dat cat Gaben.)"

The premise and execution is absolutely immaculate. The single player campaign can be done completely co-op with varying changes throughout, and the multiplayer modes are very unique and fit the design of the game's mechanics.The music is incredible - I am not a fan of electronic music or EDM at all, but when its done right in a game (and it's done right in Battleblock Theater) I really enjoy it. Think of the soundtracks to the original Deus Ex or Frozen Synapse - Battleblock Theater's music is so good I would rank it among those games.It is chalk full of the classic Behemoth humour you would come to expect by their titles.Honestly, this is one of my favourite games.

,Recommended,238460,30464162,Posted: 11 March,all,Will The Kill,"This is a fun and colorful platformer with a great sense of humor provided via story/cutscenes and voiceovers.  It's fairly easy to pick up and play, but most certainly difficult to master once you get towards the second half of the game.There's incentive to replay levels for 100% completion, as you get graded at the end of each level depending on how many collectibles you discover and how quickly you finish.  Each level contains multiple checkpoints, so there's a pretty good balance between being both fair and challenging.  As I referenced earlier, the first couple of worlds are pretty straightforward and may feel like a breeze, but the last three or four areas of the game consist of some pretty challenging platforming.There seems to be a pretty solid multiplayer following for this game, but I can't speak much about my experiences on it.  The inclusion of a level editor is great for games like these, but even when playing solo, BattleBlock Theater is a great addition for any 2-D platforming enthusiasts, both new and experienced."

Making your own levels is fun, but the fact that I am able to upload them to the Steam Workshop to let others enjoy my cruddy work makes me happier.If you haven't picked up Castle Crashers or this game yet, I say the next time there is money in your account their shouldn't be because you just bought these two games.

It is a great game full of crude yet funny humor that not all will appreciate, but those whose do will get many chuckles out of it. The story mode levels are fun to play through with difficulty progression that changes throughout to give you an even greater challenge. The arena modes are fun to play with others and are full of amazing moments that you and your friends will charish forever.Overall, this is a good port of the Xbox version with more stuff added to the mix.

Though I must admit that the driving force of this game is the narrator's wacky ramblings and complex jokes about fatal poops. I found myself going through this game with my main two sources of motivation being getting to see the next chapter in the story, and my friend's gun to my right temple. The soundtrack is also a big part of the magical rabbit that is this game coming out of steam's big black hat. It's probably a foot, or like, an ear or something. Not to mention the underlying message of this game that all makes sense at the end. It'll blow your mind like a working girl low on drug money. Best part is that all it takes to get your family back is like 25 bucks. Two-packs man, gotta love 'em. Anyway, to sum it all up, this is a pretty good game. I mean, billion pixel resolution? Like... Pffffsssshhhhttttt or whatever sounds brains make when they explode. I dunno. My friend knows. Buy this game."

Now, regarding comedy and voiceover, the commentary is VERY well made and funny, you play the game for the cutscenes, which are humorous, now. I am not far into the game yet, perhaps halfway done with campaign, but the story seems pretty basic, uniqe, but nothing to fancy and in depth. Now, the multiplayer, the multiplayer for this game is great. There are TONS of gamemodes and EVERY SINGLE level from singleplayer has been modified so the experience you have in co-op is completely different then the levels in singleplayer. There is also some interesting gameplay elements for you have a love/hate relationship with your companion throughout the levels during co-op.

I've played about 9 hours on single player and still have tons more to go as well as completing the co-op which is equally fun if not more rewarding.

It's platforming, puzzle solving and creative design (built-in level editing and Steam Workshop support) all rolled into one powerfully amazing gem of a game. The 2D art style is colorful and unique. Watch the game videos on Steam (and Youtube?), try the demo (if there is one) and decide for yourself.Bring a friend along for some added fun, challenges and hijinks. Help your friend up to the next hard to reach place or jump on his (or her) drowning head to reach your own spot of safety after first pushing him (or her) into the water. How you play is up to you. Co-op puzzles are generally made to require two people to solve so you'll most likely need to co-operate to complete them.Arenas (four players) and assorted game modes are also available. A game controller, such as the Xbox360 gamepad, is highly recommended.__Notes: Reportedly, there have been some launch issues but these are being addressed. A patch has already been released to fix some of them. High latency (high pings/slow connections between players) is known to cause game performance issues. A quality connection is recommended. This reviewer is uncertain if the game indicates connection quality when connecting to other players. Please visit the game's forums for the latest news and information."

The narrator (voiced by Stamper) does a perfect job delivering the humor in this game and his work in the cutscenes in particular made me look forward to the cutscenes at the end of each world. As for the gameplay itself, it is a very fun and challenging. If you are a fan of difficult platformers, then this game is for you. There were a couple times when I got frustrated, but it was never enough to make me rage quit.I cannot recomend this game highly enough. 11/10 stars."

And then I watched 'em again until I cried *blood*. They were that funny.Do you like jumping and dying and jumping and dying and jumping and winning? I DO! And THIS IS A GAME FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE THAT! <3Much of the presentation for BattleBlock Theater(r) seems to revolve around the map-making stuff. I... never really got in to that part. Maybe it's great! But it seemed weird to me. The mechanics present in the game didn't strike me as the kind of palette I wanted to paint levels which, and that is normally one of my bags. OH WELL!Was still a blast to play.So, while this game doesn't *quite* live up to the astounding achievement that was Castle Crashers... I'd say that expecting that kind of thing every time is perhaps holding the bar a bit high, wouldn't you say? I think you would. And if you wouldn't, you should.If nothing else, it's actually worth the price of admission fo the opening cinematic. I THINK I'LL WATCH IT AGAIN!"

And the best part is that he's in the game, and he's your guide to having the time of your life.With probably over 5000 possible combonations of head/face, weapon/tool, and team color you'll never get tired with your character. I've switched character after each set of puzzles and that's probably only 50 of those choices.Playing the game with the narrator on chatterbox mode makes the game what it really is: hilariously great.

BattleBlock Theater is a side-scroller in which you are imprisoned by a bunch of evolved cats that are now forcing you to do death-defying stunts through a diabolical theater, risking life after life. By the way, unless you are going through the game on insane mode, there are helpful checkpoints in each level. There are other prisoners that you can unlock along with weapons.

I like alot of Behemoth's games, but this one takes the cake. The goofyness of Stamper (The narrator) and the enemies provide a pretty unique atmosphere that gives the game its own style. Like many platformers, this game is pretty challenging, especially in co-op. The co-op is an amazing experience that everyone should try with a friend in local multiplayer. It manages you to really work with your partner, and punch them in the face when he/she kills you. The level editor is pretty fun to use, with many blocks to work with, Happy Wheels would kneel in this game's presence.BY TEH WEY, the game controls nice and tight (thats what she said). Barely any lag with the many things that can possibly go on screen.

After a terrible shipwreck, you lay stranded on a mysterious island filled with theater-going cats which imprison you to perform daring stunts on stage. You're tasked with collecting all the gems on a stage, and the optional golden ball of yarn, to reach the exit and continue your life as a prisoner.The stages are well-made, ingeneous, and so damn hard it's like the game is dunking your head in a pot of boiling water, but is somehow able to do it in such a way that it feels good. Death is everywhere, but completing a super-hard stage is one of the best feelings I have felt in a game thus far.You can either grab a buddy to play the story mode or play in equally-fun arena gamemodes (which I haven't experimented with too much) My one complaint is that for me, at least, I couldn't enjoy the game with more than one friend, as the multiplayer system just decided to not want to work for my friends and I.Otherwise, it's a wonderful game and is worth all of your pennies.

A silly atmosphere leads to hilarity as you and a friend try to navigate your way through the levels. The game was very easy to pick up and play for short or long sessions. Difficulty was nice, with some challenges taking several tries and the oppourtunity to pick up collectables. One qualm is that many of the level designs are linear, with only one route to travel. Obviously the point wasn't to have ""Open World"" levels but I think more than one path could have been interesting. Would recommend for friends! 7/10"

The main goal is to finish the story, but there is also a prominent side quest of collecting gems to unlock prisoners (usable characters). Additionally, there is a yarn ball hidden in each stage. If the player collects 5 of these, they can bribe the cat guards (which is explained in the story) to get weapons that can be used in the main game.As for the comedy element, it was fantastic. The game has a dark sense of humor reminiscent to that of the Portal franchise. The narrator is an omniscient voice that loves to tell stories of humor and horror. Even when the player dies over and over again, there is always a sarcastic comment ready to be said by this voice. As the story advances, the narrator is right there to explain it with stick puppets and jokes.If you're familiar with the studio's previous game, Castle Crashers, than surely you will enjoy this game. If you haven't played it before, you will be introduced the amazing games that the Behemoth makes."

For the longest time, I knew this game as the ""Buckle Your Pants Game"" because of the ending credits theme, which is great. Anyway, is the game good? Yes. It has great voice work from the narrator, and is just a funny game in general. You can unlock new characters and weapons, and is overall a good time. I ike the level design for the most part, except for the timed ones. Specifically the world 5 one. It isn't hard, but it's really easy to get stuck at several parts, like the two block platforming sections, and the area where you have to wait for the correct patterns to show up. Now, I have two more small complaints. One is this puzzle where you have to make the bars on each eaqual. I didn't understand these, and simply lucked out on them. Lastly, there is a large dog creature, and it has to hit a switch. What's the problem? It can be a bit slow with reactions, and you might die a lot because the dog was too slow. But my complaints aside, I still love this game. I also haven't played co-op yet so I can't give my thoughts on that. Now, I'm on World 8, and wow is it hard. Some parts seem to only be hard for the sake of being hard. Also, I've messed around with the level editor, and my levels are monstrositys. They are nearly impossible to win at, and it's a vs one.

Although I am not a big fan of platformers, this is one with a story that made me really enjoy it. The story is very engaging and made me want to play it all in one go (althogh you can't really do that), and the narrator throughout is very funny, if it does not get a little repetative after playing it for a long time. Besides the story, the gameplay is very smooth, and it feels very natural to be playing. The levels start out easy and get to be very hard. The game also has very good replayability because you can always try to get a higher rating on all the levels.Overall this is a very good game that works very well, and will make you want to play it all the time. The one recommendation I have is that if you do not already, go get a controller. This game was ported over from the xbox (and a very good port too), and is thus designed for use with a controller. Along with my belief that all platformers should be used with a controller, this game pretty much requires one (although you technically can use the keyboard). I would give this game a 9/10 on my very strict grading scale and would recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Go get itNOW."

SUCH CATS, MUCH JUMP.StoryStory is extremely crude, kinda cute, and charming in its own way.  Gotta be frank though, the ending thoroughly disappointed me considering the amount of effort involved but that's just me.GraphicsWhile the overall design of the game is super simple, the amount of fluid animation and so forth is fabulous.  Environments aren't too varied in normal single player I've noticed until the last zone (Zone 8) but that's what community levels are for.  Also the amount of customizable heads is easily over 100, if you decide to give the effort and collect the gems to buy them.Gameplay/Co-opYour goal in the game is to basically go through an obstacle course, collecting gems on the way (and balls of yarn which will be explained in a bit) reach the exit and repeat numerous times.  There is a final stage where there are 2 sections, both timed which you need to complete, and 3 following stages (called Encore levels) that are unlocked which are HARD AS CRAP and are timed as well.  You can turn in Gems for unlockable heads to wear around and Yarn for more weapons and can carry up to two at a time.  With single player, most of these stages are doable, albeit get ridiculously challenging as you progress (to the point I still haven't beaten the final 6 Encore levels).  Puzzles are complex and sometimes ingenious but I have issues a bit with the combat as it's easily a ""mash every button you have and pray you knock evil cats down"" ordeal and most of the time you'll get yourself killed or knocked into some hazard.  However I feel they were downright lazy with the Co-op stages, as there is almost no variation between single player and co-op aside from maybe one or two things.  They also have the dreaded hit collision, and since there are hazards everywhere, 9 times out of 10 you'll get your partner killed or yourself since there is usually nowhere to stand.  The Multiplayer Games however hold much more milage such as the usual beat eachother to a pulp or coloring blocks for your team and you can even earn more gems playing them.ControlsControls are okay, but I only had some iffy feedback trying to punch cats at close range or grapple pipes to climb, sometimes the game really just doesn't wanna let you grab them.  Also as the game even itself states in the loading screen, playing this with a controller will spare you from most headaches, but not all.  Weapon switching and even using them felt very clunky.SoundSound is fabulous.  Music is adorable, sound effects make you wanna go ""awww"" and the narrator needs a cookie.  The game is quite literally 5 times more enjoyable due to the sound and I wish I wasn't being literal here.Final VerdictA fun platforming game with a few hicupps and a lazy co-op campaign that cannot be taken super seriously due to all the accidental deaths that will occur because you had to avoid a death laser and jumped on your partner as they jumped to some far platform and plumbeted to their death."

I admit that I couldn't finish the single player.It's a platformer with tons of obstacles, weapons, and death traps. Single player starts out easy and fun, but gets mind-shatteringly hard by the end. There were quite a few rage quits while I tried to beat the last level. Some levels feature a time limit, which is the main source of frustration. Otherwise, you can just keep retrying a level with your limitless number of lives.There is a lot of customization in this game. You can change your character, build levels, and get levels from other players. Multiplayer is a lot of fun.It's a great game for messing around, but once it gets serious, you need to be pretty dexterous to win."

You can be a huge **** in this game. It has a create your own level mechanic which is simple to use and fun. The narration is hillarious and is well-done it brings you into the story. The game mechanics work fine so far I haven't experienced any bugs. The gameplay collecting the diamonds and the golden ball is one of those things that are fun at the beginning then start to get lame. Because there are like 9 required levels you have to do to enter the main level to get to the next chapter (Total 13 level including main chapter room).  All the level are all the same collect the diamond and the golden ball to unlock stuff at the store new heads and weapons. Which end up being extremely boring. Though the multiplayer, playing it with a friend with the different modes are really fun. The steam workshop is a great addition to the game.But my main problem with this game is the price of it. This game is not worth equal to or more than $15 Dollars.Its best to wait for a sale for the game to be like $4.99 or 1 thats how much it should be worth.My rating for this game would be 8.5/10It brought my attention just the only lame part of it is the reptitive levels for the campaign."

But anyways, You are a little guy who wants to defeat someone  (cant really know) and if you want to defeat him you must complete some sort of ""parkour"" maps. And maps are so fun and nicely maked! You need to collect green diamonds and to collect them, you must to do some sort of puzzles. In very first maps you get eazy maps and they are eazy to complete. Theres so many maps/levels that u cant even imagine! Seriously u can im just kidding lol. But of course there are time limits, easter eggs, a freakin shop where you can get some custom heads, thats pretty cool huh? to get heads and more stuff you need to complete levels. But about final levels, there is time limit and map is harder than normal maps are. I also recommend Xbox controller because its more eazyer than playing with kboard. I play with keyboard because i havent ever, EVER played with xbox controller...Well one time in store but it was only for testing. And I have mechanical kboard so it doesnt really mater, also I like challenges. But my overall rating for this pretty cool game is 8/10.+ Great Fun+ Good timewaster+ ITS COOL!+ No glitches or some kind a bugs+ Great puzzles to complete- Price -.-- Lame story- Boring to play solo- It repeats it self A LOTBtw...I recommend your friends to check out this game so its even more fun ^^Recommend!"

However each time after I had rage quit I found myself wanting to play again after a short while. The best part of the game is the narrator, just watch the trailer it is extremely representative of the brilliance of the cut scenes. The game itself is also great, stylish silly, with a nice range of obstacles that are introduced steadily to create a good difficulty curve. There is no penalty for dying so you can play through the levels throwing yourself repeatedly to your death until you flounder your way to the exit. This process is even more hilarious in co-op as you repeatedly inadvertently thwart your partners efforts. There are loads of weapons and characters to unlock as you play. The frustrating parts are the finales which are like the other levels but with a time limit. It is quite telling that 98% of the reviews for this are positive but only about 4% of people have completed the story, just keep playing the fun levels and don't worry too much about finishing the story."

The story is both comedic and has a ton of great narration by Stamper which makes the game even more enjoyable to play. Although cartoony the style is refreshing among the gritty realism the games industry is trying to achieve these days in the terms of both aesthetics and graphics.Battleblock supports both a keyboard and a controller input, however plays incredibly better with a controller compared to the former. I would definitely recommend this game if you ever have mates around, or have mates which want more co-op games to play - just double-check that you've got a controller to hand."

76561197983662248,Recommended,238460,16143457,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery. Also, I only played through this game in the single-player mode, and as such, my review will reflect this.Gameplay: I've been a fan of The Behemoth's games for quite a while; in fact, I picked up Alien Hominid a couple of years after it came out, and absolutely loved it. About a year ago from writing this review, I played Castle Crashers for the first time, and I felt that it was pretty good, although I wished there was some proper scaling for the amount of players you have on screen, so that a couple of areas in particular felt a little bit more reasonable to play single-player. Now we have BattleBlock Theater, The Behemoth's first foray into the world of platforming, and to be honest, I only kinda enjoyed myself from time to time while playing this game.BattleBlock Theater is a pretty basic platformer; you can double jump, shoot a gun/punch kitties, grapple onto pipes, cry furiously, and fart yourself to death. The double jump works irrespective of whether you're in the air, and double jumping after walking off of a platform becomes imperative later on. Also, there is no run button; you go at the same speed throughout the game. There's also a lot of gimmicks as well, such as a jetpack, sticky walls that let you jump again, coals that make you jump higher, etc. etc. Combat is just as simple as punching things or using your weapon; there's only three types of enemies, and the last of the three only shows up a couple of times. This game also has no bosses, so don't be expecting any of that.As you might guess from the title, the level design is very blocky, which lends itself nicely to user created levels, but it does somewhat ruin the game's ""world feel."" This may be a complaint levied by my having grown up with the early era of 3D platformers, where you weren't just playing through levels but worlds, but at the end of the day, these just felt like levels; processed ""fun capsules"" that the developers made for you. I'm having a really hard time remembering any of the levels, and it's simply due to the fact that most of these levels feel unremarkable due to the very nature of the game. I understand that the game is supposed to be taking place on a stage, and that does limit how much room you have to work with in a level, but after the third world, the game felt like a grind rather than a romp through a world.In every level there are emeralds; although the amount can vary, the average level has six or seven emeralds in it, but never more than seven. There is also a ball of yarn in each level that usually requires a tricky jump to get to. These emeralds can be exchanged in the Gift Shop for more faces and the yarn can be exchanged for more weapons. I quickly ran out of weapons to buy, which meant that I just had a bunch of yarn laying around doing nothing. About 70% of the time, these collectables either require you to perform a kinda tricky jump or are just along the way, and the other 30% of the gems require you to rub your face against the wall in order to find a secret passage that the game sometimes signals. I don't understand why they insisted on making invisible paths to get these, as it doesn't really add anything challenging or skill based to the level; instead, they just make it so that sometimes you've just gotta headbutt walls for a while in order to get 100% on a level.The last bit that you can do for a level to 100% it is to beat the par time... which the game never tells you about beforehand. In fact, the game is kinda bad at telling you things you'd probably like to know. You never know before you go into a level how many emeralds there are, but at least there's signaling in that there's a brighter flash once you collect the last emerald in the stage. Also, for the par time, unless you're playing the Finale or Encore stages, the game will not give you a timer, which is frustrating, as there is ample space on the screen to put a timer on. In these Finale and Encore stages, the game gives you a timer, but not an indication of how many things you've picked up.Ultimately, 100%ing the game turns into a dull, tedious grind that almost made me stop playing the game. I got up to level 6-8, 100%ing every level along the way, but I just got fed up with that level, and as a result stopped the grind. After doing this, I found that I was having a bit more fun, but even still, the level design felt unremarkable. As mentioned earlier, there were a few cool jumps here and there, but I find myself struggling to remember any particular level. The final level is a big disappointment; you just do what are basically a couple of Finale levels and the game is over. That's it. There are custom levels, but considering that I was as bored with the game as I was in the main playthrough, I won't bother with it.I liken this game to an MMORPG in that it seems like it's the kind of game that you have to play with friends to really have fun with, as playing it entirely on your own can feel like a painful grind (to some, at least). However, when it comes down to it, these levels just don't feel substantial. 6/10.Story: Honestly, the cutscenes were the best parts of the game, for better and for worse. The writing is as silly as ever from The Behemoth, and having talent like Stamper on just nails it (I'll talk a bit more about this in the Audio section). The dialogue that these two read out is great, the basis of the story is absurd, and the storytelling in the cutscenes is absolutely spot-off; just what I want from the Behemoth. It's not a deep story in the slightest, but at least it's told in a pretty fun and definitely enjoyable way. 7/10.Graphics: The art style is just as good as ever in this game, with Dan Paladin's style shining through with its cartoonish absurdity. The character design is good, the cutscenes are fantastic to watch, and it's just all around a good game to look at. Simple, but effective. However, due to the nature of the levels, during gameplay the art style can feel a bit too simple from time to time, making a lot of levels feel like other levels, not only in terms of gameplay. As for the technical details, the game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p by default, and it ran at a perfect 60FPS, just like I'd expect. There were a few weird things that happened with some of the assets, like lines showing up around an edge of an asset from time to time; perhaps a problem with the way this game upscales resolution. Cutscenes are obviously pre-rendered, looking somewhat low-quality and rather obviously rendered at something like 720p. If you've got a particularly high resolution monitor, it'll really become obvious. While the art style itself is fun as ever, the level design feels like the biggest limiter of just what Dan can do. 4/5.Audio: Let's just get this out of the way: Stamper does a fantastic job voice acting in this game. His style favors absurdity, and it works perfectly for a game like this. He's also the only voice actor, so I suppose it's fair to say that he is the best voice actor in the game. The soundtrack is very abnormal, which works pretty well for the game, although I do kinda wish the game stuck with one track when you reset a level rather than just starting another one, which can make ""grinding"" the levels a lot more annoying than they already are. Don't expect anything conventional from the soundtrack, but do expect to be humming along with these songs when you least expect to. It's a pretty good OST. A solid OST and Stamper's perfect voice acting for this kind of game make me wanna give audio a 5/5. But I'm not gonna because I'm a cynical self-entitled jerkface!Oh alright, 5/5 for the audio.Overall scores are: 6/7/4/5; cumulative score of 7.3/10. I'd like to say a bit longer of an afterword, but I've ran out of spa"

,Recommended,238460,10814475,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Ernie,"TL;DR: If you have had even a mild interest in Super Mario World, you should totally get this game and play it. If you have had even a mild interest in having friends, you should totally buy this game and give a copy to your friend so you can play it together. If you have no interest in having fun and enjoy spending your time staring at walls and not pressing buttons, I guess you shouldn't really get this game. Concerns with the game include no in-game timer, but they still time you. Easy 8/10.If you've read any previous reviews I've done, you know that I generally just play games and write reviews for them when they have cards for me to get. Or I just want to let someone know about a bad/good game. This was totally initially neither. I remember seeing the trailer for it and I was pretty hyped. I was mildly excted to play.Finally, this game went on sale during the glorious master race sale 2014.The background story: you're imprisoned and forced to work in the theater to try and leave. You also see your friend put on a MYSTERIOUSLY OMNINOUS HAT WITH A RED AURA. TF2 would be proud. You're implied to be competing against other prisoners for freedom. Getting more gems = more chance at freedom. I think. I don't really know. I don't play games for story.Anyway: the game plays like any other platformer. So maybe you'll think this is dull off the start. If you do, man, you're kinda nuts. The whole game has this very silly atmosphere and they try to push that on early with the announcer having a silly voice  and commentating lines such as ""No, no, DON""T die"" when you die. Pretty great. Little things like that are what really make a game fun.I mean, that's not to say it's carrying the game. The gameplay is pretty solid. There's no tutorial because tutorials are for babies. Instead, they go with the tried and true method of teaching someone how to play their game: by forcing them to push buttons until they get things to work and also heavily implying what you SHOULD be doing. They even go out of their way to show you when you need to push a button to interact with a certain object. That was very kind of them.So, after the gameplay, what's stopping you from just playing this game once and neve touching it again? You can unlock somewhere around thirty gorillion costumes (and like 10 weapons/tools). In-game. No DLC microtransaction shenanigans. It's a shame I have to qualify that. But yeah, basically, the more gems you get, the more costumes you can unlock. Also, currently, you can get more gems from playing co-op.Oh yeah, I mention there was co-op? There's totally co-op. The levels change a bit and you now get to interact with your buddy. That's super cool. It's always great when games like this offer co-op. It would be totally cool if they had some competitive thing besides just rankings though.Oh wait, they totally have that too. Online arena. Yeah, it's kinda weird, but it's still another dimension to the game.Not to mention you can unlock 10 tool/weapons to offer you different methods to go through the game. Like the papertube rocket launcher that sticks to walls sometimes to give you another platform. Or the fan that reflects projectiles. Or the fireball that really doesn't do anything but looks kinda cool. GOOD TIMES.The issues I do have with this game include not having an in-game timer. This becaomes relevant when you're going for A+ runs and you don't know what time you need to hit to actually get that stopwatch stamp. Man, Act 2 Scene 3 had me for like an hour where I thought I was totally gonna get the stopwatch, but didn't. That was kind of irritating. Especially since you can't skip through the score stamps, costing you like 10 seconds each time. I hope they fix that + add a timer.I also would love to see a run button in the game. Not to say that your default movespeed isn't fast or anything, it would just feel right. It's somewhat foreign for me to play a platformer without a speed up button. It's not too big of a deal and it totally didn't detract from how I feel about this game at all, I guess not having it makes the Arena more fun. it's definitely a mixed feeling type of thing.Annnnnd, there's also a bug on multiplayer where if you push a block going toward a laser cannon thing, there's a chance you take damage from the laser and die. That kind of sucks.But yeah, overall, the gameplay is really solid and you can totally play by yourself or with a friend. Great game. Go play it. I think it's like 15 bucks or something off sale and it was like 2 bucks on sale? I would have definitely spent more than 2 bucks on it if I had a demo beforehand or something."

It's a platformer that combines cooperation with competition (unless you play by yourself, in which it's still fun regardless), but even if you have no one to play with locally, there's still a lot of fun to be had with online mode. Aside from the amazing story with funny narration, there are also a ton of arena gamemodes to play, as well as community- made levels. Plus there's a bunch of stuff to collect too, mainly character heads that you can use to customize yourself with. This game is great, and I highly reccomend it (but if you plan on buying it, make sure you have a gamepad, 'cause BattleBlock Theater is best played with a controller)."

The game features arcade 2D platforming, collecting gems to continue to the exit and advance to the next level.After your ship crashes on an island, you and your friends are imprisoned by feline natives. One of the prisoners is Hatty, who is brainwashed by the cats.There is not much to say about the gameplay. Imagine Castle Crashers as a platformer game and voiced by YouTube's Stamper. Since Steam is very vauge about who we recommend this game to. So I recommend this for platformer fans with a lot of humor and a gamepad. Because the game is hell without one."

Let’s get rocking.The GoodI think my favorite thing about this game is the commentator. Far better and far, far funnier than any commentator alive (or dead) today. Nothing helps you get over your own 367th death on one particularly nasty obstacle than a sardonic remark from the commentator. Honestly though, there were moments when I was ready to rage quit, but the commentator brought me back with his mocking.There’s a stupid amount of customization as far as your character’s head goes. There are several colors for you to choose from, but the heads are seriously where it’s at. Hundreds of heads to choose from (once you’ve unlocked them that is). There are even special heads that can be acquired through participating in events on Steam or by owning other games from The Behemoth. The Castle Crashers head is one of my personal favorites.To go along with the heads there is a generous amount of “Weapon Tools” for you to equip your character with. There are things like fireballs, grenades, and exploding discuses, but there are also suction dart guns and the like. The latter was actually one of my go to Weapon Tools for the course of the game as it was extremely helpful in multiple situations.The music is divine. If you’ve played a game from The Behemoth before, you’ll already know what I’m talking about. The music is always spot on and makes the game so much better.The BadThat damned, missile launching, indestructible robot. If there is a Robot Hell, he belongs there with all of his ilk.I’d say that some of the obstacles were a bit overly hard, but, let’s face it. I just sucked when it came to those, it wasn’t the game’s fault.The MehI would have liked to have seen a few more types of enemies scattered around the courses, but, oh well. It’s no big deal.Verdict: YeaBattleBlock Theater is a solid platformer and is guaranteed to bring you both sheer joy and sheer frustration. It is well worth the price and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it. As always, thanks for reading."

The writing was good and made me keep playing to see how the story unfolds.The music fits the game very well, that in conjunction with the narrator's voice will compel you and make you laugh instead of getting mad whenever you die (well, sometimes you'll get mad anyway but it's a part of the game!).I haven't played too much of the multiplayer content but from what I've seen it looks like there's quite a bunch of stuff to do. Really, next time you have friends in your house, grab two controllers. buckle your pants and let the fun begin (there's a co-op mode for 2 players AND a competitive co-op mode, which means 2 vs 2 players) !TL;DR: It's not an expensive game and there's plenty of content.

Here are some pros and cons:(Note: There are more pros than cons.)Pros:-Best. Soundtrack. EVER. They plan on releasing a soundtrack soon, BUT I CAN'T WAIT!!-Very fun gameplay... most of the time. (See cons.)-Very interesting story... and i've pieced together some of the story... but im not gonna spoil it!-Can play with friends.-Fan-frickin-tastic graphics. (I love their graphics style!)-Has good humor. I recommend setting narrator to blabbermouth in settings. He's so funny!-Workshop support.-A level editor so you can build incredibly hard levels to troll your friends.-Steam trading cards for badges, emoticons and backgrounds.-8 chapters, so don't worry about finishing it too soon!-MANY MANY MANY heads to collect and trade with your friends.-That being said, it also has Steam Market support, so you can buy and sell heads for cash if you're rich and too lazy to earn gems.-Cats.-Did I mention the amazing soundtrack?Cons:-A bunch of the levels are built for co-op, making singleplayer slightly harder.-Levels after chapter 4 or 5 get REEEAALLLLYYY hard, so if you're the kind of person who gets frustrated a lot, then you might want to be careful. (I can barely beat normal, and I'm going to attempt insane. I must be insane....)-The grab button on the keyboard can sometimes be hard to push while jumping. This can be solved by using a controller though!-The fact that I doubt behemoth actually took time on insane and didn't take in the fact that insane mode can be RIDICULUSLY hard. Like seriously, I've actually spent 2 hours on 1 level in insane!-Has no regard for physics. Some examples are: Dying on spikes without touching them, dying from lasers after they dissapear and drowning in water your character can stand in.And the final results of this review? I hate this game soooooooo much, but I love it more :3(And a random side note, insane mode is ridiculesly hard. I'm on chapter 8, and my goal is to beat at least 1 level each day. Not because I want to, but because I can't do any more than that. Plus, as said in cons, this game has no regard for physics, so most deaths are from lasers that have dissapeared or racoons who can eat stuff thats on top of their head without doing anything.)"

If you are still evil, release it all in Arena Mode. Battle opponents, friend or stranger, in many different ways. If you are bored, when the game launches, don't play.

,Recommended,238460,12918810,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,Tomás,"Simple, stupid... funBattleBlock Theater is a very rare kind of platformer, one that needs not depend on gameplay to deliver a superb experience.Most good games of this genre provide the player with sharp controls and outstanding level design to ensure that the experience is rewarding. They capitalize on the thrill of getting through challenging levels faster and more elegantly as you master the mechanics proposed by the game and the moves of the main character. BT is not such a game. It provides you with a basic, even derivative, core platformer gameplay, that is far from the likes of Super Meat Boy or the latest iterations of Rayman. That said, this game does appeal to the player in a less orthodox manner.There are three main reasons for which you might want to play this game. Firstly, it's fun. BT's wacky, unexpected, and at times immature, sense of humor keeps you going through one of the dumbest stories in the history of gaming, which I think is a great merit. Silly weapons and competent level design keep things fresh as new mechanics are introduced early on the campaign, but fall short in the middle, where things become a bit repetitive. You might find yourself trying to finish some of the levels as fast as you can, not for the sake of speed running or score or leaderboards, but instead, because you want to get to the next cinematic.The collectables you get throughout the campaign are pretty worthless too. Weapons are ineffective, albeit fun in the multiplayer modes, and the 'friends' you rescue (skins for your character) are sometimes funny, but hardly interesting enough to fire up a completionist's quest.You still might not enjoy the campaign at all if you don't share the sense of humor the game has, but BT can still make it up with a terrific multiplayer. Like the single player, the shared experience is damped by the overly simplistic gameplay, but the variety of game modes, combined with the unpredictability of a human opponent can lead to hilarious situations. Simply put, playing this game in a local 4 player match is a blast. The game modes for the multiplayer are simple enough that anyone can understand them and jump in right away, and even though how the game keeps score is somewhat of a mystery at times, the end result never feels unfair.The third grand reason for giving this game a chance is the level editor. It's powerful and fairly simple to use. The inclusion of this editor in the game is really a huge plus in terms of replay value, helping to keep things fresh after the original line-up of multiplayer stages loses novelty. Some of the funniest moments come from playing the most bizarre, stupid and even annoying levels you can think of with your friends. You can even experiment including multiple game modes in a single stage.Battleblock Theater is a rare kind of game with plenty of reasons for you and your friends to come back to it every once in awhile. It is certainly worth your time, specially if you've got a few friends to play with. It is also worth your money, very much so if you can get it on sale.Pros:Awesome multiplayer.Funny.Well presented narrative.Level editor adds loads of replay value.Cons:Shallow gameplay.Campaign is pointless for the serious of temperament."

Personally I enjoyed it I thought it was pretty interesting although it could be better in some ways. Secondly, the jokes he makes are what some people call potty-mouth jokes, and makes some near misses at some other... words. -_- However it is a very humorous and fun to play. Sometimes the narrarator will make wisecracks and jokes during the level playing. Also... there is a level maker, in which you can build, test, and post your levels in these things called 'playlists' which each act like a chapter of a story. Once you have completed your playlist you may keep it to yourself or post it to the workshop where-in other people can download it and play the levels inside it as well. Overall it is a really nice game for what the price is now. (like $15 i think) I definitely recommend this game to people who like funny jokes such as ""... it smells like doo-doo casserole with a side of butt-salad"" and players whom just love this kind of games made by Behemoth. Behemoth definitely did a good job on this particular game and I hope you enjoy it!"

The announcer praises your good performance, while hilariously mocking each failed attempt with a witty comment. Definitely a good game to play (whether solo, or multiplayer)."

I really enjoy the levels which are really well composed. The levels get gradually harder and callenging as you expect. It really is a fantastic game for those who enjoy a little puzzle with their platforming.I think it gets really hard that eventually you have to give up on every level and have no other way to get to the next level than to finish the one you're on, which takes hours. Despite this, the game has co-op, user-created levels, arena battles against your friends or random users and much more. It has so many possibilities, game modes and levels for you to enjoy, but if you get tired of others levels, you can make your own levels!Overall, this game is one of my favourite games and I recommend it to anyone that is having doubts about buying.

The game really shines with it's multiplayer, however, especially with friends. Whether you're actively trying to reach the goal or send one another to your demise, there's hardly ever a dull moment. The game provides a handful of interesting and fun weapons to aid you in each stages, as well as numerous different head styles to customize your character any way you like.Unfortunately, the game doesn't have much replay value, as nothing new is unlocked upon completion, however you can go back to any level to try to best your time or obtain every collectible. The stages vary between single and multiplayer, so it's worth it to play through both campaigns to really get your money's worth.Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an incredibly lighthearted yet challenging puzzle platformer, and especially if you're looking to experience it with a friend."

Hell this game's opening cutscene tells you that this game is gonna be awesome! So lets start with the Story shall we?Story: The opening cutscene tells you that this awesome narrator is going to tell you (the player) a little story. So there once was a ship with tons of friends hundreds of them. But there was the friendliest friend of all! His name was Hatty Hattington (super creative i know) and he was the most charming, kindest, and dashing man of all. So everyone was out on the journey on the S.S Friendship (nice pun Behemoth) when most unfortunately a massive storm brewed (the narrators sound effects for this are amazing btw) then it calmed down. Hatty then checks on everyone to see if they are okay and everyone was fine until the storm came back much bigger this time. Then after dozens of friends were dropped into the sea they crash landed on an island with a strange theater run by, oddly enough, CATS! Then as you enter the theater you see two cats putting a glowing red hat on Hatty then the cats proceed to capture you. I'm not gonna go any further than that if you wanna see more play the game for yourself trust me you will love it!Now to the gameplay!Gameplay: This game at its core is a 2D sidescrolling platformer. Unlike Mario though this game adds more collecting to the mix. You need to grab 3 gems to open the exit and advance to the next stage. However, there are more than 3 gems and a yarn ball in every stage. Collect them all and you will a nice A on your card at the end. Do it fast enough and you get an A++ meaning you get 2 extra gems! When you get to the end of a chapter you will play a time trial level where you have a time limit to get to the exit and grab gems along the way. There are also encore levels which you unlock when you beat the chapter. These are just like the end levels accept much more difficult and some times a pain in the neck to complete. There are in one stage in every chapter is a bonus level hidden somewhere in the stage. When you see a red weird looking bird you know there a is a secret stage somewhere. When you find it the screen will swirl and go black for a split second and now you are in a room with tons of gems, a yarn ball, and the best secret level song ever created in the history of gaming. Be forewarned though that these stages end the entire level once you beat them and the game will give a B at the highest so if you want an A go back into the stage and replay it this time don't do the secret stage. Now for the last thing i will probably have to explain about the gameplay is the Gift shop. This is about the only reason you will come back to this game. Here you can spend your hard earned gems to get heads. These heads you can wear and play as them as separate characters. I haven't collected them all yet but i do know some people who have and there is a ton of them. There are also many different weapons you can get with 5 yarn balls. Some are very useful such as the darts which you can use to make platforms.That's enough of the gameplay now lets get into the community.Community: The Community is very good in this game. This game has a level creator. You can create your own easy levels, tricky levels, or outright jerkish levels with this. You can upload these so others can play them. Its a very cool concept that lots of other games have done but im glad they put in.Ending: Well, the ending isn't what you'd expect. The ending is you get this awesomely funny song sung by the narrator himself. And then he proceeds to sing a very random yet fast-paced song about buckling your pants.Cons: This game can get pretty repetitive but the gameplay still stays fun nonetheless. There isn't a ton of memorable music IMO. I think about the only thing that comes to mind are the two ending songs and the secret song. The stage music is catchy but i can never really remember it well. This game has a major difficulty spike at chapter 5 like seriously it gets very hard even with two people. But once you get through it you feel like you accomplished something.And that's my review of Battleblock Theater! 1-10 i would rate it a nice 9 it just does what other platformers don't do all the time. I really hope i persuaded you to buy the game and try for yourself! Have a wonderful day!P.S I know there are online game modes but i havent gotten the chance to play with anyone since pretty much no one i know owns the game. I will also commend Behemoth for making the best platformer I've ever played."

I'm always on the hunt for hotseat co-op games, and this one has been a blast for my girlfriend and I to play together. For someone like her who hasn't played many games, this one was really fun for her as she got the hang of it. The fact that you can die an infinite number of times during a level with little consequence makes this game just challenging enough that once we'd get something right, we felt accomplished, without the process being too frustrating or demoralizing. Collecting all the funny looking prisoners creates a reason for us to go back and get better scores in some levels to get more gems, and user-created levels will add a great deal of replay value, which is great for us if we're looking to spend an evening playing games.If you're someone who has someone in their life that isn't much of a gamer, or just a casual gamer, this is a real great game to pick up and laugh as you play."

This game is pretty relaxing, so long as you don't do the last chapters. You can also do this game in Co-op with a friend. You can do 4 playthroughs in this game doing Solo, Co-op, Solo Insane, and Co-op Insane. That'll keep you busy.You can also change your character (only the head, its purely cosmetic and doesn't do anything special to help you in the game other than to look different), but you have to free them first by giving the kittys some shiny gems :3. There are 256 Prisoners for you to free and 64 special prisoners (heads) you can get through a special event. So, 320 Prisoners (heads) in all!I haven't started Insane mode yet, but when I do, I'll probably be raging a lot. I haven't done much of online yet other than trying out user created levels. Which were both fun and BS. Unique and.... Not so unique.Not much to say about the online battle modes. I did try each one at least once and some of them were fun. But really, the battle modes are only fun if the user has created it to be fun and unique.Final Word. I'd recomend this game, but only if its on sale. Due to user created stuff, this game will last awhile. You will have fun, and you will rage. Maybe you won't rage and the game will come naturally to you. I hope you liked my review. Enjoy the game and I hope you don't rage at it to much!"

However, on on journey, they get caught up in a massive storm and are shipwrecked on an island full of cat-people, who then make them collect gems in a maze for entertainment. It has much humor, although cruel sometimes, which is much to my taste. I also enjoy the concept of weapons and punching cats in the face with land-mines and such (much wrong button pressing is done by myself) and just the gameplay in general is just amazing. I love the sarcastic narrorator and especially the cut scenes, which deffinently give the game character. Although it is meant for the computer on steam, I recommend a controller, as some may struggle to find keys. Overall, this game is worth every penny!I give it the Ravens' Seal of Aproval!"

It is highly recommended to use a controller (works fine with an Xbox controller on PC). It is not overly difficult, although some of the last few levels are downright frustrating. The mechanics are good, the control is good, everything about it is just a good game.However, the reason a lot of people really like the game is the writers are completely insane. It's funny, it's strange, the voiceovers are great, the animation is hilarious, the sound effects are good.. everything just comes together for it.So, good platformer, only minor puzzles, and downright bizarre worldviews.

After watching the trailer for Battleblock Theater, I thought I'd give platformers another try.Battleblock Theater is a platformer for gamers that hate platformers.  It offers numerous checkpoints for people like me who hate repeating the whole level because I twitch-jumped to death on accident 20 minutes into the level.  There's no ""lives"" that end the game on you because your not as coordinated as most platformers require you to be.  The levels are quick and easy to traverse, and it can be played in short sessions.  There's tons of tradeable/sellable collectibles that you can earn in game that not only alter game play, but offset the cost if you're really good at steam trading.All in all, it's a great little game with a whole hell of a lot of attitude and humor.I highly recommend it!"

You play as the unnamed hero who has to save his friends from a decaying theater with an outraged crew of mutated cats. Once a happy theater run by Mr. Furbottom, a talented cat trainer who ran a circus-like series of acts. The platforming is amazing. You can alternate between being happy and turning cats into skeletons using your Acid weapon, to wanting to falcon punch your computer's screen into a million little pieces. The game has a masterfully hilarious story, which kept me laughing constantly. The story was not too long, nor too short. There are a few problems, though. Matchmaking completely dead now. You can find a few people playing story mode, but they're too controlling. The marketing is dying. You can get buyers, but the items you get aren't worth the effort of selling.An amazing, fun, family friendly experience. I'd rate 9.5/10 Would buckle my pants."

,Recommended,238460,13189469,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,👑 Magic Potato 👑,"Battleblock Theater start you out with one of the best intros I have ever seen! Seriously, it's really humourous. And then it drops you into the game and its really fun. This game uses lots of elements that we have seen before from other platformers, but the game (sure its fun to play) shine in the narrator. He is always mocking you for missing a jump and dying etc. He's pretty humourous and make you chuckle lots of times... and then the occasional laugh out loud moment. (By far, one of the best lines in the game ""...cuz that stuff is like doo doo casarole with a side of butt salad"")(How is the gameplay?) The gameplay is similar to Super Mario, where you enter each world and each world has a certain amount of levels in it. Each level contains gems to collect (max is 7) and the almighty yarn ball. Each time you find a gem (or yarn) you feel a little sense of joy in you, which is good, since that is what the game should do. The gameplay is pretty fun, although can get a bit repetetive unfortunately, so what I would do is play this in short bursts (30 min - 1 hour) so that the repetetive nature of this game doesn't affect you.The game could've stopped there (with its features) and it would've easily gotten a 7/10 (which is an average score but still good), but then they decided to add 2 player co-op, 4 player arena battles (I can imagine it would be very messy in a good way) and a level editor where you can upload your levels to the Steam Workshop. These features are pretty simaler to Little Big Planet, but in this case, it's not a bad thing. I have easily lost 2 hours into making levels and perfecting them, and I enjoyed it. The level editor doesn't feel tedious for me.(How is the co-op?) Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test out the co-op at the time of review, I will be playing the co-op with my friend though, so I'll be able to tell you wether it is good or not! (but I imagine it is)The game runs really well, no framerate drops, no crashes at all, no clunky menues, everything about this game's performance is perfect. The options menu give you the option to put it in 1080p as well! Overall, the performance is great!(Overall) This game is really fun! It combines stupid humour that for some reason makes you laugh, similar but nonetheless very satisfying gameplay and great feutures that let you play with friends and lose a few more hours into this game. I rate it an 8/10, I recommend it if you like platformers, but if not, then maybe skip it. If you like games with humour (as long as you don't mind this humour being a bit childish in a good way), definetely pick this one up.Thnx 5 redin111 :P :D"

,Recommended,238460,13290788,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,Akira Kurojawa,"BattleBlock Theateris one of the dumbest and silliest games I have ever played. It's also really,reallyfun.The game itself is a pretty run-of-the-mill platformer, but it becomes so much more thanks to the presence of the Narrator, voiced by Will Stamper, who infuses each of the game's nine cutscenes with a cheeky, over-the-top performance. Stamper's dedication to the role, combined with a memorable visual style (each cutscene has the appearance of a child-friendly puppet show), really brings the humor forth.The really neat thing, though, is that the Narrator will stick around throughout the game, even as you play, making asinine (and hilarious) remarks about whatever you're doing. For example, upon grabbing a ball of golden yarn, the Narrator may quip, ""Putthatin your scarf and... knit it,"" or he might launch into a sarcastic anecdote about how yarn was invented by Stanley Yarn in 1984 to lure cats into people's homes, because meat was very expensive. Sounds stupid? It is. But Stamper makes it work, and the results are award-worthy.The voice-work really helps elevate the experience, because the gameplay, while fun, isn't really all that special. The main character runs, jumps, punches, and throws weapons in an attempt to gather gems that he can use to save his friends from the adorable evil that has captured them. Sometimes there are enemies, but usually, you're just moving through insane obstacle courses. Many of them are quite fun and a handful are genuinely impressive, but there are a few that will likely make many players rage, and not in a good way. The final encore level is the worst offender by far, and will have you wondering, ""What were they thinking when they made this?"" For the most part, however, the game is a blast, and you can play the story mode solo or with a friend.The singleplayer / co-op is pretty one-note gameplay-wise, but you'll be glad to know thatBattleBlock Theater's multiplayer offers a wide variety of game modes, each of which feels unique and is entertaining in its own way. You'll also be able to unlock a dozen or so weapons to use in the game, and there's hundreds (literally) of heads that you can ""rescue"" and use to customize your character.The story is pretty incidental, and you probably won't get too invested in it, which is good, because the ending goes off on this weird tangent that doesn't explain anything. This is purposeful, of course, and it's hilarious as all get out, but it's a bit unsatisfying if you were hoping for something with closure. Or even something that makes sense, really, because it doesn't.I was surprised to find myself so addicted toBattleBlock Theater. It's an absolute blast to play, and it has a wonderful sense of style. It's clear the Behemoth put a lot of effort into this one, and although the results aren't perfect, the game is well worth playing, and should keep you entertained for a long while. I know I had a lot of fun with it. Putthatin your scarf and knit it.8.5 out of 10."

,Recommended,238460,12206047,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,scali.exe,"I'll just start off with this: I loved this game on the Xbox. So when I heard of a Steam Edition coming, I was hyped. BattleBlock Theater is one of those games that you can't help but throw your controller/keyboard at the screen, but come to play it over and over again.The plot is simple: You were on a boat of 200+ friends led by Hatty Hattington, who happens to be the greatest of friends, when BAM! Your ship crashes on an abandoned island. You later go out to explore the island, learning that this is home to the once-famed BattleBlock Theater, which is now inhabited by cats. You later find Hatty with 2 of the cats, and they put an evil-looking hat on him, causing him to suddenly stab you and your friends in the back, and hold you prisoner in the theater. Forced to perform in an audience of cats for their amusement. As you progress, you find out more about the theater and what  the actual hell is going on, all on a quest to escape with Hatty, the new owner and CEO of BattleBlock Theater.BattleBlock Theater is a simple platformer with a simple concept: Gather at least 3 gems on the way to the exit of the level. Simple, right? Hahaha, I wish. There are plenty of obstructions to keep you busy along the way to the exit. Mortars, Heat-Seeking Missiles, Cat Guards that may sometimes spit out fireballs, water (you apperently can't swim), and many, many more obstacles. Eventually, these obstacles will be arranged in such a fashion that will make most of the later levels seem unfair. There are also time trials at the end of each chapter, so, as quoted from in-game, ""RUN LIKE YOU HAVE DIAHREEA.""The gems you collect can be used in the gift shop to unlock new prisoners at random. You can also find balls of yarn in the levels, which can be used to bribe the cats for weapon-tools, which you can switch out. You can also trade the prisoners, weapons, and gems/yarn with other players.There is also a battle mode, which allows you to play different gamemodes such as capture the horse, king of the hill, and muckle, just to name a few. These will also give you gems, based on how well you perform.The music in-game fits well, and is charming. Also, the talented Stamper is narrating your entire epic, so prepare for some lolage.There's also a level creator, allowing you to create your own levels and battle arenas and share them on the workshop. I've seen some rage-inducing levels made by community members. If the levels are good enough, they will get featured in Furbottom's Features, where the best of community-created levels reside.Overall, BattleBlock Theater, while not the best platformer, is pretty damn fun. I highly recommend you pick this one up if you want to make/break some friendships.And be sure to buckle your pants throughout the entirety of this game."

It all starts when a grandiose storyteller puts you through a series of unfortunate events, which result in your captivity at a strange old theater. You are then forced to perform shows in a platformer style co-op game, where you collect items to free your friends (this unlocks new faces) and receive random weapons.

The comedy is the funniest I've seen, way better than Castle Crashers.It has fun and challenging puzzles that increase in difficulty as you progress through the story, although I haven't really played the Multiplayer feature, apparently it is really good! Whoever voiced the narrator in the game is an absolute great voice actor, his comedy in the cutscenes and while playing will have you in tears.Very smooth gameplay, hardly no bugs or glitches that I've found while playing and has tons of replay value. Character customization is great and the story funny and charming!If you have to pick between this and Castle Crashers, in my honest opinion, it would be BattleBlock TheaterRECOMMENDED :)Best played with a controller"

It was made by the same people who made Castle Crashers, so a friend and I decided to watch the trailer. After watching the trailer I literally said: ""I don't care if the gameplay is bad, I want this game just because the trailer is amazing."" I then bought the two pack for me and a friend to play co-op.And let me say, this game is as amazing as the trailer. The voice acting that they did for the narrator is just amazing. In the cutscenes, the sound effects are just 10/10. A friend and I have began playing through the co-op and so far, it has been a lot of side-aching laughs.Overall this game is amazing, but if you want the full experience I suggest getting on Skype and playing co-op. This game is already HILARIOUS but with a friend it is just 500% better. You can work as a team to get the level done quickly and perfectly, or you can♥♥♥♥♥♥around and have the best time ever.

I had missed out on the console version and just never bothered getting it. I enjoyed Castle Crashers and when they released the bundle for steam I thought, ""What the heck?"". One of the better decisions in gaming. The Narrator (StamperTV) is one of, if not, the best part of the game. His dialogue over the puppet cutscenes are hysterical especially his sound effects. The gameplay is fun and not too difficult but can be quite aggravating. The music is great too with a great secret level theme.

You will start with a number of default player settings, but as you progress, you will have a LOT of things to pick from to enhance your experience while playing. (The narration style even made me laugh.)That's not all, you can also bring friends (or family) along to play, either from your own computer or on the Internet to co-operate OR battle against each other (Co-Op needs 2 players and competitive matches need 4).Artistically talented or want something else other than the faces the game already provided?

All you need is a digital art program of choice (Don't use MS Paint though, it doesn't have transparency feature), empty, transparent 128x128 image template and for you to draw a head from scratch or take one from other sources, then save and put it in your game data.(On Windows: Computer > [YOUR USERNAME](C)/: > Program Files (if you have a 64-bit system, STEAM usually is located in Program Files (x86) > Steam > SteamApps > common > BattleBlock Theater > GameData > UserFaces)You can also create your own levels and publish them in the Steam Workshop for other players to download and play.So what are you waiting for? Go grab this game and experience the fun!(The only drawback is that you may end up having rage-inducing moments with some puzzles. Other than that, feel free buy this game and play it if you have some spare time and money!)"

Most games take the Mario Bros. or Metroid route where you're either going from point A to point B or exploring an open world. BattleBlock Theater takes the Lode Runner path less travelled and drops you into a seires of rooms where you need to collect enough items to unlock the exit.Where Lode Runner-style games were mostly about enemy avoidance BattleBlock Theater hits a really good mix where each level offers bite-sized adventures that require platforming, exploring, and light puzzle solving to progress. The difficulty curve is good and it mostly hits that tough-but-not-too-tough feeling.Dan Paladin's distinctive art style that's become synonymous with Behemoth games is on full display here as usual but it's the ridiculous cut-scenes voiced by Chris Stamper that will probably be what most people remember from the game. They're silly and nonsensical, but hit a charmingly juvenile range and sound like a fairytale as told by an insane person. Stamper also manages to be one of the most listenable announcers in a videogame that I can recall offering color commentary as you navigate the game's stages. Yeah, you'll shut him up eventually once his one-liners are played out and repeat for the umpteenth time, but the charm lasts far longer than any other game."

What about crazy humor that kicks it up to 11 once in awhile?If you said yes to any one of those questions, then this is a great game to add to your collection. BattleBlock Theater is another fantastic puzzle/platformer game from Behemoth that makes you insanely frustrated from the inability to complete a level one moment but the next your laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off from the stupid humor that plays during cut scenes and commentary throughout the levels.Scoring wise, I give the game a 9/10 ( 10/10 humor, 8/10 level design - most levels feel reused, 9/10 audio and visuals, 9/10 for gameplay)."
,Recommended,238460,10845960,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,✪ script,"All Behemoth games have featured laughs, usually in the form of sight-gags and others jokes lurking beneath the surface. Battleblock Theater brings this humor to the forefront, and it successfully permeates the entire experience – from the narrator’s manic opening monologue to the multiple songs that play over the end credits. The writing mixes poop jokes with pop-culture references, punctuated by higher-brow, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it self-referential humor. Between-world cutscenes in most platformers are good opportunities to get up and grab a snack. Here, they’re a highlight.When your ship full of friends (BBT makes sure to point out that this is a true ""friend ship,"" har har) crashes onto an island jail run by intelligent catBattleBlock TheaterApril 3, 2013A side-scrolling action game by videogame developer The Behemoth, the studio behind Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.→  Much MoreJustin Davis SaysMore Xbox Platforming Bliss:Ms. Splosion ManSpelunkySuper Meat Boyguards, your only choice is to platform through 80+ levels for their feline amusement. It sounds crazy, written out... but it works. The Behemoth fully commits to the premise and has a ton of fun with it. Balls of yarn hidden in each stage can be redeemed in a prison black market for power-ups. The narrator promises “sandpaper kisses” for doing well.You command your customizable prisoner with standard platforming controls – jump, double-jump, wall-jump… nothing out of the ordinary. Everything feels snappy and responsive, and I rarely felt like the controls betrayed me and caused my death, even in the hairiest segments. But BattleBlock Theater’s moment-to-moment movement doesn’t compare favorably to recent 2D platforming greats like Super Meat Boy. Movement is a little stiffer, the physics a little less intuitive.The simple hand-to-hand combat system is more disappointing. You can dispatch enemies (or fellow players in multiplayer) with simple punches, kicks, and special attacks, but it lacks the precision found in the jumping. With no real attack priority, combat rapidly devolves into random button-mashing. Luckily, the bulk of the single-player campaign focuses on spot-on jumps and not enemy cat combat.Horse riding... BattleBlock Theater style.BattleBlock Theater’s wildly inventive stage design is undoubtedly its greatest draw. It offers up some of the most clever, satisfying, and varied 2D platforming in years. Eight worlds are loosely sorted into gameplay themes, each stage building and tweaking ideas established in the previous one. My favorite set of stages are all designed to force two runs – once with a (relatively) easier set of challenges, and then a second time after hitting a trigger to activate lasers, disappearing blocks, roving saw blades, or some other added bit of trickiness. No idea is used twice; if an idea does repeat it’s sufficiently escalated to really put your platforming skills to the test.Stages alternate between pure Super Meat Boy-style skill and puzzle-platforming ala Braid or Toki Tori – sometimes within a few moments of each other. The variety is welcome and well-executed, and does a great job of propelling you from stage to stage. But the platforming feels better in other games, and the puzzling is lacking a hook like Braid’s time mechanics – it’s mostly pushing blocks.BattleBlock Theater doubles down on its jack-of-all-trades nature in its sheer ridiculous size. This is a truly gigantic game, guaranteed to keep completionists busy for literally dozens of hours. After clearing the seven- or eight-hour campaign, you still have 24 tossed-in-just-because bonus stages (three per world) to run through. Each stage also has a gold-medal time and eight hidden collectibles, all of which are needed for the coveted A++ score. These doodads aren’t afterthoughts, either, as most are hidden behind clever mini-puzzles or optional platforming sections. After all that’s done, true masochists can do it all again on Insane Mode – a difficulty that removes the generously placed mid-stage checkpoints. Whew!01:36BattleBlock Theater - Release Date TrailerThis would already be an incredible amount of content, but The Behemoth decided to throw in the kitchen sink while they were at it. A complete set of level-authoring tools is also included, letting anyone create and share their own custom creations. Curated playlists of the best fan-made levels are promised for months to come.And that's just the single-player portion. BattleBlock Theater also includes a robust collection of cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes via local play or Xbox Live Arcade. Multiplayer, especially the seven competitive Arena modes, doesn’t ever feel like more than an added-on curiosity, though. I enjoyed the frantic fun of knocking opponents off my turf in King of the Hill, but the iffy combat controls make it unlikely that these modes will be more than one-and-done diversions. Some of the other platforming-centered multiplayer options, such as level races, feel like they have much more potential for longer-term fun."

As someone who is fairly new to pc gaming, I found this game to be very inviting.  The controls are easy to learn and master, and pulling off crazy combos in order to get that ball of yarn in incredibly satisfying.  The incorporation of spending the jewels to unlock customization items, and balls of yarn to unlock new weapons is brilliant.  The grading system for each level brings out your inner tryhard, trying oh so very hard to get that conveted A+.  And the narrator is hilarious. If you like puzzles, funny deaths, and destroying (or creating) friendships, then this is the perfect game for you. 5 yarn balls out of 5."

,Recommended,238460,11273864,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,Peekles,"First things first: this is one of the funniest games that you will ever play. And here's why; the narrator is absolutely out of his mind, the plot consists of cats who have somehow taken prisoners, and you get the opportunity to change your character's face and color each and every time that you play. Now if that doesn't make you want this game then you should have your head checked immediately, because something just ain't right up there.Aside from the hilarious lines and the evil evil kitties, this game is a surprisingly fun platformer that will keep you entertained until the very end. The levels aren't long, but can get extremely frustrating from time to time, especially if you're trying to collect every gem. And even though there aren't any ""bosses"" in the game, the last level of every floor is timed, and can be pretty difficult to get through. All-in-all, if you're looking for a new platformer to sink your teeth in to, consider picking this game up as it's one of the best platformers on Steam.And if you don't, then you'd better watch your back, because the cats are surely coming for you. Oh yeah, and did I mention that the soundtrack is totally awesome? Because it is. And anyone who knows their platformers knows how incredibly important a killer soundtrack can be. What are you still doing here? Go! Now! Get this game!"

If you play together you need to cooperate, but you can also innocently troll each other.

Also, you respawn really fast.If you don't have a friend you could play solo and have equal amount of fun, since, as you can see from a trailer, announcer is quite entertaining + you don't need a friend since if you play singleplayer levels are a bit different than multiplayer."

I'm not a fan of strategy games, but this one is at the top of it's class. It's like one of a kind. It's truly charming and just all around entertaining. Never a dull moment with Hatty Hattington!"

You play his friends and after being captured by theatre guardsmen (the kitties) you are forced to perform for their amusement, collecting gems and yarn while figuring out how to save Mr. Hatty.Unlock more friends and weapons as you play along, either in single player or co-operative two player where you and your friend will really have to work hand in hand to complete the levels and survive.If that isn't enough, go online and battle versus other players or play content created by them... heck, why not create your own?The online downside I've been able to find to this game is the limited soundtrack. That's not a big minus though. So what are you waiting for... grab this game and grab a friend!"
,Recommended,238460,10792900,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Leon Kuwanker,"BattleBlock Theatre has finally been released on Steam after is arrived only for Xbox Live in 2013, the game has you going through dangerous performances to gain gems for the broken down, cat infested theatre that has taken your friend Hatty Hattington and made him manager, only he doesn’t seem to be doing anything, you’re on a quest to please the kitty crowd whist saving your friends whist the staff slowly descend into madness. What’s great about this game is how it tests both your thinking skills and reflexes as you go through the level trying to collect everything as quick as you can, all whist YouTuber StamperTV narrates with an entertaining voice, and with a chance to get a better score and unlockable there’s a lot of replay value. You also are able to customise your own levels and export them to the steam workshop where you can also play other user’s levels. In the end this is a really enjoyable flash game and one I will be going back to over and over again."

Normally, I don't like platformers, so I didn't expect much. Originally, I started playing it by myself just to get a feel for the controls so I wouldn't be going in blind with my friend.THREE HOURS LATER I REALIZED I HADN'T GOTTEN UP FROM MY SEAT TO EAT OR DRINK OR EVEN GO TO THE BATHROOM. THIS GAME. THIS GAME WILL BE THE END OF ME.No but it's a lot of fun and the cutscenes are hilarious and the visuals are all extremely appealing. It also gets reeeeally challenging later on."

This game can be played both in single player and multiplayer, which I absolutely love. If none of my friends can get together to play, at least I have the option of playing several levels on my mine. Although the art style is rather basic, it's still humorous and enjoyable to look at. I only play for a little while, but I really recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh while still being challenged."

I hate collecting items while trying to prevent capture or death and I hate jumping while trying to do so. That being said, I love this game. Sure its a platformer, but it doesn't feel like one. There is a plot and the voice acting is top notch. The puzzles aren't so hard you feel like an idiot and you don't have to collect all the items on a level to pass. This game takes an old classic video game genre and makes it a fun, entertaining mix."
