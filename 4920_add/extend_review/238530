The more of the same color touching, the bigger the combo bonus when you blast them with your ray-gun! That's essentially the core element of Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe, shooting blocks in larger and larger groups for higher and higher combos in order to collect gems and unlock new areas and outfits!Each new area comes with its own tileset, music, trap-blocks, and total gems needed to ""complete"" the area. Gems are earned by collecting bits from blasting blocks and clusters of blocks. Grab enough or get a big enough combo and a gem will drop for you to collect. Completing certain other ""tasks"" will unlock different outfits or characters to choose from. Each outfit comes with its own set of stats and abilities, each one having its own strengths and weaknesses.Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe hits the action, puzzle, and indie spots tremendously well. The music is great and keeps the game at a fast pace while the sound effects blend perfectly into it. Bright, colorful, and simple animations are pleasing to the eye and easy to keep up with during quick bouts of frantic, block-shooting fun. The multiplayer is great and the game is a solid buy for the price. Get it. Right now."
,Recommended,238530,10675761,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Matsuoka,"This title, although small, is a great send-up to the 3rd and 4th generations of gaming. Players can choose one of nine different outfits, each with thier own ability (for example: Ninja offers double-jumping; Domino Mask utilizes two-way shooting), and endure amidst a small arena of falling blocks. Jump, shoot and strategize your way to a high score.As for the gameplay itself, the premise is simple: survive as long as possible, with no time limit. This quickly becomes a welcome challenge, as numerous traps [and blocks] will appear according to the players' level (goes up to four; the higher the level, the more difficult it is to survive). Each map has its' own set of traps. Usually, it is a better option to wait for the screen to fill at least halfway, as connected adjacent blocks of the same colour will all explode when shot as a combo. As blocks explode, they drop block bits, which add 1 point on thier own. Collect enough bits in a row, and an invincibility star will appear.Get this title while it's still only 2 dollars; it's worth it. The game has a small footprint as well, being under a gigabyte, as well as lower specs."

This game is addicting and fun, on the level of Robot Unicorn Attack. Although I didn't really care for any of the unlockable characters, but it's good to have some variety to find one's style of play. Is this the triple A title GOTY you've been looking for, with a level system, perks, killer story, killer graphics, and hardcore gameplay? No, it is not, but it is a fun little title that should not be ignored. Buy it, play it, and play it, and play it, and play it, and play it..."
,Recommended,238530,811642,"Posted: 1 June, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"This is a slightly different take on the 'match colored gems' genre. Blocks will fall out of the sky, randomly, and it's your job, as a playable character, to destroy these blocks with your gun. If you shoot a block, all the other blocks connected it will also be destroyed. As long as they're the same color. Destroyed blocks will give you stars and earning enough of these stars will level up your character allowing him to shoot much faster and also to get hit should a block fall on him. Your level equals the number of times you can get hit, except if you fall onto the spikes or a weaponized block hits you. So, a level 3 character allows you to get hit 3 times. It's a challenging game, but you'll learn how to play it in a matter of minutes. 'Easy to learn, hard to master' has been never more appropriate.Collecitng enough stars will unlock new outfits that give you more abilites, like a double jump or a jetpack, making the game slightly easier.The retro graphics are charming and the music is pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive after a few games.There are also challenges to be unlocked, but instead of relying on skills, they actually rely on memory. They can be frustrating, but fun, since they only last 30 seconds.Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe is a great game for all those who love games like Bejeweled, even if it doesn't use the exact same gameplay mechanic.[Rating: 71/100]"
,Recommended,238530,10717345,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,ᴄʜʀᴏɴɪᴋᴇʀ,"Where can I begin?This game is one of the most fun and addictive titles I've played in a while.It's exactly what it says it is, a Puzzle Platformer. The puzzle aspect is quite simple; there are multicolored blocks that cascade from the sky, and your primary objective is to destroy them. Same colored blocks can connect, and chain for extra points. Massive combos result in massive amounts of points (buckle your pants, you're in for a massive amount of screen shaking.)Now, the platforming part is where the fun begins. In addition to the puzzling, your next objective is survival. It's an endurance test. You'll need quick reflexes and lots of caution when blocks are falling from the sky - but that's not all you need to be wary of. Various stage hazards appear from time to time and vary from each world. Each hazard making the gameplay a ton of fun, as well as somewhat frustrating from time to time. A wise person will avoid letting hazards stack up. (Trust me.)While the gameplay remains the same through each world, each world feels fresh as you play through them. As stated previously, each world adds new hazards, and you're in for a surprise every time. The graphics on each stage look great, and the music for each stage is even better.In addition to solid gameplay, Super Puzzle Platformer has quite a few unlockables - various costumes that grant different bonuses and change how fast your character moves, how high they jump, and how strong their breaking abilites are. If you're feeling brave, there are also unlockable challenges that are both fun and, well, challenging. (They get pretty darn hard.)This game even added some words to my normal vocabulary, I'll be calling things radical, jazzy, smokin', and nifty from now on.Overall, I can't not recommend this game. Vibrant, colorful, retro graphics and a kickass soundtrack that are reminiscent of the Sega Genesis, simple and solid controls, with simple and great gameplay, as well as long lasting re-playability make this title shine. My only gripe would be the massive screenshake on very large combos. It can be pretty disorenting, but makes those combos feel worth it. I love everything about this game.At the time of writing this review, I've only got a couple hours logged. But I'm extremely satisfied with this game, and I can't wait to log some more hours. 10 / 10."

The basic idea is that this is a matching block breaker type game, except you don't have any control over how the blocks fall.  Instead, you're a guy on top.  The game actually plays like a platformer, except you score points by breaking blocks.  The bigger your combo (the more of one color that you break in one combo) the more you score.  There's some exp type things that raise your general attack power.  You also immediately level down upon taking some forms of damage (some damage out right ends the game, like falling on spikes),  As you progress you unlock new stages which in turn have their own unique mechanics that don't typically appear within other stages.  Certain stages (♥♥♥♥ing fire cave, for example) are harder than the end ones simply because of the design of their mechanics.There are also some challenges and those were fun, though they're more about learning the progression of the drops than anything else.Additionally, there are different characters that have different abilities but I never found myself wanting to use any of these.  The base character is pretty balanced and his ability is good.The music is pretty good in Super Puzzle Platformer and I really enjoyed listening to the sound track.Graphics are graphical.  They don't get in the way but they're also not super fancy.  They work.If I had any negative things to say it would be how the difficulty curve scales (that ♥♥♥♥ing fire cave, world 3 or 4, is pretty hard but later stages aren't really).  That, and if you're an achievement hunter then yeah, this game can go ♥♥♥♥ itself lol.  Most of the achievements aren't hard and I had fun doing them (beating challenges, clearing stages, getting max level on stages).  However, the ones that suck ♥♥♥♥ing suck.  Although not the worst, there is an achievement for dying 1k times: sorry, I don't want to play this game that much; even grinding that out would be a massive hassle.The worst, however, involves lasting for an inordinate amount of time in a stage to unlock a special challenge.  There is a challenge for each stage and clearing one of these challenges earns you an achievement.  These challenges are pretty tough to unlock and I gave up on them.  Not interested in the time it takes to get that.Those two points, the achievements and the difficulty, are pretty minor though.  I count this as a great game and I think everyone should play it.  It deconstructs the puzzle genre very well."
,Recommended,238530,4830129,"Posted: 30 August, 2013",all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Buy? Maybe. It's a very challenging block puzzler that plays a bit like Mr. Driller or Egg Mania (YEAH! Just made you google that obscure game) where you control a character instead of the actual block drops. Shoot blocks for XP shards (which look almost exactly like the ones from Cave Story), which make your weapon stronger. Connected blocks of the same color reward more XP and points. Be carefull, as shooting a block combo from under you can mean death if you don't jump in time. Other hazards can make things difficult. It has the sharpness and solidity I've started to see in other Adult Swim games, but the difficulty is no joke - get ready to kick♥♥♥♥♥or get yours kicked. If you were looking foward to this game already or if this kinda of game appeals to you, I don't see any reason for you not to enjoy it other than the somewhat unforgiving difficulty. If you have a passing interest and already have other games you're interested in, then you're not missing much, though it may be pretty fun with local co-op."
,Recommended,238530,18683433,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,genoforprez,"It's very frustrating at first, because pretty much everything instantly kills you, and there are a lot of rules that you just have to learn by dying, and also some nuance to the rules that you just have to learn by accident or via the special challenges (e.g. if you jump or fall onto spikes, it instantly kills you, but if you walk onto spikes that are the same horizontal level as you, it's totally safe).It's extremely challenging, but once you die enough to figure out what in the hell is going on, it's actually a really creative idea for a falling block game. Extremely challenging, but honestly very fun. Especially once you start unlocking alternate characters with different special abilities. (The dual wield character is my jam.)I'll give this one the thumbs up. Especially if it's in a sale."

Blocks are shot to destroy them (with adjacent matches destroyed at the same time), creating an ever-shifting landscape to traverse as the player dodges spikes from below and traps falling from above.  The goal of the normal game is just to survive for as long as possible (each level containing different traps and visuals), with unlockable challenge levels placing traps in set locations for a very difficult platforming gauntlet.  The game is loads of fun to play, taking two seemingly unrelated genres and mixing them together in a seamless and easy-to-understand way.  It does suffer from some laggy/glitchy issues that can ruin a run at the worst possible moment, though.NOTE:  The game also has multiplayer in some form, but I have never played it and thus cannot comment."

You shoot the blocks to destroy them and level up your weapon, making sure you don't fall into the spikes at the bottom. As you get more powerful, the stage starts to throw harder obstacles at you, such as spikes, laser beams, cannons, enemies, etc. You unlock new characters, allowing for different playstyles, and new challenging stages as you progress through the game. There are also challenge stages, focusing on specific traps and obstacles. You can pick this up for 10 minutes and end up playing for a couple hours, trying to beat your old high score or unlock something new.

76561197993531522,Recommended,238530,23025981,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,frankieparsons,"GAMEPLAYThe action takes place on one screen. You can move left, right, jump and fire. You first stand on two layers of blocks as blocks start to fall continuously from above. Your job is simple: avoid them, shoot them and don't die. A block takes 3 or 4 hits to be destroyed but all blocks of the same colour that are adjacent to each other explode in the blast. Destroy lots at once for a big score and don't hit the bottom - the spikes cause insta-death. Your quick-thinking decisions will involve where to fire from and which block of blocks to wipe out.PRESENTATION & DESIGNIt's a pixel-art style kept simple. You have a map of an island which is your level-select screen. This has six unlockable areas denoting the six levels to play and the main idea is to try to get your best score on each and attempt to beat it with later playthroughs. Some players will attempt to crack certain conditions to unlock more characters.CONCLUSIONThis is a fast-paced game requiring quick-thinking and quick-reactions. One false move insta-kills you, often prematurely, and this unforgiving nature of the game can make things frustrating. Emotional players will need to be prepared to yell at the screen in despair on more than one occasion - and the fact that you need to wait through a load of animations to get back into the action after death, might just make stress levels worse. Despite this, most patient and balanced individuals will enjoy the blast.4/5For the full review of this and other games please check out or follow my curator page at:Parsons' Garden"

The controls are intuitive, but it doesn't tell you the objective, or the hazards, or anything. It's a delicious break from the norm of agonizing handholding and unskippable tutorial dialogue. But, since learning the game is an experience in itself, I will not state any of that here.Once you get the hang of the rules, it feels like it'd be easy. But as you progress, you start overstepping your boundaries, taking risks you shouldn't, and you'll end up with some awesome close calls. The game is balanced fantastically- You'll almost always see your death coming, and you'll immediately know how you could've avoided it.The multiplayer is good fun with a group of people, and is pretty reminscent of Tetris Attack. Clearing a cluster of three or more blocks sends a hazard to your opponent's screen, and it tends to come down to 'last man standing.' Which usually doesn't take long: It gets hectic fast.The variety of characters all have their different strengths, as well. The starting character can float across the whole stage, while some can fly, another can double jump. Some have strengths in firepower, being able to take out blocks much more quickly, or not suffering knockback from shooting.For what this game is, how much content there is, and its price, this game is a steal. And they recently put out a substantial content patch for free, just out of the blue. So the devs are awesome."

At first I thought it was a decent game but then I just kept getting cheap-shotted by it over and over again. It's visual cues of incoming traps is way too sutble at times. Also the amount of time it takes to get a high score is ridiculous. It can take up to 30 minutes to get up to a minimal high score. But before you can even get a high score you have to power up all the way. Most of the time playing this game you'll be trying  to get to the max level, level 4. But you'll constantly die before reaching it. But when you do reach it you'll be doing the same bland thing for half an hour trying to get a good score. By that time you're about to reach that high score you'll be screwed over by several traps at once making one large impossible to dodge trap. It will happen at complete random and will happen regardless of wether or not you played carefully or dangerously. Not only will you feel cheated in this game all the time you'll also feel quite bored once you get the hang of it. There are no good multipliers. The amount of points you get per cluster of similar colored blocks is nothing even if you fill the screen with them. That in itself is pretty dissapointing, having reached the pinicle of gameplay in half an hour. Finally, again I'd like to mention some of the levels are unfair. There is a glitched level that glitches while you play it and all its purpose is is to cheat you out of satisfaction. Very poor visual cues mixed with missleading visual cues does NOT equal fun! Pile on completely unfair and impossible to dodge traps, while mixing in pixel perfect accuacy and you have this game! YAY!Unless this game is free (I believe it was originally) then I suggest not buying it."

I think I came into it with reasonable expectations, but Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe falls short for me.The gameplay is simple, fast-paced, and controls well once I got used to it.  However there were no instructions or tutorial provided.  I start a game, and I have to guess how to move, how to interact with the blocks, and even what the objective is.  I go to the options to see the controller map, and there isn't one.  You go to controls and you're already changing them, one by one.  I have no idea what the default keys are now.  Plus, the text is hard to read - always inexcusable, 8-bit or not.  My first impression could've been much better with just a little more effort on these points.If you're in the mood for a cheap indie 8-bit platformer built around a few simple mechanics, I'd look at other offerings - VVVVVV, for one."

And, you'll find out that having 10 face keys on a gamepad won't be enough for a game for whose controls equate to move, jump, shoot, and alternate shoot! There really could have been some consolidation of button functions here.Additionally, the game has some really clunky switching from control schemes. I still haven't found out how to go from a keyboard to a controller without a fair amount of confusion and hardship.The gameplay itself however is fairly decent, isn't really an improvement over the original flash game.But the game suffers from terrible and clunky UI problems overall. One such example: The game uses something like a  640x400 resolution blown up to a larger size, which you can view in either fullscreen or windowed. But, you can't reduce the window to the original 640x400, which can be a little oppressive.Also, I found the game's music to be pretty repetitive.Overall I really recommend you skip on this one, but check out the original game on adult swim's website if you are still interested.

You're equipped with a gun, and your job is to shoot these blocks down in colored sets, such that you still have room for moving around, yet you don't open a hole into the spikes below.During your careful shoot-a-thon, the game occasionally changes things up. For example, you might suddenly see spike blocks or cannons falling down into the arena - additional hazards to avoid. These hazards change with the level 'theme' you select.The fun part of this game is that it's so simple, yet complex when you think about it. If you just shoot everything you see, blocks that match colors will open wide holes you'll have to jump into at some point. So, you need to have an ability to plan for at least short-term, on the fly.Music is eeeehhhhh. Original music was better, but this music isn't too bad.Not convinced?

I come back and play for 5-10 minutes at a time every few days, or while waiting for something to download. It's always fun to try and get a new high score in a level, or beat your best record for number of gems grabbed. There are multiple playable characters, with their own movement/attack types that add even more variety past the normal puzzle gameplay. All in all, it's a really good game that I'm glad I picked up."

,Recommended,238530,7744839,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Lt. Commander Data,"Adult Swim Games has done it again. This is one of the most unique games I have ever played. It combines the controls and feel of a side scroller, with a challenging 'Tetris-like' twist. With several levels, different enemy blocks, different characters to play as, and a pretty catchy sound track, the game's replay value is very high. The games sets the bar high when it comes to the high scores. Every level has its own unique high score list that can be very difficult to beat.Multiplayer mode is one of my favorite ways to show my friend's up in this game. Although it is not an online multiplayer, you can play locally on one keyboard or 2 game pads.The 'Challege' mode is also one of my favorite things to do on this game. It includes a plethera of different levels set with only one type of enemy block that you must try to survive.I recommend this game to anybody who also enjoys Tetris and platform high score based games."

Well good thing this came along then.This game combines a casual game with an unforgiving high-speed arcade game. Blocks in one of three (oh how I wish for a mode with four) colours fall from the top of the level for you to walk or run and jump on.Depending on the character you've chosen you might have a double jump, or a jetpack, or extra powerful attack though you're just punching instead of shooting. The character choice offers a bit of variety in the gameplay if you so desire.If you hit a block, any blocks it's touching of the same colour will also get affected, slowly breaking. Once all connected blocks are weakened and you keep attacking them, they'll break apart dropping small triangles to pick up to gain score and level up your weapon with.So far it sounds easy, and it would be, was it just that. Just keep in mind falling to the bottom will kill you. Getting a block on your head will level down your weapon, and if you're level 1, it'll kill you. And did I mention the obstacles? Depending on the world you're playing there will be different blocks to cope with. From simple guns shooting in a straight row to tombstones which cause ghosts to hover around them, or perhaps a dynamite plunger which it would be very unwise of you to jump on top of, or be near when something falls on. Thankfully you can get rid of these items by blowing up a block beside the offending block, just beware it might cause you to ruin a carefully put together group of coloured blocks you were trying to gather for a huge combo bonus.It's fun. It's fast paced, and it's got that ""Just one more try"" feeling to it. But don't take my word for it. Hit Google and look up Super Puzzle Platformer or just Puzzle Platformer. The flash games are available to try for free. Deluxe is just...well more goodness."

,Recommended,238530,33244166,Posted: 4 July,all,StarLover19,"A very simple, but yet an addictive game. The controls are responsive especially on a keyboard which most of the death/accidents will be your fault not the controller. The visuals are colorful and nice to look at which is kinda surprising from Adult Swim since I didn't expect the game to be kinda layback or yet refreshing to see a friendly type of game as opposed to a gory or adult theme. The soundtracks are great to listen to since they are catchy to listen to give the game's music a listen when you have a chance. The replayability is can be short, but it's a short and sweet type of game with 6 stages with it's unique gimmicks as well unlocking and doing the challenge mode. The can hard with strong reflexes from hazards, falling blocks, and one hit kill booby traps. I recommend on buying the game it's a fun and unique platformer with a puzzle style tetris. It's a great time killer if your into that type of stuff."

That's what this game is.You jump around, shoot linked-colour blocks for some sick point-combos, dodge traps and other hazards, and unlock new characters and challenges as you progress through the game and hit new high-scores.My only issue is that some of the later levels get too insane for casual play but the early-ones get tiring to grind high-scores for.PROS:- Simple and addicting.- Animation gives a lot of oomp to the visuals.- Fun soundtrack.- Challenging.- Multiplayer is a chaotic mess in the best of ways.CONS:- Gets a bit repetitive.- The skill-ceiling plateaus pretty quickly.- Multiplayer is split-screen only.- No online score-board (that I know of).I give Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe 8/10 vicious screen-shakes causing me to miss-aim my jump and fall into the spike-pit."

Great soundtrack, simple controls, and the different protagonists with different abilities make for a game I know I'm gonna keep coming back to.
