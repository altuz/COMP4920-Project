,Recommended,238630,11168145,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,The Purple Pantywaist,"This game really is a very mixed bag.There are some awesome ideas and characters there, but the game as a whole feels halfhearted and gets very repetetive very fast.Let's start with some basic stuff:The game is supposed to be a throwback to the classical 8&16 bit era of sidescrolling beat'em'ups in the vein of Double Dragon, Final Fight, Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage and River City Ransom.It has a lot of references to games such as these, and quiet a few parodistic moments.You have eventually up to 20 playable characters, as mentioned some of them are hilarious. Just to name Dr. Karate and the Beekeper, two of the starting characters. But as funny as they are, there is not much more to them: Gameplay-wise, there is not that much difference after a while: Almost every character learns a projectile and a dash attack, can autoheal and lift enemies. The main difference is their starting statistics, how soon they learn which skill and if it is better to spam the one special attack or the other.It is similar with the stages: Their are fights in the subway, on a nude beach, on top of a truck, but again, besides scenery, it is all rather similar.The same with the opponents: You fight thugs, guys in suits, nurses, zombies and many more quirky or absurd opponents, but with a very few exceptions, they behave all the same - except later, when they start to have guns.And again, so do the bosses: Most do the same.They are further grotesquely large in comparison to the other characters, and while that is funny at the beginning, if you fight similar bosses for the uptenth time, the joke gets old.Later bosses can kill you with two hits. So basically, if you do not stick with one of the characters, which were unlocked at the beginning, you need to grind some time before you stand a chance.That goes for the game in general, it gets very unforgiving pretty soon. You can always grind, but the combination of artificially heightened difficulty and repetetion was more frustrating than encouraging in my opionion.I know I am repeating myself, but I find no other description for the story: It starts out kind of promising, like a parody of the classic ""save damsel in distress""-trope, then it more or less disappears while you have pointless and uninspired conversations with the bosses, just to end in a Twist with a cliffhanger.To be fair, the game is cheap, so you will get your money's worth.I can imagine, having up to three friends over, and playing the game with its funny characters for a short while (preferebly while drinking) you can have great fun - as long as you stop before it gets repetitive or frustrating.Still, it feels largely like a chance, which remained unused. Like they used all their great ideas, than just stretched the game by repeating everything 5 times with increasing difficulty. Here's to hoping for a sequel which will be finished.6/10."

We love Double Dragon, River City Ransom, Golden Axe, TMNT, Streets of Rage etc., so this seemed like a sure bet at the time.After a while we decide we like it, and want to show our friends. But we can't include our friends because that would mean grinding up their characters to our level so we could play (levels are attached to the 4 players, not to the characters themselves). So now we have to leave our friends out and just play by ourselves, but its no big deal. Now combat is starting to get stale and nothing is really jumping out at us. Then we decide we want to be daring and maybe try out one of the many new characters we unlocked, but oh bummer, they start at level 0 and would take hours to grind. Now we are trapped, just the two of us, playing a game where we aren't really free to use the characters we unlock with out going through the monotony of grinding. We went through level after level, unlocking all kinds of cards (achievments), characters, and secret items/areas, but really all we wanted to do was have fun. Packing in all this content doesn't really matter unless the game offers some kind of entertainment.I could go on about all this, but the bottom line is this: I was grinding so much I was surprised I didn't just unlock the next level in Tony Hawk.By the time we reached the halfway point of the game, we were definitely not enjoying ourselves. Luckily, we ran into a bunch of difficulty spikes that really won us over.After simmering in our losses on the final level for what felt like hours, we finally beat it. The final joke did make us laugh, but I think the humor really came from how fitting it was that we made a mistake both in real life and in the game just by playing it.The way this game artificially lengthens itself would make JRPGs blush. I actually feel unclean for putting in 20 hours to get %100, but that's my own fault. This isn't a terrible game, I enjoyed half of it, but I think it just spread itself too thin."

A lot of the content is okay to enjoyable, but the structure of the game is deliberately skewed to make single player unreasonably difficult, and they tied the ""RPG-lite"" system to individual character/controller-slot combinations (as opposed to character or player profiles), so multiplayer is a tedious leveling affair for all players, all the time.  You might cruise along fondly for a few levels, but the seams quickly fall apart as you reach the point where you have to have multiple players actually leveled up to proceed.  I'd be willing to play to the end, but none of my friends are tolerant enough to get there, and honestly, I don't blame them.It's a shame, because the framework is there for a great beat-em-up game, but they didn't feel to finish the product by correcting poor design decisions and fleshing out the feature set.My recommendation, if you really want a good beat 'em up, play Castle Crashers instead.  It's got everything present here and a lot more.  If you've already done that and want variety, don't bother here.  You're going to be overwhelmed with the knowledge that it's not nearly as good."
,Not Recommended,238630,34182265,Posted: 11 August,all,Erebor,"Not even worth the $0.99 I paid for it. I was looking forward to a good beat-em-up because I grew up playing Streets of Rage and Golden Axe, but this felt like a crappy flash games I played on Newgrounds back in 2002. The player doesn't even stop walking when you attack, so it feels like you're ice skating. Is it really so hard to program stuff that was easily done over 20 years ago? It makes no sense that you can just run through enemies and punch them without stopping or even slowing down. Also the ""jump kick"" is really an aerial slam as there's no angular momentum, you just crash back down to the ground a few inches from where you start. Totally useless, I wouldn't play this again even if it were free. You give this genre of games a bad name, shame on you"

When you punch or kick you see the same punch or kick animation. An upper cut to end a punching combo or a roundhous kick to end a kick combo would be cool.- Would like to see DLC and more characters in the future.- Needs online co-op.- Gets a bit repetitive."

It’s a throwback to classic 80s and 90s brawlers with modern concepts like leveling up a la Castle Crashers or Guardian Heroes. And yet, it falls short. How so? Well sure, there are a ton of characters to unlock as you trudge through the streets, beating up all kinds of baddies…but most of them are pretty lame.  In fact, most of the starting characters are kinda crappy, too.Once you get the ex-cop, you really don’t need any other characters. Besides that, the enemies aren’t that fun to beat up and take too long to beat up. Nevermind that it’s pretty easy because all you do is mash the attack button while moving…yes, while moving. You don’t stop to attack like in other brawlers.  The bosses are ridiculously overpowered and not fun to fight at all, the music is meh at best, and while there is an interesting amount of level variety, it never really goes anywhere. If you’re looking for another brawler and you’ve tried all the rest, I guess you could get this one since it’s cheap, but it’s really not that impressive."
,Recommended,238630,8386334,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,Killer,"As a fan of classic side scrolling beat-em-ups, I had to try this game.  As the title indicates, this game takes an exaggerated spin on classic side scroller fight genre.  It is best played with a group of friends.  One major flaw is the lack of online multiplayer.  Though I prefer computer master race keyboards, I found that this game plays much better with a controller.  Comparing again with River City Ransom, I would say that this was a fun spin.  Especially using smart cars as melee weapons. The gameplay and feel are not completely as polished but there is more challenge.  The game is not terribly long, but there are a lot of secrets to discover.  If you're not a fan of River City Ransom, I think it would be hard to appreciate this games absurdity."

The combat is more basic like that of classic 2D brawler games and can get monotonous at times however the character unique skills keep things interesting. Each character levels seperately as well and are also given stat points that you have control over placement of, meaning you have the choice of how you build each one and what abilites are unlocked. The level design is well done and clever and throws homage to other games and pop culture references. Also each level has its own things going on that help keep things interesting and not just a punch grind. The music is very retro and gives you that arcade vibe. Overall the game is a decent 2D beat'em up with cool character design, a quirky story, and great replayability.Game Showcase/Gameplay-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BAyvbMTN1Q"

The controls feel so slippery that you'd think your characters shoes are made of butter, the enemies can combo break you so often that you might as well just resort to shooting projectiles the entire time, the bosses have an unfair amount of strength (the THIRD boss killed me in TWO hits) and some other bosses spam so many projectiles that you can get stuck in an endless loop of standing up just to get knocked down with no escape whatsoever.  I normally thoroughly enjoy beat em up games, but this one just feels broken to me.  I had to retry the fourth level 7 times because of so many instant deaths that just felt unfair.  This game really tested my patience and I wanted to give it a chance, but there are so many better retro throwback games that could be played instead of this.TL;DR Go play Castle Crashers instead"

If you want to buy this game to have a nostalgic feel, then avoid this at all costs. And, it's completely easy to spam this game to win.

With 15 different characters, with every level up needing more and more experience points to do so like common role playing games, you will feel the wrath of boredom over take you. I would suggest this game to any beat-em-up fan, but keep the game play to only beating it the first time through or exploring with friends.http://iamericm.com/2013/08/fist-puncher-indie-game-review/"

I tried using the control stick but the dioagonals are not nearly sensitive enough. With a little work, this game could be much better, but as it stands now, it's pretty much junk."

A controller is needed to play, so don't think you can use a keyboard. Over all worth a buy if you enjoyed those old 16-bit titles for years gone by."

Comes into its own when you stop punching heads on your own, and get your friend in so you can both punch heads together. All works very well as a solo game if you cannot find a friend to do this with. I am constantly telling myself ""no more after this go"" and yet I end up trying the level again with a different character. The game has a lot of apparant depth that you need to be persistent to experience. Much enjoyable! Play long time!"

Even though its a cheap indie game i've played it all weekend. I loaded it thinking it would distract me for half an hour then BAM four hours is gone.If you loved any of the old school beat em up arcade games like double dragon, streets of rage etc this game is a must buy. Throw a controller inot the mix and its epic fun. I also like how you can level up the various characters in the game as well.This is a fantastic game. A must Buy!!"

We had been looking through Steam to find a good 2d side scrolling beat 'em up since it had been forever since we played one that was really good and new to us. We purchased the game and the first 15 minutes were alright, not great but alright, and the next half hour is nothing but horrible-ness.Story: Not much to say about it since we didn't get far but it was harmless enough.Music: The music was pretty bland. No rock, no weird electro, no 8-16 bit, just really bland uninteresting music that you would hear at a cheap backwater bar.Gameplay: The real heart of the problems we had with the game so I will try to rapidfire this. The enemies took too long to kill and were not even fun to beat up. The level up system was mediocre. You have to stick with 1 character since the levels are not persistent with all characters (which there are 20 of). We kept dying not because of lack of skill, but because the enemies took too long to die and did so much damage that was unavoidable due to the rather wonky controls. And it was monotonus as all get out, which isn't bad if the game itself is enjoyable to beat up bad guys but it was not. The worst part is that when you die in co-op you can't just come back and get back into the action, you are dead until your friend(s) come revive you while they have 6 enemies chasing them down at once.Graphics: This game was released three years ago as of the time of this review but the graphics are very bare bones. Yes it is retro, but that doesn't mean you can be lazy at making a pixel graphics game.Overall: I do not recommend this game one bit. It is just an unpleasent experience. There are many more beat 'em ups I could recomend you such as Castle Crashers (Steam), Dragon's Crown (PS3), Double Dragon Neon (Steam) ect.The only saving grace about all of this is the Steam Refund System."

,Not Recommended,238630,34905532,Posted: 12 September,all,JGBeagle,"I want to like this game; but it is obviously made for co-op/multiplayer. Some later levels are built around having one person fight while another completes the objective. Or bosses that are near-impossible without two people wailing on them due to their high damage output. At a certain point the game becomes an unfun slog while playing singleplayer and that's why I can't recomend this game. If you have a spare PC controller and a friend it might be fun, but I'd avoid if you don't.If there was online muliplayer I might actually recomend it."

Also x360ce is a must if you are 50% of the world's population ( (only own a generic usb controller rather than an Xbox 360 one)
