Well look elsewhere, because Citadels is a dreadful and incomplete mess. The game was created by an unknown and inexperienced development studio called Games Distillery. Currently a different studio called Big Moon was hired to add further playability and stability to the game. In the future, at best you can only hope for a polished yet dreadful entertainment product (without the entertainment value).Citadels attempts to accomplish what so many other strategy games have already done before, and it accomplishes those things poorly. Citadels most closely resembles a stripped down Age of Empires title. Everything from base building, combat, and resource gathering are implemented poorly. There is no strategy involved at all because combat boils down to spamming units. You can literally spam the most basic miliary unit available and win every time. The utter lack of military units available leaves no room for strategy, tactics, or planning at all.The game has a boring campaign that currently can't even be finished entirely, and a few lacklusted skirmish modes with terrible AI. There is only one map available per skirmish mode and no matter the difficulty you choose you cannot lose due to the incompetent AI. Citadels is only a singleplayer game so these are your only options. There is no map or scenario editor or multiplayer of any kind. The poor quality of this title combined with the utterlack of content at a $40 price point is downright theivery. Avoid at all costs.I only put 3 hours into this game but that was rather generous of me. The boring gameplay, poor design, and lack of content leave little reason for me to play any further."

The videos and screenshots made the game look very great and detailed, but this game is actually terrible quality and was very poorly made. Here are the reasons not to get this game:1. It's $40, when it's really worth $5.2. The graphics are terrible. The screenshots may look fine, but they actually suck.3. The game looks like it was made by people with very little experience in programming. The menu goes off the screen, and the minimap does not even show the correct positions of things. The map could say that it is directly in the center of the screen but it could not even be on the screen.4. There was no tutorial, and I can't even get past the first level because I have no idea what to do. It says to gather 100 of each resource but whenever I try to build stone pits and ore pits it says that it could not be gathered at this location and no matter where I put it it always says that.I only paid $10 for this game, but it was still a complete rip-off :("

Yes the dreaded broken game my friends. I played and played level 3 a several times, and can't beat it because the game doesn't want me to, it's not due to lack of trying or being defeated....It just  freezes on the level after a half hour or so.In any game, buidling your castle is one of the most fun parts, it's a freak'en nightmare. Nothing lines up, even when you think your walls are together they aren't, for some odd reason. When you finally do get your castle walls straight it seems like you only need a handful of bowmen to fend off any baddies.The AI took the short bus to school,  they charge your castle in small groups sort of like they are hazing you and testing you out but they end up accomplishing nothing.It does have an interesting system  when it comes to getting resources, you just don't chop down word, you have to make them into planks with a special production house. I like the mirco mangement, and you can switch workers from job to job. I like RTS games where it takes time to raise an army and it's not just about who can build the fastest army first like starcraft.I would have finished the game dispite it's flaws but at the end of the day when a game is broken and can't play you can't give it a thumbs up."

I was expecting a clone of the Stronghold series, with perhaps some embelishments or improvements. This game provides neither. In fact, it can't even provide the basic expectations of an RTS game. After playing it for about an hour I was surprised to see this wasn't an 'Early Access' game, but instead claims to be 'complete.'  The game most lacks in its user interface (UI), which if improved, would bring it at least on par to other RTSes.Areas for improvement:1. Double-clicking a control group (0-9) doesn't center on units. And there is no additional key to do so. This is unforgivable.2. The game helpfully informs you that you are under attack. Hope you noticed that one minimap ping, because otherwise you're clicking through controls groups trying to find the one taking damage, and then remembering where that group is (see 1 above). There needs to be a 'zoom to last alert' key or equivalent.3. Speaking of minimap. When you have a unit selected, the unit info covers half of the minimap. You can hide the minimap, and the unit info. But maybe they should just make the unit info smaller... Or make the minimap movable?4. Trees block building. And I didn't find a way to manually dfestroy a tree. I looked in the keybinds, and found what can be best called a 'minimalist' interface. You have WASD camera controls (not my cup of tea for an RTS, but whatever), control groups (0-9), and then a couple keys for peasant (resource gatherer) management. No attack-move, manual attack, zoom-to-unit, etc.This game might have potential, if like I said, it was not billed as complete. There's much more I would want, but those listed I think are some bare-minimums needed to make it playable.  To be honest, I haven't played long, but I found myself fighting the game controls and 'lost' for most of it. Pick up Stronghold to fill your midievil RTS needs."

In fact, on the second map of the Arthur campaign, the enemy likes to constantly build resourse buildings next to your own. There is no way of destroying these until they are built.Graphics are poor.

Without researching it I would say it is a language hailing from the scandanavian region of europe, perhaps even deeper into eastern europe. Walls don't build properly and the game atmosphere is dull and un-moving, not offering much excitement or motivation to continue playing. The build system is a good idea and designed well but doesn't work so well when put into effect. Building a wall section will leave parts onbuilt and peasants cannot complete the unfinished section.Overall looks good from afar (trailers etc.) but terrible up colse (actually playing it). Feels like another Total War: Rome II failure guys, so look forward to indefinate patches and broken promises to fix the game and make it what was expected upon release. ""We've put alot of effort into this game, it's our biggest budget yet!""......... broken on release just like Total War: Rome II. That was not a direct quote from the developers of the Citadels game but similar to something similar to what a developer from 'Creative Assembly' said about during development of Total War: Rome IIOverall a disappointment not worth buying. 3/10- Sexy Vorta"

There are many older castle/siege games available on the market that are better in content and gameplay.  Citadels gameplay was okay.  My main complaints were the ackwardness of some building upgrades and the low population cap.  Considering the amount of population required to maintain your economy, a cap of 99 people was maddening when trying to manage an army.  At first I assumed the population limit would increase as the campaign progressed but before I knew it the campaign was over and the cap never changed.  I played a couple skirmish/sandbox games.  The castle defense one was boring on normal difficulty.  I then tried a duel map and found it more fun.  Both maps had ackward terrain to build on.  Steep terrain is a pain to build walls on.  It usually requires building towers close together.  However, if you build towers to close together, you may be prevented from building walls between them too.Overall, the game wasn't very fun to play and recommend playing other games out there."

I wish i didn't have to pick whether or not i would recommend it, and i'll tell you why.When i saw this come rolling in, i guess i took the description the wrong way, as i assumed it would be more of a base-builder/town managment deal.  The kind where you focus more on building walls and planning your town than training troops and sending them to attack other groups on the map.Unfortunately, i was wrong, this plays like a plethora of other RTS games, all already established with their fans.  Much like the Age of Empires 2 HD i bought sometime back around the november-december sales.  You cna build walls and turrets, but the focus was more on just holding your base until you'd trained troops to go attack other bases.  I can't recommend it because this wasn't even what i was looking for, nor is it any better than other RTS games already available new or old.It's not a bad game, some collision detection with your own units acts weird and the cursor doesn't seem to like being where it is at times, but it's nothing that won't likely be patched up by the time it's at an actual release version.  If you like these kinds of games and want something slightly different feeling but still familiar, sure try it out, but it's no better than what you probably already have.tl;dr, not too bad, not too good, disappointly average.

Thats ok till you start trying to click the small people on a large map, forget it.I honestly just got past the first level and wanted to never play it again. I'm not usually so annoied by poorly made games, I think its the price tag that bothers me. There are many games that aren't as polished and they take that and compensate the price. This one jumps out at $40 and then makes you feel like your getting a steal at 75% off. No. This game should be a $19.99 game, or $5 on sale.Sure its not a great review of the game but read some more of the other reviews.

HOWEVER the nightmare started after when it crashed constantly like no other game that I have previously played, and I run pretty high spec games on my pc, and this one is by far not one of them.Compared to other games of the same genre I would say it ranks around 30/100, due to how much it crashes I found myself loosing a lot of things done because I didn't save every freaking minute.There is no auto save option and no short key for saving either, which makes it pretty easy to forget to save when you're in the middle of building a decent city and a powerful army.I had to leave the game several times before having to reattempt a mission because I forgot to save and it just decided to crash on me, so trust me it can lead you to a rage quit :/Building and Unit quality/content is quite poor, there is very little to do and explore.The AI is completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they cannot carry out simple tasks like cutting a tree which you tell them to, instead they go off and cut down another tree miles away from where you told them to go.The AI will very commonly forget where the resources are located despite their assigned work place being right next to it... In other words the AI behaves like a 3 year old for most of the time, which is my opinion is appaling for a game of this price.The graphics aren't amazing, however in a strategy game I consider that to be the least important thing and having played strategy games for over 10 years I can still have fun in a game that reminds me of old experiences through its graphics.Personally I really didn't like it, I really don't think it is worth £30 when it lacks so much and the quality is really not the best, many other games of the kind would be a better option if you're interested...All in all, quite disapointed, as having payed full price I had really high hopes for it..."

This is a fun concept if you enjoy strategy games or like whole castle/fortess theme. The problem is the game is designed as though the last 10 years of game developement never happened. There are no tool tips for the majority of the interfaces. You are left to guess what upgrades actually do. There are three game types in skirmish mode, but you are not told any of the information until you launch them. The settings section has you clicking through options one at a time instead of having a drop down menu. The game has a 99 population limit, which would make sense if it was a game with a lot of micro managing of individual units - it is not. Most of the challenge in the game is figuring out how to deal with the tiny population limits and figuring out how to get a wall that is glitched built before the next attack.Essentially if this game came out in 2004 it would have been amazing, but it plays like a game from then with some updated graphics and plenty of bugs with walls and structures. I do not recommend it. I feel sorry for the people that worked really hard on this, because it just didn't come together."

,Recommended,238870,29373744,Posted: 20 January,all,PiggyBANK-,"Honestly, most of the reviews are negative. But in my opinion the game is really good even with its cons.This game is definently comparable to Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2.The gameplay is mostly the same, but you can control each warrior, you have more choise in building, more ressources to gather, etc.There are obviously some cons if there are mostly negative reviews.- Typically, I have a GTX 980 + i7 4790 and i run it at 90-100 FPS, which is not so good for an RTS with medium typed graphics quality. (The graphics are like in LOTR BFMO2).- Second point, is that building walls is very specific, and you will need some time to understand how it is to be placed.- The worst part I have found in the game, is that selecting units by holding the right click is problematic.And thats it. Honestly, I don't know how people could write a negative review about this game. Of course the game has to be a bit more polished, but overall it IS GOOD.If you are an RTS fan, but it for maybe 10$, or wait sales, because I would even buy it for 20.UPD : - The AI is stupid, there is no skirmish, and no voice acting in campaign."

For example, the campaign is completely enthralling. The story is way too good, it's like mixing Call of Duty with The notebook. The gameplay is flawless, with it's unique way of mixing completely broken mechanics with a near unplayable controls that makes it some how makes it perferct. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
