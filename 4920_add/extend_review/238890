Its simple graphical sprites would feel right at home on a tablet, but seem out-of-place on a PC. Making matters worse, the clunky user interface manages to simultaneously overwhelm the player with information, while not giving her enough data with which to learn the game.Though the tutorial helps by walking the player through the early steps of gameplay, it seems very fond of telling her about things you'll have to worry about later on in gameplay, without telling her any appropriate steps to take when shedoesencounter them.By and large, however, the major strike against this game is, well,it's boring. After the initial setup period, gameplay becomes unbearably slow, a pain which is only mitigated by the shortness of the games themselves. The position the game puts the player in changes throughout the game, leading to what are arguably contradictions: she has both the power to summon wild beasts and unquestioningly place down buildings to aid the mortals, but is subject to the resources they have on hand. Resources the game is fond of telling the player she's missing, but not how to acquire without a scavenger hunt through the long-winded information prompts scattered throughout the game.WhileSkyward Collapseshows great potential through its promotional screenshots and videos, it fails to live up to it in execution, leading me as a player to be very disappointed in the overall game."

Let's be honest: it's not the worst game ever, it's a game that is just average in everything. The graphics are pretty simple, and I understand that top notch graphics aren't required to a game be any good, but the lack of things like character animation make this title looks worst than most of f2p cell phone games.The objective is very inovative and distinctive from other God games: you should keep the balance between the factions. But it's simple boring, sometimes I just skip to the next turn waiting for something to happen, sometimes you need to make your ""civs"" ready to wage war, because there are an amount of points required to win the match in each difficult. And... that's it.The interface is kinda messy, the game doesn't do a very good job in order to show to you what is needed to be built and what are the requirements for each unit... I'm not saying that this info isn't available, it's just so much pain to get to it.So, let's wrap up: the concept is great, the interface is messy and clunk, the graphics are sub par and the music is quite good. Thats it, I can't recommend this game, but I would like to see this concept in a more polished and diversified game."

Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to be a very good god game, leaning more towards the TBS side, and it's not a great TBS either. If you're anything like me, you'll probably love it for the first 20 rounds or so; then your interest will fall more and more. By turn 70 I just wanted it to be over.Some have said that the main problem is a lack of challenge: once you figure out how to play it, that's it. But if that was the case, you could just get more bandits and woes. (In fact, I managed to lose it once, and that didn't make it much more interesting.) In my opinion the problem lies elsewhere: it gets repetitive, and it feels pointless. In a god game, you usually have a “project” in your head, something you want to do; in an RTS or TBS, you're constantly under pressure by the opponent(s). Here neither thing happens: no use having a project because you have very little control over what will get destroyed, and also because there is simply not that much you can do; and the pressure simply isn't there either, since winning is “score X points and make sure both factions survive” — once you reach the required score and have one well-fortified town of each faction safely away from the conflict areas, it's an annoying game of attrition.Again, it's a very interesting premise, and I'll keep an eye on it — it has a lot of potential to be fixed in an expansion or sequel. But as it currently stands, I don't think it works."

I would enjoy the game alot more, if they showed a little bit of autonomy."

The goal of the game is to balance two opposing factions by supplying them with resources and buildings. You must cause enough chaos between the two factions to get your score high enough to pass through three rounds until you reach the end of the game to achieve a victory.Skyward Collapse features one of the best tutorials I've seen in awhile. The game can be overwhelming at first, but the tutorial does a great job of holding your hand through your first game. The tutorial will teach you the basics of the game while giving you the freedom to play around and experiment as you see fit. You won't know 100% of everything after your first play-through, but you should understand the basic concepts and be ready to play a better game on your 2nd time around.Skyward Collapse features very basic animation and graphics, it's best to think of it like a board game. Units move around the game like pieces on a board, and when they fight, they just bump into each other until one falls off the board.I would say if you are interested by this review at all, you should go ahead and pick the game up. It is only five bucks, and even if you end up hating it, you've only wasted a few dollars. If you do not like turn based strategy, or if a lack of graphics or animation is a big turn off, stay clear of this one.For more info, you can find my full review here:http://hashron.com/display.php?id=18"
,Recommended,238890,12207906,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,IwillforgetYou,I really like this game for it's somehow chaotic gameplay which makes it unique in the strategy genre. It is turn based and best comparable to a very complex board game. This is also how it is presented.You as a player have limited and mostly indirect control over what happens. There are many random variables. But the offered possibility space of what to do to react on the events is strikingly huge. Every time I start a new round I find something new to try out.It has its lengthy parts and I think the 60 rounds variant is much more enjoyable than the standard of 90 rounds per match.I think the suspense in this game is great. For the first 90% of the game you have to do careful adjustments to keep your civilizations alive. But when it becomes obvious that you are about to win it's up to you to wreak as much havoc as possible. As you only get points for destroyed buildings and units. This is immensely satisfying.

Lemur,"I really like the idea of playing two factions against each other and having to make sure that neither one of them wipes the other one out, but something about it didn't completely click with me. As with most Arcen games, I'm glad I tried it and played through an entire session of it from start to finish, because it's interesting and not the kind of thing you usually see, but I don't think this will be one of the ones I'll end up going back to repeatedly for weeks/months/years. I'm happy they keep trying out whatever crazy ideas they come up with though."

When you're forced to visit them you end up playing board games alone in their cluttered back room. You always find yourself bored. Even though the room is cluttered your relative never takes the time to show you anything they have. When you ask they just shrug you off. Then one day, they pass on, and the family jumps in and starts dividing all the stuff they had in their house and you learn they had a lot of cool stuff. Actually there was a lot to learn and explore, but the place was so cluttered, and your relative never explained much of what they collected.That's the best way I can describe Skyward Collapse. The single tutorial level gives you a limited/basic understanding of what it's trying to accomplish then sets you out into the world to play god. You find yourself with 2 civilizations, with slightly varied dependencies, different unit types with their own pros and cons, a cluttered interface, and you have to play them both at the same time and keep them from killing each other while they attempt to kill each other.IMO a tutorial that perhaps took a few levels to complete would have helped this game out a lot. There's no hand holding here and usually I don't like that type of design, but in Skyward Collapse it could have been a refreshing boost in understanding the complex systems in place here.Also, the building icons are cluttered. Yes, they are divided up into categories, but I still found myself lost a lot of the time. The dependencies between buildings aren't very well explained and I kept backtracking to understand what I did wrong. I played the tutorial level about 5 times. There's just not enough clean design or helpful tutorials to get the average player involved.I'm also, not a fan of playing against myself. Well, balancing against myself really. You have to build civilizations that will ultimately destroy each other, but you need to build them in ways they complement their destructive potentials into an almost deadlock.That does sound like a great idea, but honestly it's just a bad execution. I really think this game would have benefited from a little TLC on the GUI and a few extra tutorial levels that would walk you through certain aspects one at a time. The way Skyward Collapse is presented you end up feeling like you're playing a board game, alone, in your Grandmothers' clutter back room."
,Recommended,238890,15677384,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,Flying Omelette,"Skyward Collapse is a game that requires some dedication and time investment to really learn it. You have to forgive the fact that there is no animation at all - characters slide around the world like pieces on a board game. And I'm going to say right up front to buy this game with the Nihon no Mura expansion. It's only a little extra for it, and you won't want to be without the Super Smite ability that comes with it.As a god-like being, you command two factions of human civilization, which can be either Greek, Norse, or (with the expansion) Japanese. Each has unique skills, monsters, and gods whose powers can be used against one another by building up their towns and earning supplies.Here's the catch: you're on both teams. You can't allow one to completely destroy the other. And you can't just not let them fight, because you need to earn points to make score requirements every so many rounds. So, you have to find ways to keep them balanced - if one side starts overwhelming the other, you'll have to concoct strategies to even the odds. This can get quite hectic, especially considering all the random elements the game tosses at you - such as the woes that create game-changing conditions, the rogue bandits that pop up every so often, and what to do if a character attains such high stats that they become practically unstoppable.Once you get the hang of it, you will likely never be in any real danger of losing. But the game is fully-customizable. You can change any number of elements to make it as hard or as easy as you'd like. Going for the achievements is a good way to learn the game's rules and mechanics and to give you concrete goals to shoot for.Rating: 3.5/5"

The tutorialisation was done in a light way maybe too light... There is a lot happening even in the simple tutorial and I feel like the tutorial did not do it's job proprely to explain how deep and complex this game is. I gave up a bit less than 2 hours in because I didn't quite fully understood what I was doing(and that is really frustrating in a strategy game) Imagine playing monopoly and the only thing your friend (the tutorial) taught you about this game is the dice rolling system and that you move according to the space on that said die. You would miss out on the game and the chances are you won't like your experience.

The idea is to keep 2 civilizations balanced as they go to war with each other, and prevent each civilization from destroying the other, for as long as possible. The civs have unique units, like minotaurs and such, and you can build Military buildings and infastructure in one side if its in danger. But be careful! the military infastructure might tip the scales, but then the other side will be in danger. I remember this as a very fun game. Not sure why its getting so much negativity."

It is a turn based strategy game in a mythical setting, where ancient greek and norse fight a never ending war. A war that threatens creation itself. You are the Creator in charge of this world and it is your duty to ensure that this war never reaches that point of doom, while at the same time keeping creation ""interesting"".Each turn you have a build face for each of the two factions, allowing you to place buildings, summon mythical creatures such as minotaurs, create mountains or even nudge the gods to do your bidding. Death and destruction increases your score but too much of it and a faction runs the danger of getting wiped out and you would lose the game. And as if the constant warmongering of the two sides wasn't enough, bandits raid everyone equally and calamities (like floods, draughts, serial killers or tartarus spitting the dead back into the land of the living) will spicen things up.This game is well worth checking out for everyone who enjoys turn based strategy and would like to try something different.

The game itself is nice, although there are some features that are not so likeable. The game itself feels like a board game, and could easily be played as a board game, which is a great thing if you like board games! (Note, I am the founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League, so you could say I like board games!) Anyway, enough said for now, let us proceed to the pros and cons list.Pros-Literally A Board! It feels and looks like a board game! Moving tiles around, characters, stat cards, and so forth, it just is a cool concept! Anyway, this isn't a pro for all people, so let us continue.Audio/Music, the music is great and doesn't get old. The sound effects are so-so, but the sounds definitely fit the game so I am happy with them.Gameplay, the gameplay is very cool. You are a godlike being who manages different cities, trying to promote both peace and war at the same time. Although you can't have a ""Endless"" game, the gameplay is doesn't need an ""Endless"" mode in order to be good. You get to change the entire world if you like, from the tiles to the bandits to the empires themselves, change literally everything with a simple click or two.Combat, the combat is entirely automatic. The empires will build armies for you. The empires will send their armies to die for you. All you have to do is sit back and watch, and sometimes scold an empire that gets to powerful (By scold, I mean brutally smite off the map).Cons-Combat, but combat was also a pro? Well, for some people the fact that you can't interact with the characters/pieces/armies directly is somewhat disappointing. Personally, I like the way that they did this, but to each there own I guess.Multiplayer, the multiplayer isn't really there yet, it doesn't really advance the gameplay any by having more people playing it. It just complicates things, but even so, that is also part of the fun of it I guess. Personally, I don't like how they did the multiplayer, but oh well.Conclusion-I definitely recommend this game. It literally feels like I am playing a board game! It is also very fun to play this game local hotseat, having each person control one nation, nation vs. nation! Although the game wasn't developed for this kind of gameplay, it is definitely fun to do no less. If I had to say a way that they could improve this game, it would be to recreate the multiplayer aspect of it by having a more nation vs. nation set up like I described above. It would be more like a Age of Empires feel and would give the game something unique to get more people to play/buy it.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League"

It's pretty easy to cruise through lower difficult levels, but once you turn it up to hard or higher, you will be constantly scrambling to both (1) get each side to kill and destroy as much of the other side's units and buildings as possible while (2) not letting anyone get totally wiped out. The basic early-game strategies you employ will involve instigating two competing armageddons against each civilization's strongholds, which will be followed by armageddons on your armageddons. Available map space for new strongholds will quickly be oustripped by how much of it is covered in unrecoverable ruins, adding a hard limit on exactly how much infrastructure you can destroy before literally running out of space to build destroyable infrastructure on. High level play is madcap and insane as you race against the clock to meet score requirements without completely ruining everything on the map.In other words, it's sort of like a strategic Jenga? You will be constantly trying to work out the metagame that you're playing against yourself, and then putting out fires that you yourself ignited with even bigger fires. Fires upon fires swallowing up oxygen, with the only real solution being to add more chaos to the mix and hope that you can deal with the aftermath later.Coop is also great fun, particularly with beer."

I can understand why some may not enjoy this, and I'll try to cover those through my groggy head. So, forgive my miss spells and other nonesense. But I speak from my heart and mind none the less!So, I love this game for many reasons. Maybe some small, stupidly funny text from the developers as you try to leave the game and such. But that's just me I guess. Or could be? I'm easy to entertain.I think that this game is an amazing strategy game to some degree at least. It's in depth, has plenty of content, and can, if you actually know what to do, move on pretty fast. It just takes time to learn. And like everything, you need to hit it with a good attitude. If you go into this, expecting the worse, or allowing yourself to be overwhelmed, of course you'll hate it. But if you go in with optimism, and allow yourself to lose a few games for the sake of science and experimentation, you may just learn a few things and start winning.A basic game starts with 2 cities in which you build up. Starting out with both of them equally is what I do. Maybe, give each town a basic ranged and melee unit to start out. And then to maximize the death and destruction without total annihilation, I'll try to build a mountain range to block the path into a choke point, covering key locations with outposts and cerberus' as to prevent enemy advance whilest building up a bigger force. But sadly, you may find yourself running out of time and needing more points. So one could perhaps... Spawn a labyrinth. And maybe... Spawn minotaurs for each faction each turn? That are... Temporarily invulnerable? and... Randomly spawned! Sure! That'll cause chaos. And now you find, after 25 sturggling turns, you've destroyed some cities and find yourself with one overpowered nation. So in a panic, you close off the last red city and spam mythological units, but wait, you don't have the resources! Oh no!! So you start to expand, but find the other side to powerful and find that you're too late to try and go for a less... Murder filled victory. What now? Well, that's for you to decide. Perhaps you let all hell loose and spawn an armageddon if you can. Or just♥♥♥♥♥♥around till you learn a few things, who knows. Maybe the bandits will save you.I personally don't know if that made sense, but I felt it showed the craziness of this game. The idea that so much can happen in one game, how fast it can progress and that only those who don't know what to do have long, grooling games. I for one like to play this game fast passed, and therefor, don't get so far all the time. But it can be fun to play god over two races bent on destroying each other, watching their attack plans unfold and fail as you secretly aid their enemy while just as well giving the attacker a new seige factory while yet again at the same time unleashing a great mythological beast against their newest town. All for you to rack up points in a hilariously devilsh game.Maybe you don't want to kill your followers so fast and violently... You can go for a culture victory. Build peaceful towns on the ruins of others and amass culture to build great arcs which symbolize your world's success and beauty. All of this and so, so much more can be found in this game. Each game feels knew and each game has a new story to be told.On to multiplayer. Download Evolve and you can easily project a LAN server across the states or provinces or which ever! That'sEvolvehq.com(The motto is ""Stop playing with yourself!"")While I have yet to try multiplayer, I can imagine it's great. Don't quote me there though.Sorry to be rambling so much, but please try this game or watch some videos and imagine a great god strategty game in which you try to control two raging armies in which want nothing more than death for the other and glory under you. It's a perfect strategy game and isn't so much chess against yourself as it is altering another 2 players' chess game. As if you were choosing where the tiles were (because you do) and what units are available and how often they are (because you do!!) and what player gets what benefits. Because you do.Lastly, thank you for reading, and if you have any questions at all, or want to play this with me, please please contact me at any time! Take a look, and rate this for yourself.

The buildings tend to look similar and blend into each other, so you never really know what is going on at a glance.The action phase jumps around a lot, and seems so pointless you simply end it most of the time so you don't have to put up with it.And to top it off, the interface has a very inconsistent feel."

It plays more like an old version of civ made for people who like to hotseat to play against themselves AND use cheats. Over half of the 'god-like' powers you have do nothing but add resources. This might be a 5 or even 6/10 for the rigth person..... but not me....Might be more of a 4/10 than 3 considering my expectations of the game were SO wrong. lol. Still, despite the good coding/lack of bugs, (making me want to give some good score/recommend) I just couldn't get any fun out of this. :\ and can't recommend.Pros:- No Bugs (not that I came across)- Has working options/settings- Has proper tooltips- Limited TutorialCons:- No Campaign- No real-time elements- No Editor- Different races have same buildings to make, so that the whole point of 'balancing' in the game FOR MOST OF THE GAME becomes not so much a case of balancing between rival factions as balancing between 2 of the same faction. You can 'deliberately' do things bad/different and not play to your best, but it just makes it even more like a boring simulation/replay than any kind of actual game.Points of Interest: (Could be pros or cons really)- Unique Menu Interface (IMO looks messy and don't like it)- Graphics are 'Dated'"
,Recommended,238890,9328012,"Posted: 3 March, 2014",all,Draken,"PROS- Pretty original, and there are so few games that try to be different these daysCONS- Needs more balance and more races / civs- Wish the main mechanic would rely on a gameplay element instead of simply scoreREVIEWFirst, I have to say this is a much better game than might be guessed at from the screenshots and video.The main idea is that instead of incarnating a civilization and fighting others, you take a more neutral stance, watching over 2 civilizations and even if you still build things for them you are mainly fighting unbalance, as you are trying to make the civs as big as possible without having any of them annihilate the other.Up to that point, great. The concept is interesting, and playing it (at leat for a while) is fun. I can recommend the game at this point if you like strategy.That being said, this is one of these games where as you play you get so many ideas and suggestions on how it can be improved. For instance, your main motivation to make civs as big as possible is that you have a score quota to reach or else you lose. While this is necessary, or else the game would have no challenge, other systems could be imagined to replace the score. For instance, why would you not be a god that feeds on war and conflict and gets more powerful the bigger the conflict is? That would let you gain / unlock more and more powers to have more options to balance the game, creating a gameplay loop that pushes you to make the conflict bigger (and thus more challenging) to gain the power to control it, and so on. Further it can open the field to creating other challenges to add variety to the game instead of just watching numbers on a score.The game also needs balance and variety. Only 2 civilizations are not enough, they have to add more. And balance is not yet there, you won't be dropping some mythical creatures or some powers (at least for a while) because they are too much of a curve to deal with.If they add more civs, balance the units, and plug something more interesting than the score system, this can become one of the best Civilization / God games strategy series out there."

Skyward Collapse has you controling 2 diffrent factions and building them up in pretty normal turn based base building, with various buildings required to build other buildings and units. You however only build the buildings, you don't control the units, the ai does that. The goal is to have the bases fight each other without actually destroying one another. A high score is what you are shooting for. What makes the game complicated and not boring is the addition of score requirements per ""age (30 turns), random encounters that have crazy powerful effects (called woes), and bandit forces. The tutorial and demo don't do the game justice, as it is only once you get on normal difficulty and past turn 30 tha things get crazy...and hard.

I'm inclined to agree with the non-insufferably-prissy parts of the GameCritics review: It could use some polish here and there, but the fundamentals are innovative and interesting. It's not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's firmly in the 70-85% range.Parts of this game are a bit rough (for instance, siege units have a range longer than the default zoom, so you either have to manually zoom out to see what they're attacking or manually edge-scroll during the brief window of time available - the camera should really track the projectile), and the resource system borders on needlessly-intricate (do we really need ten different resources and corresponding ""finished goods"" buildings?), but all in all I think the underlying mechanics (which can be crudely summarized as ""Populous, but you control both sides and the goal is to stalemate"" - a very clever way to sidestep the issue of AI programming) are interesting enough that if you're at-all into strategy / tactical games, this deserves a pickup - especially at the bargain-bin price!"

Basically, you aren't trying to win, you are trying to get the 2 factions to be equal to each other.  Which, while it may sound interesting, ultimately results in extremely boring gameplay.  This game would have so much potential if you could just pick a side and play as it and try to beat the other faction.  But you are not able to do this.  After the very beginning of the game, it becomes unplayably boring.  I don't think I've ever actually been able to keep playing to the end.

It was like I was laying down tract housing in SimCity, except the inhabitants killed each other and torched their neighborhoods while I was spamming the next row of buildings for them to burn down. To advertise that the player is supposed to ""encourage"" war is misleading - the sides war no matter what (and rather ineptly at that). Your godly goal is simply to lay down more tract housing so you can rack up sufficient points off their carnage. I suppose that if there was some actual *graphical* carnage or gore, it might be interesting ... but these units just blink out of existence when they die, so even their fighting is boring too.I'm not sure who this game will appeal to, so I don't recommend it at any price."

Not controlling units directly, but only being able to vaguely determine which unit is built when certainly is appealing. My first approach was to build pretty much exactly the same buildings on each side, which worked decently until an event kept killing random units of one side, then bandits appeared to mess up the balance even further. The world seeming to work actively against you keeps the game challenging to some extent.The aforementioned lack of control leads to one issue, though. Especially in the mid- to endgame phase, you have tons of units on the map. Bandits, red, blue, all happily beating each other up. Sadly, all you can do at this point is watching, and turns are 10-20% building/doing stuff and 80-90% just watching the game play itself, which I feel is kind of a missed chance, although it fits well within the concept (on that note, thanks for allowing to speed up the movement). Each side gets random Gods each round, and the randomised events keep the rounds different, forcing you to adapt quickly.I'd still recommend it for the interesting twist on the well-trodden concept of strategy games, but it's probably not a game you'll end up giving up your social life for.

And when the tides need balancing you get demi-gods and gods.  Sounds great right?  In theory it is, but the game is flawed.  Here's why:1.  You win by scoring, you lose by dying, by not meeting the score criteria or succumbing to the woes.  This is the major flaw.  ( I recommend this game because what i think is a flaw will me someone else's attraction.)  Why is this a flaw?  Each age lasts thirty turns, each age also has a score criteria.  To advance you have to meet that criteria.  On the easy settings it's a paltry 1120 pts for the 1st age, by turn turn 90 it was well over 110k.  The barbarians dont appear until turn 20 or so.  Their tokens upon death are only worth 40 pts, their fortress, 150.  Bottom line, this becomes a game of Red Vs. Blue, which is against your mandate.  If you let one wipe out the other, you lose.2.  I was hoping to have control of the soldiers, you know, tell them where to go and when, kind of like...a strategy game.  Yeah not happening.  The minute they have a path, they're gone.3.  It becomes more about where to drop new land tokens, then any real strategy.  Which is annoying.4.  The AI, it acts like it wants you to have control.  Otherwise, its just dumb.  Literally dumb.  It needs major balancing overhauls as well.The game started to shine in age 2, which is when you get your 1st demi god.  You start dropping tokens and it starts to feel like a struggle.  By age 3, the shine started to dull as scoring becomes simple.  Simply use your god, and spam your tokens like crazy.  Eventually you kill a demi-god and score a major 40k.Now, i'm not much of a multiplayer gamer.  I have a select few i game with, and none are interested in this one.  It seems the game would truly shine on a multiplayer setup, but i can't say for sure.  PC resources are minor,  every home should have a rig with at least Win XP sp2, and 2 gig ram.Bottom line:Its flawed, but cheap and good for an hour here and there.  Don't let the developer be the deciding factor, otherwise, you are gonna hate.age: 8+score: 5/10"
