,Not Recommended,238930,8678628,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Ooops,"7 Grand Steps is an interesting concept: board game meets chose-your-own-adventure-meets (very light) civilization. You begin the game as a couple of poor workers and must build a dynasty, trying to climb the social ladder. Since 7 Grand steps is very much the sum of its parts, I'll describe each one, as it's quite difficult to understand the game based on existing reviews.DescriptionThe board game. That part is an almost direct port of the board game Cartagena. You almost always control two playing pieces (husband and wife). You advance the track by paying a token that makes you advance to the next location on the track that has a symbol matching that of the token. You can also move backwards to the next space that is occupied by another playing piece (either your spouse or one of the shadow pieces that are controlled by the AI). Doing so earns you tokens. How many and of what type depends on your skill level (more on that later). Here stops the Cartagena comparison.Whenever you land on a space occupied by your spouse, there is a chance that you'll get a child. Children must be educated, so it's best to feed them tokens as often as possible. Doing so increases their skills, which will be used when the child becomes an adult (you can chose which child to play as in the next generation, a choice you have to make when the current one reaches the end of the track). Remember that the skills increase the number of tokens received when making a move towards the back.There are 4 different tracks on the board, one for each social strata. With few exceptions, you're confined to your own social status's track.On some spaces, beads are found that you can collect if you are among the firsts to reach the space. Collecting enough beads will trigger an event of one of three types: discovery (which changes one of the symbols on the track to a new one, and gives you a boost in skills and tokens for it, therefore giving you an advantage over shadow playing pieces), heroic, or social advancement.Heroic and social advancements trigger a short choose-your-own adventure. A narrative is presented to you, and you'll typically have to make 5 choices. If you make ""good"" choices, you earn rewards: assorted rewards for the heroic events, or climbing one step of the social ladder for social advancement ones.When you reach the fourth and last social class, you must make civ-style ruling decisions for your city each turn. You'll typically start as a sort of secretary of agriculture, but you'll get more power later on, on financial and defence matters for example. Most of those decisions are actually sliders to set (how much grain to distribute to the people, how much to store, what level of corruption do you tolerate/encourage, etc.)CommentsRegarding time spent on each section, 7 Grand Steps is actually about 90% board game, 7% choose-your-own-adventure, and 3% civ-style ruling.Meaning you'll spend the bulk of your time (I guess about 15 hours per game) playing the board part. Now ask yourself this: are you comfortable with a 13.5 hours-long game of Cartagena? No? Me neither! Cartagena is fun as a 45 minutes affair, but it's not meaty/varied/strategic enough to warrant 10+ hours a pop. It gets boring quite fast, actually.The choose-your-own-adventure part is unfortunately not better. It feels completely random, gives incredibly weak feedback (to the point where the text describing the resolution will leave you scratching your head: ""is that good or bad?""  ). It's also repetitive and lacks drama. The board game part might be boring, but at least it's something solid. You feel like you have some control on the outcome. Not so with the adventure part.About the civ-style part, I must admit I have not spent a lot of time with it (more on that later) and I certainly haven't seen all it has to offer. What I've seen is something pretty abstract, and relatively basic, but it made sense and gave me control, so probably the best part of the three. Too bad it's also the one you'll play the least.So why did I spend so little time with the ruling part? Of course, partly because, as I said, it's only accessible once you reach the top of the social ladder. But also because, when certain conditions are met, a ""challenge of the ages"" is triggered, which is another choose-your-own-adventure that ends in an age advancement (from the copper age to the bronze age for example). It's as random as the others, but the consequences are much more dramatic. After my first ""challenge of the ages"", my character died and I got to play a distant sibling in the next age. The problem is, that sibling was only on the second rung of the social ladder and had of course no access to the ruling game. And that's actually the moment I quit this game: I didn't want to spend another 3 or 4 hours to reach the point where I could play the only part of the game that was at least mildly satisfying. yukConclusionI don't recommend 7 Grand Steps. It's much too repetitive, long and random. in short, it's very boring. That's a shame, really, because the basic concept is interesting. This game is apparently the first of the 7 grand steps (full title is 7 Grand Steps, Step 1: What Ancients Begat). IF (capitalization intended) the developer manages to correct its many flaws, I think there's a possibility of making a very good and original game out of the concept. I therefore wouldn't rule out playing step 2, if it ever sees the light of day. But until then, I'd avoid the game entirely.If you're desperate for playing a game with a similar concept, there are two alternatives I can think of:* Zafehouse Diaries, about Zombie apocalypse survival. Not excellent, but much better than this.* King of the Dragon Pass, which I haven't played yet, but sounds similar with a stronger emphasis on the ruling part (it also has much better reviews)."

However, with 7 Grand Steps, there's more at stake. Your coins are steps to improving oneself in the world. In this case, a coin operated Ancient Egypt. You have coins that denote the 'skills' you can adept yourself in as it pushes you forward into time. If you decide to excel yourself in the society, you move up in the social hiearchy. You can find new techs (skills) or become a hero through its adventure-story style of narrative.However, once you get to the ruler class, it becomes a challenge and that is what I admire: a game that is actively trying to push you back if you screw up. It is telling you to learn the mechanics again and come back when you are ready. That is why I am recommending this game. It is a game that is responding to your choices, your shifts and your play of the coins. Who knew a slot machine would be this fun?"

,Not Recommended,238930,9383579,"Posted: 8 March, 2014",all,utopianmachine,"7 Grand Steps is an ambitious game. It provides a single-player boardgame experience against computer-controlled AI characters set amongst the classic ages of history. Unfortunately, the experience is enormously crippled by the random elements of the game. Progress often feels the benefit of luck, and the frequent impediments to your progress are frustrating and feel beyond player control. While the various storylines you'll encounter are somewhat engaging, they are often hopelessly vague. Character choices that work for one individual utterly fail for another. While training children is an important part of the game, the parents can reproduce beyond their means, such that nurturing each child becomes impossible. Should you choose to dote on one child, rivalries will develop which hinder progress down the line.While progress is exciting, especially from Age to Age, due to the strange and random nature of the game, you could be forced to play one Age for a great length of time. As you are forced to make the same choices again and again, the tedium weighs the experience down, such that slogging through the wheel becomes a chore. While you may find the game has an instant surface appeal, it doesn't ultimately hold up. The lives of the characters in the game feel beyond any meaningful influence, and each turn eventually feels mechanical.The initial wonder of the experience was greatly muted after a few hours of play, to the point that I couldn't explain why I continued to play. The structure of 7 Grand Steps is intriguing, but sadly, it is a flawed creation. ""Winning"" the game is an empty achievement: the end result of many hours of token creation in a blind universe."

The trailer and associated screenshots make it look simple, but I can assure you; it is not. Installed it Sept. 3rd, in the afternoon, and played just about 12 hours straight almost. This is one of the best sims I have played in a LONG time, and easily justifies $15. It gets its hooks into you early, and quickly turns into one of those ""just one more turn"" games. It is unique, has a seemingly infinite amount of depth, and one play through is REALLY long if done correctly. I'm still on my first family, after this initial 12 hours.

,Not Recommended,238930,11904504,"Posted: 28 August, 2014",all,AinSofLight,"I kind of have mixed feelings about this game. I would give it 5/10. Good, playable, but with serious drawbacks.Upsides:It does give you a strangely epic feeling - you do feel like a part of history itself, looking at stories of families not at the level of each individual, but ultimately, for the entire family bloodline, as a whole. I would say that this epicness is the most unusual part about this game, which no other games I've ever played offers.The graphics and music is also not bad for a game of its size.Downsides:The biggest problem is the disconnect between player's choices and their consequences, and the lack of any coherent logic as to how and why to make decisions. For example, when your family is facing a crisis of the age, you are given 4 questions, each with 4 choices - and after you choose all 4 answers, you kind of get a ""score"" on how you did. But there is absolutely no prompts as to why one answer may or may not be correct - and the worst answer kills your character outright, and the previous 2-3 hours of your gameplay is wasted. What the hell?! This happens in other places too...To make this even worse, there's no SAVE functionality in this game - just Pause/Continue. I understand that history cannot be rewinded, and that decisions are decisions. It makes sense, but this is a game, for people to play. It is not meant to punish the player harshly. If the character you control dies, you lose your previous 2-3 hours of progress; If all you characters of the current generation dies, you are dead. Your game progress is completely erased. What the hell?!Overall, I like this game for what it's good for, but I hate it for what it's bad for. I'm not playing it again."

Others with an open mind and a willingness to learn the rules might find themselves strangely addicted.Though some reviews compare this game to a slot machine, the comparison is apt only in the most superficial way.  Instead, it is a solo boardgame with a length that feels like a full-on campaign and the ability to quit and save your state in three seconds (take that Mage Knight).  While there is a compelling storytelling mechanic at work (that emulates King of Dragon Pass to some degree), understanding the underlying mechanics is essential to success.  Difficult decisions abound, and multiple winning conditions, tradeoffs between long-term and short-term success, and pinches of push-your-luck tension are all present.  Really curious to see whether a sequel would stick with the same base mechanics or innovate all over again.  Definitely an indie gem."

It's about a mysterious coin-op machine which represents the progression of time and a family's struggle to advance - and sometimes just to survive - the turning wheels of history. Their story is told mostly with the interaction of a few abstract icons, and the occasional snippet of text, and you'd think it would be a rather cold and abstract experience. It didn't feel that way to me, though. The struggle to find the best way to provide for your children's future has real emotional weight, for example. I still can't really say why I like this so much, but it's a totally different experience to most computer games. It seems very simple at first, and the complexity only creeps up on you very slowly, but as it does, the whole experience seems to grow with it. Highly recommended."

Originally, this game was meant to be part of a seven part series. The developer has mentioned however (in early 2014), that the second step (game) won't be coming for ""several more years"".The game is stylized after the old coin games in which you insert a coin into a machine which triggers movement. Game play is relatively simple to understand, but is complex enough so that there is a layer of strategy involved.The game is relatively simple. Through the use of coins and choices made during game play, you influence a family through the ages, determining how educated the children become and how powerful the family becomes. Play the game right, and your family could end up ruling over their city as high priest or even king.Long Review:Story:  You start in the bronze age as a new family. Throughout the game, you'll be presented with story cards through which you can sometimes influence the fate of your family. There are several Ages through which you must progress in this game. Each Age follows several generations of your family. Some generations manage to reach high society while some struggle to survive as simple peasants. The story cards are very samey throughout a given Age, which can make the game a bit boring at times.Graphics: The art assets are very well done in this game. Similar to the story cards, there aren't many different assets, but that's to be expected, given what the game itself is a relica of (old fashioned coin fed theatric game machines).Music/Sounds: The music and sounds in What Ancients Begat are superb and really add a lot to the overall ambience and immersion of the game. They're not over done, but are instead rather subtle, which is exactly what a game like this needs to make it shine.Length: According to the forums, the length of this game varies according to each person's play style. Some people manage to finish the game in less than 5 hours, while others take closer to 15 hours to reach the end. Personally, I got about 13 hours worth of play time.Replayability: There is a bit of replayability in this game. In my opinion, it's well worth playing through at least twice, as the first time can be seen as an opportunity to learn the mechanics and work out a viable strategy for the second playthough.Overall, I recommend that you purchase this game if you enjoy simple, historical, slow paced games with strategical elements and few art assets. It's definitely worth getting on sale, if nothing else."

It, in fact, could have been a nice game... if it were about 5 times shorter and 10 times cheaper.One playthrough takes wa-a-a-y too long, even if you don’t take into account the possibility of your family dying out halfway through, which of course makes you start over, as there is only one save. For the first couple of hours planning on your family’s development, balancing between producing tokens, spending them and moving forward is interesting, even fascinating – due to the novelty of this experience, probably – but it gets old really fast.You rise up to the very top of your ancient society, become an ultimate ruler… and then the Age ends, and you find out that you have to do the same thing yet another time. And again, in the third Age. The art changes from Age to Age, the icons on the board change… everything else remains the same, over and over again. Once you start climbing up the social ladder during the third Age, the routine gets depressingly, brain-curdlingly repetitive and boring. The ruling mini-games are the only thing that is different among the three ages, and again, after you organize your city’s grain supplies for 30-odd turns, repeating the same set of actions…The title implies that the developer plans on continuing the series, this time showing the way of a family through the Middle Ages. If the sequel ever gets around to being released and it will be similar to this game in terms of game mechanics, well… I can only say that the developer is really, really optimistic if he plans to keep it up for all 7 steps."

As first side, the game seems like a ""Monopoly"": you start by moving your character-token and gathering ressources (token and achievement points). But you'll quickly discover that the gameplay mecanism has quite some depth: how to optimize your itinerary by minimizing ressource-token used and by maximizing achievement points gain, how to use ""boost"" of movement etc etc... There are a lot of tricks that can give you some tactical advantage over AIs.However, this gameplay discover phase may take you 2 hours or so, and then you may start to feel some repetitiveness: the game has 3 main phases (copper age, bronze age and iron age), all of them have absolutely the same gameplay mecanism. The only thing that changes with the ages is the ""ruling game"", which you gain access by uplifting to the highest rank. Honestly for me, the ruling game is the true shining point of the game, they are kind of ""management & simulation"" like mini-games. I found them pretty well thought, as they fit very well to the historical aspects of each age.One major default is that the ""random side stories"" you can encounter. The problem is that... well they are random, but the pool of available events are extremely low... If you chain several ""heroic deeds"" quests, it's very likely you'll get the same story twice or more. For a game which is supposed to centered on developping a story of a clan/family, I found this very annoying.Overall, I rate this 7/10.

,Not Recommended,238930,34330628,Posted: 18 August,all,Arkan01d,"TL;DR If you find this game on sale for less than $5 it is worth a play, but with big caveats.When I first saw this game I thought of King of Dragon Pass. That's an old reference most may not know, but bascially it's a texted based adventure where you try to manage a society. Each choice has consequences. It's a really awesome game and you can still pick it up ongog.com.So I see this game and think it's King of Dragon Pass with a little more board game play and possibly less text. I was wrong. This game does have progression. It does have a story. But damned if I know what it going on! I'm not sure why I'm switching boards or why I have tokens or how things are happening. There is no flow to this game. It goes from one board to another and back then switches things up. You're never told why things are happening. Some things that I felt should be planned are random. Some things are planned that should have been random. It jarrs the player back and forth through story and board games and slot machines without any message as to it's scope or reasoning.I spent the first 10 minutes of the game making a baby and training that baby to be someone better than me. Then the game went in another direction and totally forgot all about the offspring I had spent so much time creating...Discovery in a game is important. It helps a player learn and keeps them engaged. Too much tutorial or just plain text dumps at the beginning of a game always gets a down vote from me. This game did the exact opposite but in a bad way. It's almost like the developer's thought you'd have some grasp of the game already. What I'm trying to say is it's like playing a First Person Game. There doesn't need to be a tutorial to tell you WASD is for moving, mouse is for looking. We've played enough First Person Games we don't need our hand held in that reguard. BUT let's say the first time you played Skyrim they didn't tell you how to pick a lock. That would leave you confused and slightly frustrated. What if they didn't tell you how to equip spells? What if they didn't tell you how to sneak? WHAT IF they did not tell you who you were or why you were even playing the game??? Say the game just dropped you outside the starter city, in the wilds, with no story or tutorials and just let you play? That is what this game proudly attempts to do. The difference is this is not a First Person Game, it's a board game, and I don't know anyone who just picks up a board game and begins playing without consulting a few rules to begin with.There is enough intrigue to keep you playing for a while, but not enough to fully enjoy the game. In the hour I played, I never felt as though I knew what was going on. Also at $20 the game is a rip off. Maybe the developer's felt they put a lot of effort in the game and it's worth it, but the reviews state otherwise.I do want to like the game. Maybe if I understood why the turns kept flipping around or what my purpose in the game even was I may have played longer. But as it stands this game is a tangled mess that only the truely entrepid or bored gamers will ever fully come to enjoy. If you're someone who needs no motivation this is probably the game for you, but at $20 it's still not worth your time."

It's not at all a typical computer game, being mechanically very much inspired by euro-style boardgames, with some minimal systems based around the stock and flow of tokens that do a suprisingly good job of representing complex scenarios of social and economic status. Periodically you get a little story describing some challenge or incident of life in an ancient city-state and these help to flesh out the history of the family that you are steering through the ages - what narrative there is emerges from a combination of these vignettes and the story you tell yourself as you move your tokens (representing the patriarchs and matriarchs of your clan) around upon the ever revolving wheel, but the content provided by the game designer is minimal - a spur to imagination rather than providing a story to you on a plate.Going by what the designer has said, I have only played about the first third of this game and haven't graduated t the 'game of thrones' element that comes in to play once you get to the outside track of the wheel - so this review is really a preliminary impression.

One complaint is that you can't manage the country unless your primary character (the child you raised from the previous generation) moves, so you can't get the +1 research...But I guess it kinda makes since due to how that +1 research is explained, and it's not that big of a deal.What I REALLY don't like, however, is that all your story choices are made when you decide the character's personality, which is fine....I guess, because there are definite ""best"" responses to each event, and should you be able to choose it...well, you see where that goes.

No aspect or combination is worth the full price.The game concept and overall execution isn't bad, but suffers from simply pretending to be more than it is. A lack of documentation that serves to feign complexity.Example: You're given 4 questions with 4 options each. The degree of success determines how well you will do in the new age, while complete failure will outright kill the character. That sounds fair.However, picking the exact same options on a second playthrough might result in different results. Why? The stats or family of the character? The reputation of the character? Wealth of the character? Any missions undertaken by the character? Pure chance, possibly with a greater chance of success for certain options?Yeah, good luck figuring it out, because the game doesn't tell you.

You want to buy this game because it seems like it'll pioneer choose-your-own-adventure storytelling into a strategy game, but it ultimately fails.  The CYOA is often linear and random in that you don't even get to choose among options or the options you choose among don't have sensible consequences.  Furthermore, if you try to influence those consequences through preparation, your preparation doesn't seem to help.I played the game up through the Bronze Age's ""Challenge of the Age"", and had to stop because of this.  After invading all of my neighbors for 20 turns straight and improving my cities infrastructure and roads, I died because my invading forces fell apart and couldn't regroup despite how I previously got the regular army upgrade.  In other words, everything I did up to that point was completely meaningless.  Yea, I could have taken the conservative route, but I thought my mechanical preparation would have made that unnecessary.  On top of that, in the Copper Age, I took the conservative route in the ""Challenge of the Age"" when subduing colonies that weren't tributing resources any longer, yet that penalized me by making the invasion of my main enemy more difficult since it had more time to prepare.This ignores other problems like how the king gave me only so much time to ""conquer a city"", but despite how I won so many invasions where I got sued for peace, the king still didn't recognize my conquests and even ridiculed me instead.  Other times, the king would build me monuments but still keep the clock ticking.I mean the mechanics in the lower three social tiers are easy enough to grasp as long as you play a balanced strategy between using the ingot to get more tokens versus jumping on victory point chips to achieve heroics, discoveries, and social status.  Don't breed too many children either or else you'll end up with sibling rivals in the next generation who make your life a pain.  You can be sure of this by using the ingot back and forth between your partners in moving backwards to make more tokens while the other one gets victory point chips......but ultimately, the storytelling just falls flat.  Decisions don't make sense.  Sometimes, you don't even get to make a decision, and half the time, the story doesn't even seem important.  This especially happens when choosing a personality for your next generation after finishing a rite of passage.  What's the difference in the game between being virtuous versus benevolent or miserly versus petty?  The game is never clear about this.All and all, interesting concept, but poor execution.___________EDIT:  I have since completed the game since my last playthrough had a dimwit sibling, so the game let me play as him (or her since I don't remember).  Luckily, I managed to get a lot of tokens by playing the ingot over and over, so my next generation lead the country to success......upon which I became a hermit shepherd who never got married and had to start over in the bronze age again......so I did, and again became a shepherd, but got married and had too many kids that constantly got in fights, but I eventually managed to reach the ruler class in the iron age anyway.The game ended with the empire splitting up after I consolidated all the power of the (Roman) Senate, and my family forgotten in the original part while remembered widely in the new part......and then the game tells you there will be a part 2 and that your family's history is saved in your documents folder......except it wasn't.  :-\The Iron Age ruling period is weird since you have to vote for bills alongside your political party to maintain support among constituents even if the empire suffers.  My party got so small at one point though that I had more politicians supporting me than my party size was, so I had no idea how to vote.  Thankfully, I finished the game before getting removed from power and dumped back into the noble class.I dunno about you, but the game seems like it needs a lot of work to me."

The gameplay is a bit complex to understand at first, but you quickly get into it (definitely not because of the tutorial though).However, the text-based parts quickly repeat themselves, even within a game time of just a couple minutes. This especially goes for 'rite's, which occur every generation... and there is exactly 1 rite per class/gender.The sideevents are rather repetitive, too, and completely random, reminding of CKII style brutal difficulty spikes.In my oppinion, one of the game's biggest strengths, the storytelling, suffers exactly from this lack of content.On top of that, the gameplay quickly grows repetitive and feels overly lengthy... to the degree where the lack of actual content diversity becomes even more of an issue.I think this game is not worth more then a few bucks, maybe 5€.

I am also not sure if I actually enjoyed playing the game.The overall goal of the game is that to lead a family through various generations, and by your decisions lead them upwards from common laborers to become artisans, merchants or even priests and kings. A turn based game, you either move your charges to new positions on a spinning wheel based on a variety of tokens you have on hand, or spend a turn earning new tokens. Ultimately, you character will have children, and these tokens can also be used to teach these descendants new skills, which will - once they have grown up - limit where they can move on the game- board. It is a unique game and for that alone is worth the price of admission.I'm just not sure it's really that much fun. Game mechanics are poorly explained, and too much of the gameplay is determined randomly by the computer. This makes it exceedingly difficult to create any sort of long term strategy and - especially as the game progresses - advancing the characters upwards through the social ranks takes more and more time and becomes increasingly onerous. I suppose this bears some resemblance to real life but since I use games to escape this sort of drudgery, it doesn't entice me to keep playing.

I bought this game during a sale period (02/15/2014). I found it to be mesmerizing. It's a little confusing, I'd admit. I don't know all the features, but found it enjoyable. Before I knew it, I'd played for several hours straight and was surprised how much time I'd played. The phrase, ""Time flies when you're having fun"" fit. This is not a ""shoot-'em-up"", tactical warfare, zombie, or even strategy game. This is a game to amuse you. I'm age 37, and in many ways I felt like I was in the casino."
,Recommended,238930,9150892,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,› mineshaft,"Summary: This game is kind of slow but mesmerizing. You're turning the massive gears of a beautiful clock. It oozes one-more-turn once you figure out what's going on. I recommend it for patient people who enjoy working out intricate single player puzzle systems. If that's not what you want to do, you will bounce right off.In this game, you move a married couple individually, Candy-Land style, along a wheel of a few tens of spaces marked with symbols. You move by spending coins with a matching symbol, which represent skills, or maybe technologies, like Brewing, Sailing, Writing, and so on. Other people, basically your neighbors, are also moving along the wheel, spending their coins. Some spaces contain points that fill up a ""legacy"" meter. So first, you are basically racing your neighbors to them.The way that you get coins is by moving backwards to your previous neighbor, then teaming up to do work together. Each person has individual skill levels and produces different coins based on those skill levels. If one spouse you control teams up with the other one, they both produce coins at once. When you meet different neighbors, you can also trigger random events that may affect your people's personalities and stockpiles.Each turn you have to decide whether to go forward or back, one move per person. After every turn, the wheel rotates backwards toward crocodiles, death. So there is first this balance between exploiting and replenishing your resources.If that were all, the game would still be pretty simple and your decisions would be pretty constrained. But then you have babies.When the married couple meet as they journey on the wheel of life, they may produce children. Children are stupid. They have no skills. Each turn, you can decide whether or not to train your children by spending coins on them. Trained children can themselves be used to produce coins in skills they are especially good at, which can become critical if you need a particular move.Every turn of the wheel, the biological clock ticks down. Eventually, the current generation ages and cannot advance for more tokens (death is a wall), and doesn't have room to go backwards to do more work. So you have to pass on your family legacy to your chosen heir. If their skills suck, then when they take over the game, they will have a harder time succeeding.So each turn becomes a series of agonizing tradeoffs. If you train the kids, you can't move out for points. If you go backwards and fall behind the group, you have to spend a lot of worthwhile tokens just to stay alive. It's a diabolical resource management puzzle.If there's one thing I would change, in contrast to other fun dynasty/legacy games like Crusader Kings II, you don't usually get to make choices for your characters. Usually in an event there is one option to click on, which violates my sense of role playing and agency. Or in the succession event, all the options can look crappy. Are you: a) evil; b) dumb; c) cowardly? It could be improved by making the pros and cons of each option a little more visible, or a little more obviously pro.Also, the progression can feel pretty slow, especially when there are no points in sight on the board. In such a case, it can feel pretty grindy to train up the chosen heir as much as possible and squeeze every drop out of the parents. After a succession you can feel like you're not going to make much headway if your heir is crappy. In general, you feel like you're working a lot for rewards that are few and far between.At the top of the progression there is even more game as you become a city administrator and make even more decisions. I've just gotten into this, but it promises the same interlocking connections between the different levels of the game."

You slot coins into the playing pieces, the pieces move, the wheel spins. You make a family line where you can track their progress. Other than the coin slot, there isn't much interativity until you get to the ruling caste. There is some challenge there but its pretty mindless and the only thinking you have to do is to figure out where your next pieces should go, and how much should you invest in the next generation. So for casual gamers, who enjoy things like facebook games and stuff, I think you might enjoy this.I thoroughly enjoyed my five hours playing this game, and I would continue to play more...If it didn't crash that often for me. I have no idea if its my computer, or the game, but I have crashed about 5 to 7 times in the five hours spent on this game. Although it could be because I'm on a windowed version. Seriously I'm here enjoying the game, then it crashes. I restart it, it usually picks up where it left off... or the saved bit. I honestly cant remember. After a while the steps start to blend. There is some lost progress occasionally from the crashes, but that loss of progress doesn't irritate me. I just spin more and make better decisions.But oh man the crashes just irritate me. Seriously. I've never written a review before and I've felt irritated enough by the crashes to actually write one.

It plays like a casual, strategic peg solitare board game, but it produces engaging, thought provoking stories. In the game, you guide a family's journey through thousands of years of history. You set their aims and decide how they handle their fate.To give you an example, I played as the Archian family named after the family's discovery of the Arch building technique. The first child of the family remained an only child despite the parents' many attempts to become pregnant a second time. The child became known as Raziya the lovable, for she was much loved. Raziya married Amen and started trading in pottery. Her first born, Kawab, grew up to have  a very pessimistic view of life. As he was gathering courage to propose to the love of his life, she went on a boat trip where she married his best friend. Kawab felt his pessimism confirmed and became a fatalist: All that happens is meant to happen and cannot be changed. Kawab's friend knew of Kawab's love and felt immensely grateful towards Kawab for giving up his own happiness. He became Kawab's most loyal friend and ally. Kawab married a woman whom he did not love, but who was deeply in love with him. He later became a local hero as he stopped a massacre on his village. Kawab begat two children: Etan and Osahar. Kawab was a genious irrigator and ran a very successful farm. He gave both his children the opportunity to study, but Osahar also followed his father into the fields and thus learnt from his genious. Kawab tragically ended his days, when his was killed by the city guards on a false accusation of stealing. His wife struggled as a sole provider. Etan became head of the family, for Osahar loved his brother and would never speak out of turn against him.Etan entered the family into the trading business and they rose in society. His father's irrigation geninous, however, was not carried on. Etan married the love of his life, but she did not love him. She only married him because he was rich. Thus Etan in a way ironically suffered his fathers's fate reversed.All this from only 3 hours of gameplay and the game has barely started. I warmly recommend this game."

However, at the current price point, other than the novelty of the game there's not really much in the way of meat on the bones. The core game mechanics are entirely random and there is no way for the player to understand the consequences of their choices as they play. Essentially, this is the same as playing a slot machine, with a randomly emerging narrative that the player has very little to do with.If it were 4-5 bucks, it might be a great buy for a new and innovative experience. That being said, it is *not* worth buying at this price point if you expect a lot of game time or an in-depth, user guided emergent narrative because it isn't there. I give it a gold star for effort, and I will probably tinker with it from time to time, but it is not so much a video game and closer to video gambling."

It's very much a moving boardgame in the sense of visuals and playstyle; the player must tactfully advance across the board while playing tokens they earn by doing specific task (or luck). The point is to raise your family line into something great; this however doesn't necessarily mean becoming incredibly wealthy or status oriented as one can become important in the lower tiers of the game as well.It can be tedious at times but I find the interactive story events charming and intriguing as you advance through family generations and across different ages of time. If you have the patience it's definitely worth your time. $9.99 is a fair price price I feel.

The board moves toward the crocodiles every turn, and you have to stay away from the crocodiles by using tokens to move forward, but you have to move backwards to get more tokens. Collecting legend points gains you advances and when you make a discovery you get 10 tokens of whatever type you discover, and basically have a monopoly on them for a while.The problem is with the random events in the game. you're going along fine, doign well, and then the game randomly kills your character. Not because of anything -you- did, mind you. Just because it randomly decided to. I wouldn't mind if I'd doen something stupid and gotten killed, but no, you don't even get to make choices.
