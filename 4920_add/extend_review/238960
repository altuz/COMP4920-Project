,Recommended,238960,29667624,Posted: 3 February,all,Purp_Skurp,Very good game.  Its free to play so how cann you go wrong.  Can get somewhat repetitive working your way through the acts multiple times.SMALL TIP FOR NEW PLAYERS:  Pay attention to your skill tree.  This is very important.  If your skill tree is not optimized properly towards what types of spells and attacks you plan on doing then you will not be able to defeat the higher tier enemys and end up grinding HARD.  Look up some good Path of Exile builds online or on youtube and follow those.You will not just have one character.  And you will not play through the game just once.  Everytime becomes more of a challenge to better your character.10/10 would wash up on a beach again.

76561198052349706,Recommended,238960,30022340,Posted: 18 February,all,Zyx,"TL;DRThis is a great game. Try it out, its free anyway.Review:Path of Exile is a ftp-Action_RPG game, released 2013 and being under continued development since then, having had multiple free expansions, leagues and content updates. It can be played solo or in a party with up to 5 other people on either soft- or hardcore.Pros:-Free to Play, only cosmetical purchases-dark & gritty style fitting the story and lore-insanely deep and varied skill system-smooth leveling experience-expansive and challenging endgame-interesting and unique currency and crafting system-free trading economy-seasonal leagues with their own twists and challenges to keep the game fresh-regular free content patches-big and friendly community-around 5h of soundtrack-nice looking cosmetical microtransactionsCons:-this will eat your time-start of play can be unimpressive-since this is a always online game, connection issues can be a problem-daunting skill tree-through the leveling process you have to play the same story 3 times in increasing difficulty (changed in the future*)*as of now, the new expansion ""Fall of Oriath"" has been announced for mid 2017, adding 6 new acts to the 4 existing ones, therefore eliminating the need to replay the story 3 times. (i have a boner)Conclusion:For anyone interested in the action-rpg genre and disappointed by Diablo 3, look no further than this ftp-gem called Path of Exile. Challenging, rewarding and smooth to play, this appeals to everyone: the casual softcore to the min-maxing hardcore player. There is little as rewarding as building up your own character, theorycrafting, gearing, fighting, struggling and finally concquering everything the game has to offer. And then doing another one, thats complety different. And another one.For someone new to the action-rpg genre, don't get scared by the seemingly endless possibilites and mechanics the game offers you, punch through the somewhat tedious first 2-3 hours of the game and enter the realm of the game that will suck you in and never let you out again.9,5/10"

,Not Recommended,238960,29710187,Posted: 4 February,all,A Lightning Round,"I can tell there's a great game here, but it's hidden behind a ton of obtuse mechanics that take a while to decipher. Any attempty to try and understand the meta of the game is tied up in different concepts that, on their own are cool, but require you to put a TON of time into the game.If you have the time to dedicate to a single game, this one is a good candidate. But the lack of a trading mechanism that isn't whispers with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and a skill point system that punishes people who don't have the time to learn the meta means I wouldn't recommend PoE. I've read multiple people say you're supposed to fail a couple of builds, but I don't see that as interesting or worth putting my time into. If I've failed at putting together a build, I'd like to at least be able to reasonably grind out respec points or reasonably tweak my build without starting over from scratch. I can only run the mid-game so many times before it gets boring. With the skill system's current state, you're better off putting tens of hours into what you can only hope isn't another failed build from scratch.Build a decent trading system and help players who want to respec and I don't think I'd ever want to play anything else. With things as they are, and with the devs explicitly mentioning they won't improve on the absolutely atrocious trading system, I have no problem giving this title a negative review."
76561197963161776,Not Recommended,238960,30216533,Posted: 27 February,all,Razor,"This game tries very hard to keep you playing as long as possible because it lacks content and is too short. The main problems are:- The storyline is too short and can be finished in 10 hours. You then have to do it again 2 more times on higher difficulty levels for more XP and better gear.- You can't easily respec your skill tree if you made bad choices. You either need to spend days farming items that grant you respec points or you can start fresh with a new character. In fact, experienced players always warn new players that ""Your first two characters will suck"" so that should tell you something.- Higher difficulties make you lose XP when you die. So basically if you're too weak to progress in an area of the game, the game's logic is to keep you weak. The only thing to do is to farm XP for hours by killing monsters in areas you've already visited and cleared without too much trouble.- Farming for better gear is a chore. The drop chance is the same everywhere. If you want a specific item, such as a better armor for your mage, you can't farm it faster by going to an area where it's more likely to drop.- There's no auction hall, trading with players is done through the public trade chat channel and private message. At best there's a third-party website that sort of helps organize trades between players but it's not exactly convenient to use (at least it's far from as convenient as a real auction hall would be). This is obviously intentional to keep the players playing and farming for gear instead of acquiring it easily from other players, yet the devs have the nerve to say that the lack of an auction hall it's a feature intented to promote player interaction!- There's a new ""league"" every now and then. A league is like a separate server that lasts a limited time. When the time is up, your character gets moved to the main server. You must make a new character to join a new league. The thing is, some unique items can only be acquired in specific leagues. So to get them, you're forced to start a new character with every league. Again, just another ridiculous way the game tries to make you grind.- The game is incredibly hard (again, to keep you grinding and playing). In other games there's a point where getting more health or resistances than you already have just makes things easier but isn't required, but in Path of Exile you need to grab all the health you can in the skill tree and max out your resistances (all of them at the same time, because enemy encounters are unpredictable and monsters aggro you off screen).I keep dying in areas of my level. I have a good balance of health, mana and damage but it's not enough to survive long enough to earn XP and level up. I could have maxed out my health first, but then I'd either be running out of mana after casting just 3 spells or my damage would be so low it would take me minutes to kill basic mobs. To reasonably progress in the areas of my character's level, I actually need at least a dozen more levels. It's just ridiculous, but again the game tries to make you grind for XP, gear and everything else or otherwise you'd be done with it in 10 hours.I don't know why people like this game. I assume they got tricked into spending money and don't want to face the fact it was a mistake (the game is enjoyable in the beginning, the frustration only becomes obvious halfway through the second playthrough). Or maybe these players just can't afford to buy games so they're stuck with PoE and have to make the best of it. Or maybe they have so much free time that spending 10 hours grinding for a few levels isn't a big deal to them.Either way, the objective truth is that this game has an awful design. It's nothing more than a grindfest. Honestly I tried. I really tried to enjoy the game and getting through the tedious parts. I tried to believe the positive reviews saying it was a good game, or that end game was fun, or that you could overcome the difficulty once you knew the game better. But it just keeps getting more grindy and tedious, and the difficulty is artificial and there's not much to learn that makes it easier. It gets worse and worse as you play. I got far enough to realize that the game has only 10 hours of content and the only way the devs found to keep people playing is to make them grind for hours on end for a small bonus. If that's the impression I'm left with after more than 80 hours of playing, I'm not going to stick around for another 80 hours just to see if it does actually get better at some point. I'm not going to spend dozens more hours testing yet another ""good build"" recommended by an experienced player (I've spent at least 20 hours researching information to get better and I'm still stuck). 80 hours of playtime and all I see is a grindfest. That's probably becauseit isa grindfest.So honestly, stay away from this game. It's not fun or enjoyable after the first playthrough.Edit: Also, the community is just awful. There are a few helpful mature players here and there but for the most part it's just rude and childish people. I've never had to remove so many insults and one-line troll posts from a review before in such a short amount of time. I'll start leaving non-constructive comments up though, that way mature people looking for actual information about the game can see the problem for themselves. And I'm not even going to mention the stuff I saw in the game chat."

If they spend some more time refining the new player experience and polishing what they do have, this could be the game of the decade.Some positives:- Lots and lots of viable builds and room to be creative- End game content done right- Great community and responsive developers- League system is outstanding and filled with consistent updates. A lot to look forward to every three months- Very few botters and currency sellers. They have zero tolerance and dedicate resources to preventing/stopping them- A true Free to Play game where there is 0 pay for power. With that being said, please support these devs by buying the aesthetics or account features, especially if you want to send a message that pay for power is not an acceptable revenue model for PCSome downsides:- Game performance and extreme over the top VFX on skills make it difficult to group up unless you have a super computer. I wish they would tone down the skill VFX a bit- Because there is so much going on on the screen, it is very difficult to tell what is harmful vs what isn't when in a party- Very intimidating new player experience with very little guidance. I honestly believe they can reduce the intimidation with some better onboarding- There needs to be better options for trading. One of the more frustrating aspects of the game is having to leave your map or whatever you are doing to trade. I understand the downsides of having an AH, but I think there is a better compromise to be made. They should allow trading posts where someone can visit your hideout and buy an item with a set buyout."

Well, yeah, there is tremendous amount of looting and killing in PoE, but really, really this game is about creating builds and see how it works.You have to devour and digest enormous meta to fully enjoy this, and learning it is a part of the fun.Huge passive tree, lots of active skills (gems), different ways of attack and defend, buffs and debuffs, type of weapons and magic, six classes each with 3 sub top classes and one class which is mix of all of them, and links and synergies between all this stuff. It all leads to literally endless variations how you can build your character and play it.Oh, and this game is totally free. No content is hidden behind the paywall, you just pay for cosmetics and extra stash space which you need only if you love to collect all kind ot trash you'll never need.So it's easy 10/10 for me, now I have to create another new character with this build idea I've just got."

I tried this game again and was amazed at how far its come, and how much it does right compared to Diablo 3.This game has incredible depth and unique varied RPG systems that makes leveling up really fun. You have the skill tree (similar to FFX) as you level. You also have skill gems and gem slots that allow you to add, remove, and mod skills with other skills. Its a very fun system. You can also level up those skills too.The gameplay is addicting and fun. Party up or solo its a great experience.

I have been playing Path of Exile since June of 2012http://i.imgur.com/jeP6URF.pngand have thousands of hours on it.It is among the most amazingly awesome games I have ever played. Coming from Diablo 2: LoD, and the various mods (Valhalla, Eastern Sun, Median, etc) this game is perfect for me.* I will start here, with the things that I enjoy about it.1. Diversity among builds. Want to shoot a thousand exploding arrows per second (Quill Rain + Chain/Greater Multiple Projectiles/Exploding Arrow/Fire Penetration)? Want to blast rays of fire that launch exploding balls of magma (Scorching Ray/Cast While Channeling/ Fire Penetration/ Multiple Projectiles/Magma Orb)? Want to call forth the fury of the heavens with a mighty scepter, smashing your foes into submission (Mjolnir+ Lightning Strike/Arc/StormCall/Spark/Multistrike)? The sheer amount of ways you can go about destroying mobs is limited only to your imagination.2. Story is great, very interestnig, and keeps you entertaining while playing through the game. Unlike other ARPGS of similar play style, Path of Exile is able to effectively deliver a quality story along with the extremely well done gameplay.3. Scenery is dark and grim, gloomy, morbid, and full of gore. From corpse ridden beaches, ancient temples filled with undead and skeletons, destitute crumbling cities, palace cellars flooded with blood - ridden with heaps of corpses and twisted miscreations, echocing crystal caverns of golems and mutated freaks. The variety in enemies and terrain is very broad.4. Item creation, map alteration and creation, uber dungeons. There is plenty of challenge to be had in this game, thus keeping you striving to achieve ever greater power and push yourself ot the absolute limits of your capabilities.5. Infinite replayablity. I have made probably 50+ characters so far, and each one gets progressively more powerful as I understand more about the game, the mechanics, and how to build them effectively.6. Temp Leagues + Ladder. Nuff said.7. Constant expansion and content updates. The game is constantly being updated, minor balance tweaks, additional items, skills, monsters, maps, etc. It's amazing.8. Grinding Gear Games are among the most amazing gaming company. Really really good people and they constantly interact and have dialogue with the playerbase. ""How do you guys feel about X? Does Y feel right to you? If you could change X, what would you do and why?"" etc.I could go on for another thousand lines but I feel as though I got the point across. The game is amazingly fun and addicting.Now, for the things that, I don't necessarily ""dislike"" - but things that I feel may dissuade other people from playing the game.1. Learning Curve is incredibly steep. Your first 3-5 characters will be absolute trash. You need to do a bit of research on what to do and how to build effectively, otherwise you're probably going to get wrecked hard once you get to a4 merciless. Here is a beginners guide -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZtq6FSebE&list=PLjlRwdIo6SixoG_Bo5bhKCzZtOMVuVnJZ&index=8&t=8s2. Repetition of acts, 3 difficulties (however, this will be gone come July - TEN ACTS ONE PLAYTHROUGH HYPE!) Going from Normal, to Cruel, and then to Merciless can really put people off. Myself, I'm used to it and have done it since d2 so it's just a normal thing for the arpg genre. GGG are going to change that though.3. Item crafting isextremelyexpensive. Like, unfathomably expensive. I have never crafted an item before other than throwing an alch and a couple chaos into a rare item.4. Currency is nightmarishly rare. I've found maybe 4 exalted orbs in my entire time playing this game. Two of them were just within the last week as well. I have only ever owned two 6-link items. Wings of Entropy, and some random rare 2h sword that is garbage.5. poe.trade is the only real way to trade. $Chat is a scam 100% of the time. Once they implement a real trading system other than posting shops online and checking the forums every 3 minutes, or browsing poe.trade for an hour at a time trying to find an item to fill a hole in your build this game will be just shy of perfection.Those are really the only negative things I can think of that might dissuade a player from sticking around... the game is magnificent.I highly, highly suggest you play.Overall Rating10/10 - one of my favorite games of all time."

PoE will test your skill and if you truly want to enjoy it you'll have to endure the challenges until you reach low-tier maps/endgame.Pros:-Diablo 2 successor-highly customizable builds-solid lore (soon to be expanded with patch 3.0)-unforgiving gameplay (no handholding, a lot of knowledge required)-frequently updated and expanded (new season every 3 months, new expansion every 9 months)-great community and dev team (devs communicate often on reddit and deeply care for the game, community gladly reaches out to new players)-patches always bring way more than promised (we were told next expansion brings story Act 5, we got acts 5-10)-game is free! (but investing 10-20$ will make your Stash organizing less stressfull)Cons:-lags happen (I'm playing on an old rig (GTX460) and it's very rare, but some people complain so hey)-can be overwhelming for a newbie or impatient people (some forget ARPG is based on grinding, or that it's not easy to reach endgame)-if you decide you want to keep playing, you'll want to invest 10-20$ for Stash tabs (not mandatory, just makes life easier)-no in-game auction system (for me this is a plus, for many reasons. Anyway, they are working on a new system that won't mess up economy like D3 Auction house)Path of Exile is an ARPG, hack'n'slash that decided to be a spiritual successor to Diablo 2, and in that intention it succeeded completely. If you're looking for a game that will fill a hole in your heart that D2 left, something that's way more complex than D3, darker than Torchlight or Titan Quest, faster than Grim Dawn - you've found it here. But that's not all. What really sold me on PoE are the community and dev team.With all that in mind I still have to give a warning. The game doesn't do any handholding. Knowledge required is vast, combinations are near endless and you'll have to stumble through a lot of deaths to reach endgame, much more if you decide to make your own unique skill build. Luckily, with recent influx of players and huge expansion coming in June community is working on guides, tutorials more than ever before!"

Much like other popular MMOs with functional, live economies, the trading in this game is very dynamic and conceptually representative of real-world economics. To really grow and amass your wealth in this game players naturally develop business strategies that are applicable in the real world. Flipping, currency manipulation, product research, value assessement, market forecasting (legacy items), negotiation, marketing and monopolization are all important skills to apply if you want to be the richest in the leagues. Simply grinding through the game and accumulating wealth through linear progression won't be enough to a major influence in the economy.Throughout my countless hours of trading endeavors spent in Path of Exile I can say I learned many valuable business oriented lessons; of which I think everyone can benefit from."

This is an excellent game and it's unbelievable that it's free! There's so much freedom when it comes to playstyles. The necromancer actually feels like a necromancer. I've got like 14 minions (zombies, specters, a golem, and a badass minion that's made up of various gear/weapons that I come across. All of that and the ability to summon 11 more skeletons if needed. It's absolute chaos and I love it! The hideouts are just the icing on the cake. I looove games with player housing and it just adds that extra little touch of personalization. Plus you can bring in the guys that sell furniture and do daily missions for them.I also really appreciate that there's no pay to win here. I've purchased a bunch of vanity items just because I wanted to show my support. Ok I also kinda wanted to be shiny... But that's besides the point! I've easily spent more money on this game than games that try to go with a pay to win strategy. Really excellent. It's free so get it! You won't be disappointed.TLDR: Lots of play style options.

76561198008964408,Recommended,238960,29787068,Posted: 8 February,all,Sooner535{UFIP},"What can I say about Path of Exile?There are over 25 different currencies which you can use to:Buy well over 75 gems to socket into your:Over 200 different item bases (each can be 1 of 4 different rarities with millions, if not billions, of combinations of stats) which help augment:A passive tree of over 1300 buffs to each of:6 basic classes with 1 unique class with:the basic classes each having 3 different sub classes and the advanced class having a versatile one.Path of Exile is a game where the sky is the limit in terms of builds and enjoyment. I have built:A necromancer who relies solely on 2 golems, 7 zombies, and 9 skeletons to fight off the enemyA mace and shield user that runs a skill that burns himself and enemies around him for massive damageA Electromancer that has 1 life and 10k+ energy shield which buffs and provides healing/support to nearby alliesThat is just the first 300 hours on Steam(ish) I cannot imagine the builds or fun I will fall into later in this game. But first some downsides to this game (because there is some):I do not like the 50+ level grind, it can take hours to grind levels in the 90s region. This is more of a genre annoyance then a specific PoE complaint, however for those that like the feeling of leveling up this hurts the fun alotRnG is ran by Satan himself (I have no proof of this)Having to run through the campaign 3 times to get to the maps (end game) is quite tedious, this will be made better as more acts are added though.The game can jerk around in ping spikes quite often (I never do HC because of this) although I understand that the reason for this is the sheer amount of things the game has to relay to the servers, would be nice to see a few improvements in this area.All in all Path of Exile is what I consider the most flexible RPG known to man, the sheer number of things you can do is staggering (such as a totem build that cannot fight by himself) and this only increases with each patch adding new and exciting gems and uniques.TL:DR9/10"

I played about 10 hours and shelved it. Why? I don't know. I Jumped into other stuff including Diablo 3 and forgot all about this game. Year or two later, I've returned... What an Idiot I was. I should have been playing this game all along. PoE is the gold standard of ARPG's at this time.PROSFREE. WHAT?!For those of you that are into deep, complex, and rewarding character builds, this is YOUR game.The economy is brilliantly done. A barter like system with no gold. Spending things you could use yourself on your own gear creates value, unlike throwing generic piles of numbers around...The game has micro transactions, but they are NOT P2W at all. The micro transactions are done in an ethical way to fund the game and bling out your account. Nice job GGG.Player made hideouts. Might not be a deal to most, but are fun to create and make great meeting spots for all the trading you'll be doing. You'll be surprised by the sheer amount of decorations that are available. Unlike other MMO's out there, you can earn your decor by just playing the game as normal without grinding for hours and hours on random, not-fun stuff.Leagues, updates, patches, etc are frequent and VERY good. This game is WELL SUPPORTED.Huge support and fan community. Just go to twitch or youtube and find out for yourself.CONSThere are some cons to the game. No game is perfect, but if you want a very engaging ARPG to sink your teeth into, look no further. Some players complain about the difficulty of ascending your character on merciless difficulty and others complain about the grind of leveling after the 70's. (Max is 100) Others want trading to be easier...Let's just say this: ""If it were easy, you wouldn't respect it.""I respect the hell outta this game."

This time READING on how the class system and how the gems actually work. That helped. A LOT.Loving this game now, and progressing steadily (act 3, level 29  (or so) Ranger).Pros:+ Free+ No pay2win model. You can only buy stackspace and cosmetics (weapon effects, transmogs, etc).+ Visuals are great if you crank up the settings.+ Some quests have choices (with a different outcome/reward)+ Skill gem system+ No strict classes, a class is just a starting point in the (large) passive skill tree. But with enough points you can go anywhere.+ Voiceacting is excellent+ All items are (party) tradeable / giveable.+ Loot item filter system (just download a premade script to get you started)+ Upcoming SSF-mode (Solo Self-Found)+ Game is under active development (despite being around for quite some time now)Cons:- Load times. My disk is not the fastest around (I play on a laptop), but the waits are sometimes annoying.

But this game with this in-depth crafting system, the build system is un-explanable (You will get used to it thougth,, just look at the skill-tree, read some basics about build-crafting and you will honestly be set to go.)  the massive build variations in PoE.. I don't know what to say to explain myself short but, it's tbh the greatest, hottest, most amazing ARPG out there and has been and hoppefully stay so).Try it out, if you're a fan of Action-RPG, Hack&Slash die to an unexpected one shot from a detonate dead mob then this is the game for you. Mark my words, for real! Frikking frokking try it and play the game trougth once and you're hooked as if it was Mr. Walter White who cooked this game,Some explanations:I honestly dont know how many hours i put into this incredible frikking frakking frokking awesome game made by the frikking frakking company Grinding Gear Games. Wich from the start had a staff on (idk, 11-13 active developers). *ChrisRNG*Never played on steam really, that was after my time *_* (--> dedicated member since 2011).To be fair I can just say, screw you D3! Path Of Exile is the game Diablo 3 should have been.So a quick headsup for you guys who did ""try"" the game, running to Mud Flats and got bored.Keep going, you don't know what you're missing out on.The game is so much bigger than you could imagine, there is so many things to do.Level up your masters wich will reward you with many kind of options, gear optimization, Atziri (End-game boss (UBER Atziri),  labyrinths wich will reward you with powerful passives in the Ascendansy tree. Different type of mods you can roll on different maps (maps is the ""mainly focused"" end-game content I guess.)Stop reading!! Go theorycraft, go look into builds, and you can thank me later.How come the game is free2play?? Pay2Win???NO! It's not p2w at all! It's up to you if you want to look badass in the new Golden, silver, bloody, goor MTX!+++ The trading econymy isnt viable by gold, you have different kinds of Orbs, for example:+_* Alchemy Orb: Makes A white items into a(rare, items yellow random stats.*_+ Chaos Orb: wich rerolls the affixes on an rare (yellow) item.+++ You don't HAVE to pay anything if you don't want too (there is microtransactions *Mtx*, skins, extra stash tabs).+++ I have spent alot of money into this game and I don't regret it for a minute. But I don't get more powerful beacuse I wear my cuul armors from MTX.+++ No, there is too much! Ill stop writing now and just listen to me and the growing community, the game is good, really, there is no.Ginding gear games succeded.A bigger review from my side, I will keep on suporting this game as long as I live, I promise!It's free, it's very good optimized atm it seems.Just do it, try it, play trougth the holw act and you will understand me!"

In my opinion Grinding Gear Games did their best during the creation process of Path of Exile, they gave us everything they could. This game offers endless possibilities and countless hours of fun for absolutely no charge. We all should be thankful for this business approach while every other company tries to squeeze out as much money out of gamers as possible with unfinished games.  I highly recommend this game for everybody who was a Diablo II – Lord of Destruction fanatic. This game is so much more Diablo than Diablo III – Reaper of Souls. If you haven’t played this game yet, start downloading it for your own good!Regards,POE.Grendel"

,Recommended,238960,30150914,Posted: 24 February,all,Masa,"Path of Exile is a decent enough online-only action RPG that sticks pretty close to the classic Diablo formula. It is also a great example of a free to play game done right.The game is clearly made for the hardcore fans of the genre. There's a fair bit of complexity and very little handholding. At times the game feels downright hostile to new players as there are plenty of ways to permanently mess up your character build and the game does a rather terrible job of explaining many of the game mechanics. In practice you are pretty much forced to read wikis and guides unless you enjoy going through a lot of tedious trial and error.On the other hand it's quite refreshing to see a complex character development system in this day and age when most games go for the dumbed down approach instead. The massive skill tree is certainly the most notorious example of this. I wasn't actually a massive fan of the tree, however. The tree just feels like a lot of added complexity for little additional depth. The skill gem system on the other hand is a great addition and offers some interesting choices between the different active skills and the various support gems. I would have actually preferred to see even more options and complexity here.Unfortunately the actual moment to moment gameplay is rather lackluster and simple. While the character builds are complex enough, the actual combat is not very involved and you generally have only a few active abilities available to you at a time. This is something where both Grim Dawn and Diablo II do a much better job.The loot system is pretty standard for the genre and not particularly exciting. The monsters drop a lot of loot but the vast majority is useless junk. Even most of the unique items feel rather underwhelming. I also strongly disliked how clearly the loot system is designed around trading items, something I personally have zero interest in games like these. The potion system on the other hand is a great innovation and one of my favorite features of the game.Visually the game is not much to look at and the maps and monsters often look boring and dull. A bit more inspired visual design would have certainly helped. The game also suffers from rather serious performance issues and terrible optimization. Sound effects and music are passable, but not particularly memorable.On a more positive note the free to play model is extremely well done. Most of the things you can buy are just cosmetics with no in-game bonuses. The extra stash space is really the only thing you need to spend money on, but the standard four tabs should be sufficient for quite a while unless you are a pack rat.Overall I had somewhat mixed feelings about Path of Exile. On one hand it offers decent character customization and lots of content. On the other hand the actual gameplay is rather lackluster and the production values leave a lot to be desired. Still, it's almost completely free to play and as such easy to recommend. Just be prepared for a massive time commitment and a large amount of repetition if you want to reach the end game.For this review I played once through the normal difficulty mode. Personally I didn't enjoy the game enough to push through the other difficulty modes to reach the end game. I also played a fair bit around the original launch, but I wasn't overly impressed by the game back then either. I'll probably come back for another look when the 3.0 patch is released.The good:- Superb free to play model- Lots of content- Good variety of different character builds- Skill gem system is great- Innovative potion systemThe bad:- Boring loot- Good items are very hard to get without trading- Bland visuals- Poorly optimized- Weak writing and utterly forgettable story- Obtuse game mechanics- Grindy and repetitive (which is normal for the genre, still doesn't make it enjoyable)"

The community is great, the developer support is great, and the gameplay is extremely satisfying.  A big problem with loot-based ARPG's is that the end-game is usually underwhelming, which limits the replay value.  With PoE, you can spend countless hours running end-game maps and developing your character(s).One of the biggest pros is that the developer pushes new content out regularly in the form of Leagues, which adds new game mechanics to freshen the gameplay.  As far as developer support is concerned, GGG has to be near the top.9/10 for me, probably a full 10/10 once 3.0 is released in June/July."

However unkown to me at first, since I just started playing it, it's far, far better than any of the games in the Diablo series. If you've played any isometric-type, farming, looting, grinding game then you already know what you are getting yourself into with this one. Another great game, not as famous as Diablo or any games alike, but it sertaintly deserves it. The late-game is what you will be aiming for in this game. However, to reach this you have to go through a couple of hours of grinding and looting, whilst creating a character which is completely unique to all others. With an immense skilltree, with every perk avaliable to reach on every charather, you can truly create some unique builds. Want a spell-casting marauder? Feel free. Want a heavy assassin? Feel free. The possiblites of character custimaztion done right are endless.TL;DRPlayed Diablo? This is better.

The game borrows heavily from the Diablo series, particularly Diablo II. All areas aside from the central encampments are randomly generated for increased re-playability. While all players on a single server can freely mingle in encampments, gameplay outside of encampments is highly instanced, providing every player or party with an isolated map to freely explore.Players can initially choose from six available classes to play as (Duelist, Marauder, Ranger, Shadow, Templar, and Witch)"

(the one thing D3 did right)*Wasn't too bad at starting up for a exp ARPG player, skill tree is a bit overwhelming  at first but I've seen the community telling new players asking about builds to just play the first time and enjoy it which is nice.---A little advice that helped me so far being a new player:Watch A diablo players guide to PoE and anything else that is good Tips and Tricks for PoE they really do help with a quick guide to the skill tree that will make it not so overwhelming. Please don't go to the global chat as a google you wont get a response I've found this to be true even with a minor questions. With that though I find it EXTREMELY easy to go from desktop to game quick which is surprising because I don't believe I own a single game that will let me do that without running really slow or messing up the game.With this all said NOW is a perfect time to start playing this game with Tons of Solo and Multiplayer content coming, a new Ladder starting, and the new League starting which is basically round up past events with famous times that are buffed even better, Come play PoE!I just cannot believe this game is free and here I am enjoying it more than some $60 titles I've bought.Thanks GGG Keep up the Awesomeness that is Path of Exiles"

The wonder and nostalgic feeling of things like skill gems going into socketed items and changing them, and the use of things like jewels really made whatever level of complexity there totally fun. In contrast, and sorry to draw the comparison with d2 -- to someone without any information to go off of, a LOT of the game mechanics are horrendously complex. Imagine having a few runes and thinking "" Hey, I'll just put this ber first then my jah cause it looks cooler"" and never considering runewords at all until you stumble upon them down the road. Global chat having basically always sucked except for maybe the first 3 years of the game wouldn't help that for players coming to the game later.tl;dr game is only complex if you plan on just going in blind and figuring every little thing out and needing to solve everything yourself.10/10 would not rescue tolman again at the behest of global chat"

It has limited replayability though, however the storyline is one of the most immersive I have ever seen, it just blew me away and as it gets to its ending it really explores the deepest themes of human existence, morality and transhumanism. Made by Australians and New Zealanders, it draws on cultural traditions and stories outside our normal experience, especially referencing the Maori legends. Totally worth downloading and playing through for the sake of its amazing story."

With the announcement that they are expanding to China and Xbox one should increase that number even more. This game does more in one week then most games do in a year.

No p2w in any way, you can, however, support devs by buying some cosmetics and premium stash tabs but it's not a big deal and your gameplay will basically remain unchanged. The game is constantly updated and devs really care about their playerbase and not about how to fill their pockets as majority of gaming studios does nowadays. So this game is highly recommended not only for fans of Diablo 2 but also everyone who is looking for a high quality long lasting ARPG game with ridiculous amount of content and replayability, in addition - completely free. Have fun and support the devs if you can."

There are no pay to win elements and they consistently come up with major updates and content expansions. Sure the game has some clunky animations but its not detrimental to enjoyment at all. The other main drawback is the learning curve, but any game with solid depth will always have a steep learning curve.

76561198341756331,Recommended,238960,29971638,Posted: 16 February,all,Lord of the Gord,"Path of Exile is a Diablo-like game with way more character building than Diablo thanks to the Passive skill tree which is giant and is the reason you can make very specialized characters which is amazing. Most importantly IT IS FREE!!! and I mean actually free, you can get to play the whole game without spending anything, it does have a cosmetic shop but that is all it is just cosmetics to make your character look more flashy or to your liking with nice visual effects and honestly Grinding Gear Games (developers of Path of Exile) deserve any money they get for the constant free updates and expansions which are of high quality, I would gladly buy cosmetics from the store if I had the money. The gameplay is much like Diablo but it starts off slow and gets faster as you improve your character and the skills come in the form of Gems which you can socket into weapons and armor and take them out so you don't lose them, Skill Gems grant you abilities and spells such as fireball, dual strike, frostbolt and WAY MORE! There are classes in this game but they only determine where you start on the passive skill tree and starting gear and ability. For anyone looking for a great free to play game or Diablo-like game this is the game to get especially if you like the dark fantasy aesthetic which is really nice in my opinion. Thank you if you read this review."

,Recommended,238960,29974073,Posted: 16 February,all,Zushakon,"Path of ExileWho should spend time playing this?Any fan of Diablo 2, Torchlight, and other similar ARPG’sIf you want a difficult and incredibly deep game with endless grind potential.How much Money Should I spend?This is F2P, though it is certainly worth a $60 investment if you enjoy ARPG’s.What’s it about?You are an exile that has wound up fighting for survival on a disturbed, violent, and hostile land.Your goal is to collect gear and wealth and work your way through ever malicious boss encounters and waves of monsters.Open ended Grind focused gameplay with tons of variety and loot gathering galore.What is the Gameplay?There are 6 classes, perhaps the most well developed and complex skill tree I’ve ever seen in a video game, and hundreds of different unique skills that really will let you play the game in a whole new way dozens of times over.The game uses a skill slot system that is essentially Materia from FF7, you pick up items called skill gems which you slot into your gear to grant your character spells and attacks.The PvP is decent though most of your time will probably be spent focusing on PvE grinding and gear farming.The game is much more difficult than other ARPG’s such as Diablo 3, there is a lot to learn within the game and it is very punishing for players you haven’t mastered certain game mechanics and interactions.The game has various leagues that change throughout the year and add special gameplay properties that really help to keep play fresh and exciting.Graphics/VisualsA good looking game with a macabre art style that is constantly improving all the time.The animations and movement is fantastic and everything moves and interacts smoothly.The effects are the high point here, though certain character models are to a degree stale and bland, the games spells are vibrant and pop magnificently.Sound/MusicThe music is rather good and fits the dark and somber mood of the game.Spells and attacks sound crisp but never become too messy or overcrowded.Dialogue is voiced very well and the tone of character voices suits the atmosphere of the game.What does it compare to?Diablo 2Torchlight 2Titan QuestAchievementsThe achievements are very straight forward and primarily focus on progression.Keep in mind many of them require hardcore progression, so if you want to 100% this game you will really have to invest the time to learn the mechanics and practice your gameplay.What are my overall thoughts?The best ARPG since Diablo 2 by far. Significantly greater depth, and difficulty, compared to something like Diablo 3.The game runs great and is very well optimized.I have found myself spending hours just sitting in town looking at websites trying to theory craft a fun and unique build.The PvE is incredible and is constantly updated with new content and leagues to keep things fresh. I can’t speak for the PvP, didn’t play it much, but the story is well done and the zones are all unique and interesting.This game is F2P and there is absolutely no reason not to try it out. If you like action RPG’s or just RPG’s in general you could get your fix with this game easily. I personally Invested at least $80 into this game and encourage anyone who enjoys it to support the team as well."

,Recommended,238960,30066420,Posted: 20 February,all,Rayad Ayporos Yorc,"Easily the absolute best ARPG on the market currently, including games that aren't supported by Steam.I joined this game looking for something to fill in the loss of ARPG games. I put countless hours into Diablo 2 and did spend time playing Diablo 3, but as time went on they were extremely repetitive. So, I decided to give this game a shot.Never have I been more satisfied with a game before, and the fact this is free to play is just icing on top of the most delicious cake you'll ever try. They have taken the ARPG genre and have blown any other competitor out of the water. From the crafting, to how much content there is, to design of character talents and how they work.I'm just going to be posting a summery of what I consider pros and cons here, but I am going to say that this game is an absolute must for any ARPG fan, and it may turn a lot of you Diablo 2 folk to the light.________________________________________________________________________Pros:-To start, 100% free to play - There are only a few quality of life things in the store, which are just for inventory management and extra storage, the rest is entirely cosmetic, no pay to win/progress. Grinding Gear Games has also shown me what a REAL free to play game is, and has shown what it means to be a real game studio.-Coming in the newest expansion, they are removing the typical ARPG element of repeating content 3 times in a row. It is being replaced with a total of 10 unique acts. Currently there are 4. A very unique stray from what a lot of this genre.-A very in depth system to design your characters with. You choose passives rather than actually putting points into your abilities. It is a system which reminds a lot of people I show of Final Fantasy X's ""sphere grid"". Your class determines your starting point on this grid of passives, making it easier to reach certain stats. You earn a point to put into this tree each time you level up as well as from a few quests.-End Game content is hardly as repetitive as any of the competition. While you eventually widdle your way down to a handful of them, there are several end game bosses to take on, and a mapping system that is as in depth as the crafting system for gear. You have 4 main paths on your atlas, a total of 126 maps, that progressively get more difficult as you find, roll stats on them, and progress into finding tougher battles. On top of that you can enhance these maps via sextants that you find, causing level maps to gain a temporary bonus effect, which can improve loot and spawm more enemies of various types.-A crafting system based on leveling up multiple NPC characters that send you on daily missions that unlocks player housing as well that you can fully customize and grow in size with the characters level.-There is quite a bit in regards to loot, stats, enchantments, etc. It makes really finding the things you need rewarding and worthwhile to use.-Graphically, this game is gorgeous for an ARPG, especially if you like a dark, gritty atmosphere.________________________________________________________________________I am very happy to say that the cons of this game are very few in my opinionCons:-Servers seem to be intermitant at times, and the game doesn't seem to like processing large amounts of abilities at once. Buffing a giant army of skeletons, for example...be prepared to experience a delay for a moment as it gets everything together.-The difficulty of several of the end games maps scales severely, and causes a meta game that pushes away several build types in favor of clearing the game as quick as possible. If you play with online groups prepare to need a high clear speed, and people like to move as fast as possible through everything.-3rd party tools are highly recommended to use in trading. The market is web browser based. The quality of life stash tabs I mentioned prior are able to post directly to the site, others who decide not to own these tabs are able to use 3rd party software to do the same thing however.-While purchasing cosmetics are 100% optional, the pricing of these items is very high. I actually explain to people that these are MACROtransactions with armor sets costing $42 and individual items sometimes costing $32 or more. Still, 100% optional and it does help out the game considering it is FREE. Quality of life stash space to use the market from in game will cost you something around $10-15.________________________________________________________________________Overall, this game is the highest quality of its kind. I have put in almost 1,000 hours so far and plan to easily double that over time. The creators show their dedication to working on it as well, and nothing about it feels rushed or scammy like a lot of the free market. I was, and have continued to be, impressed by this game!"

No pay-to-win, but if you want cool skins you can buy them.Endless amounts of free content released at regular intervals that really make you want to support the developers.The character customisation can be extremely intimidating at first, but with a little practice (and a lot of online guides) you'll be able create a character that perfectly suits your play style.If you're sick of playing the same old acts 2 or 3 times, PoE has you covered. They're releasing 6 new acts in which you go to new places, and revisit others to experience the impact of your actions during the first 5 acts. If there was ever a time to give Path of Exile a go, now would be it!The community can be a little hit-and-miss but I've managed to find some really friendly, knowledgable people to help me out.One of the most pervasive negative things about this game is definitely the trading system. It's fine once you get used to it, but expect to take some time out of gaming to learn the ropes. If you're against downloading external programs for trading then you might have some trouble selling off your gear, but it's not a game-breaking issue.I highly recommend this game to any ARPG lovers. Just keep in mind that it's much more complicated than most ARPGs, and has a much steeper learning curve.8/10"

Since Nov'2016, there has been a lot of threads relating to device/ shader d3d9 issues, which seem to occur for the most part, at critical times like at the end of an ascendancy trial run or on a unique map or boss. Until they fix this issue i'm not likely to change my opinion, it makes the game even more frustrating than it already is.Grinding Gear Games is a very apt name for the company given the levelling system. It is easy at early levels to plow through enemies and experience, but after hitting levels 50 and beyond, the experience curve gets steep. Very steep.Maxed out at level 90 with one character, but given the time and effort to do that, i think i'll pass on seroiusly trying it again (that was pre-patch before they made the experience gradient even steeper)Also, worthy of mention is the random number generated system, or whatever it tries to define itself as. It is so unforgiving at times, but when you are spunking hours and hours worth of playtimes worth of in game currency, trying to achieve the desired rolls/ effects only to be met with disappointment time and time again, it starts to loose it's appeal. Thankfully forgotten masters/ workbench has eradicated some of the issues, but you will be waiting a long time indeed (talking hundreds of hours probably) for that 6 linked something you've been dreaming of, or you could always try your luck with the ridiculous odds.Thats about the crux of it. Hope those who play, enjoy the game and hopefully GGG will improve the game with time."

,Recommended,238960,30161002,Posted: 25 February,all,Indian Hotline,"1100 hours as of today. I guess it is fair to write a review.Path of Exile is a free to play game with some of the best overall core features of any game to date.~POSITIVES:-Free to play: The fact that it is free to play gives many people an opportunity to dislike or engross themselves in the game, with minimal investment.-Passive tree: The passive tree consists of hundreds of interconnected 'nodes' that provide some sort of function to your character.-Learning curve: Even if it seems daunting at first, with a little of investment such as youtube videos on PoE mechanics, you can begin your journey into PoE. Then you are left to gradually build your knowledge, with many forums and build guides at your fingertips.-CASH SHOP: This is one of the big ones. In this day and age when the term F2P rises, one is inclined to believe that there is some sort of P2W system in the game. But the devs (GGG) have constructed it perfectly. The Cash shop essentially consists of cosmetics such as armor, skin transfers and skill effects. The only thing that is even close to debatable is the fact that you have to pay for extra stash space. But due to the FREQUENT STASH SALES, you can get dozens for dirt cheap.-Community: the community is one of the best out there. It seems quite mature, due to many of the children being put off when they press 'P'. But the community is really helpful and you will always find people banding together grinding XP, Maps, Bosses. Infact in global you often see people giving away valuable items to players.-Content: Even if you don't intend to Nolyfe the game and want to be casual, it is always worth it to keep tabs on the new implimentations and content that releases. I honestly do not know how GGG does it. Their team is no where as large as Blizzard, and they put out new leagues every few months. Which implements some new mechanic for people to play with and enjoy. And every few leages, as well as a league, you get a new FREE DLC. which can potentially add hundreds of hours by themselves. Let me give an example. PoE has put out 10 ACTS, HUNDREDS OF UNIQUES, PASSIVE CHANGES, and many other things, and D3 has....A NECROMANCER CLASS WOOHOOOO!!!!Replayability: Due to some of the frequent changes and implementations that PoE gives out, this adds for some amazing replayability. With HUNDREDS of Skills and uniques, this can lead to HUNDREDS of VIABLE builds for endgame content.NEGATIVES:-Requires time to ""git gud"": To get to be a top tier player, it does require time investment.-Server issues: Sometimes servers may be a little laggy, but this only really gets annoying just after a new league releases. Which leads to...DESYNC!!!!! ASFKAFLKHGHKAHDLGHLAHGLKGHKLKHG-Nerfs: Often when you find a build you like and want to keep for Standard league, it will be nerfed after the league anyway, especially if it is a ""Meta build"". RIP MJOLNER I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. When this happens it can lead to your items for that character to decrease in value, decreasing your total balance by a fraction, but nobody cares about standard anyways.I rate 10 Necromancers."

Serious kudos to the devs creating the content and art. That being said, it still has some major issues with lag and DC's that seem to stem from server & backbone issues that have persisted through the years. In a game where you lose XP upon death, DC's and 1k+ lag spikes every few seconds during peak hours, are a joy killer. I've put up with the performance issues for a long time but enough is enough.Finally completed an Uber lab run solo last night and had a DC while selecting an enchant and the Ascendancy points. GG. Progress lost along with the consumable required to get into Uber lab. This is too common for a game company that wishes to bring their game to the big time. GGG needs to get their act together. If this stuff happened on a Blizzard MMO you'd have people ending subscriptions in droves.I'm done. Uninstall. If GGG ever gets their game functioning at a decent level of reliability I'll probably be back but my desire to spend money on it is completely gone.New player beware."

At the end of the day, the biggest flaw to the game is just that it feels a little too grindy.The seasonal aspect of the game is cool, but realistically it just means you're spending the first week or two every season just grinding the same three areas over and over until you reach level 80, at which point you're ready to start grinding the maps for crafting material that you sell to get better items.Oh - and the inventory system is just plain stupid. Loot drops so prolificly that there is even a custom loot filter in place so that you can limit what you see to only the items you care about, but your inventory is so small that you can only hold 10 or so items before needing to sell. So realistically you just don't pick anything except the best stuff up, which ruins the whole loot piniata experience.Overall I can't recommend this game. Diablo 3 is just plain better in every way. If you've played that game to death and are bored, sure, pick this one up and play for free, but otherwise don't bother."

76561198110830942,Not Recommended,238960,29974170,Posted: 16 February,all,GiantPandaOfDoom,"I really loved this game for the first 70 hours of playing. It was refreshing and I hadn't played a game like this since Diablo II, which was at least a decade ago. I made my first class a Marauder because I liked going two-handed weapons, maces specifically. Nothing really seemed so bad about this game. It was a very enjoyable experience. I found the story compelling and the graphics appeasable to the eyes. And since everything was voice acted so wonderfully, it made the immersion even better. The only thing I didn't like was that the story was so short (4 arcs which is like 4-5 hours each if you take your time and explore everything) and then they would just restart you into a more difficult mode.I was skeptical of such a thing, but I figured before I rate this game I should at least reach end game or close to it. So having gone through the story once already, I just mindlessly grinded through Cruel (the more difficult mode after Normal) to gain levels and better loot. Now I restarted the story again into the most hardest difficulty which was Merciless! Things were getting pretty dreary here. There's hardly any party interaction in this game as most things are done solo. The only reason you would party up is either for XP grinding or you hang out with friends or a guild. The looting allocation in this game also dissuades people from partying because there is no dice interaction or some substitute for a fair and random way to distribute loot, but rathera short allocation - which is that the leader of the party gets control of the loot for a short amount of time before it becomes availalbe to the rest of the party members.a permanent allocation - which is that the leader has full and permanent access to all the loot that is dropped.a free for all which honestly just creates chaosEventually things just become a grind. And it doesn't help with the fact that your stash - pretty much similar to a bank in other games - has limited space and you are forced to spend money if you wish to increase the amount of loot you can hoard in your stash. I know it's a free game so I wouldn't mind spending money on that, it's just that $8 - $20 depending on which stash tabs you purchase for virtual storage space isn't exactly worth it in my opinion unless you are planning to dedicate a lot of hours to this game.Right now I am pretty much at the end of Act 4 in Merciless mode and I would consider that pretty damn near to end game. My Marauder is level 73 and for the most part I think I skilled pretty decently for not have following a guide. End game is pretty much the never ending grind of breaches, maps, and Uber lab which you will find out if you play the game. And like all other mmorpgs, it eventually becomes a grind. I don't mind grinding, I really don't. I've played many MMORPGs and specifically I've spent at least a thousand hours on Tera. The important part is that a game has to make the grind fun in a sense, and not just put your face against the grindstone type of grind. On my Marauder I am pretty much only using one ability, maybe two abilities depending on the situation plus 1 self-aura and 1 party aura that both grants me a massive damage boost.There isn't really much of a skill cap in this game. There's no important factors other then gear and putting points correctly in your skill tree. Yeah sure you may have to memorize some animations for certain bosses, but it's honestly not that fun of a game at end game. It becomes a boring grind, and I hate boring grinds. Some of you guys may ignore it, but for me there's nothing interesting to keep me playing this game. I've experienced all it had to offer, well most of it anyways, and I am pretty sure if I am bored of it now, I'll be bored of it later. That doesn't mean it's a bad game. It's a great game and I highly recommend that you try it out! It's a fun experience for those who missed out on the Diablo series and maybe you might just fall in love with this game as I did. Maybe it'll be a lasting relationship instead of both sides just losing interest in each other. Just maybe."

,Recommended,238960,29523487,Posted: 27 January,all,Stroym,"As a huge fan of the ARPG genre, I can only recommend PoE, as can pretty much everyone else. (i've been around since open beta, had about 300 hours played outside Steam. I have so little since I mainly played HC chars and dying 80+ is just so, so painful.)The skill tree can be a bit overwhelming and sometimes you'll spend hours upon hours planning a build, especially if you want to get to the late game (so far I only played HC, but from what I've heard, plenty of SC people die so much they can't gain xp fast enough to actually level up after certain point) - glass cannons really don't work here.The F2P system they have in place is pretty nice, only cosmetics and character/bank slots. Tbh you're probably going to have to buy some slots, since 4 is really not enough (depends on how you manage items, if you just sell everything and keep only currencies and a few uniques, you should be fine for a looong time), but for this game it's worth it.Sockets and everything related to them can be annoying as hell, but this RNG in gear has always been a part of ARPGs. But I guess getting the top gear for your build is supposed to be hard, not just a few clicks and rolls and done."

,Recommended,238960,29518964,Posted: 27 January,all,Nerobyrne,"100% complete free game. This price includes all expansions.Unlike many games, this game is really fun, actually balanced, and has a lively community. It really feels like this is what Diablo III should have been but wasn't. The game's graphics and atmosphere are gritty and dark, yet all acts have a very unique feeling to them and the devs have really put a lot of effort into realistic weather effects. Sound, physics and design are all really well done.The skill system will seem familiar to those who played Final Fantasy X. There are no real classes, all you really select is your starting position on a giant disc of passive skills connected through lines. Each skill unlocks those adjacent to it, allowing your character to travel along a specific ""path"" of related skills.So, if you start with the witch, you will have easier access to magic skills, but that doesn't mean you cannot end up developing your bow skills as you grow stronger. Eventually you will unlock a character that starts in the middle and can literally be anything!""But what about active skills?"" I hear you ask. This is a really well done system: You have items that have sockets, much like the old favourite Diablo II. But instead of slotting gems with stats into it, you slot skill gems that drop from monsters. These skill gems level with your character and can be freely traded between your other characters or other players. These two systems mean that every single character you play will be your personal creation, with a limitless amount of different ways of playing.Finally, there is no gold, no zenny, no coins or credits. You trade with ""currency items"", which aren't just items you give to NPCs, they have actual functions. The lowest item is the identify scroll, and it goes up to orbs that can create special effects on your equipment.So, this is probably the most unique game you will ever play, and it is totally free!There is literally no excuse to not at least try it."

The only reason I haven't put more time into it is because I have other games I'm playing.But this is a well-thought out, modern ARPG with classical medieval fantastic elements and original ideas. You start by selecting a character from multiple different classes. You can create multiple characters. Also you can create ""hardcore"" characters which if they die stay dead! Otherwise, non-hardcore characters are revived automatically. The ""skill tree"" which lets you improve your character is enormous with hundreds of choices.  Also, you have a large inventory and the items that are in the game are generated randomly. Normal, magical, rare items are present and more. Even potions can be enchanted. You have a paperdoll to see the items you are wearing. Quivers too can be magical. There are bosses and regular monsters and champion monsters. There is a wide variety of monsters. Obviously, this game offers the same interface and control scheme as the Diablo serie, Titan Quest or Torchlight and similar titles. The controls work very well, the graphics are beautiful, the sound is great and the music, from what I remeber is also good. So overall this is an excellent game.The bottom line: For it's price (currently 0$) this is an incredibly good game to spend time getting invested in."

Go online and try to roll 4 four's, 1 six and 1 three on 6 eight sided dice exactly. And you'll find out what's it's like to play end game content. "" Oh shoot, I only roll 100 % max energy shield and +70 energy shield. that's garbage on this vaal regalia. No resistances, no stats. This is garbage"".Then you realize it took 3 days of play time to get those supplies for this crafting adventure and when you're disappointed and salty. You just get back on that horse and ride again.P.s I switched to the stand alone client and unlinked my steam at 178 hours. I'm probably nearing 600 and still ain't finished with this game..."

Variaty.I like to make character after character in a game simply to try something cool I found. I'll play a character 40 hours into a game, just to restart in the blink of an eye because I found something that seems cool and I want to see just what I can do with this new little toy. Not only this, but I do the same thing when a stupid, unconventonal idea enters my head and feel so good when it somehow works.This game right here, this game feeds that sooooo much, and I knew that was true the first glance I took at the immense skill tree. I have probably spent more time plotting a course through it, picking out what I want and the best path to get there, which route will take me through the most stats that will compliment my end goal, so on, so forth, then I have actually fighting.and I love it so much.This is a game that masterfully blends action and deep thinking and planning, and truely rewards you for practising both with potentially insainly strong characters. If you enjoy that, all the better. Each time you wonder if you can do better is a chance to start from scratch and plan it all out again, and the best part is that, for me at least, half of this game will, I suspect, take a super long time to get boring.So now that I have more time and am genuinly ready to commit to this, it's time to ruin this game like I did with dark souls. Time to make more metas and suffer disapointment when people copy and spread it around."

This is where it is geared towards ppl that have uber time on their hands that have completed the game MULTIPLE times to configure a build. That being said, many of the dynamics of the game including spells are bugged where they get blocked in door frames, tunnel openings , etc. The game is still living in the shadows of Diablo ((which imo, is a far superior game). the network syncing in the game is horrible, especially when they devs spam monsters in such quanity it becomes ridiculous. The game is fun to a degree, but the developers need to come up with something better than reducing your resistances by 75% on merciless, lossing 15% of your earned exp when killed and increasing the reward function let alone the complete lack of configing your gear unless you have an adequate supply of orbs for trading with other players for equip that can usually only be found from farming end bosses on high tier maps and having maxed out masters in your hideout so you can tweak the gear you have to a certain degree.

,Recommended,238960,29975787,Posted: 16 February,all,Ardeof,"This is an updated review as 3.0 has been released.FPS: There are threads on Reddit that are talking about how bad the fps is in 3.0. With 3.0 came ""Dynamic Resolution"" which is fairly common on consoles to lower the resolution to keep a steadier fps. Dynamic Resolution has come over to PC in Path of Exile and it isn't working that well. Part of the reason is because performance fps-wise in 3.0 *with dyanmic resolution* is about as bad as i've seen it in PoE. Even on my system which typically averaged let's say 40fps in towns and even in modest maps, i'm seeing heavy pixelation to meet the ""40 fps bar"" that I set. This seems to be an unfinished feature and it isn't tuned properly.CPU: CPU Core Count usage has improved, which is great. I did the typical test using Barrage in a hideout with Quill Rain and noted CPU usage before and after I filled the hideout as much as I could with arrows. CPU usage went from roughly 5% idle, to a capped 70% with 7~8 fps in the hideout. At this point, it's easy to tell that even if the CPU usage could go up a bit higher, there was still a limitation. PoE has improved core usage potential by an extra core, which is a bit odd to do. Two core and Four core has been a standard in games for quite a long time, it'd make more sense to go from two cores to four.""And at the end of the day, even if it's not perfect, it's better than nothing. At least, that's my opinion.” – said Keiji Inafune at his Mighty No.9 pre-re.HDD/Download:This is one of the other issues that I addressed. To summarize: Every time PoE had a patch that affected the GGPK file, even if it was a ~30MB change/addition, Steam would have to go through the (used to be 12GB) file to verify and patch the addition in. This was very inefficient and quite wasteful to a lot of drives over time. GGG seems to have shrunk this, or split the file, as it is now roughly 8GB in size. While that didn't really address the problem efficiently, it's certainly an improvement.The Content:I think a lot of experienced players can agree with me that some of these new maps in the acts (non ""remastered"") feel similar to others. It's almost as if a similar layout of another map was used and then adjusted to meet the needs of the new style. I'm not going to dock points for this one, but it was something worth mentioning since one area reminded me of another map with certain breasted miscreations. Other than that I think the acts were wanted/needed. Even if a lot of it is the graphics team going to town on some maps. At least now it'll be one smooth playthrough instead of doing the same four acts three times. Overall I think the new acts are great and add a lot more story, content, and creatures. I'm not a big fan of ""content for the sake of content"", but as long as it isn't abused like it is in some games (*ahem*, NMS) then the addition is welcome.Edit: The terrible FPS performance seems to be tied directly to Dynamic Resolution, at least from my experience. After testing the maps and such afterwards, framerate is about equal or better than usual. There is still that one town with the terrible fps, but I assume that'll get worked on a bit. With this in mind, i'm going to change to recommended but GGG should know that dynamic resolution isn't quite ready for the public. It seems to be overtuned to heavily focus on the FPS, but GGG tends to forget that on bad systems there'll be fps drop spikes. A player shouldn't have to look at a handful of pixels instead of 1920 x 1080 just because a strongbox was opened and Dynamic Resolution decided to drop all of the pixels just to get that fps. There would be some level of importance involved in this equation. It's a mess and causes more fps/visual problems than it fixes. Perhaps it's time to think about making more use of the GPU, especially fun stuff like CUDA cores. Even with the game maxed out, it barely makes a 750 Ti start to sweat. Plenty of room there to offload some computation on the GPU."
