At one point about two hours in we found ourselves in a situation where we had to deal with one of those lurkers that shoot spikes from the ground. To give our ranger the space to kill the lurker we needed to clear away all of the giant worms that were guarding it. Our thief ran in, threw his knives to get the worms' attention, then ran back around the corner where my paladin was waiting. As the worms circled around the corner to chase our thief they ran into my sword, and while a couple managed to poison me, our priest standing behind me had his healing beam running to keep me topped off. We killed off the horde and the ranger gave us the all-clear that the lurker was dead and the rest of us joined him in the lurker's lair to clear out to the booty.It was at this moment I said over voice chat to my friends, ""This game is awesome. Do you want to know what dungeon-crawler I believe Hammerwatch is ten times better than?""My friends responded ""Diablo 3?""""Yeah, Diablo 3."""
,Recommended,239070,7749904,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,DWIGHT was RIGHT,"Hammerwatch is definitely a game with a lot of effort and a lot of potential. From the comfortable pixel-art visuals, to the simple Gauntlet-style gameplay, I spent a good number of hours playing just through half of the game's basic campaign with a few friends and enjoyed it. Each choosable class feels different from one another, and as you progress, you can further your abilities to defeat swarms of tougher monsters. There's a few problems with the game, such as graphic bugs here and there, but they're few and far between. Top it off with a map editor that has as much potential as a set of dev tools, and Hammerwatch is definitely worth the $10."

Game is fantastic!  It's so simple in setup, yet so god damn challenging in execution.  I find it super addicting.There's so many game types combined here, I think that's what makes it so addicting to me.  In some aspects, it's pure hack and slash dungeon crawler.  Then you run into another type of monster, and it's a bit like a bullet hell shooter.  Then you get your exploration jones.  You get some simple puzzles.  Spike mazes.  All sorts of stuff!  They change it up a bit in that you're not gaining xp and levels, but you're hunting every shiny gold piece you can find to level up your skills, keeping it from being bogged down in stats and number crunching.I've played just under 2 hours and I think I'm on floor 2.  My only slight concern is that everything keeps looking the same in the further levels, as in the drab green and brown pain job.  This isn't even that big of a concern though, since the exploring's done pretty well and just the sheer fact of pressing on so you can find a save state is a pretty strong drive.  I just hope there's some other even cooler environments later on!"

Because this game does not have a central server you will need to make a local server on your machine for multiplayer. It will be listed as a joinable server to the public and people will join. Please let them play and make new friends. Sometimes it is hard to find a server to play on as people will sometimes kick you for no ryhme or reason. So when you pick up this game let others play on your server. This really doesn't take away from the fact this game is a lot of fun to play, just an inconvienience."

With amazing music composed by Two Feathers, plus the Online Multiplayer Co-op Adventure, this game hands down is one of my favorite pixelated dungeon crawler still to this date!IMPORTANT: This is more of a informational review that won't be going into the game-play.There are now two campaigns that you can play-through in this game.Castle HammerWatch: The first and original campaign. Recommended to playthrough at least once before moving on to other campaignsTemple of the Sun: The second campaign or Expansion campaign made by the HammerWatch developers. With lots of new mechanics compared to the first one.There are 3 different difficalty settings.Easy/Easier: Enemies do less damage and die easier.Medium: Standard difficulty.Hard: Only for very skilled players.There are now currently 6 Very unique classes all that play an important role.There is the Paladin, a melee fighter with good mobility and high defense.Wizard a ranged spell caster with good area of effect damage.Ranger a versatile fighter with long range. Recommendd for new players.Warlock a melee spell caster who can replenish health.Thief a high damage melee fighter with low defense.Priest a ranged spell caster with good defense who can heal.(Copied from the character select screen)Like I said all these classes play an important role when playing multiplayer and is recommended not to have more than one of each class, one is enough.My take on the game:I play Paladin 95% of the time and I am at the best of my game when I play as him, He is a good class to have on your team of adventures. His shield can block projectiles which can be very helpful for your teamates who don't have a shield. As the name says, the Paladin does have a healing ability, some may say that his healing ability is better than the Priest's, but that is another arguement for another day. In general the Paladin is a ""Hero"" among the other characters and I reccommend that you always have at least one Paladin on your team.  But, this is coming from some who almost always play Paladin and this is just my opinion, but remember it's your choice whether or not to have one.Conclusion:In my opinion I recommend this game to anyone who loves hack and slash action adventure games. It's an amzing game well done. And before you could argue that the price was not worth it because there was only 1 campaign but now there are two to playthrough. If you buy this game, I guarantee you will have a fun time playing it. It's one of the best hack and slash adventure games of all time in my opinion. ;)I hope you found this review helpful.

,Recommended,239070,12869444,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Nerd House,"Hammerwatch is a game that feels like an old school (and intentionally looks like one) hack-and-slash game similar to Gauntlet. The story consists of one box of text at the beginning: ""The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!"" From there, your job is to kill and collect anything in your path and stay alive. When I was younger I used to play the hell out of the Nintendo 64 version of Gauntlet, it was fun when I took on the levels alone, but things really got going when a friend or three joined. Hammerwatch is similar. Due to the non-existent story, your motivation for moving forward is take your selected character from a choice of a Paladin, Warlock, Wizard and Ranger and take them to the end.Playing alone, Hammerwatch is fun enough, fighting large groups of enemies as a lone Ranger, wiping out hundreds of bugs and creatures. The first act of the game is quite lengthy, where the constant killing and exploring for secrets slowly turns into looking for the way out. Fortunately there are save points around the world so when I began to burn out I could come back later refreshed and ready to go on. There are RPG elements in the game in the form of upgrading your attacks and adding in combos. At times I forgot that I could alter my skills, as it felt way too long between finding the vendors that I can purchase the skills from. Initially you have a basic attack and a special attack that feeds off of your magic meter. With combos added you gain bonuses such as health regeneration after killing 10 enemies in short time.Going with old style pixel art, Hammerwatch pulls it off well and feels like a game you could have been playing in the 90's. The music works as well. For controls you can use the keyboard or controller. I recommend using a controller if you have one over using the keyboard. Not that the keyboard is a bad way to play, but I found dual sticks the way to go.Playing co-op can be done by sharing the same screen or online. If you can, plug your computer/laptop up to a TV or have a big screen - sharing a screen can be good fun with a group of friends together. Online is great for if your friends aren't nearby or it's hard to get people together. The online experience isn't always smooth, there is stutter at times and a few graphical hiccups but neither really impact on the game and really I can't remember the last time I played an online game that ran super smooth so it's hard to knock Hammerwatch for the same.If you feel that you are up to some level editing that is available too, you can tailor make levels that you and your friends will enjoy. If you just want to make the game harder or easier there are sliders to adjust.There's not much to dislike about Hammerwatch unless you hate having fun, it's a fun Gauntlet style game; great fun with two to four people and fun enough playing it alone. Combined with some nice 'retro' visuals and good music to quest to, with the game editor you shouldn't run out of content anytime soon.Highly Recommended"

You'll be picking up tons and tons of gold but when it comes to getting an upgrade you'll only have enough for one then you're back down to being poor. The game generally goes: room of monsters, pull group, spam attack, pull group, spam attack, kill monster spawner, loot room. Repeat 100 more times for the rest of the game."

,Recommended,239070,8494843,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,[soth] Corion,"This game is a lot of fuuuuuuun! It's like an oldschool Gauntlet game with RPG elements mixed in. It's great for co-op gameplay, but perhaps too difficult in singleplayer.The way they balanced the different classes is quite amazing - each one has strengths and weaknesses that go beyond arbitrary mathematics. For instance, the Warlock has great AoE spells, but struggles to kill spawners, turrets, and bosses. The Ranger is great at killing spawners, turrets, and bosses from afar, but has trouble taking on enemy archers in large numbers. The Paladin can block enemy projectiles (archers? no problem!), but can't cope as well with masses of enemies and turrets. The wizard has very little health, but is great at taking out groups of enemies and their spawners, as long as he's not overwhelmed. It's a bit tough to put into words how great the variety between the classes feels, but these strengths and weaknesses are one reason why it helps to bring friends.My only gripe with the game is that the levels are all manually created (no random generation option), so they might not be as fun to play through multiple times. They're still adding content to the game, so it looks like there will be more to play in the future.  There's a level editor so the community can create additional content for it, but it's a bit more difficult to use than I expected - you can't just whip up some new levels with minimal effort.Overall, it's a great experience with friends. Fun for couch co-op or online multiplayer. Definitely worth playing, especially if it's on sale."

This game isn't super deep, you aren't going to be engrossed in a moving story, there's no beautiful graphics, there's not infinite replayability, and it's not a 300 hour campaign....But this game's a gem in every sense of the word. Single player is nothing great, but the feeling of getting 3-4 friends for a few hours of wild and ridiculous fun is hard to replicate. The controls are smooth, the game is simple enough for a non gamer to pick up and understand, and the mayhem of dragging a few hundred monsters in a loop around your friend, only to run to them to have them surrounded on all sides... is priceless."

,Recommended,239070,29792147,Posted: 8 February,all,Rumors,"If I could give this game a thumbs-sideways, I would.  Hammerwatch is a fun game, especially if you're able to get some friends together to play, but it has a number of glaring issues that really keep it from shining and, in fact, make it frustrating or a chore to play.  To keep myself from writing a multi-page review, I'mma just do bullet points.Though, I'll go ahead and say, this isn't a roguelike like some may say and it is barely an RPG.  It's really more kinda of a dungeon crawler or hack 'n slash.  Think of titles like the Gauntlet series.The Good-Six classes to choose from with a number of possibly upgrade paths means each run can be pretty varied.-Multiple built-in game modes:  two campaigns, an old version of the first campaign, a survival mode, and a sort of tower defense-esque mode.  ...except you have yourself instead of towers.-Online co-op play, either private or public.-An editor and Steam Workshop support means there's dozens of user-made levels to go explore, potentially increasing the replayability of the game a hundredfold.-Multiple settings for difficulty and modifiers to tweak, allowing you to customize the experience at the potential cost of not being able to earn achievements if you make it easier on yourself.-Music is pretty darn good.-Most of the time, it's pretty good about introducing hazards and monsters in ways that don't require you to die to them.-Lots of secrets to find.The Bad-Planks in the first campaign.The things are well hidden and, if you don't get all of them, you don't get the good ending.  And the game does not give any hint to this until you need them at the very end.  And if you miss one in a campaign, that run is doomed to failure.-Game gets a bit repetitive.  The levels drag on for about a floor too long each and enemy variety is incredibly tiny for their size.-Like many games of this type that try to be difficult, melee classes get shafted significantly harder than ranged classes do.-It bears repeating, but the acts last a bit too long.  I'd rather six acts with two floors each as, currently, you'll be tired of seeing the same enemies by the third floor.  Especially in Act III, which has massive and open second and third floors, and Act IV, which spams the heck out of spawners and spike turrets.-Some upgrades are pretty downright useless.  For example, the Warlock can spend gold on a passive that gives him a chance to heal off a kill.  He also can get an active skill that's a large AoE that's guaranteed to heal him for at least 1 HP per non-boss enemy hit.  Why bother with the passive?-Most bosses are kinda BSy, such as one that will randomly teleport next to you while firing multiple high damage shots.  If you happen to be walking in the wrong direction, you'll die instantly with no chance to react.-Exploration is practically mandatory.  Gold drops are super common, but teeny tiny, and upgrades are expensive.  So you'll spend a lot of time hunting down and busting every crate for every penny so you can buy an upgrade.  Also, planks.-Low randomization.  Other than enemy drops and the locations of some secrets in the second campaign, everything is pre-set.  This game could really benefit from a mode with randomly generated dungeons but, sadly, they don't exist.-Compared to the music, the sound effects are pretty weak.  It's a little jarring.-Multiplayer is very trollable.  Everyone shares lives and, with a certain setting, HP.  So there's little stopping someone in public from connecting to the game and skewering themselves on instant-death traps over and over until you're out of lives.-The endings are really, really lame and feel unrewarding.  I know the game isn't big on plot but, still...  I wanna feel a bit more accomplished for an 8 hour run than a ""Game ends in 15 seconds, you win!"" deal.So yeah...  It's a fun game, worth some time, but it's hard to recommend unless you really like this genre.  I got enough fun out of it to give it a thumbs up over down, but, again, I'd rather give it a sideways.  My experience with the game was enjoyable but... I could also live without it and I'm not sure I'd invest in a sequel unless they really addressed all of the game's shortcomings."

Each character has a range of coloured choices should you want to personalise your hero or if there is a clash with a friend.ART & GRAPHICS:The art style is delighful to the eye, not too bright nor too dark and the lighting effects are surprisingly satisfying to give each environment an immersive ambience and in-keeping with the moody undertones to each dungeon's respective theme.GAMEPLAY:Gameplay is enjoyable with the standard attacks for each character as well as two abilities that drain Mana, adding depth to each class and making them useful for different situations that then require you to strategise in co-operative situations or choose battles wisely solo.CONCLUSION:After playing this game alongside three friends in one continuous grind I can vouch for the hugely addictive nature of the game and the satisfaction after finally reaching and beating each boss (♥♥♥♥ the Worm Queen). I can safely say the only flaw to this game is the inclination to strangle that one friend who keeps losing all of your lives to death, 8 hours in."

Basically increase the Amplitude between hard fight and item discovery, some far fetched ideas:- Lesser encounters with more meanungful combat- Lesser boxes with more gold- A tad more dungeon hand-holding by implying what is a main and what is a side path- Slower player-character-attackspeed but more impact- More incentives for exploration- Encounters that are different, e.g. a small caravan that has some dialogue or minigames, A crazy mage that fights you if taunted and drops smth.- Randomization, this is the age of replayability"

It's worse than some of the flash games I've played of the same type.Firstly, multiplayer is a travesty. They could have used Steamplay and made it super simple but no, you need to port forward to get hosting to work properly. It's not that hard but, an extra step that never needed to happen.Also, you share lives. My bud & I went through, he died a bit due to being the melee tank Paladin while I was the ranger and when I eventually died, the game was basically over because we had no lives left.Secondly, the level design is utter rubbish. I'm adjusted to play Rogue-likes however having to walk very, very slowly back to where you were after dying is just poor design. They do give you checkpoints but they are so far spaced/poorly placed you may as well not bother.Third, while I did not get too deeply into the game, you start each class with next to nothing. A basic attack with a horrid default layout (Up to attack, really?) and 1 spell (Bound to Left, on the arrow keys, okay dev, okay.) It wasn't until far later that we found a shop to buy something new, which wasn't even something really good mind you. It was a combo skill type of deal, requiring you to kill 10 enemies in a very, very short time frame (Which in multiplayer, good luck as the counter only increases with YOUR killing blows) and you'll receive a minor movement speed buff. Wow, neat-o.Fourth, the random death drops. Now, I'm okay with crates and barrels occasionally being booby trapped. In Diablo & Path of Exile, it's a minor inconvenience at best, especially when you start getting a lot of health/resistances. In this game, however, your character is made of wet paper and when you break a crate open to a black bomb (Which, mind you, blends into the environment seamlessly) and it blows up .3 seconds later, taking over half your health on the squishier classes, it's annoying as hell.This got lengthy real quick and I doubt anybody will actually read this but, hey, there you go. I do NOT recommend buying this game. I'm not whining about the difficulty, I love hard games with learning curves, etc but this game has none as you'll just get bored after your first game over.I just now decided to try the game again/collect the trading cards (Which is why I now have 2 hours of this *shudders*) to at least get some minor return on the cost of this steaming pile, it's still utter crap."

On one hand, it's an interesting dungeon crawler with big maps.On the other hand is literally everything else.The class system is really unbalanced. Thief, for instance, is basically unplayable for the first two thirds of the game before being on par with the Paladin, and even then it takes lots of skill to out-DPS him. All in all, the classes feel extremely unbalanced in comparison, especially in multiplayer games. As my friend - who played a Paladin - said: ""So basically I am useless while you carry the game""The level design is mediocre. While I enjoyed the idea of going back and forth through the level, the key-system they use always make me feel as if I am missing something, as if I'm not going the optimal way. To do that, I need to play with a walkthrough next to me - which is an experience I really don't look for.Further, the game often teases you by showing secrets in impossible-to-reach places and wants you to find a switch /anywhere/ in the act to make it accessible. Personally, when I hit a switch and it just says ""Something happened"" I feel really disappointed and frustrated.Finally, the secrets. The game has several secrets hidden throughout the ""scenarios"", in the form of planks. What are these planks used for? Well, the game doesn't tell you.You'll see in the very last boss fight. Afterwards, you will need to use the planks to escape. If you missed only one, then you basically get the bad end. And I'll be honest, basically telling me ""you ♥♥♥♥ed up"" for not consulting a walkthrough while playing is a middle finger to the face.All in all, the game's negative sides outweigh its positives - at least for me. If you really want it, pick it up at a sale or refund it after an hour."

Mind, I haven't played it a lot at the time of writing, so take it with a grain of salt.The levels are designed, not randomly generated, which might hurt when it comes to replay value. The levels are very large, but are mostly empty. Most of the time you are smashing near-endless amounts of containers that primarily contain coins. The rest of the time is spent on effectively killing hordes of enemies in bullet-hell type of situations. There's a littlebit of puzzles and secrets sprinkled around, but not a whole lot it would seem. Checkpoints allow you to try again if you die, but you have limited lives. Reaching a new floor saves your progress.You can select from a few different classes that behave quite differently. You can bring some friends with you in co-op mode if you wish. Sound-wise, there's not much to go on, but the art style is cool. Shops spread out in the dungeon allow you to purchase upgrades.What I find to be the issue with this game is than it's simply not a lot of fun. With an addition of randomly generated, faster-paced levels and more interesting things to do, the game would look a lot more interesting. I think it has potential, but the experience, as it is, doesn't allow me to recommend this game. If you still think you'll like it, or just want to show your support to the developers, consider getting it during a sale. The regular asking price is rather high."

The game appeals to the more nostalgic gaming crowd(such as myself) and gives them a game that looks and feels like one coming straight out of the 80's but has much more effects within the game and generally looks better than most of the 16-bit games prior what with all the technology today. The gameplay itself can be a bit of a challenge by yourself if not using any sort of handicaps but can certainly feel rewarding when accomplishing a dungeon or even just a floor of a dungeon, but the real fun lies when playing with friends. You can play up to four people on a single server that can be created very easily compared to most of the other pc games that i have played since no portforwarding is involved or anything of that nature; with that being said there are no dedicated servers either which is completely fine for a game like this. The four playable calsses each have some advantages and weaknesses which of course balance the game and variation of them will keep the dungeon crawling interesting. There is no voice chat support so your fingers will be more dedicated than ever to the keyboard if you are accustomed to using a microphone, but then again there are 3rd party software like skype and even the steam voice chat system to use. I only wish that there would be a system of picking and choosing which dungeon you would like to explore because i find myself wanting to start where i left off in multiplayer but must start from the beginning(this only applies to multiplayer). Although I really do enjoy the game I feel like the price is a bit high and suggest that when the game drops to a lower one(summer sales*) that should be the moment you buy it because the game, all-in-all, is pretty fun in all of its facilety."

I highly recommend it and think it's absolutely fun and amazing. It offers 4 player multiplayer co-op and the fun can last for hours on end. I recommend having a controller though as tapping the same button over and over for an attack and get repetitive and fast. The only other thing that this game doesn't have is online multiplayer saves. Say you reach a save point in a multiplayer session and it takes 5 hours to reach a certain point. If you save and then turn it off and then turn it back on try to get back to where you were, it won't let you and you'll have to restart from the beginning which is a super downer :(. However despite that, it's super fun and there is no other game like this on steam! It's fun, unique, and it has 6 different classes you can play as now!!! (it used to be 4 but with updates it's 6).

,Recommended,239070,8536738,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,eldee,"There's a bit of a learning curve to this game, but if you are able to stick with it you'll find a real gem here.First of all, as many others have pointed out it is very similar to the core concept behind Gauntlet. At it's core, it follows the same 'find all of the keys to get to the exit' formula, but this gameplay is augmented by player progression, special abilities, backtracking, and boss fights. It's colorful, lots of great effects, and has a generally high production value.I'd also like to express a few issues I have with the game, but at the same time point out that these should not necessarily deter you from buying/playing the game, just give you a better idea of what to expect.First, there's no steamcloud support. To me this is a basic feature if you're going to put a game on steam.. it'd be forgivable if it were a roguelike with no persistence, but this is a long-play game. Anytime a game doesn't support steamcloud I have to copy the save to my dropbox before I go to work.The decision to make the paladin the 'default' character for players who just start the game without changing options is questionable. The paladin takes a fair bit of skill and nuance to play effectively- not to mention that just about any other game that has a paladin gives that class some sort of healing ability. This paladin has a charge/dash. It's a great skill, but just not what people are going to expect when diving into the game for the first time. Your average player is going to start the game, get swarmed and die repeatedly. Personally I think the wizard probably would have made a better default character.There is virtually NO onboarding in this game whatsoever. The closest you get to a 'tutorial' are these little 'hint boxes' that you have to attack, but if you happen to take a warp or staircase past the first floor (not as hard as it sounds) you'll never see them. An actual onboarding level or optional tutorial would go a long way to making the game more digestible for the average gamer. After my first 30 minutes of playing this game I nearly wrote an angry email to the friend who recommended I buy it, but I persevered and found the diamond in the rough.The soundtrack is nice, but personally it doesn't gel with the art style. I feel like a retro chiptune style soundtrack would have fit better, but that's just my opinion. What's in the game is good, it's not distracting, so in the end it is what it is. I just feel like it's an area where they could have given the game a bit more personality.A lot of the encounters aren't really balanced for single player. It's clear to me that they are pushing for coop multiplayer for this game, but a bit more thought could have been given to making sure the singleplayer experience didn't suffer. It's not bad, mind you- I have a singleplayer game going right now and as an example- I was able to full-clear the first 3 floors without dying once, but during the first boss battle I died 9 times. It's not so much that the fight is hard, it's just that they spawn you right in the middle of an area where you're going to take damage immediately (and a low armor class is going to die quickly). So that's just an example, but you'll see little hints of it throughout the game. Not a huge deal, still very enjoyable as a single player game.So, TLDR version: It's fun, great, awesome. Hard, steep learning curve. Stick with it and you'll love it."

While not as deep as other similar dungeon crawlers, the constant barrage of foes to keep running through keeps your attention.  The soundtrack, while quite small, is unexpectedly epic for a game that looks like it came from the 16-bit era.  This is definitely a co-op title, as some of the levels require a variety of classes to make the experience infinitely less frustrating.  One note I will make are the bosses, who can come off as insanely cheap due to the hectic action.  There are plenty of secrets abound, and it lasts quite a while. I can reccommend this at sale price and with friends."

This leaves for no checkpoints where you can continue playing the next day and so forth, given how expansive the campaigns are. Playing for hours in one sitting becomes torture. Dying becomes frustrating but at the same time you want the whole thing to just end already.Don't get me wrong, I like a good roguelike game but I feel like Hammerwatch could have been better without meddling into the growing genre."

It does takes a bit of getting used to - unless you're familiar with and/or comfortable with this type of controls - but you should quickly get a hang of it.From what I've gathered this is a game about navigating a labyrinthine dungeon of numerous levels, finding secrets and solving simple puzzles, gathering money-loot and buying skill/ability upgrades, last but not least, it's all about killing hordes of beasts and other foul beings.A keyboard-based (or controller, I think, haven't tested) hack&slash for singleplayer or co-op.If you like the abovementioned concepts and don't mind getting lost now and again, then I'd recommend you Hammerwatch.(If my opinion should change I'll come back and edit this - unless I forget to)"

But nevertheless, it was just enough fun to let me recommend it... but the limit was nearly crossed.First, the solo game, ""medium"" difficulty. Dungeons are really huge, so huge that sometimes I felt bored. The secrets are sometimes really well hidden, namely hints are not strong enough. After a dungeon ""cleanup"" (namely 100% money harvested and minions killed), I wander into the whole ""floor"" for forgotten secrets... and they are so vast, I was nearly disgusted. On the same level, there is so many monsters and so much money to harvest... for toooo long. The bosses and middle-bosses are really hard (kind of out of phase with the overall difficulty), and not loosing quite many lives is damn hard (or you need to do it many times and find ""the trick"" to avoid loosing even a single life).Online multiplayer: the game does not manage IPv4 UPNP for port redirection (at the time of writing), then if you are behind a IPv4 NAT, your will have to perform port (9995) redirection manually on your router in order to be able to host a game. For the few games I was able to join and not be kicked out... no point. Games were messy and short. The ""tower defense"" map is really a loss of time. I think the right way to do it is to find people on the community forum and organize multiplayer games with them.Maybe that game ""grows"" on you when you try to perfect it, for hardcore gaming. I may give some other tries in the future, who knows. The game worked with the linux radeon open source driver and has a 64bits native build.As usual, achievements were not unlocked for me.

76561198042798086,Recommended,239070,10696829,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Mina (computer is being crap),"this is definitely a nice little nostalgia-invoking game. if you're a fan of the gauntlet series (especially the old ones), or if you like simpler-designed hack-n-slashers, this game is possibly a good idea to get. here's a quick review of this interesting title:GRAPHICS: although very 'dated', this is part of what makes the game what it is. it's meant to feel like the console dungeon crawlers of old... and it does.STORYLINE: nonexistant, mostly. it's a gameplay-focused game, you aren't supposed to sit there and think about anything other than making it through the game. this isn't meant to be some epic novelesque game or anything...GAMEPLAY: the controls could probably be a bit better in some ways but they give you some really nice control perks that many games don't. you can keep yourself in one place while rotating to face enemies, or you can strafe around and continually face one direction as you do so that you can fire your projectiles or swing your melee weapon at whatever's in the direction you're facing as you either get closer or go in another directions. you get like 4 actual active skills per charactre if iremember right, one of which is your basic (everyone has a different basic attack). there are no items, no inventory, no levels. instead you will be looting the castle as you go, using gold to buy upgrades to stats, and to abilities. it's simple, it's easy to pick up, and it's full of tons of what this type of game was made for: killing enemies en-masse.REPLAYABILITY: well the game may seem rather unremarkable at first... but factor in a level editor, and up to 4 people online or local co-op along with all being able to play on the same system and you have a console/pc hybrid that allows for a lot of interesting replayability. there are also 5-6 classes currently (there were 5 when i got it but that could vary depending on when you read this review... there was originally 4.), each one being very different from the others and adding even more to the replayability. sadly the newest class, thief, has a huge setback and i'm sure most people besides hardcore roguelike fanatics will hate him: the thief. all of his skills not only cost Mana but also cost gold, which is the equivilant of experience in this game... this makes the thief take a million times longer to level, as unless you go through the game spamming regular attacks only, you won't be doing a lot of upgrading/levelling, and you'll remain weak for a longer period of time. this is really my biggest gripe so far besides one or two other things.CONS:-although almost all the character sprites are fairly androgynous (but leaning towards masculine), they all seem to be male as the sound effects determine. this is kind of a setback for me, as i prefer my hack and slashers to at least allow me a choice in gender or to have some characters be girls and others guys. nothing that ruins the game but would have been nice...-although in 'custom' mode, you can change your clothing color to some extent, a lot of it is miniscule on some characters, and you cannot do it in a normal campaign... why not? o.0;-the controls can be a little clunky at times but not really all that bad. you'll still enjoy it if you're an old school dungeon crawler veteran, i'm pretty sure.-the editor isn't the easiest tool in the world to learn, and you may have to find a 'cheat sheet' for what each item is in it, as their titles don't exactly describe what they are very well, and some things don't match up well with each other. i'm still learning the editor, and will give a better review of that when i get it down.-that's about all i can think of for now, will update this review later."

Add some challenging bosses that can be beat by fighting intellgently and learning their patterns with a little bit of finesse to dodge, challenging at times, but not difficult enough as to be completely frustrating.

Legend of Zelda for NES actually had better graphics and stronger art direction 27 YEARS ago.Hammerwatch plays exactly like it looks. Like a cheap LoZ clone with 100% less depth and entertainment value. I actually beat the first boss(3,500 pointless monster kills and two hours into the game) without ever seeing it. The ranger class could hit the boss before it was even on the screen. 10 min later of pointlessly mashing my attack button, the boss died without ceremony. The health of the boss was absurdly high compared to my character's power level. I think the developer might have been one of those people who thought monster health stacking was a great mechanic to increase difficulty.This game was probably the biggest waste of eight dollars I've had in a long time.

While this game is both singleplayer and multiplayer, I found it more fun to play it coop then singleplayer.. I have played and seen all the classes. Each ofcourse has his own advantage. The paladin can block arrows, can heal later in the game and hits quite fast, but is bad against stronger or many mage class enemies. The ranger has enough range to kill most spawnpoints without getting near, but has avarage health and mana. The mage has an AOE fireball, but has little health. And finally the warlock has a poison dagger and an AOE shockball (for mana). The downsides of this class is the limited arc of the dagger (compensated by the shockball).The castle is the same every time you go through it, so if you want to have a different map each playthrough you're out of luck. This said, the maps are big. You need a lot of time to clear them and then some more time to find the secrets in this game. These are well hidden and you need a good eye. Also, while there is only one campaing at this time, the game has a leveleditor to make your own maps. Futhermore, the enemies are more of the same all the time. You have ranged, melee and caster enemies, each with certain abilities (faster, poison etc.). One might find this repetitive, but then again this is a hack and slash game; they are always repetative. The coop game I played lasted about 7 hours for me.In general I would give this game an 8 out of 10."

First of all, i think that the allows for a wide and varying way to play the game. While you always play the same levels each playthrough, you get a completely different experience with strategy and pacing depending on both difficulty and character class that you choose. Becuase of this, playing the same levels is not much of a problem. Single player is a very enjoyable experience, with the game being balanced for any character to compete the game on their own, at least with enough skill. Multiplayer is also a lot of fun, changing the gameplay by a lot, increasing the ways you can enjoy the game even more. With the hours I've spent playing the game, i do think it is worth buying."

There are only a handful of characters when we played but they all have interesting powers that really ramp up as you level.  The levels are long and really challenging, so you'll want to play with as many friends as possible.  Sadly death comes easy, and you'll have to start at the beginning if everyone falls without making a save along the way.  What's interesting is that you can choose handicaps to make the game less challenging.  But then it feels like you're giving in to the difficulty. so you'll try to use as few as possible.The level selection is rather limited as well, and you can't choose an individual level within a campaign, which we found very debilitating.  Hammerwatch does have a level editor and community content, though we've never found the urge to try them with the amount of professionally done content the game had to offer.

Up to four people can play together as very different classes (at the time of writing, Priest and Thief were just added--I wouldn't be surprised if more came along) to fight throngs of enemies through many different levels. The first campaign has some flaws (e.g. can become repetitive, searching the map for where to go next becomes a chore) but overall is fun because of your friends. However, the second campaign--while much shorter than the first--is a legitimate entry into the RPG genre. A hub town, upgradeable skills, backtracking, detail, and most importantly, hordes of monsters forcing you to work together and evade certain death.

Although, the 8-direction movement can make combat difficult and choppy, but it is not very hard to work with. Another bothersome aspect is the saving feature. you find places where you can save, and it is also your new spawnpoint, and if your game ends in a game over you may return to your game through the ''load'' section, which is confusing. This section only displays the date you played the game on, so if you play more than one game, it becomes confusing. Also, games played through the ''load'' section can not be played with other people, whether or not the game began as multiplayer. The multiplayer function is easy, flowing and fun. The different hero choices are between 4 characters, each with there own attacks.Overall, the game is fun, and has potential for more maps and possibly characters. One major annoyance to me is that there isn't any type of gear whatsoever, which seems like a standard for rpg games.This game is cute, fun, but seems to need improvement.

This game takes that concept and executes it in some sweet♥♥♥♥♥ways. Skillful dodging and timing your attacks is much more prominent. You choose what to level up OR NOT if you want to conserve your money and have more later for more options. Use positioning and abilities to get the best out of the health you have remaining.I've been fortunate enough to experience this quite a bit with some friends. This is not an easy game. You can't just mosey on into a room willy-nilly. You will get smacked down by a horde of beetles or magic weilding mages. Bait a few enemies out at a time OR if you think you can dodge,GO IN SWINGIN'!You have the option to choose from some very different classes. One of the problems with games like this is the melee classes all feel the same. Maybe all of the classes feel generic as if it doesn't really matter what class you chose. It's all about mashing buttons. That's not the case with Hammerwatch. You will play each class differently I guarantee it. Not only because it makes them more efficient, but because youwilldie if you don't.Just be careful. I've given myself quite a few blisters playing this damn-good game too much at one time.

I beta tested this game back before its official release, and loved it. I'd been waiting for it to release, and then saw it for sale when the summer sale came. I was hooked from the first secret door I found. This game Is so satisfying when you explore and find secrets. The other nice part about Hammerwatch is that it is actually challenging. I tend to play on medium, and (perhaps due to my skill level) I occasionally struggle with a new area. EVERY time I encounter a new enemy, it is an adventure to discover its capabilities and weaknesses, from the basic cannonfodder mobs, to the minibosses. When a game this cheap is this captivating and fun at the same time, I just HAVE to write it a good review. I hope that you guys buy and enjoy this game as much as I do, as well as send the devs some love."

It's very nostalgic of Gauntlet (one of my favorite games of all time) and even has bonus levels that are made to look exactly like Guantlet. One thing that may turn some people off is it's insane difficulty. They nerfed it in the recent patch but Hammer watch is still a very hard game. The Game is split up into 4 acts, each with 3 floors. On each floor theres a red switch, when you've pressed all three then the door to the boss of that act opens. Each level is filled with secret doors and puzzles that you can find to get extra gold. Theres also alot of game referances in the secrets you find. the gameplay is from a top down view, you kill monsters and collect loot while finding shops to buy upgrades. I would advise playing with a controller but i played with a keyboard aswell and it worked fine.The only thing that is truly annoying is that there's no save while playing multiplayer and it takes about 6 hours to beat the whole game.

I've finished the main campaign and the new Temple of the Sun campaign on regular difficulty and have 55 hours total. Plus a bunch of tries to get Survival mode down. The different characters really all do play quite different, have beat it with the ranger and the priest.The few downsides is that the game tries to beat you mostly with numbers of enemies rather than very intelligent ones, but still remains quite challenging especially on hard (and survival mode is BRUTAL). The other thing is that there is no actual reward for killing enemies, they are mostly just obstacles for you to explore for loot and secrets.That said, I loved this game in single player and it's even miles more fun as multiplayer.

If it's not on sale, buy it if you like the original Gauntlet or  any twin-stick shooter (for the record, it is NOT twin stick, but it's very similar).I will say this: have a good graphics card. The system requirements say Open GL 1.4 minimum, but I could NOT get it to work on my laptop which meets the recommended requirements except for the Open GL 2.0. I would say minimum requirement is 2.0. Further, the graphics are really good if you do have the graphics card to support it.Last note for this game and honestly for Steam and PC gaming in general if you like retro games... buy a game pad.

Occassionally you'll see old things mixed together in new ways - an enemy spawner next to a difficult stationary enemy, for example - but then that combination will get re-used dozens of times before you run into anything new, and that new thing may very well be a slightly faster version of an old enemy with different graphics. Tough enemies can take a minute to kill even if you're taking no damage and they pose no threat to you, making them more chore than threat, which only adds to the sense of tedium.The difficulty is also extremely inconsistent.  Some enemies plink away with 1 damage and easily avoided attacks, while more difficult to avoid attacks often take half your life bar or more.  The game's first boss was vastly more difficult than the second.I would have been happy to play this same game with levels a tenth as long and a constant stream of new situations, instead of its current form, which feels like mostly padding."
,Not Recommended,239070,8613429,"Posted: 7 January, 2014",all,MrKlorox,"It just doesn't feel fun to play with the control scheme it has.This game does not let you aim independently from your movement like a normal dual stick or WASD+mouse or WASD+arrows shooter. There are strafe and stand modifier buttons that allow you to lock the direction of either movement or aiming while held down, and that is the only way to do one without doing the other.Furthermore, controllers are more capable than the keyboard setup because the game allows you to disable 8-way aiming on the thumbstick; and since there is no mouse aiming, this is impossible on a keyboard because you are only allowed 8 directions over 4 keys. Same goes for movement, though every game is like that.I'm sure people are thinking, ""Dude, you're just not good enough."" Well, I seem to be surviving just fine, so that's not it. ""It was intentionally designed like that as a throwback to games like Gauntlet."" The games it's throwing back to were from a period where design philosophy wasn't as refined as it is now. It's especially hard to understand such design choices since these problems have been solved for quite some time.I'm going to continue trying to beat the campaign with my friend just so we can feel like we got our money's worth.

Even though I had very much completed the game with about 700 hours of game time in, I still wasn’t satisfied. I’d played Dark Souls 2 for a while, but it just wasn’t the same as the first game. I know I picked up Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and while I’m still playing the game, it doesn’t quite fit the niche of what I was hoping for. I wanted a game which was as unforgiving and just as rewarding as Dark Souls with the same kind of co-op that would make me appreciate the power of friendship. Since there aren’t too many games that copy that feel, I find myself diverging into the Roguelike genre. Just so it happens, the game Hammerwatch seemed to sell me right away.Now, I don’t usually delve into Roguelikes as they’re known for being intentionally and notoriously unfair and difficult. They’re something I often play to challenge myself but they’re not something I would ever see as a party game. When I bought the game on sale for 8 dollars(including three other copies), I’d initially hoped to find three other friends to traverse the dungeons of the evil castle to fight with. Unfortunately, first impressions really let me down and I had to give away a few of my copies out of pure disappointment. Then, I had one person come up to me and offered to do some co-op to which I gave the one more chance to tickle me…and I’ll be damned if that’s not what happened.Hammerwatch is a Dungeon Crawler Roguelike in which you are a member of 6 dungeoneers who have made their way into the titular castle. Though some adventuring is implied to have occurred, you have been cut off by the rest of your party and you are forced to find your own way out of the castle to meet up with the rest of the party. Your chances appear to be slim, however, as they deduce you are unlikely to get out alive. With what weapons and skills you have, though, you hack and slash your way through hordes of various creatures.My initial run through the game was me starting as a Thief on standard difficulty and my first time going through the game could be described as very much challenging going alone. Enemies often come in mobs large enough that you can find yourself easily surrounded and have the psychic kind of AI where they can detect you from a fair distance, even if you were behind a wall. The experience ended abruptly when I discovered that you have that archaic lives system and dying results in permadeath. Upon this discovery, I learned of quite a few other features through research that deterred my desire to play anymore. It wasn’t until my co-op experience that I entered the game a little too harshly.When you start the game, you have a choice between six characters(two of which were added in later patching), two campaigns, a difficulty setting, and a series of modifiers that make the game customizable to the player’s comforts, making the game experience as hardcore or casual as you’d like. Gameplay is simplified with one button for attacking and three skills to use. Unlike most RPGs, you do not level up by killing mobs. You actually go to merchants scattered throughout the campaign who you use gold to buy upgrades for your character. In most multiplayer experiences, collecting gold and treasure gets antagonistic. Fortunately, however, any gold you do pick up is gathered as a whole by the party and, better yet, you spend it as though it were separate.If I had any complaints about the game, however, it’s that the save feature can be unforgiving when playing with random players. If they’re especially uncoordinated and uncooperative like two players I’d played with, they basically wandered off and soloed areas, getting killed off and wasting respawns. It wasn’t until I didn’t respawn when I discovered that the other party members had burned out all our lives and had been spending the time upgrading themselves and saving the game before they quit. If you’re playing with friends, this proves detrimental since saving doesn’t reset your respawns or health. If you get game over and reload your save, you start off with the amount of health, mana, stats, players registered, and number of respawns you had from the last save, regardless of who saved the game last. If you’re going to be playing with friends, I’d recommend making the game private.Also, while four players are needed to make a balanced party, the ranger and priest are especially unbalanced in that the former is overpowered for going solo and the priest is so completely worthless by himself—this is because the priest can’t heal himself when he starts out. The game was clearly made more for multiplayer in mind rather than single player which may make going through the game on your own a varying experience.Overall, a lot of flaws and issues aside, the game, while repetitive at best, is definitely worth playing with friends, but I’d hardly recommend playing with random strangers or even the single player if you’re the sort who wants a balanced experience going it alone. It’s definitely got a niched audience who is going to enjoy it, especially those who like Roguelikes. It's just a shame not many of my friends share that taste. Personally, I’m actually planning on starting over the solo mode with features to make it as dark souls-like as possible…but then again, I’m just one of those self-loathing masochists who can’t get enjoyment out of a game anymore if it doesn’t somehow stop to♥♥♥♥♥♥on my face once in a while."

Maybe the game could use a bit more depth and be less repetitive/tedious at a time, but if you like the genre, you'll probably enjoy it. Grab a friend though, it improves the experience. I see a good potential in the moddability of this game. If you're highly critical of details or expect an RPG, you should probably avoid the game. At least i was happy finding that i can bind autoattacking on the same key as regular attacks.

There's also a healthy dose of secret areas, and shop-bought upgrades...""That's a pretty low score for such a gem"", you might say... and if I stopped playing after the first two hours, I'd be inclined to agree with you...However the game reveals it's hand too soon.

Plus if you start a new game with a different set of people you're destined to repeat even more. There's no randomisation of rooms or key locations, it's all 100% identical every time.

Kiting big groups of weak enemies and blowing them away with your attacks gets old quickly, and that's how almost every enemy encounter goes. Add to that the fact that you can only attack the direction you most recently moved (meaning you have to turn around for every attack) and combat becomes an excercise in tedium. This problem is compounded with minibosses which have a lot of health and do a lot of damage, meaning that the only way to fight them is with constant ""pokes"", moving toward them, attacking, and moving away. And you must do this very quickly and do it a lot. It just isn't fun.Level design looks awkward like in many roguelike games, but it is entirely pre-designed. There are some pretty horrendous ""puzzle"" systems, most of which consist of re-exploring empty areas looking for switches, breakable walls, and de-activated traps to find new routes. Think Metroid-vania but without movement itself being an enjoyable experience. In fact, movement is pretty bad all around. You walk slowly when unhindered and attacking cuts your speed even further.Also, there's a lives system. Why? Lives were introduced in arcade games to keep people from hogging the machines. There's no reason for this to be here in an individually owned singleplayer game. There's no reason to keep players from continuing and retrying in a pre-designed area, It's understandable in roguelike adventures where there's always something new each time you play, but here all it does is add a cheap attribute of difficulty."

The puzzles as well as hidden areas are fun to discover and loot. Monsters are quite interesting. They range from the obligatory dungeon rat, to bugs, to more formidable enemies that may have appeared in some other rogue-like RPGs.

The different characters means you have several ways even at that to do it and the checkpoints say that there is only a set amount of errors or not. Lives do play a factor so spend them wisely. It's like i'm playing gauntlet all over again. All though i'm not spending quarters standing at my feet with 3 other's at the cabinet is not the feeling there. The curvature on the screen feature at least gives me the benefit to have it somewhat like i'm there. It helps relive some suble memory of it being a arcade cabinet while having fun.

Alas, those few positive traits are all the game has to compensate for the uninspired monotony of the core gameplay.  Disappointingly dull for an action game, disappointingly simplistic for an RPG, and incredibly repetative.Since I'm tired and lazy like so many other steam users, I will now stop writing an actual review and just make a list of positives and negatives.+Very good pixel art.  Always nice to see games where pixel art graphics are a stylistic choice, and not just used because it seems easier than other visual styles.+The secrets make the game a lot more interesting on their own, and would increase replay value substantially if the core gameplay it was built on had any kind of nuance.-If there's a tutorial of any kind, it's not immediately apparent.  Thankfully the controls aren't particularly complex, although they are a little odd by default.-I don't think there's any story.  If there was, I wasn't made privy to it.  I don't need anything great, it doesn't even have to be a big part of the game, but really?  The only story I get at the start is an NPC across a broken bridge saying ""The bridge!""?  Not even a quick ""the castle is overrun please save us!""?-Thus far it seems the entirety of combat is handled with 2 buttons, one mana using ability and one main attack.  This might have been enough to make for an interesting game, but combat really ends up just being about mashing main attack button while trying to strafe, with the occasional special (usually just a higher damage attack of some sort) thrown in.-Repetative af-Slow movement makes for a dull action game"

However there is no auto-fire option for this key. This means the player is required to hammer attack as fast as they can, leading to this game being a prime candidate to cause repetitive strain injury.I can only assume that the developers are fairly young and as such haven't noticed these effects yet, however for me the pain made it unviable to play further once i'd hit the 15 minute mark of my first session.This makes the input design a critical bug in the game design and means that i can not recommend the game to *anyone*.

It just gets old too quickly. There is almost no variation in enemies - in fact, there are only two kinds: melee mobs that run up to you, and ranged mobs that sit there and shoot at you. All other differences between enemies are just superficial. The AI is just laughable. The only reason the game is hard is because it throws dozens or hundreds of enemies at you all at once, sometimes even including a spawner so that more keep coming. It's very tedious and it's just the same thing over and over.

The game has set dungeons and really slow ability progression, but it kills you by attrition (it's hard to get health back) and kicks you back to the start of the campaign when you die. It can't decide if it wants to be a campaign or a roguelike.There's modifiers you can put into play so that its easier to regain health, and you don't lose all progress when you die, but the damage was done, I can't round up friends to play this game anymore, they just aren't interested.The game doesn't make me want to play it like a campaign anyhow, it's not like I'm fed story or characterization or anything to keep me attached to a particular playthrough -- I really wish they had gone more for a roguelike, with procedurally generated maps and faster class skill progression, so that it's fun to try and fail and try again.Running around and shooting and dodging is fun, and the game is beautiful.

The game seems somewhat easy but in some ways can be challenging, making sure you do not run out of lives is necessary for continuing the game, otherwise you begin right back at the start. I've so far gotten to Act 3, the environmental change felt good and the acts seem to go for just enough time for me to get sick of them and then be gracefully met with a new stage. The game could benefit from better multiplayer features, Eg: Character creation, better game saves, randomized clothing item pickups. The game overall could benefit from more stages and more variety in enemies. Hammerwatch is something that can be fun by yourself and with friends; each give off a different and unique feel. Hammerwatch is artistic, slashing, fantasy fun; the game just hits the right mood with gameplay that is decently fluid.

And I think the expansion Sun Tower doesn't even need that if you know what you have to do.-The maps are always identical and only small differences in secret rooms differ from game to game. I don't know how hard it is, but a randomized dungeon system like in diablo could be better. ALthough the level design isn't that bad.-The Achievements Genocide and millionaire is a joke! Since you kill about 1-5 monsters a second it would need you at least 13hours just bashing through hordes of enemies... without any down time. If you play the game normaly 2-3 times you would get about 20%-30% done with both achievements so the developer thought it was a good idea to make you play the game 12 times? with just a handful of classes to choose from.I know I ramble just about achievements but for a game with this small amount of content it is frustrating to hit a block. Thankfully there are a couple of guides and you can set up a 10monster/second trap of so you just have to let it sit for 4hours or so... -.- Or recycle the bonus level 4 250 times without saving after finishing.(btw: Xmas-secret-Achievement is still doable with the 1.3 beta version, although tedious).-Playing it alone is only fun the first time and after that maybe a second time with a different class until you learn it's specials.-I don't know if it's just me, but this 250MB Game always heated up my laptop(intel i3 CPU + Geforce 820M GPU) tremendously. And it bothers me very much. I gues the dev didn't take the time to optimize the performance but I would like that he did. Expecially in retro-styled games like this one. Although I admit that it is not nearly as bad as that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The binding of Isaac...  It still crashed on me a couple of times. But thankfully my saves weren't corrupted(as some of my friends').PROS:-It is kinda funny to play in a group. Expecially if the other palyers aren't that experienced with gaming(since you could better play diablo or anything other). But here you could rush through the main game in an evening or so.-The music ties in great into the action and at least for me didn't become boring although you hear it a long amount of time.-The leveldesign is kinda good the first time you play it. But it's sad that it's the same in every play through.-The classes are all kinda different and mostly fun to use. Although I never really tried the priest/cleric.-The price is ok. But I recommend to grab it in a sale, since it preatty small. My playtime is just as high because I lost my saves after nearly finishing both campaigns and because I got both grinding achievements which took my setup about half of my playtime.So yeah, if you search for something 4 people could enjoy for a small amount of time together, grab it! It's better than I thought.TIP: Make some backup saves from bonus levels or before the boss-rooms, so you could check stuff you might miss."

Not technical issues, heck no. The game, despite what it claimed to be was uninspired. Yes, it was obviously a throwback to the classics from the start but my god, was it ever tedious. In singleplayer, you don't get to choose your class. ""Hey,"" I said, ""I'll go with the mage, so what if my health drops like a barrel over the falls. Worth it to hurl fireballs."" Then I was slapped upside the face with the knight, who has a sword and a charge attack, both of which do about as much damage as a gentle fart. Then I was stuck in a dungeon with some maggots. The gameplay then became repetitive, with both killing enemies and breaking barrels for coins becoming repetetive. Maybe this game gets better over time, but I prefer games that are just plainly good. Save your money for Rogue Legacy or something."

Which as primitive as it is, is decently fun. However, the game defaults to throwing massive amounts of the exact same primitive enemies at the player; over and over and over. Through highly recycled maps which involve large amounts of backtracking to explore, over and over.The game boils down to the player mashing the attack button and then backing away. And that is about the entire experience. The levelling and progression system is sloppy and unappealing, the map layout is uninteresting and the combat spoils itself by crowding the player so much so often with enemies that are not even remotely interesting to fight.The levels are not even randomized, and if players run out of lives their progress is completely reset.For the most part, everything is just done in a very grindy and unenjoyable way that is just not interesting at all to play, nor is it worth anything close to the price."

The problem here is that it's an updated version of the original Gauntlet with more RPG elements in it. And yes there is a secret level on Floor 2 that takes you right back to the first stage of Gauntlet as an homage to the original.Problem is, Gauntlet actually evolved itself as a game to include a character and progression saving system in Gauntlet Legends and that was an Arcade game, so what's this game's excuse?This goes right back to basics... like clear a 100 floor dungeon in a single sitting, if you lose all of your lives or actually manage to get a real life then you have to start over from stratch again... No thanks, I'll pass and find something more productive to do like watch paint dry.Another gripe of mine, that's been occuring all too frequently in indie games lately, is the old school I.P. connection system which is just unaccetable at this point in gaming...I mean really? I have to go open ports on my router because the developers decided to use an archaic connection design for their game... just♥♥♥♥♥♥off already with this nonsense.It's more trouble than it's worth as you'll probably be the last man standing and want to fall asleep after 40 minutes of this tripe.When you're expecting to connect to your friends after first booting up the game and discovering you have to go play with ports... it's a bit disheartening. Honestly if I didn't already have Hamachi installed I would have just closed it and watched a movie instead... or maybe played a game with a server system.I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this game and if you're planning on beating it, hope to God your power doesn't go out or the game doesn't crash while it's minimized because no one has the kind of time or patience to complete this mess.2 / 10Worthless waste of time."

While this allows for some interesting design and lots of puzzles and secrets, it diminishes its replayability. And replaying it you will a lot if you want to ""really"" beat this game, because for some unknown reason you will have limited lives. Meaning you have to learn the maps and learn the bosses to make it through and find every secret. Speaking of the bosses ...I thoroughly enjoyed the game despite its repetitive combat system (and since every class plays basically the same, it further kills the replay value) right until the first boss. I can get behind the idea of kiting big groups of enemies to survive and I can get behind the idea of learning attack patterns. But what I can't understand is the intention behind turning the game into a bullet hell all of a sudden.It looks a lot like they are designed for multiplayer, in fact the multiplayer is one of the driving factors behind this game. But the maps are far too long for some quick fun with friends and a playthrough will easily take several hours even if you know every nook and cranny. But again: how often can you stand playing the same maps over and over again.So the single player gets old fast and is impeded by adding artificial difficulty and the multiplayer by its low replay value and its length.Unless you have a few friends which can commit themselves to a full playthrough, I sadly can't recommend this game."

Coming to this after Torchlight II and Path of Exile was like going at least ten years back (and not in a good way.)I refunded the game and unless you're looking for something dumbed down to mobile game levels of player interraction and gameplay, you're better off completely avoiding it."

Save spots are scarse but going up and down stairs save as well so you can use that if you're short on time. Bosses are fun and the levels are large and take a fair amount of time to fully explore and find all of the boss locks/seals. Hidden areas for those that like treasure hunting and would like to know the true ending of Hammerwatch.Not too difficult and not too easy either. I've had a lot of fun and for one traps don't do negligible damage but WILL kill you if you're not careful.
,Recommended,239070,9845928,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Render,"I definitely didn't get into this the first time I played it, but I'm glad I came back to it. Yesterday (4/16/14 (lol American date format)) they pushed an update adding a new class to the game, the thief, and I thought I'd check it out since I never quite had. I'm more than glad that I did.1. The gameplay is challenging without being too impossible. I HATE some enemies, but it feels rewarding to learn the strategies to employ against them. Learning to properly counter helped plenty, and I plan on feeling out each of the classes to pick my favorite. Thief and paladin go strong.2. The campaign is the same every time. It's NOT procedurally generated, which people will either like or dislike; me, I like it; if I need to try a spot out in Easy before I blow it on a harder difficulty, that's an option. And the developers already compensated for the limitation campaignwise by including a level editor! It's kinda tough to learn at first, but there's youtube videos to assist, and even if you choose not to, there's plenty of awesome levels created on the Hammerwatch forums up for grabs. Steam Workshop would be nice though!3. Multiplayer felt weak for a while, it's 2014 and the end user shouldn't have to deal with port forwarding. The update to use Steam networking resolved this, now only if it had a stronger playerbase to play alongside. I've not experimented with multiplayer until today, and after playing but one game which I joined, I realized I didn't have a save file for the character. I guess this makes sense, but the concern from my end is that multiplayer seems limited to the host in continuity. What I mean is this: I jumped in, created a character for the game, and didn't get to retain it. Playing for only the host's benefit may discourage some users, myself included. If I were to play with the same people again, I would have hoped to retain the upgrades I'd purchased.Overall, I do have some qualms with the game, and the things I wished different would make the game a different game entirely. It's a fun game, and now, I'd definitely recommend it, though I wouldn't have when I bought it in 2013. Give it a chance - hell, give it a few chances, and see what you think."

First and foremost, Hammerwatch claims ""Controller support, supports various different gamepads"".  While this may be true on other platforms, on Mac I have tried 4 different gamepads, from Logitech to Microsoft... not a one works at all.  This is fairly important since another selling point is the ability to have multiple people play local on the same machine.  Without controller support this is simply unfeasable.It would be nice to imagine this is simply a bug that is soon to be fixed, but judging by Steam and Hammerwatch forum posts, this has been a problem since day one, which was 6 months ago.While it is certainly possible to play with a keyboard alone, Hammerwatch's gameplay style truly begs to be played with a controller."

No leveling up, no character saves (you start over from scratch each game), characters share lives, and extra lives are limited to about one per level.It has nice retro appeal. You can modify the graphics to look more dated, like adding gridlines and bending the corners of the screen to make it look like an old CRT monitor, but otherwise there's one song in the entire game that doesn't loop smoothly, so that gets annoying fast.A lot of these indie games have the 'tough-as-nails' approach to separate themselves from newer games, but in this game's case, it feels a little cliched. I'd wait until they update it more, but being $3.39 on sale, I think it was a decent investment."

This game has various mechanics, whether it be the puzzles or the combat, they all work together to make a great game. It is a great game to play with 2-3 friends, or solo. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun game to play with friends, especially if oyu want to have a game where you can relax and haave fun with some friends."

I have played alot of this game already and you can ajust the difficulty to your setting. If you are a hardcore gamer you can leave it to the default settings and they game only lets you die 7 times before you completely game over. If you are a little more casual or just starting off in the game like me you can set it to infinite deaths. I give this game a 9.5/10.

Then this is right up your alley!The crisp response of the simple interface and mechanics feels satisfying in one of those ""DIE BATS, DIE SLIME!, DIE SKELETON!, DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE"" kind of buttonmash-fest ways. Or in other words, it'll actually get you amped up to DEMOLISH those other pixely critters and get another skill upgrade.The music wasn't jaw-dropping or anything, but I don't suppose it was meant to be. This game is the meat and potatoes of action dungeon crawling at its most rudamentary levels, and that's not such a bad thing. The graphics are memorable in the same way many 8bit looking games are for people my age.For its often inescapably low price, I couldn't be more happy with this game...and then I've got 3 hitpoints left, got no healer buddy next to me, and there's no apples in sight...

Like most of my games I bought it some time back because it was on sale and after watching the trailer I decided that one day I'd like to play it. So in my infinite quest to get more badges I thought it was about time to see if this game was actually any good or if I'd drop it as soon as I got my three cards and left. Boy was I surprised by this one. I soon as I started playing it I could tell the diffrence, this was a game that had the classic spirit of the Rouge-like gerne to it with all the things that made it fun. First off, it was visually very appealing with it's classic 16-bit style of graphics which I felt only added to it's retro theme. Next, was it's simple yet intence combat system, ok I know what you're thinking and running up to a guy and hitting him in the face isn't very complex but when there are hundreds of enemies on screen and dodging them is just as important as getting a super long combo chain of destruction combat becomes just as thrilling as it is desperate. Lastly, the game is full of secrets. I don't know if I spent more time trying to find my way, killing all the monsters, and looting every thing that wasn't nailed down or combing the levels making sure I hadden't missed anything. Also this game is challenging. The first few playthroughs I did were just to figure out how to not die on the first level. All-in-all I like this game. I brought me back to a better time in my life where I played games not to get achivements nobody else had or get a badge saying I spent more time and money on it than others, but because it was not just a game good enough to waste a few hours on and leave once I got what I wanted; but insted actually play it all the way to the end, beat it, and still want to keep playing. Even if it was the same stuff I had just played. This is one of the rare few games I've encountered that not only did I have more fun that I ever thought I would have gotten out of it, but that I know I'll still get every time I come back to play it. 5 Stars all the way."

I'd compare it to a 2D Dark Souls in that you need to have tactics for groups of enemies, you need to kite and dodge like a boss, and the boss fights are wicked. You buy character upgrades with gold you find throughout the various levels and it's great when you solve a puzzle and end up unlocking a room full of loot.

Those guys have done a great job to create a solid retro game, and they've got that even better than those old games they tried to reproduce. The bigger problem with old games were their dificulty, and they've solved this in Hammerwatch.Put aside all the funny gameplay, challenging bosses, a quite original upgrading system, the well resolved HUD, simple controls and, the game is surprisingly well-balanced! It sometimes feel like Diablo (hit and run) but this fact doesn't make the game boring at all.The only fail, I believe, is the art. It could be way better and more diverse. It wouldn't bother me if there were enemies with the same behaviour with different skins: I just wanted to see more enemies."

Controls are very smooth and make sense, I've only played with a controller so far so not sure how kb+m is in the game. Best played with a group of people as it gets tough a few levels in if you're not playing on easy. (Though its sometimes hard to join a game online, I've had to join up to 10 games sometimes before you get a host that isnt autokicking you, when I host I let anyone join as long as they dont go wasting lives on purpose.) The game is a gauntlet/bullet hell mix with some rpg elements. You buy upgrades at random vendors rather than level up, and everyone in the party gets all the gold that anyone picks up. Benefit to this is you can join a game thats been going on for a half hour and your character gets whatever the total gold thats been picked up is. Only downside to the game is you dont have characters you create and level up, you either start from the beginning with nothing or join wherever the game is currently in progress."

They've nixed that game's 'food' life bar, thankfully, and added RPG elements to let you improve your damage, range, dmg mitigation, regen, etc. You ""save keys to open doors,"" though here there are 3 different color keys to open their respective doors. Collect treasure to purchase your upgrades from vendors. Loot is shared and one class is a healer, so cooperation is easier done here than in 8bit Gauntlet. There are also boss fights along the way.The art is nice, adding variety to levels and enemies while still evoking a sense of retro gaming. Additionally, you can change the parameters. Play with limited or infinite lives, for example, so you can scale the game to a difficulty level that suits you. Essentially, any thought you might have had along the lines of, ""You know, I liked Gauntlet as a kid... but I wish they had added XYZ,"" that XYZ is probably in Hammerwatch."

The levels are too large, the enemy swarms are too large, too common, and entirely cliched. Most dungeon crawlers make up for this by having the endless combat reward you with loot or skills until they've trained you to salivate every time you hear the mouse clicking of combat but the character advancement, which is done entirely through buying from vendors using coins you find laying around in barrels and crates, is too slow and too unrelated to the endless swarms of enemies you have to fight through for it to pass on any glamor to the fighting. Even when you do finally purchase a skill it's probably going to be weak and a pain to use, rather than any kind of awe-inspiring new ability you can't wait to try out. It's a samey, repetitive slog that fails to reward you in any way or give you any reason to keep going.There might be an entertaining game here in multiplayer given the possible interactions between different classes, but, in my experience, joining a public multiplayer game will usually get you instantly kicked and if you host a public multiplayer game you'll maybe get one or two people who play for about 5 minutes each before losing connection.It might be worthwhile to try out Hammerwatch if you know people who want to play as a group beforehand, assuming the tendency to lose connection isn't as big a problem as it seemed to be for me. If you don't have a pre-existing group, you're better off with just about any other dungeon crawler. Any of them is bound to have better mechanics for solo play and I would bet most of them will have communities large enough for you to find a group if you don't have one to begin with.The pixel art is very nice looking, I have to give it that."

It gets repetative becuase it does not have more than 2 missions worth of content.There are 2 campaigns, each having maybe 10-12 floors. You can run through a floor in about 5-10 minutes with 4 others, and if you run out of lives, die, which happens often, you start at floor 1 again.This would be fine except most of your time is spent on floors 1-5.

,Recommended,239070,13178545,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Kudendar,"I *highly* recommend this game for people that like oldschool RPG/Hack N Slash genre style games. You play from a top down perspective and kill as many enemies as it takes to get to the end of each level. It feels much like the old gauntlet games. You eat food/crystals to regen health or mana, gain money to upgrade your spells and abilites, and uncover in-game secrets for a chance at great rewards. You can play as a Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, Archer, or a Wizard. Levels are always the same layout each new game, but with plenty of classes and a lengthy compaign it does not disapoint as far as value goes. You can easily expect 15-25+ hours with both campaigns put together, so if you manage to find this on sale its a no-brainer as far as value is concerned. With Survival mode and plenty of workshop maps to play this game can provide even more hours. I have seen people hit around 30-80 hours before growing bored of this game.----However, it can get slightly repetitive after long play sessions and the graphics are not exactly cutting edge. Directional targeting can be tricky as well. Online play can be a little frustrating, as people will just kick you for slight mistakes or at their convenience. (Whether you deserved it or if they just wanted to have some fun for kicking you) I suggest you host your own game if thats the case, and just let people join you.I only prefer this game with a xbox controller or equivalent gamepad in mind. PC controls get the job done though if you dont have a choice, the PC controls didnt seem like they were a huge inconvience."

The beginning is calm, allowing you to learn the game without any obnoxious tutorials. Then the difficulty rachets up noticably. By the time I arrived at the first boss I was already forty five minutes past how long I had intended to play. The battle was tense, and chaotic, without seeming unfair (all mistakes were my mistakes, no ridiculous glitches). I beat the boss with two hit points left, swearing up a storm, and when I realized I was victorious I performed the first involuntary fist pump I've done while playing a video game since I don't know when.

Monsters don't regenerate, so backtracking is a boring trek. Health restores are sparesely laid out - they're adequate in number, but backtracking to the last health location is boring. There is no reward for playing aggressively, and playing cautiously is... boring. Also, there is little visual feedback on leveling up, and attack/alt-attack options are nil. Lastly, the controls are poorly mapped, and the game would be a lot better as a twin-stick shooter (like Hotline Miami) rather than the current strafe/lock mechanic.I had fun playing it, but Hammerwatch ended up being a fun diversion rather than something memorable, which it could easily have been with some tightening up of mechanics and level layout.Get it when it's on sale, but it's not the New Best Thing (or even Retro Best Thing), which it could have been."

The game felt like a chore.  It lacks a traditional leveling system, and instead, upgrades are bought at stores scattered about the dungeon.  The upgrades are quite expensive for small increases, and as a result, I never really felt my character was getting any more powerful.  I found the obstacles and enemies challenging, but without a leveling system or story elements, I couldn't bring myself to play any more.It seems like it would be a good multiplayer game, but the singleplayer is more like a chore than a game."

,Recommended,239070,13743036,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Flux,"When I first played Hammerwatch I found the non-regenerating health to be a big barrier to fun.  I started somewhat casually and eventually I ended up getting stuck and unable to continue due to the fixed checkpoints and limited resources.  Starting over and taking the game much more seriously was my only option.However, then I discovered the difficulty settings that allow you to customize all that.  Regenerating health, regenerating mana, extra lives, etc...  With just some regenerating health it was all of a sudden a great casual action RPG without requiring every battle to be won with minimal casualties.  I really enjoyed the tactical options the various classes and powers provide.  This is definitely not a brainless button masher where you charge in and lay waste to all around you.  That gets you killed.  Even with regenerating health.Three player local co-op was awesome, as it broadens the available roles and powers.My biggest complaint, other than the default difficulty level, is that we would occasionally get stuck and have no idea how to proceed.  You sometimes have to traverse through old empty levels looking for a button you missed, or a new secret passage that opened.  This was super boring.  A zoomable map that highlighted plot objectives (it need not reveal new secret areas that open up) would have solved that."
,Recommended,239070,13744202,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,vladde TF:GO,"Hammerwatchis a 2D, rouge-like, co-op, dungeon crawler game. The game can be played both 4player locally or via the internet. Controllers are also supported.The game currently offers two campaigns, one main story and one side quest, plus two extra game modes, called survival and defense. You choose to play as different classes, each with it's own set of skills. The current classes arePaladin,Wizard,Ranger,Warlock,ThiefandPriest.On keyboard, you walk with WASD and attack with the arrow keys, with the primary attack Up and your first special with Left (which consumes mana). You strafe with Space and ""hold"" with LShift. All controls are rebindable.The games controls are good once you get used to them. If you didn't notice from the logo, pictures and video, the game has pixel graphics, but has some special effects, such as nice faded light from torches. The options are fine, and my only problem with it is that you cannot change the resolution if you play in fullscreen, however it shouldn't be a problem for the majority of the players.In the main campaign you start off right after a bridge collapsed and your NPC friends on the other side tell you to continue without them. You start of by fighting some bats, and you can destroy some crates with a chance of getting extra gold which also lies spread out in the map. Gold is shared in an interesting way, where if one player picks up 2 gold, all players get 2 gold. However if one player buys an upgrade for 200 gold, only that player looses 200 gold and no one else. The gameplay is good, and with friends to back you up the game gets way more exciting, which also makes this game a great game to play if you have an extra keyboard/controller laying around. You start off with 2 lives, or re-spawns, per player, and if you die, you obviously loose one life. There is a shop where you can buy extra lives. You can also buy upgrades for your character, varying from health upgrades to higher damage and defense to health pots. At the end of each level you fight a boss.For the ones who want more of a challenge there are modifiers to disable mana regeneration, disable hp pickups, only 1 hp, etc. And for the less skilled there are modifiers to give you hp regen, infinite or double lives, ""5x mana regen"", and a few more.Final thoughs:My only problem with the gameplay is that the game gets repetitive. You fight the same enemies the entire first floor, and could be generalized as acommon weak enemy, aslightly less-common stronger enemy,a somewhat rare strong enemyandone mini-boss. This does not mean that the game itself is boring, only that I at the third level saw the same pattern for each level.However I have gotten many fun hours from this game, both when I play by my self and with friends. Everything above should explain enough why I really like this game.As an extra note, I bought this game early on, and the game was very fun back then, but oh my, how the game has improved with each update. The menu system, new characters, a new campaign, new secrets and some extra tweaks show how the developers have worked hard to make the game better since day one. They have my support!"

,Not Recommended,239070,9922990,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,Kreegath,"When deciding on whether or not to buy Hammerwatch, you need to be clear on what it is. Because for what it is and what it does, it does well. It's an achievement hunter game. You want to get it for cheap and then grind it out for some rare achievements and steam levels, maybe some steam trading cards. It does deliver there, as you can relatively easily obtain the (at the moment) 0,09% achievement.First, if you don't have a gamepad I would strongly recommend either getting one for Hammerwatch, or just not pick up the game. It's not a necessity, but the quality of your time is seriously lowered with a keyboard and mouse.Secondly, where the game starts to fall short is in the actual gameplay aspects. There is very little replayability as it's the same dungeon, same enemies in the same places every time. That in of itself isn't necessarily damning, but seeing as how you do the exact same strafing and shooting for every enemy all game long, you will get bored. It's the same even with the other classes, as you quickly find ""the way"" to abuse the non-existing AI, and after that you just do that ad nauseum for the next couple of hours. There are not enough skills or abilities to make you feel like you're accomplishing anything, and there's no diversity in enemies, puzzles or dungeon design to keep you interested.The music and sound effects are fairly good, but way too short, few and repetetive for prolonged gameplay. During my grind for kills and gold, I turned the music and effects off entirely in favour of my own playlist.The difficulty depends on which class you play, with the archer being the easiest and probably paladin the hardest simply due to being melee. Setting the game from medium to hard doesn't really matter, it's negligible. Playing the archer, I'd put the game at medium going on easy. There are a couple of hairy situations that you can find yourself in, and the Lich level can get frustratingly unfair at times, but doing dungeon runs you'll mostly be spamming your shoot key all the way between bosses, maybe racking up a couple of deaths due to losing patience or focus. You get tons of lives though, so there's no risk of ever actually running out entirely, and there's an all too easy way of cheating the death counter by just exiting and reloading if you're dying.Finally, when it comes to the achievement hunting itself, be aware that the game is unstable to the point of crashing and ruining entire attempts. You can tell when it starts to slow down and lag, eventually insta-closing with an error message window popping up. Doing the crystal lich achievement on hard I had too many enemies activated at the same time with the lich at about 50% hp and it killed a sure win, which really soured my opinion of it.You can definitively get all achievements in two dungeon runs and two lich runs, clocking out at perhaps 20 hours if you're doing all secrets and figuring stuff out as you go along. I went four dungeon runs and did a whole lot of lich fighting, as well as doing the soul crushing grind achievements, clocking out at 69 hours.I would not recommend Hammerwatch to your casual gamer, your hardcore powergamer looking for a bullet hell or insane roguelike. I would barely recommend it for completionists who want the rarest achievements. Barely. The 1 million gold and 250k kills achievements aren't hard to get, they just take hours upon hours of mind destroying grinding to reach. If the game is on sale, and if you can get a couple of friends to play it with, you could pick it up when it's on sale and you have a couple of hours to laugh away with crazy antics.That, however, is not good enough to warrant a recommendation from me."

Atleast, a blast to the hard, difficult and unforgiving past of that gaming era. This game is incredibly hard and pretty long and is a roguelike. Now, normally these qualities would be good for a rogue like game, right? Hard, long and is old-school! Well, no. This game suffers from a lack of randomized envornments along with some other issues.The game is linear and ALWAYS the same regardless of how many times you play it AND doesn't have any save feature other than ""quit and save"", even before or after defeating bosses and beating the levels, which believe me isn't easy at all. That means you'll be going through the same enemies, the same pick ups and the same secrets throughout the whole game which consists of 4 or 5 huge, monster and secret/treasure filled levels with 4 bosses over and over again until you manage to beat it all without dying. Sounds fun? No. It isn't. This'd pass if the game wasn't so extremly punishing rather than challenging, there's no post-hit invincibility implemented in the game and it's got bullet hell characteristics, which means that you can die from a single point blank attack if the enemy fires more than one projectile.Sure, it's got upgrades and classes, but it's all lost when you die - in oldschool NES fashion, you die - game over, literally everything starts all over again. What makes it even more hard is that you start off with 4 lives, which believe me you can lose REALLY easily and really fast and to get more lives you have to go through puzzles and other challenges, rarely does the game give you lives unless after a boss fight. Due to these major♥♥♥♥♥flaws I'm giving this game a complete lack of a recommendation unless you really want to experience what AVGN has to play through except on a computer."

,Recommended,239070,7945143,"Posted: 6 December, 2013",all,Achilleez,"Hammerwatch is a multiplayer, retro-pixel, D&D or Diabloesque fantasy ""role playing"" game. If you've never played this game or know anyone who has, but have played Diablo, the original, in multiplayer mode, then you know what I mean. When you boot up, you are confronted with a solo or multiplayer option screen. Solo, I cannot recommend, unless you are curious about game play and what capabilities your potential characters have. You can play: (a) Paladin, (b) Wizard, (c) Ranger, and (d) Sorcerer. Each one has an offensive and defensive capability. Game play, in multiplayer mode, is dependent upon teamwork (communications), simple rules (e.g. don't seperate beyond line of sight), and equal distribution of wealth, which is harder than it seams. Your decision will be, ""should I help the Team slay these monstrous charging flesh eating beatles and vampiric bats or dash over here, bash the chests and barrels to get the loot""? Why is this an issue? The more wealth you amass, the more skills you can purchase from the vendor and, hence, the more powerful you become. The Paladin is a shield wielding, sword swinging, monster bashing, healing hero. Each party needs a Paladin to make it to the big leagues (i.e. Boss killing). The Ranger is the Legolas of the group.  His shot sails across the screen to kill minions beyond line-of-sight. Sure, the shots weaken over distance, but who care? You eventually wear them down to death. The Wizard is like every wizard ever played in D&D: Glass-cannon. This book-wormy individual is so susceptible to insta-death, it is the character's middle name. Keep the Wizard behind the Paladin and unleash fireballs or inferno jets from his finger tips. Finally, there is the Sorcerer who serves as the poison dagger wielding area effect's master of lightning. Monsters grouping for massive attack, one lightning ball spell and there is nothing but ashes. The real challenge is movement mastery. Get a game controller. Keyboard playing is just too tough; if you can master the keyboard play, then you are much better than I am. My fingers cramped up during game play. The other challenge is loot balancing. Your group will be challenged to stay on and continue playing without dying. You all share the ankhs (life pool). If your glass canon dies multiple times (guilty) then you may find yourself in a situation where there are no lives left if the Paladin perishes. If that happens or if everyone dies except one person, then you are dependent on the one person buying lives (if they have enough money) or unlocking a cool puzzle, there are several, to earn an ankh. In that scenario, a team member is randomly resurrected. Joy. Yet, that leaves the rest just watching and waiting. Darn! For Mac players, go to your router and open port 9995. When you do, then you'll be able to host a game. To prevent or minimize booting from hosted games, try to build up your friends list and develop a time to game together. It's more satisfying that way. Bottom line: For the price and multiplayer enjoyment, I highly recommend this game."

If the answer is yes then you can stop reading here and just buy this game because this game is similar to gauntlet but better in every way.Hammerwatch is a dungeon crawling style game that has decent size maps and HORDES of monsters everywhere, there is no such thing as a one on one fight in this game, and when you see an enemy you can be assured donzes more are right near them, usually spawing infinitely from a lair that you must destroy if you want them to stop.The baisc objective of the game is to work your way through 12 floors of a castle(there is a boss every 3 floors), kill every thing you see, avoid traps and collect loot that can be used to buy a myriad of upgrades for your character, including more hp, mana, stronger weapons, various abilities and more.The level design is great in this game, each floor is huge and is riddled with secret passages, swtiches and all other manner of hidden objects.  Although you do not need to comb over every inch of the floors to complete the game, you will feel compelled to explore every area, find as many secrets as possible and kill every monster you see.  There are also hidden bonus levels which give a nod to a classic game, and are loaded with hundreds of monsters and tons of treasure chests, finding these levels can be tricky but the loot is worth it.There are several classes in this game, each with their own strenghts and ability sets, as well as the ability to play co-op.  I personally completed the game in single player and loved every minute of it, I can only imagine how much more fun it would be to play with a friendIf I had to describe this game in a word it would be addiciting, it is the kind of game that will make you want to explore one more hallway, find one more switch, and before you know it several hours have passed.  Thankfully, there are also checkpoints sprinkled throughout each level so you will never have trouble saving when you realize it is two in the morning and you need to get up for work in 3 hours.If the trailers for this game interest you in the slightest you should buy it, you will not be dissapointed."

,Recommended,239070,8489891,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,squibsforsquids,"The Good:Hammerwatch inherits a lot of the fun of Gauntlet in that classic hack 'n slash style -- from ravenous swarms of (wo)man-eating eyeballs to the shambling eldritch fury of unholy liches, there're plenty of enemies to wallop, ignite, poison, and bullseye. With up to four player local co-op available, with mappable control sets for both keyboard and controller inputs, the game's extremely friendly and social to the game-loving crew that remembers the heydays of couch co-op. (You can play online, too -- no worries.) The visuals are simple, retro-ish, and can even be edited to make your screen look more like a standard def 16-bit game (if you're into that sort of thing).For anyone concerned about how the game runs: it's smooth. You can turn down the settings significantly if your computer's not exactly top-of-the-line, and you'll likely do just fine. (My poor PC's been struggling for some time now to run too much of anything, but Hammerwatch doesn't hiccup on me once I cut back on some of the graphical bells and whistles.) The devs did a great job of giving the player a game that can be customized to fit a variety of play needs/experiences, and the ability to strip down the graphical demands to smooth out the game is one example of many.The editor is great. Sprites are PNGs, their basic coding's XML, and the level editor itself is a pretty easy-to-learn GUI. There's some scripting involved for more advanced functions, but anyone who's experimented with modding in the past'll find a pretty simple, quick-to-get-into editor for the game. (In particular, cosmetic changes to the game are a snap.)The Bad:This game is fun, but there's just not a ton of it. You get a campaign with the game itself that'll take you through a handful of dungeons and bosses. They're not procedurally generated, so once you've played the game, you've played the game -- return trips are going to be much of the same. (Of course, you get four classes to experiment with, and three possible difficulty settings.) There's a survival mode that can add some fun to the game, but the lack of content sadly holds Hammerwatch back from having its real potential realized.The community's doing what it can to add to the game -- like I said, the devs have put together a solid set of editing tools that can allow for plenty of ambitious modders to take the game the extra mile. However, that community's not a particularly big one. (I suppose this is a call to action, then: buy the game, and start making new campaigns for it! Something something about a rising tide lifting all boats...)Also, the single-player's a little boring. It's not really the game's ""thing"" -- it's a party-based game -- but you can wander the dungeons alone if you're into that sort of thing. You just might not have quite as much fun...TL;DR:Buy this game. Give it a playthrough with your friends. If you're really a mensch, build a campaign or make some cool sprites for the community. This game deserves more publicity and more people contributing to it content-wise. (And the devs deserve your coin.) It's got some draw-backs, but, in terms of fun-versus-price, you're going to get a good investment return out of it."

I got my copy for $2.50 and I think that is a really good deal.   I think ten bucks may be a bit steep, but if it goes on sale again, scoop this gem up.  I wouldn't pay more than five, but I'm a total cheapskate.The Temple of the Sun expansion is really difficult, even on the easiest difficulty.  You start with only one extra life and I have yet to find a second one.  This is made worse by  other players dropping in in multiplayer, immediately dying (extra lives are shared) and leaving you high and dry.Terrible review, I'm sure.

The objective is to make your way through a dungeon, killing copious amounts of bad guys, flipping switches, and finding secret passageways.Sometimes it can be a little drawn out, but there's nothing overly challenging about this game once you've gotten the hang of avoiding the bad things and playing your class safely. Oftentimes the cause of death is a lack of overcoming the urge to bite off more than you can chew when exploring areas and pulling mobs.The lives system is a little outdated, but you're provided with the occasional extra life here and there, and if the game is too hard then you can enable 'mods' that make the game easier or harder to your liking.The classes seem like they're well-balanced in their individual ways, although some don't play quite as well as others. It's all a matter of personal preference.The music is sufficiently ambient-y, and the sound effects convey an adequate amount of bang-bang-pew-pew.Check it out when it's on special. Don't expect anything mind blowing, but if you have a few friends you can play with then you might be pleasantly surprised.Oh and try not to be too disappointed when you beat the last boss for the first time..."

Great fun that I played for quite some time over the Thanksgiving Holiday in the US.With a remapper to use a controller (which doesn't work out of the box) worked quite well, and I highly enjoyed it. I never had the chance to play multiplayer (with lack of internet at that time), but the game was great (and I didn't get to ""the end"").It has really good core mechanics, a very simple upgrade system you use every few levels, and a good amount of just Gauntlet style fun.For the price and the content, it is a great time!

I followed this game from the Steam Greenlight forums and even tested the beta. From the beginning I knew that this was something I wanted to get my hands on once it came out.The game takes place inside of Castle Hammerwatch, where your goal will be to travel from down the prison up to the royal chambers in the top and kill the evil dragon. You play as either a Paladin, Wizard, Warlock or Knight and each character has its own weapon and special ability.Don’t be fooled, this is a serious game; and even on medium difficulty you will still have a hard time fighting through the numerous levels in each Act. The game is better played in multiplayer mode, but to be honest, good luck joining a game. For some reason I find it impossible to host a game, but I am able to join others, and this is when the game is best played.Hammerwatch also offers a few perks, what they call “crutches” in the game if you choose to host your own single or multiplayer game. Different options allow you to make the game easier or a little harder. I suggest playing with the HP Regen and Infinite Lives crutch on when first playing, that way you can get a feel for what you’re about to be in for.A game that is still in beta and continuously going through changes is sometimes hard to review, taking everything into consideration the game is awesome. Aside from the bunk multiplayer Hammerwatch is worth every penny. Constant battle action laced with power ups, secret passages and hidden doors makes Hammerwatch a soon to be classic and a necessity in any gamers library.Graphics: 7/10Playability: 8/10Story: 4/10Challenge: 8/10Replay Value: 6/10"

Old school OG Guantlet style play.  The graphics are neat and the music is pretty awesome.  I could see SP getting boring after clearing the first Act myself.  I think MP would be amazing but I haven't tried it yet.  Smashing barrels and crates and looting gold is really satisfying for some reason, and you use gold to upgrade your character, although it's pretty minimalistic and not complicated.  I think it might be better with a controller, but keyboard play is fairly easy so far.One complaint could be how large the levels are.  There's no way to move the map around that I could find.  It stays centered on your character, so it's easy to get lost and wander around trying to figure out what certain completed puzzles have unlocked in other areas, even spanning multiple floors.  One thing I can say is (at least in Act 1) if you finish out everything in an accessible area you'll be ok as you get to the next area in a level.  They seem to have designed it to be sort of linear and intuitive.  Still, a real map that you could browse through would be really nice.  Got it on sale for like $2.50 and it's well worth it."

When I picked up Hammerwatch I had only seen some short gameplay videos of it and thought it looked charmingly old school. I am happy to say that I was right about that.This game has in my opinion found just the right balance of ""olden times"" graphic style and modern day pacing. It is also neither to easy or to unforgiving as not to give most players a fair experience.Another strong point for me is that this game has co-op and up to four people could be a part of the campaign play. That is a great feature and it is truly fun to romp through a dungeon with some mates.The only thing I would have liked to have been developed slightly more is the save functionality surrounding multiplayer. It is not well explained how this works. Seeing as the campaigns are fairly lengthy this is unfortunate seeing as it is tedious having to play through an entire campaign in one sitting.If you are a fan of old school graphics and fun mp this could be a game for you."

I got started on the NES at a young age, and I nursed my addiction to SNES games through college thanks to small, privately owned shops. *shakes fist at gamestop*Try playing this game on a SNES controller (I use 8bitdo) and its just like an old school game. Except it looks better and plays better.In each level, there are many easter eggs and puzzles to work out. In the main game and expansion, you can find new things even in your 5th playthrough. You can customize how difficult or easy it is using the crutch system. (start with 1hp? 0 lives? NP)There's a variety of levels-- some you can download, or make yourself. The map-maker that comes with the game is buggy and didn't work after a few sessions... but the few sessions I had with it were great. (BTW I can't seem to find anyone with my problem anywhere, so let me know if you wanna help xD)  The workshop has all sorts of lovely map additions. I've played a lot of them.If you are on a very slow computer, this game is STILL PLAYABLE. I cannot tell you how gleeful I was that it worked on the little ""netbook"" my nephew had so I bought him hammerwatch (and preinstalled it) and he never plays. SIGH.The settings are really easy to understand and although you have to exit out of the game to connect another controller-- I find myself struggling with my bluetooth software much more often.... before I give up and just connect it via usb.The variety of characters is nice; paladin (dash, slash), archer (arrows, bombs), are among the many choices. Have I mastered every one? No, but, I feel like priest is not as useless as most people find. You learn tricks and skills with these characters.The online functionality is especially invigorating. It's very easy to start a game and get playing... and then have people join you for a spell, help you out, then leave. Most of the time it's pretty fun but I don't recommend it if you are just learning how to play. I would say, wait until you think you've significantly slowed in skill improvement with your character before attempting to play online.(I say this because, from personal experience... its not fun to be on a map, totally stumped in a puzzle with a stranger) Most players are very helpful and kind. It's an interesting and multilingual community. I haven't /really/ met a troll yet but... *knocks on wood*So aside from the retro feel of the game and the general good-will attitude of the players, is this really a game you'd enjoy?

I don't speak for everyone and different people have different tastes, and I am definitely not saying don't give this game a chance.

It's got beautiful pixel art with great particle and shadow effects. You'll be bashing your way through hordes, and hordes of enemies to eventually fight 4 equally challenging bosses. There are various classes to pick from each feeling very unique to it's gameplay.Instead of the traditional way of progressing through the game by earning EXP you only earn gold, which you can spend on upgrades, potions and even extra lives. This really fits the game really well as you can get into situations where you may have to tactically plan your purchases, would extra damage benefit you more than an extra life? There's plenty of upgrades to unlock.The game is full of secrets, filled with great treasures and easter eggs. Even though the game isn't randomly generated it is still fun to play through the same map over and over again.This is absolutely one of my favorite games of 2013. Although the multiplayer has some problems (Hosting and you can't save games) it's still fun. The controls aren't bad and works great with mouse and keyboard! Some may have a better experience with a gamepad though."
