There's almost no learning curve at all and then it's just non-stop action, drama, conniving strategies, and a lot of yelling. The controls are simple to start out with, but open up to more complex gameplay as the subtle specifics of the mechanics reveal themselves. This game is hilarious and heart-pounding; one moment we were cracking up at the absurdity of it all, and the next we were literally on the edge of our seats. Only one of the three friends I played with would probably consider themselves a gamer, but we all enjoyed it equally. This game is for everyone."

It's fast but controllable. It's sternly competative but always fun. It's simple but flexible. It's a game that you'd try to emulate if you were sent back in time 25 years and had to make a living by becoming a time-travelling game developer when you've already pitched Threes, Lumines, and Geometry Wars to 90s game studios and become a millionaire."
,Recommended,239090,32662228,Posted: 22 June,all,zhaboots,"Samurai Gunn is a couch gaming gem - incredibly easy to pick up and yet difficult to master as it has a surprising amount of mechanical depth.The main controls are simply a 4-directional slash with your katana or a gun that only holds 3 bullets with no reloads. Katana slashes, if timed correctly, can also reflect bullets. Yet, there are tons of other subtleties, nuances and the element of mind games that differentiate the skill levels of players.There is also a ton of game modes and maps that keep the core gameplay fun and engaging: each map brings new twists to the old formula.This game is also insanely stylish and polished - every slash, jump and bullet is satisfying and exciting.Overall, strongly recommended for a great time with friends."

Every kill makes you feel awesome and every death makes you curse up a storm."
,Not Recommended,239090,8708671,"Posted: 14 January, 2014",all,Dust,"I was really excited for this game, but I realize now that it's not all that great. There are a couple of reasons for that.1. So little content. For 15$ you want more variety in characters, more diverse game mechanics, a decent options menu and a better single-player experience. Which leads to my next point...2. Multiplayer with 2+ people is the only fun option. Unless you have a 2-3 controllers and have people who would play with you on the same computer, there is absolutely no point in buying the game. No online play, so forget about that. AI isn't all that challenging \ interesting, so single-player tends to get boring fast.Don't get me wrong - Samurai Gunn is well polished. It does few things (too few in my opinion), but it does them quite well. The controls are responsive. The game is immersive and atmospheric. The attention to detail is remarkable. There just isn't enough of a game there to justify getting it at this point.Maybe one day in the future, some bonus content is released and this review won't be relevant anymore. Maybe not.Right now I'd stick to Megabyte Punch if you're itching for a nice brawler (though not a 1-hit-kill one), or just wait for Towerfall to make its way to the PC in a couple of months."
,Recommended,239090,11423602,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,Sly Boots,"I am really glad I got this one. It's fun, addictive and really easy to get into.Samurai Gunn is an extremely fast-paced arena combat game in which players use a katana as their main weapon and may fire up to three shots from a gun as a support weapon. The gameplay relies on players' abilities to quickly move around the levels my means of running, jumping and executing their opponents in one lightning-fast strike. Shots from guns may be used to cover long distances in a straight line, but may also be deflected at the shooter by parrying them with one swing of the sword. Additionally, levels often include environmental hazards such as spikes and moving platforms which can squish any character against a wall, floor or ceiling.An impressive amount of attention to detail is revealed through such things as bullet casings falling to the ground after each shot. What's more, the casings remain there and may be pushed by any character who steps on them. Another example is the water: if someone dies in a pond, the water acquires a red tint which becomes more intense as more blood is spilled, only to be washed away after a few seconds of no blood-spilling on the same spot. To top it all off, standing in water renders your gun useless even when when you get out of the pond, so keep that in mind.The soundtrack is a perfect match for the action. Based on traditional Japanese instruments, it's reminiscent of soundtracks from chanbara movies and animes with a historical setting. At times, it reminds me of Samurai Spirits, only faster-paced (depending on the track). On that note, the sound effects are hugely satisfying. Most of all, the katanas cutting through the air (or your enemies, ideally). There's something about that loud metallic *schwing!* that makes you want to keep pressing the sword button for more, even if you're not hitting anyone.Graphically, it's a beautiful game. The sprites are simple but perfectly distinguishable from one another and each is full of personality. There are three characters for each faction and, even within such simplicity, all of them can be told apart at a glance while keeping a common element that identifies them as belonging to the same group. The levels offer a rather wide variety of colours and designs. The intense lime green and clear brown of the bamboo forests, the purple rocks and pale green bushes of the mountain pass with its Buddha statues or the white snow, dark trees and clear water of the winter areas are all pleasant to look at and brimming with detail. Each gives the battle a particular mood or atmospheric feeling. And yet, they managed to do all this with no real distractions for the player, thanks to its retro-style pixellated graphics. Combining an old visual style with modern-day gameplay fluency is a path that numerous indie developres take, and it was yet again the right choice for this title.All of it is wrapped up into an elegant presentation that fans of chanbara films and samurai pop culture in general will recognise and love. From the moment we see the title screen, we know what type of world we'll be thrown into. A red band with black silhouettes belonging to a bunch of samurais running through a field is an extremely effective introduction to a high-paced game such as this one and it also serves the purpose of creating a classy main menu. In-game, the brief stop produced by a kill, with the blackening of the screen save for the strip which shows killer and victim, is a charmingly abrupt way of making everyone aware of the death. The slow-motion plus zoom that frames the final kill in a fight always provides for an interesting composition and flaunts the game's colourful palette as well as its sprites, still lovely and worth of appreciation with their pixels brought to a bigger size. The menus are simple and use one font, and the signs which recount the kills at the end of a match have a neat parchment feel to them, with easily recognisable icons depicting each death and its cause.I recommend obtaining this underappreciated gem while it's on sale, since playing it with friends is the best way to exploit its wonders. Survival mode is fun, engaging and addictive, but nothing beats the variety and unpredictability (or lack thereof) of playing against human competitors. As more people get this game, the more fun it will get for all of us who share it."

,Recommended,239090,8011734,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,More_Badass,"Throw Tarantino, Hotline Miami, and 47 Ronin in a blender, and you'd get Samurai GunnFirst off, I've only played solo Survival but that's impressive and substantial enough to enjoy.So you might be thinking that those three elements in the title seem like a weird mix, but that's the kind of vibe I'm getting during my time with Samurai Gunn. Take the samurai films of old, ramp it up to eleven with the Tarantino-style violence and blood, and then imbue that with the lightning-fast white-knuckle pace of Hotline Miami, and that's Samurai Gunn in a nutshellChoose a samurai, choose an arena, and then fight. One hit kills. Armed with only your blade, your handful of bullets, and your agility, you must survive against increasingly challenging waves of enemies in increasingly complex arenas. Like Hotline Miami, death comes fast and at a moment's notice; a single lapse in timing, in reaction and reflex, and your blood will stain the ground rather than your opponent's.There are no power-ups to equip, no special swords to unlock, or abilities to use. You and your foes are equally matched; superior skill and reflexes are your only advantages. Each battle is one of hair's-breadth dodges over swinging blades, of smart positioning, perfect timing to strike down an enemy in mid air or deflect his bullet back at him. And that's just against one opponent; it only becomes more intense once you're down to one life and three enemies are out for your blood.It's not just this frantic dance of death that makes Samurai Gunn so compelling, but the sheer variety of arenas as well. From levels consisting of moving platforms and traps to levels with spike pits and saw blades, to levels made of nothing but easily breakable bamboos so that the layout changes and shrinks as you play, they are numerous and each must be learned and mastered if you wish to succeed.It's the little details that round out this impressive package. Fall into a pond and your gun won't fire but instead misfire and discharge spurts of water. Your blood and bodies stay behind, monuments and reminders of your past failures. Play dead among the corpses to confuse your enemy. Slash at your foe at the same time he does, and you'll clash swords and fly apart, leaving a dust trail in your wake.So again, I've only played single player, but I can only imagine that multiplayer is even better thanks to human players instead of AI. You can play co-op against bots or fight against each other in Versus mode. As for Samurai Gunn's future, the developer has said he's ""interested in experimenting with different types of enemies, modes, and other things"" so there's only more frenetic bloodshed to come."

The combat draws heavily from titles like Towerfall and Smash Bros, and while the game is lean on content, it provides polished hacky-slashy-stabby-shooty multiplayer fun.

Bullets are fast enough that you have to react, but slow enough and limited enough that they're best saved for a moment when you're just a little outside of reach. The showdowns are beautiful, tense, and dramatic. It's a great game for new players to pick up and jump into for a casual setting, but it stays fresh even once you've grasped all of the mechanics.On the other hand, a few different options regarding the matches would go a long way. Aside from changing the length of the matches, you really don't have any settings at all. There are no other game modes, and nothing to unlock. At the least, I wish there were a few more maps to choose from.If you are a person who has the chance to play local multiplayer games with 2, 3, or 4 people, I recommend picking this game up - but maybe when it's on sale."

I got this game on sale 50 %.Why I can't recommend it? Well it's simple. The amount of content is just visibly lacking. 2 Game modes Versus ( no bots yet ) and survival ( with bots ). Maps feel claustrophobic and I would enjoy larger maps ( perhaps even a map editor ) and there is no story mode.So what you get for 11 pounds is an arena retro hack n slash game with little content which makes it feel like a small project that should be sold for less than a 5 pounds... yet they charge 11.It's fun but gets boring easily because of the lack of content and settings ( like the amount of bots, mutators etc. ) Don't pay the full price or you will regret it."

Sure, it doesn't have many of the extras and filler of a larger title, but it is truly such a rare and beautiful thing to find such an uncomplicated, (and uncomprimised), good time these days. The lack of online multiplayer is for this games benefit  as, despite the shortsighted comments that we see from some of the other reviews, this is a game that is an experience best enjoyed with the other players in the same room playing together for a shared experience like no other. The immediate and visceral impact of every button push is shared, (almost by force) as each kill is given attention through screen focuses of the involved parties as they slash each other down as quickly as possible in this first to 10 battle royale. Everyone gets to appreciate the flow of the match through brief pauses for each score. This is one of those games that is immediately accessible while still offering a serious depth of strategy for experienced players, making it fun to play even with mixed levels of experience. If you have the controllers to support four players at once, you will be hard pressed to find a better way to spend a night with friends than this!"

While the game may seem basic with tight controls and two attack buttons (sword and gun), there is a bit of depth to it for a bit more thought in your angle of attack... If you're quick enough. Bullets can be deflected it with a well-timed swing, sword clashes can provide another critical opportunity to strike, and a few other not-so-obvious quirks/abilities. Though basic with mode variaty (only local multiplayer and a survival mode), there are a ton of maps included, which are generally pretty good. And even with the few negative points, Samurai Gunn is so fast-pace and bloody-good fun, that my friends and I can't help but demand one more game.

Although I would love to play with my friends without having them here I do feel that the fun level would decrease, in short, its much better when your friends are within punching distance. I do wish that the different character had different weapons or moves, maybe some designed for ranged more then melee and vice versa. I also think that being able to make and share maps on the steam workshop would have been amazing.

You NEED to have friends at your place to play against you.If you do have a friend or two to join you, and a spare controller for them, then this game is a fantastic local competitive one hit kills duel-fest with great controls, and a few secret techniques you can pick up to surprise your opponents when they least expect it. It could be well described as a more melee focused Towerfall.It is without a doubt, at this time, light on content. Two game modes, one of which has 2 different score keeping settings, and about 12 maps, but I feel it makes up well for this by fitting solidly in the realm of ""Party Game"". It is a great thing to pick when you need to entertain some guests, and the maps it does contain are well varied and allow for some clever kills through the use of screen wrap, or environmental hazards.Ultimately, ask yourself this: Do you have friends who frequently visit, and you need a fast paced game to play against them?

If two Ninjas go for the jugular at the same instant, a parry(or clash, according to the guide) ensues, prolonging the gory conflict.guns, as well as swords, can be used, and the three-bullet limit makes for some interesting situations. water will reduce your mighty blunderbuss to a mere squirtgun, an original concept.The Mysterious 'Sword Sheath' move always puzzled me, until I cheated and read up on it. It seems a good idea to be able to change your sword stroke, but I can't see any difference between over or under hand.Actually, the most important aspect of the sword is it's ability to add an acceleration,(In the direction of the slash) to your fighter. The Jump button increases the duration of the added momentum, allowing for some incredible near-flying combat.One last interesting thing about sword-clashes: The Samurai who drew sword slower will be sent flying back, unable to pull out his blade until he slows down. obviously, this means that if you follow up quickly, you can finish an opponent who defended your first attack. A less obvious application of this is that on certain levels you can send an opponent plummetting to his spiky doom.Which brings me to the level design part. Much like other games made by the same designer, levels are divided into areas. Samurai Gunn has four areas, with each area having it's own six or so levels.The 'Fortress' area is well done, complete with moving platforms and pits of spikes. purple-pink roofing and tan timber give it a very solid asthetic. The 'Forest' area too, is very well made, green and brown, with terrain that breaks up into spike traps.However, The Cemetery and Mountain levels seem unfitting. Each one has it's own cool little things, but not enough to make them equal to the Fortress and Forest areas. Cemetery in particular, with it's 'mushroom/cloud/sticky-things' and drab grey - purple artstyle, doesn't match with the bold color scheme of Samurai Gunn.The Mountain area has solid level design, but just doesn't stand up to Fortress/Forest.And now for Survival mode, most hated by fans.(That's the impression I got, anyway)So, you pick a level and battle waves and waves(I think it's without limit by the time you hit Lv.5) of Shadow-Ninjas. It's actually really fun. Except for one thing: The Ai is well... artifical. I myself was impressed by how the Ai behaved, but certain things about them are very irritating.When it comes to conflicts involving multiple attacks and movements in a short period of time and a small area, the Ai is truly pathetic, lacking the ability to see what a human would perceive as being obvious. But, when it comes to reacting to incoming sword or bullet, their reaction is instantaneous, nay, pre-cognitive. If they're lined up on level with an incoming bullet, and aren't somehow disabled, they will reflect it perfectly, every time. I am not exaggerating.Now to end my long-winded review: here is my final summation of the game:Mechanics: greatLevel Design: Mostly great, you probably won't play the Cemetery or mountain levels much, especially after you discover Pull.Art: great: The Dev is a master of color schemes.modes: Pretty awesome, could use a few more and some work.all round: 5/5Post script: My ramblings on what I would do if I were the developer of SG.(I can dream)Characters: customisation of colors, additions of special appearance modifiers for achievments(e.g. a black katana if you make it to level 5 of survival, Arrows instead of bullets ifyou make five reflection kills in survival, etcetera)Maps:         Cemetery and Mountain combined into one, get rid of the sticky clouds, make a newarea.( like shore, or dojo, or something )Cemetery Showdown: A really cool idea, but the change of map means that players have toadapt to another level. If the showdown took place on the same level of the battle,then the muscle memory would better allow for the players to find each other, invisibleas they are.Game Modes: Tournament mode. Seriously. SG was designed for this. And, in only four player battles,you could have the playoff matches fought at the same time, on a map divided down themiddle, or something. For more than four, a plain old tourney mode would work great.Clan mode: A story mode, where you fight in a huge tournament, Hayao V. Kurosawa,Kubuki V. Hirushagebleghblegh, etc. interspersed with special challenges and stuff.Survival: the Shadow Ninjas seem kinda vanilla. I'd change up their appearence and addspecialized Ai types.(see Ai...) Also, I'd add challenge levels between each round ofsurvival.(like a showdown)Ai:              Work on making them more human-like, and making them more individually skilled. like agunner type, and a berserker, and a turtle...Spawning:  I'd add spawn points in spikes. That would make things interesting, especially on pull, andhelp protect from spawn-kills.(the quickest way to win, btw.)Bushido:    Add a bonus for following Bushido.(no spawn kills, no hiding, no three-shots-in-one-second, andyou always re-sheath your sword after each slash.) like an additional 15% at least 1, rounding up.Clans:        Make each clan have it's own special advantage( Hayao jumps highest, Kubuki Shoots quickest,Kurosawa Wins in a parry, etcetera) or make the three characters each belong to a class of fighter.(fast, jump, slash)But, these are just Ideas. I'd beware of what might happen to the existing mechanics if these were implemented, and onlydo so If I were sure that they would improve the game."

The game mashes up some of my favorite things, and owns them completely. It’s the awesome lovechild of Mario Bros Arcade and Samurai Champloo, that went to Super Smash Bros High, and is currently attending indie art school and “getting to know itself.”The premise of the game is easy enough to explain. Players choose an 8 bit samurai, and prepare themselves for battle. The character selection screen gives you a small area to try out controls in while other participants lock in their selections. The control scheme is simple, yet will take time and practice to master. Players can slash in cardinal directions with a sword, fire a gun (up to 3 times per life) and jump with good air control. Wall sliding and wall jumping are also present, as they should be in any good little personal melee combat title. You can even “feign death” if you lack honor, by crouching/lying on the ground.Combat takes place in 1 of 4 selectable worlds, each with their own theme and unique obstacles. Forest levels, for instance, showcase bamboo that grows and changes as the match progresses, while the Mountain features hanging icicles that can be dropped to create level playing fields or slay foes. Each of the 4 settings features about 10 individual combat screens. A level is encompassed by the screen in its entirety, features pacman/mario bros arcade style level wrap, and have 4 entryways through which new players (or ninja) may enter the battlefield.Sounds simple, doesn’t it? And it is, truly, until you play it. There is so much to manage in such a short period once bullets are flying and katana are drawn. Death can, and will, come from anywhere. Skilled players can be seen as those who measure their sword strikes, as their is a minor cooldown (less than a second) between strikes, and striking too soon normally means the death of the impatient warrior. One would think that the guns would completely alter the balance, and they do, but not as much as you might think. While they can kill from a distance, your shots are limited to 3 per life, guns won’t function at all if they get wet (yes, there are water hazards), and, most importantly, you can deflect bullets with a well timed sword strike.That’s not to say that you will never use your gun; it may just be in ways that you are not used to. Canny players often fire bullets in the short to medium range to avoid deflections. These shots are often after after a close strike, and will follow rule #2 – Doubletap. One more makes 100% sure. You might die from a deflection, but you will likely take the other warrior down. Those who have truly mastered guns often send bullets via screen wrap to take down unsuspecting opponents.The game is beautifully rendered in 8 bit, with characters sporting multiple color schemes and great animations. Charm positively oozes from these samurai sprites. I remember the first time I got my gun wet and tried to fire it in combat, just to see little sputters of water leave my firearm. Time has been spent, and it shows.And the music! This is where the Samurai Champloo influence might show its roots. Composed by Doseone, the SG EP features tracks emulating traditional sounding bases mixed with hip hop elements. The audio accompaniment really completes the package. Nujabes (R.I.P.) would be proud, I think.Samurai Gunn is one of those rare treats one has to savor. Specifically, in close quarters with friends. It sports 4 modes, 3 of which require other players…. on your couch. That’s right, there is no online. I know, I KNOW! Blaspheme! you say. But realistically, this game was designed to be played within arm-punching distance of your opponent. It’s tense, its fun, and most likely everyone will break out their warcry. Tables might get flipped. All in good fun, with smiles.Next time you are looking for a fun party game, consider Samurai Gunn. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.http://store.steampowered.com/app/239090/http://www.dustimusprime.com/articles/review/ronin-review-samurai-gunn/"

Let me expand on that:-You run-You jump-You can jump off walls-You swing a sword in one of 4 directions (up, down, left, right)-You shoot your gun (with limited ammo) in 4 directions as well-You can deflect bullets back in the direction it came at by swinging your sword at it-Clashing swords with another combatant causes one or both of you to fly backwards and take no damage-One hit kills-First to 10 kills in multiplayer-Killing yourself loses a point-When you share a similar score with the winner, you may go to a 1v1 showdown-There is some destructable terrain-There are spikes of deathy death and squishy death squishes by moving platforms and icicles-The maps are circular, meaning when you drop from the bottom you will come out the top. From the left edge of the screen to the right.That's really about it.I highly recommend having CONTROLLERS for this game. Playing with a keyboard in a fast paced semi-competitive platformer is a good way to make yourself upset. :]"

I love the arcade style in all but even though the maker doesnt want online mutliplayer i think it would raise the amount of sales because then you have more to do. Its awesome when you have friends over but when your alone its more of a time killer. Survival mode is pretty sweet not gonna lie but honestly if your reading this and you can notify the maker tell him he needs to incorporate some sort or multiplayer because the game would be 5000x's better. But thanks for this awesome game i hope to see some awesome updates in the future!!!!

I would love to have more stages, game modes, and more multiplayer options added in the future. I hope that it is coming especially given the current price of the game.

No online support, but that shouldn't stop you from buying it if you are planning on having a party anytime soon (and you can hook up your PC to a bigscreen TV).  It's similar in artstyle to Towerfall, and similar gameplay to Smash Bros with 1-hit kills. Games are VERY fast and adrenaline pumping. You'll be yelling at your friends in no time, but also always noticing how fair the game is.Look, this review is coming out weird. It's a great game. There's plenty of videos out on the internet showing the gameplay. Lack of online doesn't kill this game (as it doesn't need it), but some people don't have a good local co-op setup.  While there is a single player mode, it's the multiplayer that makes this game amazing.  It's like Smash Bros. It didn't have online multiplayer for the longest time, and that didn't stop it from being one of the greatest brawlers of a generation.  Judge it like that.To those that *need* online (due to limitations of gaming setup or prejudices), they should probably consider a different game."

Samurai Gunn thrives off of a great idea with precision feedback  that's all done with a great style. While this may be local multiplayer only it is hard to see playing it without screaming in anguish or victory to the swordsman (swordpeople?) next to you as the blood spatters across the snow and stays there as a show of your honor defeated. Much like Super Smash Brothers, it is just that much better in person.The relatively low footprint in computing power makes this something I can throw on my netbook, hook-up xbox 360 controllers to, and have a quick match with friends at a party without worry of it boggying down or needed to lug around a tower PC. And when I can't make it to said events, the survival mode has decent AI that still has me screaming at the screen.If you got a buddy, and sometimes a grudge, this is a great game."
,Recommended,239090,15569625,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,Doppelganchor,"Samurai Gunn is a fast paced arena style ""Bushido-Brawler."" It's extremely easy to pick up and have hours of fun on the couch with your buddies. From the 10 life/kill Death Match to the life or death Shogun Showdown, the battles get intense.Only having 3 bullets in your chamber makes ranged battle high stakes, but worth calculating. You have the ability to block strikes with your sword, but whoever swings second goes flying in the opposite direction, making battles even more dangerous when traps are activated or when the floors are spiked.Although the price may seem steep for a local ""party-game"" this day and age, the single-player survival mode redeems the price. Some may disagree, however the difficulty starts strong and only gets more difficult with each level. It's a challenge not to be over looked.Overall I'd say Samurai Gunn is an 8/10 and worth a purchase regardless, but it's even more worth a purchase if you have three friends with game pads to decapitate each other. It'd be difficult to implement online capabilities since the controls are heavily based on precise timing, therefore latency would cause issues. This game is exactly where it needs to be, and provides hours of entertainment regardless of couch-buddies."

Either use your swift sword or fire you gun at range, but be weary, there is a limit on how fast you can strike with your sword, making it demand precision, and your firearm only has 3 bullets each life which can be deflected with the sword. On top of all of that, the stages themselves have interactable objects that can help/hurt you. Get 3 friends with you and play coop survival or go head to head to see just whose chi is heightened. No friends? No problem. The survival mode can be played solo as well. Only complaint from me is the price for such a simple game without a ton of content.

It has not internet but whatever, when you are only 10 large pixels wide and travel the screen space in under a second, any lag more than zero would not work. One hit kills, wall jumping, mind games.It works well as 1v1 or MP game, and I've got several hours of both under my belt. The survival mode I'm not sure about but allows you to learn the mechanics I suppose, or get your co-op on if so inclined.The maps all play very differently, and there are lots of them and each tileset has some unique mechanics. Sounds are phenomenal, graphics are perfect. It even has physics (A decapitated head will roll around the level for the remainder of the map). After a while you stop thinking and play through instinct. This is when it is at it's best.My only issue is with the 4:3 aspect ratio. A stylistic choice perhaps, but more screen space could have been used to reduce excessive scrolling in MP games in 16:9 or 16:10.I feel like I could have been playing this game on an Amiga or Nes 20 years ago, however the speed, polish and tuning here are beyond anything from that era.
