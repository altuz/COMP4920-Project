Fan of the series B.) you don't mind skillful platformers C.) You love Pac-Man or something different in its entirely.  Since it's based off the show, it might give you some insight on what the show's about.  Game-wise, it's Pac-Man with superpowers, some good and not so good, depending on how it works for you is what matters. Although I can say that this is a platformer that really makes you think and how Pac operates really helps things.  Now this is NOT your parents' Pac-Man, it's a whole new Pac-World with a story that you might get a few laughs out of it and well, you get Pac-Man burping at the end of every stage and it's worth a good laugh.  I recommend this game only if you're into platformers and otherwise."

Young gamers or inexperienced gamers will probably have difficulty in a lot of spots. It offers a lot of special abilities for Pac-Man that are very clever and neat to use. The fights are actually more intense than what you'd expect to see in a typicall 3D Platformer. You fight quite a bit of ghosts all at once at various points, and it sort of uses a combo system to pull it off, which is really neat. It has several mini-games to unlock and play, which bring back the greatness of the 80's arcades. The Steam controller is a great controller for this game, which seems to work rather perfectly. The controls are very good with it. The levels are large and beautiful, and while they are generally linear, you do have to break off the main path and do some exploring to find everything, which is something I always enjoy doing. The main thing I don't like about this game is that if you want to get all achievements, you have to play every single stage twice, and there is nothing new in each stage when you play it for a second time, so that part seems redundant for no good reason. It was fun to earn all of the achievements, anyway, in about 15 hours of gameplay."

,Recommended,239720,11995277,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,Fsyco,"Mechanically, this game is pretty solid. Pacman controls just fine for the most part, with a double jump and a very satisfying chomping mechanic that gives combat a great sense of flow. Level design is fairly solid, and the game is bright and colorful and fun to look at, and has quite a bit of variety in its visual design. While the game has flaws, it does enough right that I can give it a reccomendation.Let's discuss the flaws then, shall we? First off, I actually watched (and liked) the show this game is based on, and the show basically feels like a great big ad for this game (and any future installments). Weirdly, then, the game feels like a cheap tie-in, the kind you'd get on the PS1 or something. The game establishes absolutely nothing about the universe or characters, and just assumes you know who everyone is, and even then doesn't really do much with the characters. A bunch of them from the show are in here, but they don't do much besides act as a cameo (including a criminally underused Dr. Buttocks). Entirely not helping is that they couldn't get the VAs from the show, and the new ones just sound kind of amateurish.Also, I wasn't a big fan of the powerups. They're kind of situational and inorganic, and Pac's normal chomping ability is already really fast and satisfying to use. They feel less like enhancing my ability to play the game and more like deliberately sawing off a leg to use the handicapped parking. Some (like the Chameleon and Balloon powerups) seriously hamper the flow of combat but are required to traverse the stage. Others (Fire and Ice) are kind of fun to use, but largely unnecessary for the most part, except against a few BS enemies they make you use the power on before you can eat them (IE, melting ice ghosts, or putting out fire ghosts, both of whom hurt you if you just chomp them). There's some that are pretty cool (Metal Pac, Boulder Pac, Rubber Pac), though, so powerups aren't totally useless.Overall it's solid. I'd say it isn't bad at 20 bucks, but you might want to wait for a sale."

,Recommended,239720,16564736,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,EscapeRouteBritish,PAC-MAN™ and the Ghostly Adventures is about as safe as you can play a mascot platformer. It gets dull quickly and has a very low difficulty threshold. A nice entry title for platforming newbies and an excellent game for platforming veterans who haven't played something like this for a while.
76561198002864416,Not Recommended,239720,16005434,"Posted: 25 May, 2015",all,The Morgue,"I recently went on a Pac-Man splurge, thanks to a Steam sale.  The much-beloved Pac-Man DX was an absurdly fun retro experience - this game, on the other hand, shows the struggles this franchise has endured trying to evolve to more modern tastes.  The Ghostly Adventures is an uninspired, paint-by-numbers 3D platformer devoid of any inspiration or personality.The story is the usual fare: some bad guy has an evil device and wants to do something-or-other; I couldn't have possibly cared less.  The plot is presented via scattershot cinematics, featuring afternoon cartoon-level voice-acting and writing.  Pac-Man sounds like a plucky teenager here, which is a bit odd for a guy who, last I checked, had a wife and kid.  Maybe this is a different Pac-canon.  Who the hell knows?  You can skip the cinematics, which I highly recommend.Gameplay is pretty standard 3D platformer fare.  Pac-Man jumps all over the place, collecting shiny objects and battling bad guys.  Pac, of course, attacks his ghostly foes by eating them, which provides a bit of grisly fun for a while.  (At the end of each stage, Pac-Man belches up the eyeballs of his devoured enemies - that's pretty hardcore, man!)  Chaining together chomp attacks in an area filled with ghosts is one of the game's few pleasures.  Power-ups are sprinkled throughout to spice things up, but they're all pretty generic: an ice power-up, a fire one, one that lets you wall jump, and so on.  Nothing you haven't seen 100 times before.  The one exception is the snappy Spin power, which allows you to plot a path for Pac-Man and then have him run it at high speed - it's quite fun and I wish it appeared sooner in the game.Things are pretty solid, production-wise.  The game looks decent enough and the sounds are fun and appropriately Pac-esque.  The music is fine, if entirely forgettable.  The game let me use my 360 controller without any tinkering, and the controls did the job.  My only real beef here is the in-game arcade.  Namco has one of the most enviable arcade libraries in the world, yet the only four ""cabinets"" you can play here are new mini-games, each more tedious than the last.  They feel like half-baked smartphone apps.  Why not throw in classic Pac-Man, or his Missus?  Or Dig-Dug?  Galaga?  Anything?  I guess the game's intended audience was deemed to be too young for the classics.All in all, a pretty big misfire, from the tepid opening stages to an absurdly anticlimactic final boss battle.  And I know that this is the part where most people would say ""it would be okay for the kids,"" but I don't agree.  I think kids deserve games made with care and inspiration, instead of just plopping them in front of any old safe, colorful crap.  I'd rather see a little one cobbling together a farm in Minecraft, as opposed to enduring the avalanche of lazy, moronic puns that make up this game's script.  And if kids deserve better, adults surely do as well.  Pac-Man is a bona fide legend, but he needs a better agent."

,Not Recommended,239720,15988349,"Posted: 24 May, 2015",all,Harley,"Gobbling up your happy memories.There has always been a sinister underbelly to Pac-Man's maze adventures. Like an unaltered version of a Grimm fairy tale, the Pac-Man games exist in a world in which he must constantly consume ghosts until he is eventually overwhelmed by the relentless determination of his poltergeist pursuers. But it was easy to ignore this endless endeavor when abstract visuals shielded you from the worst of Pac-Man's deeds. After all, how could a yellow circle eating colorful doodles possibly be ominous? And the eyeballs of your eaten foes--those shocked, disembodied eyeballs--drifted back to the ghost hideout like a silly gag. Prepare to have your happy memories turned on their heads. In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the abstract barrier has been removed, and in the process, there's a surreal wrinkle to this entry-level platformer. Who knew that Pac-Man had a dark side?A benign introduction welcomes you to the city of Pacopolis. Characters loudly enunciate their lines as if they belong in a Saturday-morning cartoon, and the dialogue never ventures outside of the dry exposition that pushes the plot ever onward. For those who enjoy A Game of Thrones, it can be funny to imagine that Sir C is really Cersei Lannister, though the big-nosed professor isn't quite as ruthless as the queen regent, at least not as far as we're shown. A school serves as a hub world for Pac-Man, and though that's hardly strange given that he's just a boy in Ghostly Adventures, the company he keeps begins the surreality that flows throughout this game. Pinky, Blinky, Inky, and Clyde--the ghosts from the original Pac-Man--roam the halls as if they aren't spirits, and you talk to them instead of trying to eat them. It's nice to know that even the fiercest of enemies can make nice.At this point, it seems as if Ghostly Adventures not only caters to a young audience incapable of discerning thought, but doesn't even respect them. Because the dialogue lacks any semblance of wit, there's nothing more to the plot than a remedial MacGuffin hunt, and the by-the-numbers platforming continues along that brain-dead path. Early levels set you loose in 3D worlds with nary a hint of interesting obstacles or clever level design. You simply walk along the constrained route, collecting pellets and hamburgers just to have something to do, and then mash a button to eat ghosts who stand before you. There's a certain appeal in chomping a group of ghoulies in a flashy display of your insatiable hunger, but everything is so by rote that it's pretty dull. It's as if the game expects the inherent fun of playing to drive you forward, even though there is nothing worthwhile going on.And then, things start to get more interesting.Who put a vending machine in a frozen tundra?Pac-Man is a chameleon, and that's not just a figure of speech. Special pellets transform you from a double-jumping eating machine into a variety of creatures that give you different powers. As a chameleon, you can swing from poles using your sticky tongue and turn invisible to make it past searchlights. When Pac-Man becomes a giant boulder (complete with an indecent retractable nose), you can squash the baddies who are terrified of your girth and shoot off ramps like a pinball. Gobble a pink pellet to fill yourself with air and then coast along the currents. Ghostly Adventures injects variety into your escapades through these precious pellets, and thus raises the insulting early levels to a place of respectability. None of these specific elements are particularly well executed on their own, but simply rushing from one objective to another keeps you on your toes so you're always reacting to a new demand rather than being lulled to sleep by predictability.Rushing from one objective to another keeps you on your toes so you're always reacting to a new demand rather than being lulled to sleep by predictability.These powers have a positive impact on the combat. When you become imbued with fire or ice energy, the ghosts keep pace, and you need to use your elemental abilities to stop them. How else could you devour an ice ghost if you don't set it on fire first? Having to put thought into dueling ghosts keeps you engaged in ways that evaporate when you're just slamming on the chomp button. Still, the raw mechanics aren't so hot. Targeting specific ghosts with ice and fire projectiles is tricky, especially when there are teleporting and vomiting ghosts floating across the environments. This imprecision removes much of the skill that could have made conquests satisfying, so instead, you partake in fights of attrition where you hope you nibble every baddie before they chip away all of your health. Because it's so kinetic, combat doesn't become boring, but it merely serves as another dose of variety rather than an enjoyable activity in its own right.Pac-Man seems ambivalent even surrounded by searing-hot lava.It's in the platforming that Pac-Man reaches its potential. There are so many ways to navigate these colorful worlds that you're always doing something different, and that alone keeps you invested. Zipping across vanishing platforms is very different from walking vertically along magnetic columns, and that not only nicely mixes up your actions, but also pushes the levels to new places. The tired designs of the early levels fade away when you have to figure out how to cross a lava lake (freeze the geysers!) or reach that floating island (find an air draft!). All of these elements have been found in previous platformers, but that doesn't diminish their appeal here. Zooming through a tunnel on a crumbling piece of rock is still fun because you have to think fast as obstacles rush toward you. And the repulsive way that Pac-Man just shoves any old thing into his mouth is good for some gross-out chuckles.And the repulsive way that Pac-Man just shoves any old thing into his mouth is good for some gross-out chuckles.Through all of this ridiculousness is the surreal undercurrent that flows through the game. Pac-Man eats ghosts, it's what he does, but there's a joy to his consumption that's unsettling. He eats the entire spook (those eyeballs no longer escape), and then keeps track of how many eyes he's digested. It's a little unnerving. After playing through every level, I have eaten exactly 2,426 ghost eyes. How could Pac-Man pal around with Pinky, eat her kin, and keep a morbid running tally of his conquests? And your victory animation when you nab the fruit at the end of each level cements just how twisted this game can be. When Pac-Man burps as any foodie would, you can actually see the eyeballs in his mouth fumes. It's as if the game repeatedly wants to remind you exactly what Pac-Man (and, by extension, you) are doing, so your actions swirl in your head even when you go to sleep for the night.The creepiness continues in the four-player mode. Here, you and up to three friends embody ghosts in 3D representations of the classic Pac-Man mazes. Explore the labyrinthine passageways as you nab fruit and collect power-ups, all while a computer-controlled Pac-Man roams, hungry for ghosts. You may find the pellet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ near the north corridor, and you rush toward him with unwavering focus. Now is your chance to put that Pac-Monster in his place. And then he nabs a power pellet, turning you and all of your friends blue, and devours you whole. Except your eyes, of course. You're sent back to your hideout as just a pair of eyes, and you realize how scary it is to hunt Pac-Man. Sadly, this mode is much better in concept than in practice. It's a slow-paced affair that lacks the unpredictability that could have made it engaging. Still, it's enlightening to see the world through the eyes of your long-standing enemies.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures travels down the same road as so many. 5/10"

,Recommended,239720,15960206,"Posted: 22 May, 2015",all,King Vegeta,"PAC-MAN is still in school & sounds like a 9 year old boy.  The voice acting is cheesy & meant for kids so if you're an adult like me you'll probably cringe & laugh at most of the stuff that's said.  You go around eating ghosts, food & collecting pellets while jumping through areas & you complete levels by collecting fruit or certain coins.  It's a pretty standard set up for the Genre.The Main villains name is ""Betrayus"".  Yes, that's his name.  I'm not sure exactly what the story is since it just kind of throws you into it without much to go on.The fruits you collect can be used to unlock several mini-games.  I'm not sure why you need fruit to play an arcade machine in the Pac-Land.  Maybe it has something to do with the guy who fixes the machines having scurvy?  I haven't unlocked any mini-games yet so I can't comment on them.There's also several upgrades you can use throughout each level that serve as a power up & an extra hit point.  So far I've run into Fire, Ice & Chameleon.  I'm sure you can guess what they do but I'll explain anyways.  Fire throws Fireballs & melts ice, Ice freezes enemies, water & some objects.  Chameleon gives you a long tongue like Yoshi, let's you turn invisible & use that tongue on poles (get your head out of the gutter) like a lasso.Overall it's a good 3D platform game where you collect fruit, coins or whatever you can find.  It kind of reminds me of classic collectathon platformers of old so if you like those types of games it'll be worth playing.  I recommend it for those who are starved for platforming games & need something to tie them over until Yooka-Laylee comes out.  It's also great for the kids."

While it is a kids game and i can see why it's easy, this is too easy even for children and it's really not as entertaining. It took me days to complete this game because i kept quitting the game to play something else due to how low my interest with it was as i went through it.The first few worlds and the arcade machines offer some challenge, in which children can enjoy. However... the last two worlds are jokes and the bosses offer no challenge. I would really be concerned for my own children if they ever had issues fighting any of the bosses in this game, as they are easier than some of the levels in this game. They all have at least 3-4 health points and they all get defeated by a certain, very obvious way. It's obvious how many hit points they have just by noticing these things. And it mainly consists of them getting hit with their own attacks.The final 2 worlds and the bosses in those worlds are jokes though. They are all very short. They are all very easy. The first of the two is basically a waste of time (even the cutscene after the last one calls it pointless) and the final and second of the two worlds is the biggest disappointment, as it is the easiest part of the entire game. The player should be given a challenging final few levels so that when they complete the game, they feel like they succeeded in something. However, because everything in the final world is so easy, it offers no challenge and doesn't give you any rewarding feeling. Just huge disappointment.It's also very bad when you have to redo an entire level again just to get a token that is required to 100% the game, because it just adds to the boredom of the game. And once you get all the fruit to play the arcade machines, not only are you disappointed by now because of the fact that the optional, bonus arcade mini games are HARDER than the final world of the actual game, but they are all so short that they don't really last long and still don't feel very rewarding.If you are an achievement hunter, buy it because this will be a breeze for you to get every achievement in the game. Outside of getting achievements, this game should be avoided because it will bore you and your children, it's not a fun game and there are far better games to get on Steam for your child that are cheaper than this one."

Its not that it was hard for say It was just difficult to navigate. You had no idea wether you where progressing or taking the wrong path ect.The finally level of the game was honestly way to easy ... i get this was geared towards kids but you could have made it a little harder ....Another level i found hard was the lava surfing one The controlls on the seemed to be un responsive at times There for it made it challanginglets talk about story now.If you have seen the cartoon then you will notice that the game actualy follows the story very well which is hard to do for some movie/cartoon based games  You are basically protecting pac world from the ghost invasion  while at the same time protecting the three of life from lord betrayes That pretty much sums it up.The powers you get in the game are ones that you seen in the show. Such as ice pack,fire pac,chamelion pac,tornado pac,rock pac and i think that is it what i like is they make each power usefull depending on the enviroment of the stage or the element of the ghost you are trying to beat ahem eat.There are a ton of collectables in the game so if you are going for 100% be prepaired to do some stages at least twice. also you will need at least 4500 energey pelets by the end of the game which should not be an issue if you collect them in every level.7/10"

In the same vein as Pac in Time for the SNES and the Pac-Man World series, Pac-Man is back jumping and double jumping through various environments and battling literal ghosts of the past.This game came as something of a surprise. On the surface, it's very simplistic and quite derivative of older platforming titles. It even manages to scale back from past Pac-Man adventures, whilst adding something new in the form of various powerups that act as a one hit shield and a way to traverse the environments.Not an overly difficult game, as lives are plentiful and the tactic of using powerup spawn points to essentially make you invulnerable, though a pleasantly surprising game with a multitude of fun abilities at every turn some very solid platforming goodness."

They are crafted with love and care, and I found myself being impressed by how much of the classic Pac-Man's imagery they managed to cram into the visuals.* The controls are good, for the most part. They flow nicely and work just as they should.* The game provides a variety of different powerups that nicely spice things up.* Chomping down on all those ghosts is pretty damn fun.* The overall design of levels (gameplay-wise) is decent.Cons:* Very often the game can get a sudden spike in difficulty just because of unfortunately placed bottomless pits that kill you instantly. As a result, the very first boss fight is shockingly difficult, but all the later ones are laughably easy. It's made all the worse by the fact that if you do die, you tend to go back a considerable distance. On the flip side, when you're not under the danger of falling into bottomless pits, you usually breeze through the game with little trouble.* The camera, while usually not an issue, can be a little annoying in that, for whatever reason, it moves a little jumpily and doesn't let you look up.* The voices are so annoying that I turned them off completely after just the first level. Couldn't they have just made them talk in Simlish? Okay, I get that it's probably because of being based on the show, but still...* The last two worlds are just lazy rehashes of the previously visited worlds.* The ending is rather disappointing.* Many of the powerups seem under-utilized. Some of them appear only for a handful of levels, only to be forgotten entirely for the duration of whole worlds, and only briefly reappear at the very end.* The story is a really lazy plot of the ""villain XYZ is trying to take over the world, stop him"" kind.The conclusion is that the game is a commendable effort with various things to like, with really lovely looking environments and many good ideas for gameplay, but hampered by certain shortcomings (most notably the difficulty, voices and uninteresting story) that prevent it from becoming a truly unmissable gem. As it is, it's a nice game that's worth checking out, but nothing magnificent.If you are going to get it, however, then do it only if it's on at least 50% discount. The full price is an outrage."

If you disagree, that's fine, not everyone shares the same thoughts.Ok, this is going to be more of a rant than a review, but oh well. I might as well get the bad out of the way first before I talk about the good.Calling this game a Pac-Man game is a travesty. Pac-Man goes around a maze, eating pills, fruit and ghosts. In this game, Pac-Man goes around the world in a non-maze like fashion. I can understand that, many games transition between genres and dimensions. However, this is where the game stops being Pac-Man entirely. Pac-Man goes around, collecting spheres, not eating, and defeating ghosts by scaring them, and chomping them, collecting their eyes in the process. Pac-Man also goes around collecting fruit for arcade machines in his high school. Sorry, high school? I thought Pac-Man was married? In fact, more to the point, I thought Pac-Man was a man? Yep, in this game, Pac-Man is in high school, his voice unbroken for some reason and no wife anymore. Mrs. Pac-Man does not exist. The best part about the high school? 1 classroom. Ok, I'm digressing. Pac-Man, with the help of his 2 friends and his professor, Sir C, and Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde (yep, the 4 ghosts who constantly chase Pac-Man in previous games to kill him) go around the world to stop Betrayus and the ghosts. This is explained in the first cutscreen, along with terrible voice acting. Surely it wasn't too difficult to make 3 people act surprised at the same time? Then the game starts. The mouse is over sensitive, so the camera shakes around too much, and since you rely on the camera position to go forwards, Pac-Man stumbles around like he's had 10 too many drinks. The scare mechanic is worthless as every ghost can get chomped with or without it, and for some reason, Pac-Man has to grab handles with his mouth and pull them down using gravity. Oh, are hands too difficult to program? Also, for health regen and to unlock god knows what else, you eat cheese and pies. Way to stick to the canon.Ok, so after looking at this, I need to include a section on the game itself, no comparison to the older Pac-Man titles. Here goes: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures controls like Banjo-Kazooie or A Hat in Time, but I find the turning with the mouse to be too sensitive, and Pac turns too much, meaning I never move in the direction I want to, but that could be a problem with my laptop not having the RAM needed for this game, or whatever is needed, I'm not good at computer technical things. As for Pac-Man's abilities, he can scare enemies, and chomp them. The scare mechanic seems useless, as the ghosts get chomped in one go anyway, scared or not. As for the chomp mechanic, you'd better be pointing the right direction, otherwise Pac will just chomp in the direction you've pointed, even sometimes chomping right next to the ghost. As a platformer, Pac-Man jumps a little too low, meaning obstacles you'd be able to clear in other games, such as the previously mentioned A Hat In Time, you can't clear. Pac also has access to teleporters, which he uses and poses after coming out of them, stopping the flow of the game, and making me regret buying this even more...If this game was a different IP, perhaps Banjo & Kazooie or Crash Bandicoot, I could have accepted this game better, as the gameplay suits the character, and they already have distinct characters in the universe without having to name different coloured Pacs and give them all different hair. And perhaps the controls are good when using the 360 controller, but I don't know about that unfortunately.Although the game is a good concept, it falls flat on every single level except enemy ghost AI. I suggest getting Pac-Man Museum (see edit below) to play an actual Pac-Man game, and I suggest playing Banjo-Kazooie or Donkey Kong 64 for a good 3d collectathon platformer. I hate to say this, but I hope this series of games dies before Pac-Man gets the same tragic fate at Banjo & Kazooie did under Microsoft.[Edit] I no longer suggest getting Pac-Man Museum, just get Pac-Man Championship Edition, it's one of the two games from the museum I really recommend, the second being Pac-Man itself."

,Recommended,239720,20739590,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,aps,"After 100% and playing through the whole game twice I think I can finally review it.Short review:It’s a decent and simple 3D platformer that you should probably pick up on sale, but maybe not on the PC mainly because if you do like the game and want to play the sequel then you’ll have to get it on a console since it probably won’t be released on PC. Although this only if you can ignore the ‘new’ Pac-Man.Longer review:Ah what can be said about Pac-Man. A legend to the video game industry? Or maybe one of the most recognizable video game character next to Mario? Well how about a new hip memester? Eh doesn’t sound that great and honestly that is probably the weakest part about this game. It’s just this ‘new’ Pac-Man himself it might just be with my age and not understanding why he burps at the end of each level, but maybe the kids these day will enjoy who he is. If you can ignore the ‘new’ Pac-Man, like I did then you’re in for a treat with this game. 3D platformers are a dying breed in the modern video game industry (2016). So when one comes out I’m always into checking it out and giving a chance mainly because unlike the 90s where 3D platformers were just in for the $$$ sorta like fps these days, 3D platformers create these days seem to be much more polished than ever before. Getting the story out of the way mainly because it’s very simple and I’d expect it from 3D platformer and especially a Pac-Man game. It’s the ‘get the important item before the villain gets it and takes over the world!’ It’s there and each cutscene can be skipped so if you have no care about that then you can easily ignore it. Control wise I should of probably tested how the keyboard and mouse handles, but I didn’t and played through this game with a Xbox 360 controller, controls are great overall. Gameplay is just like any other 3D platformer where you start at point A and try to get to point B. There's a enemies in the way and some type of ability mechanics in there. Ah yes Pac-Man can get abilities examples like fire, ice, metal, meme etc. They’re all fine and control well for the most part although very generic. The worlds also have the same problem as the abilities. They’re all just generic and 1 of them is even repeated. You guy the city, temple, volcano, iceland in the volcano, city again, and sorta volcano again it’s more in the area of hell though. They’re just there and some are longer than others mainly the later worlds where there’s only some a few levels in the world probably the game being rushed, but who knows. The game does bring some challenge which is nice I mean it can’t just be some cake walk. Graphics are acceptable and the music isn’t the most memorable soundtrack out there also if you’re a nazi about ‘muh 60fps’ then you’ll gas this game because it’s locked at 30fps. Now finally to the important question is the game actually fun? Yes it is, there isn’t some type of collect a ton aspect to this game, unless you’re going for all the achievements (which I do plan on making a guide for). All the levels aren’t that long and the boss fights aren’t overly frustrating. Like I said before buy this game on sale for <$10. It’s fun and won’t take you that long to finish. Have fun with the ‘new’ Pac-Man!"

But at the same time, it's a game based on a 35 years old game franchise so you would expect seeing something also Pac-Man fans can enjoy.But nope, that's not really the case. Yeah there are some references to the older games, and the gameplay is very similar to Pac-Man World 2, but that's really it. First of all, the game lacks originality. Several gameplay mechanics are heavily inspired from another game (Mostly Super Mario Galaxy), the worlds are generic, the gimmicks are generic, the music is generic, and there's nothing original about it. The camera is also really bad. It always causes problems and it seems like the developers didn't really care to make it work. The game also expects you to watch the show which doesn't have to do anything with any past Pac-Man games. It even lacks any graphics settings, and it runs at 30 FPS. They probably thought children don't care about these, and to be honest they are right.But even though it's very flawed, it works. It's actually kind of fun. There's nothing terribly wrong or broken about it, it's just generic. The graphics are colorful and pleasing to look at as well.So if you're older than 13, don't waste your time with this. Since there's nothing unique, there's nothing to miss about it."

The only reasons why people bash this game is because:-It's based off the crappy cartoon on DisneyXD-It's apparently a ripoff of Mario (I call bullcrap)-And the 30fps limit, which really isn't that big of a problem in my opinion.Don't listen to these people. This is a good game. The only issues I have with it are:-The story assumes that you've seen the show, and you know who all the characters are, why PAC-MAN is friends with Inky Blinky Pinky and Clyde, etc...-A lot of the platforming gimics in this game have been used before-And chomping ghosts can get a little repetetive sometimes (it also brings back bad memories of PAC-MAN World 3's beat 'em up gameplay)As for the price? Well, I definitely don't think it's worth $20. Buy the game when it's on sale. You'll regret buying this game at full price. :P"
