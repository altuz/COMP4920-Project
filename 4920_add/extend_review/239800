76561198080219230,Recommended,239800,10679993,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Phaser,"This game is sweet!Some might ask: Is the game as awesome as the trailer wants us to believe? Yes, every bit of it, BUT it's one of the shortest games I have ever played. To me, it is satisfying enough to maintain a decent replay value. On normal difficulty I would say that you might need an hour to finish the game from the beginning to the end. This game has rather poor animations and colour depth, but a nice retro soundtrack and excellent gameplay. If you need a challenge willing to revisit the game on it's hardest difficulty, then the sweet gameplay is all you need. If you're not the kind of person who enjoys playing the same levels multiple times, then you probably should stay away from it.This sidescrolling action platformer contains only seven short levels with a lot of mini bosses and of course an end boss in each level. The bosses are this game's highlights. In fact, you will spend more time fighting them than fighting through the levels. None of the difficulty settings are really hard and you probably will not be frustrated at all when playing the story mode, because of its MANY check/spawn points. On the other hand you will unlock the challenging arcade mode after you completed the game once.In order to achieve 100% completion you have to beat the arcade mode on the hardest difficulty level, which is one of the most difficult tasks I have ever encountered. The game itself has an extremely stylish gameplay. There are no excuses to hide behind. Just you, the game and a 100% skill. I played it using a gamepad and have to say that there's nothing to complain about the controls. It is responsive, fast and it makes you feel like a blockbuster hero."

In this game there no time to slow down and no time to reload as your placed in a various fast paced levels with a large arsenal of weapons to your disposal. You play as young girl name Wyrn, a  person with high ambitions, mass array of weapons, and a great personality to top it all off. And her goal is to become the greatest hero of all time! And be placed in the hall of heroes.Each level is different than the last from the middle of earth’s crust to the circulatory system of a dragon you’ll be there to show how much of a badass you are. With different unique but yet challenging bosses and minibosses you come across each level really makes the game charming. This game reminds me a lot of the old Megaman games and I wouldn't be surprised that’s where they got their idea of the menu screen from.The story of the game got me hooked in an instant as it felt that I could relate from her ambition of becoming a superhero... really who never wanted to become a superhero before. However storyline flew right past me when it came to how short it took from the first mission to the last.Bleed is a really fun while it lasted, but it still is a great game with its great design, several of stages and bosses, and incredibly fun storyline.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxLIlo5ICyI"
76561198019205444,Recommended,239800,13507997,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,sitebender,"Bleed is a 2D dual stick shooting platformer with an interesting mechanic that slows down time for a brief moment. You play as Wryn, who can jump wryth the left thumb stick, shoot in any direction with the wryght thumbstick, change between two wrypeans, slow time with the left rigger and jump with the wryght trigger. When she jumps, she can aim jump two or three more times in mid air. So you can jump to the left, then aim her to launch herself right, while shooting left, then air jump up all without hitting the ground. She can even jump off walls, but it seems more like a visual aide than a mechanic. The game has a fast pace. There are speedy bullets, bosses and hazards raining down, the slow time mechanic becomes an easy way to deal with it all.Wryn is out to become the #1 hero! So she's got a hit list to kill all the other heroes and work her way to the top of the list! By top I mean bottom! The #1 hero gets revealed at the bottom of the list. These heroes are all bosses. After each death she'll comment things like, ""Don't worry its just a game, I'll be back in a sec,"" ""Do you have an older brother that can play this part, maybe?"" Bleed hits you over the head that its a game, such as hoping you can achieve your dreams for helping her achieve hers.You go through the game unlocking all seven levels to play. Each level has a completely different theme. A dark mansion, an underground cavern, inside of a dragon and so on. Different levels have different elements, such as getting trapped in a giant apple and forced to get through the top to the bottom of the screen before the apple drops to the next screen. Others like having to evade sensors or time jumps to avoid lasers that warm up and fire.  The bosses are giant and diverse. Everything from bosses that split when shot, to a girl with a giant pink kitten car to mechanical orbs that shield themselves. The bosses are where most of the lives get lost. You need to make use of the slow time to survive and drain their health meters. Every boss has a wide array of attacks. The patterns seem random, which is great. Every level has more than one boss and I can tell a lot of work went into them.There is a good variety of enemies. They change from level to level and fit the theme of each level without being reskins. Cats hopping around, soldiers that ride trains and get hit by tunnels, worms that burro then leap to shoot at you. The levels are fun and there are frequent checkpoints each time you leave an area. Its a nice quick game without much challenge. Its the dual stick, and dual triggers that make it tough at first. It gets a lot easier.When you select a level, you chose one of four difficulties, so you can always go back and play harder difficulties. Between the levels, you can visit the store to buy extra weapons. The default dual pistols are good enough and killing everything with a quick stream of bullets. The default rocket launcher does more damage, but has a slower shooting speed. There is also a revolver, homing missiles, a flame thrower and a short range shotgun to buy. While you only need two weapons if not just one, you can pause the game to equip 2 others. Why equip them when the two bumpers work well enough?Bleed isn't a one hit death game. You have plenty of energy, but there is no way to get more energy. Your slow time bar will regenerate over time depending on the character. Both can even get upgraded in the store, as well as the regeneration speed.With all that said, the game is an hour long at least on normal (medium) difficulty. There are extras like arcade mode, that is more like a YOLO where you only get once life and need to complete the game from start to finish. I always thought an arcade would give you three lives. You can unlock different characters to play as. Finally there's a boss attack challenge mode that can put three bosses on your screen at once. Its all just extra fluff. $5 is the right price for it.Judging from the fan art, there are people that love this game or its protagonist. Looking at the lack of accomplished achievements, means there are a lot of others that don't."

The game is worth every penny and more, the only possible reasoning I can see to the game being 5$ is that there is not a *ton* of content, but, it still has a full game feel to it via stages, story / introductions to stages, and an ending that can move some people to tears, in a good way. <3Not only that, but it has a difficulty setting for any level of player, from the more casual player, all the way down to hardcore players who enjoy the stress of an Arcade mode playthrough set on V.Hard that could make them rage and *still* have a good time.No matter the difficulty setting, you aren't robbed of the game's wonderful ending and beautiful message it has, so I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers as this title has a refreshing twist on bullet time and mobility.  This game truly feels unique and has the kind of game play I've not found anywhere else.And with a second coming of the soon-to-be Bleed series in the works ... I would recommend this game to get hyped for it!!!  Also, did I mention that the game's creator, Ian Campbell, single handedly made this piece of art?That guy is a total baws!

The controls feel very intuitive, and the learning curve is pretty simple, despite the length of the game. Which bring me to another point:This is a short game. All of the chapters can be beaten in a bit over an hour on a first run. However, it does include a couple modes of gameplay, one of which required you to beat the entire game in one run, on one life. I have yet to accomplish this.There is also a co-op mode, which simply puts two characters through the same levels together. While this definitely feels neat, the screen panning could've been handled better, but it is pretty cool to see what new strategies emerge simply with the addition of another player.All in all, this was an enjoyable experience, albeit short. if you have the couple bucks to drop, I'd consider giving it a play."

Game is polished, the mechanics are tight, the bosses are fantastic, and some of them get extra attacks on harder difficulties. The movement is SO good, you always feel like you're in control (except for the occassional ""walljump when I wanted to airdash"", but you can disable walljumping (dunno why you'd want to, it has its uses)) and every single attack is decently telegraphed, and even when you're caught by surprise you can slow time and dash away and make it look like you meant to do that.If you like skillful play like contorting an air dash to weave through bullets in slow motion while destroying the homing rockets coming your way, I don't think you can go wrong with this game.It is REALLY short but for 5 bucks you're getting possibly the most concentrated, no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, action run n gun with slow motion.

76561198112750875,Recommended,239800,32918696,Posted: 28 June,all,UnWeonMas,"It's kind of weird for me to review this game. I'll start with the cons. My major ""complaint"" is how hard it was for me to get used to the mechanics, three dash-jumps from start + slowmo was a lot to get used to, and if you're like me and decide to start the game on hard you're probably not gonna have a great time on the first level... And that first level is 1/7 of the game, which takes me to the next point: the game is really short, like, 40 minutes short, it ends when you're finally getting the hang of the controls.Now, the reason I find hard to review this is cause those cons are also pros. The game is short, but no two parts are the same and every section in every level is filled up with new content and mechanics. The controls feel weird at first but HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥it's awesome to use the slow-mo to dodge two bullets, change weapon in mid air to hit that third one with the katana, make a few wall jumps get height and dash above those enemies, change to rocket launcher again without even touching the ground once and... You get it, it's fun.To me, what makes the game is its replayability, and I'm sad cause I know not many people are into that. Each level has 4 difficulties with actual variations in them (different boss patterns, enemy placement, etc), and if you think finishing a level is fun, try finishing a level on v. hard without dying. It feels so rewarding when you know the layout and just how to use your abilities properly.This review is already a mess and I haven't mentioned most of the stuff, so: graphics look cool, music is fine, story is almost non existent (still charming and the two dialogues are... good, I guess?) and everything feels made up with so much love. When you die, for example, Wryn says different stuff in different stages, that alone shows you how much attention they put into this little game.Currently I have just a few hours, but I *WILL* finish everything on v. hard.TL;DR: the game gets its awesomeness from replaying and learning the stages, so if that's not your thing, it's probably just gonna have twenty minutes of gameplay."

After 10 minutes I got used to the game pad controls and trust me, the controls are so tight that you can develop a very high level of skill in this game.The game will force you to pay high attention to evading a huge amount of projectiles flying at you and by making good use of the rechargeable bullet time (slo mo moments) you will be amazed by what crazy situations you can get out of. This is where my heart starts to beat really fast and I just think ""did I just... omg... holy sh*t... I don't even..."" The Boss fight are very hard and fair and a challenge mode lets you play against most bosses quickly without playing the level (even 3 at a time, good for short sessions).  Story mode gives you unlimited continuous and lots of checkpoints. Arcade mode lets you play the whole game in one life and damn, it was probably the most satisfying moment in my gaming life to beat the final boss with my minimum health.there are 7 levels and 4 difficulties with 12 unique boss fights.Controls:I do recommend to play this with an xbox360 Controller (native support).Left stick to move. right stick to aim (and automatically shoot with infinite ammo)LT (hold) activate slo mo. RT jump + dash up to 3 times per jump in any direction.with dashes and slo mo you can wiggle your way out of many situations.The Bad:- Local multi player is not awesome but it makes the game harder since both drain the same slo mo time and the camera only follows one person. I guess it was experimental.- Also the story is just there to justify the scenes. Don't expect too much there.- Semi Automatic weapons are not good for the game pad. This could be fixed by a laser pointer (do it plz)- It is short, but considering that this is a one man dev team game for 5 bucks it is still awesome.If you like the above mentioned games, then you can be sure that bleed will give you a nice gameplay experience."

If you are a fan of plat formers, Max Payne, or both; then Bleed is a love letter to you. It takes the simple idea of a twin stick shooter, turns it into a platformer, and gives it you in the most fun way possible.

,Recommended,239800,1547320,"Posted: 27 July, 2013",all,noibn,"Bleed is another one of these modern-day hard-core 2D action-platformers that seem to be all the rage lately. But don't take that as a knock on it. It's actually a really well-made game with some unique elements to it. The primary story mode is comprised of 7 levels, each of which feature a sub-boss, a final boss, and some steep challenges in between. The gameplay is typical fare (jump and shoot), but with some interesting twists. The most notable thing is the shooting mechanic, which is done is the style of twin-stick shooters (shoot in 360 degrees via the mouse or right-thumbstick). Jumping is another key mechanic with a twist - you can jump up to three times, but the jumps are more like dashes in specific directions. So you have to perform the moves with precision and forethought. The final game mechanic is ""bullet time"", in which the action slows down to a crawl, allowing you to perform crazy dodges, super-precise maneuvers, or get more shots in on bosses. In between levels, you can also buy various upgrades (new weapons, more health, etc) using points you earn by clearing levels (performing well earns more points). The controls are spot-on and the game is very forgiving, having no major penalty for death (at least in the story mode). This allows anyone to eventually be able to beat it if they are persistent enough. Bleed can be completed in around an hour or two at most on normal difficulty (and probably much less if you are really good), so it's not very long, no matter how you slice it. Replay value and longevity comes in the form of higher difficulty levels and an ""arcade mode"", which tasks you to beat the game with just 1 life (good luck with that!). For those who are into brutal challenges and high scores, there's probably enough here to justify a purchase. But if you're like me, and are now ""way too old for that♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, it's maybe less so of a no-brainer (though I felt it was worth it, regardless). So I would say base your decision on that... If you are into tough platformers and welcome a challenge, this is well worth the money. But if you're more of a casual fan of the genre, take into account the short length for basic completion and decide whether 5 bucks is worth a couple of hours of fun. Overall, the game is solid and has some pretty cool things going for it, so I say it's worth it, but YMMV... I give it a solid B.Technical notes: I played the game with a gamepad and it worked fine, though it did take me quite a while to wrap my head around the control scheme, which is quite unusual for games like this (left and right sticks for movement and shooting, left and right triggers for bullet-time and jumping). In retrospect, I realize it probably would have been easier to control via mouse and keyboard, due to the precision aiming a mouse provides. I just went with gamepad out of habit for this type of game, without thinking. Both methods definitely work, but this is one of those rare cases where I don't necessarily recommend having a gamepad in order to buy the game. I think it should probably be just fine, if not better, with keyboard and mouse controls only, if that's all you have."

It has a great and very distinct art style, very catchy and upbeat music, a funny twist on the standard plot, great control, and a unique and memorable main character. The overall tone is somewhat cutesy, but rather than hindering the game, it gives Bleed a funny and uplifting tone that is oddly in contrast to all the shooting you're doing. I beat the normal game in about an hour and a half on normal difficulty, but there are also options for coop mode (as yet untried), hard mode, and very hard mode. The controls are extremely good, it has customizable options, and it runs very smoothly. It has some interesting weapons that you can unlock by purchasing with points at the in-game store, as well as extra health and time-slowdown energy.Some people will say the normal mode is extremely hard; don't be fooled, I think people are making it out to be worse than it really is. What kept me playing was the good level design, unique enemies, brevity of the levels, interesting boss battles, and the infinite continues. The game may be difficult (there are some incredibly tough sections, most notably in level 6) but it is incredibly forgiving and very fair. You just have to push yourself through to the next screen and you'll start from there if you die.I only have two minor gripes with the game. The first is that level 6 begins with an auto-scrolling section with some difficult platforming that the game had never introduced before; I would've preferred a section that introduced the difficult terrain management before the auto-scrolling screen kills you. The other gripe is that level 6 also has a section where you have to try and dodge seemingly infinite bubbles that are constantly in your way; it's a bit like jumping into the ocean and trying to not get wet.Other than these two sticking points, my only other suggestion for improvement is MORE CUTSCENES! The characters and plot were great, and the main character Wryn's dialogue was very funny and full of personality! She really had spunk, although it was definitely not overdone, and I loved to see that because she felt like a real person. It really felt like the developer made this character effortlessly, so mad props to the dev for a character more memorable than any I've played in a long time, even in big budget games. I wanted to see and hear more of her between each stage, or at least every other stage. The plot is quite funny and the ending was comedically unexpected but satisfying. I only wish it had lasted longer; the main game is unfortunately short. But I hope to see more from this developer, especially a Bleed 2. :)Bleed is kid-friendly but the level of difficulty may be a bit high. Replay value is somewhat ""eh"" but I'm sure kids could get a more than a few hours of enjoyment out of it."

I bought it expecting something simple only as a way to pass the time - fun but ultimately forgettable. It's way better than that.I'm not exactly good at videogames, and there were times I thought I wouldn't handle the normal difficulty, so I changed it back to easy (eventually I managed beat the game in Normal as well). By doing that I realized the creator didn't only changed enemy hp, player hp or damage. The number of enemies, of attacks, it was all specifically tailored for each difficult. It's a level of effort many don't go through, and it's a great aspect of the game.This aspect of the game is a part of one of the biggest qualities: the level design is excellent. There is a lot of variety in the ways you utilize the mechanics, the encounters are well planned and each level gives a distinct experience, with a smooth increase in difficulty.The bosses are the greatest part for me, though. Each one is different and interesting, and finding the weapons that would work best and how to react to the patterns was a great experience. I died a lot, but it was far from frustating.Bleed is really how a 2D plataformer should be done. It's on the short side, sure, but it's also very cheap.

I quite liked the concept of a thruster pack, and the manoverabillity and controlls were great. As far as the level design goes, I was impressed by what they had, but I also wanted more. If I had to state one flaw with this game it would be that it is too short. Fun, but short. This being said, if you are the type of person who finds replay value in increasing the difficulty of a given level-- you may absolutly love this game. Personally, I was impressed with its mechanics, but I felt like it needed more content. As a game, I would recomend it to you if you have excess money to spend.Here's just one more thing to think about with this game: it is well-designed. I am a part of a game-creation/game-theory club at my school, and I have tasked myself to find well-designed games like ShovelKnight. This game, while it may be lacking in content, provides a good refference to game design in that the levels and mechanics are well-developed. The ideas in this game are great, even if it is short.On the whole, I would give this 7/10 for gameplay and enjoyment, and a 8.5/10 if you're looking for good ideas and design in a game."

You can get stuck in certain situations and end up dying, example would be a constantly spawning enemies that aren't really enemies but can hit you into spikes and keep you there until you die.

In this sense Bleed really uses the bullet time well with it being a bullet hell shoot and having a triple dash ability making the tiniest gap in the projectiles an escape route. The levels a really well designed making a good difficulty curve, this however brings me the flaw of the game which is the length. I kid you not when I say there are seven levels in total and each one is quite short (6-10 mins), there is increased difficulty, arcade mode and alternate character that try to extend the length but the game remains short. There are a few other problems with the game like the fact that the upgrade systems is largely useless the soundtrack while nice is really short and repeats a lot.

You start with Dual Pistols and a Rocket Launcher for the early stages but you can acquire 10 more from the shop or by beating the game on a certain difficulty.You can dash in the air up to 3 times which allows for rapid movement, positioning and general movement which makes getting through every stage a blast, you also have an action meter, which when used can activate bullet time to precisely land bullets or dodge and wave through theirs.You have 4 difficulties to choose from (Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard) which all change enemy positions, boss attacks etc.It took me around 70-80 minutes to complete the story campaign on Normal difficulty the first time, so don't expect a super long campaign.There are 2 other variants on gameplay though besides characters, you can play challenge mode which lets you choose/ random from any 3 bosses in the game and fight them all at the same time for fun, or you can attempt to go through Arcade Mode, which is every stage back to back with no health refills or anything, it can get pretty damn hard when it wants to as well, especially in the later difficulties.Soundtrack is pretty good too.Although short, it's a fantastic game, if you're into Score Attacking or overcoming some pretty difficult challenges you'll probably get your money's worth there.Also goes on sale real cheap sometimes so definitely pick it up then, you won't regret it!"

You play as Wryn, a pink haired videogame heroine wannabe on a quest to dodge, dash, jump, and shoot herself towards the title of Gretest Hero of All Time. At her disposal she has an arsenal of weapons, a triple jump, and the ability to slow down time. You think you've seen bullet-time done right? You've seen nothing until you've tried this game! I cannot describe with words how incredibly satisfying it feels to air-dash your way, in slow motion, through the one small gap in a wall of bullets (very hard-mode) while maintaining your combo-meter for maximum damage.But let's not be completely biased here. Many players will probably be upset by the fact that this is a really short game. Like areallyshort game. To make your way through the seven levels on normal will take you about an hour. To get through hard might be another hour or so and after that the same goes for very hard. There are ofcourse some extras like arcade and challenge mode but the main bulk of the game is easily beaten in an evening.The weapon unlocks also seem pretty useless, I stuck with the starting weapons through most of my playthrough on both normal and hard as I saw almost no reason to switch weapons during any stage or boss fight.That said tho, this is a really, really fun game and I will probably end up spending more hours just replaying this than in most $20+ games I've bought.Pick this up if you're:A fan of fast-paced, skill based combat.An old-school gamer with too little time for those 40+ hour AAA titlesA speedrunner.

I keep holding “left” when pressing the jump button, intending to go “up and left” – as it would work in a traditional platformer. But, in this case, holding “left” while jumping moves the character directly to the left, and right into the wall.-Overall I find the game to be very difficult on Easy mode. In level 2 there is a sequence that requires jumping through falling debris that I find very challenging. This game (at least so far) appears to have no health pickups, although there are ample checkpoints.This creator is working hard on creating great games... support him!"

Another key element to the mechanics is the implementation of a Bullet-Time (aka slow-mo) mode where you can slow down everything for a limited amount of time. This ability gets recharged automatically after a few seconds.The controls are sharp and the game look alright. I wasn't really a fan of the presentation, it seemed like a 5 year old could create more innovative enemies and characters for the game but hey, it didn't bother me as much. Be warned that the game gets Tough and you'll die over and over again in order to progress but the levels are pretty short and there are checkpoints spread throughout in reasonably good places so don't worry about trial and error. Some bosses are pretty challenging indeed.I played with keyboard+mouse and it worked as it should but I can see that playing with a controller would be fine too.You get to purchase new weapons between levels but I found myself pretty fine with the standard dual guns+rocket launcher loadout.You can finish the game in roughly 2 hours or so and there's an Arcade mode to compete for high scores a boss challenge mode as well as 3 additional characters (read: skins) to play with but other than that, I wasn't really compelled to play this game any more than beating the story mode (there are 4 difficulties in all).To be quite honest, I can't call this a bad game but there's nothing that special about it either. It's a great bargain at sales but don't pay full price! I don't want to give this game neither a thumbs up nor down but since it is very much playable, occassionally fun but bland through and through, a MARGINAL THUMBS UP will do."

After playing the first levels I quickly got the hang of it and could enjoy the game even more.I also like the challenge when you play through the game for the first time.Also: I don't know why but I kinda didn't notice the ingame shop. This resulted in me playing through the game on hard without any items, which was of course much more challenging than playing with items, but since I like difficult games (especially platformers) I don't regret not buying anything.The gameplay and the bosses remind me of Megaman, and I think this game is pretty much on the same level as Megaman 2 (the only Mega Man game I've played *cough*) when it comes to having fun playing the game.All in all:pros:The controls are really smooth and once you get the hang of them you really start to enjoy this game.Really well designed stages and bossesThe various game modes are also super fun to play if you want the extra challenge. (Arcade mode and challenge mode)The difficulty settingsThe 16bit+ graphics look really niceneutral:The music. It's clearly not bad, but it's also not something that gets stuck in your ears easily (unlike cave story or Mega Man)The story: Honestly: it's a platformer, it doesn't need to have a great story. The great humour makes up for it though.cons:It could be a little bit longer. If you're fast, you can play through this game in about 1 hour (I have also seen some speedrunners getting <15 minutes) . Honestly, this is not a huge flaw, the games is still fun to play.If I had to give this game a score, I would give it an 8/10.All in all it's a really nice fast paced game. Was really frun to play.

Wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it is really an A rating for the gameplay and polish.  You feel like a badass.  It's not overly difficult, and even less so because it has very generous and painless checkpoints, so you do have some punishment, but not much.  You can play the insanely difficult 1 life for the enitre game mode if you want, but I think you have to beat the game first.  You almost certainly want to use a game controller to play this.  I'd guess it's frustrating without one.The downside, it's got no voice acting if you really care, but the main thing is that it's short.  Really short.  Really, really short.  I beat the game and played a few challenges in 2 hours.  For the full price, it's really only worth it if you're the type who likes to play a good mechanic repeatedly on a few bosses and characters to become perfect.

Even the death screens are friendly and encouraging (not to mention varied enough so you won't get sick of the same Game Over screen too much).A lot of folks have commented on how short the game is; I'd personally use the word ""concise"". It gets done what it's after in a timely manner, and adding too much more would just feel like padding. Same goes for story: the game gives you just enough so that you know what your character is up to, then takes a step back and lets the gameplay take center stage until the final act.All in all, this is a really awesome game, with a nice balance of challenge, fairness, and character.

And you can only get it into windowed mode at all via steam launch options.  How is it that it's 2015 and we still get a bunch of developers who refuse to have a native windowed mode? It's especially bad for this game, as the graphics look absolutely atrocious in fullscreen, which ruins what are otherwise really nicely done sprites.  Now that I think of it, when I tried to alt-tab out of it while it was in fullscreen, it crashed, so as far as I can tell, windowed or not, your desktop is more or less unusable while you're playing.Anyway, cool game, but the crashing and poor interaction with the desktop make it too much of a hassle to bother learning to deal with the control issues."

,Recommended,239800,18015696,"Posted: 13 September, 2015",all,Love💋,"A super short indie pixel plattformer with shooter elements. We follow Wryn, a young pink haired girl who wants to become the greatest hero ever. Doing so, she must first eliminate the top list of the greatest heros of all time, which include a fat purple blob, a robot ball, worms and so on. That is basically the story in this case, nothing more, nothing less. I was kinda let down finding this out, but considering the games overall lenght, it was kinda predictable in the end. Must mean, the game focuses more in terms of gameplay. Well, sorta.Basically, you use the mouse to aim your guns, the WASD keys to move and space to jump, standard stuff. However, you also have a ""bullettime"" button on Shift, a very useful tool in this game. The game slows down, also zooms in on the character a bit but still letting you see alot whats going on around you, which is very usefull since the game tends to throw dozens of projectiles at once at you. Wryn also is capable of a ""triple dash"", which you can perform after jumping and is used for dodging. Combined with her wall jumps (wich work very well in my opinion) this can lead to some pretty tricky maneuvers and helps keeping the game fast paced (even with bullet time, which can be drained very easily).As for the guns, i found most of them not that usefull to downright completely useless, and usually stuck with the standard dual machine guns and the flame thrower. Because of that, anything that wasn't these two weapons, felt really unsatisfying and unhandy to use.Difficulty wise this game is ok. Normal is what you expect. In Story mode if you die in a stage, you usually just respawn earlier in the stage, with some Point loss i believe. Wryn isn't really robust but she still can take a few hits, so it's fair in my book if you take the overall gameplay in retrospectiv.The graphics were my biggest dislike about the game. I just can't stand these sprites. Wryn and her rival look atrocious, enemies and bosses look basic as hell and the overall looks of the levels don't impress me either. As for the level design itself, it's average. They are all fairly short, most of the time containing a mini boss, an element new to the prior stages and (of course) a different theme. For what they are doing they are alright, allthough they had no real depth to it, which i missed highly here.It is difficult to say how i really felt the entirety of this game. Some part of me enjoyed it, some other part thought it was pretty dull and the most mediocre thing in a long while, lack of story didn't help either.I guess for that price it is an ok game. Next to the Story mode there is also an Arcade mode, some things to unlock and a boss battle mode, so there should be more time after. If you are fan of Jumpers with shooting elements give it a go. or stick to better alternatives. Like Metal Slug. Yes."
,Recommended,239800,20461075,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,SteemBoy80,"When I started using bullet time in addition to my guns, Bleed became much more enjoyable. The game moves too fast for you to run and gun like you can in other platformers of this sort. You have to employ bullet time in order to survive, even if you already possess lightning-fast reflexes. The gameplay was frustrating at first, especially with the combination of the right trigger to jump and the right stick to shoot, but after a little while the controls began to feel just right. Having the left trigger's bullet time compliment the right trigger's multi-jump was definitely a good move on the part of the developer.In addition, there's reason to play the smallish number of levels over and over again when you earn points that can be spent on health and bullet time upgrades as well as new weapons. And the greater the difficulty setting, the greater the points you earn. So there's every reason to want to complete each stage on V. Hard. And the graphics and soundtrack are top notch, too.So what are you waiting for? Go get yourself a copy... or borrow some playtime with Bleed from a friend's account. It's time and money worth spending."

,Recommended,239800,5562998,"Posted: 26 September, 2013",all,DAMIENX88,"First of all it's not tiny in terms of gameplay time. I personally put in more than 25 hours into it. But it's not for a single playthrough. I have to mention though that there are only 7 levels broken up into smaller sections. I played some levels many times. But more on that later. Let's start with what this game is about.This is a fast-paced 2D side scroller with a lot of weapons, awesome game mechanics, variety of enemies and it requires some skill to complete it. There are numerous achievements to unlock some of which require hard training. Others are surprisingly simple but require you to read the description of the achievement to get the idea of how to unlock it. As for the graphics there's not much to say but it's nice and pretty in its own way and the art style is consistent and corresponds to game's theme.This game is about a girl which I appreciate because I like games with female protagonist. So this girl wants to be a hero but there are some heroes already and her task is to defeat them and become the best hero of all times. She got herself a list of those heroes and set to work. And to 'work' your way through you'll need weapons a lot of weapons. And you'll be able to unlock more of those as you progress. I personally was able to find something to match my playstyle and you can switch between weapons which is very handy when it turns out that in order to beat a boss you need a different gun. But that is not to say that you can beat the boss only with a certain gun. It's just that for some players in some cases one is better than the other. But I found the double pistols more than enough in most cases.But this game in not just about the guns it's also about stylish and acrobatic combat. And that is probably what won me over right away. Once I got into first level I tried it and I was amazed and felt very cool. And being stylish also allows you to increase the rank up to an S-Rank. And that's what made this game even more entertaining. To keep your rank at high level you need to keep shooting and being stylish. Not to mention that having that rank up during boss fights is what gets you majority of the achievements. So I haven' talked about how exactly you're getting stylish, have I? You can boost yourself and fly through the air for a short period of time and then do it again. So it's a bit of Matrix-style there. This gameplay mechanic is very important because it allows you to dodge projectiles, avoid being hit by enemies, escape certain death when you're about to fall into a pit after being hit and more.Now that we've talked about the variety of guns let's talk about variety of enemies. And there are many different ones and they don't feel repetitive. But you may find some of them being similar when they're trying to match or rather to give you a sense of what the boss is going to be like. There are mini bosses as well which I appreciate because they do a great job of preparing me for a boss battle. So when I meet the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my reflexes are ready and I already trained my projectile-avoiding skills. And speaking of bosses they're very fun to deal with and give you sense of achievement.So what else did I do to keep myself entertained? I played it 3 more times so I beat it on every difficulty level. Which didn't seem impossible in contrast with other games where  very hard means that you only do it if you spend entire year training. But maybe it just me when it comes to some games. But again, in this case it felt very hard but not harder. I haven't tried it in arcade mode even on easy and I don't really feel like I'm going to because I died to many times. However I may fancy that one day.At this point you'd expect some sort of conclusion and there it is. I conclude that this game is awesome and bring joy to your everyday life by being crazy fast, fun and balanced. You can argue that it's too short and I may agree with you.

,Recommended,239800,224151,"Posted: 8 September, 2013",all,d.Tox508,"Bleed is an action packed shoot em up indie platformer sacrificed in hell and resurrected in heaven by Jesus himself. This game by developer Ian Campbell brings incredible gameplay with illustrious graphics to another level where it kicks you off the edge whispering into your ear “don’t die.” With these words of wisdom ringing in your mind you pick up the controller and begin one of the toughest fights of your life.Its games like Bleed that from the moment you watch the trailer you know that it isn’t too far from your hard drive. Unlike many of those games on that hard drive, Bleed sets itself aside from others of its genre with several different elements such as the ability to slow time at the touch of a button. Bleed also leaves a lot of the main characters abilities and stats up to you, this is done through the shop that you are able to visit prior to each level. During each level, you are graded depending on how creative you are with your gameplay, and awarded coins conducive to the grade achieved at the end. These coins are what are used to purchase each upgrade and are vital to this game’s progression.The heroine of this game is Wryn, a girl with a big dreams and an even bigger arsenal. Your goal as Wryn is to become the ultimate video game hero, and in an action packed bid to claim the title for herself, she must take down the greatest heroes of all time. Bleed is focused on stylish, acrobatic dodging and fluid, challenging gameplay, where Wryn will have to use those abilities to kill hordes of enemies, endure backbreaking obstacles and overpower inventive bosses. Her bitter sarcasm after every tragic death leaves you with a personal vendetta against each level, not to mention a bruised ego.I give this game 5 broken controllers, because even on the easiest difficulty setting Bleed is more challenging than prying the crack pipe out of Whitney Houstons cold dead lips. The weaponry in Bleed focuses around heavy artillery, starting you off with twin guns and a rocket launcher. By gaining coins throughout each level you can buy new weapons such as a flamethrower or even remote mines. No need to worry about bullets, Wryn seems to have an extended clip with more rounds than the hero of your favorite 80′s cop film. Bleed is fast paced, combined with an intuitive sense of time along with an attention to aiming making gameplay one of a kind.Offering an EXTRAS option in the main menu extends gameplay making Bleed’s replay value higher than most. With two different modes, Arcade & Challenge, Arcade Mode can be unlocked by beating the story mode, and Challenge Mode consists of fighting bosses complete with your choice of arena. Bleed has a multiplayer option that is available anytime during the Story Mode of the single player campaign as well. Two times the power can sometimes be a burden if you can’t keep up, but also provides the effectiveness needed to complete your objective. Also, each different level is replayable in whatever difficulty may suit you. This way you are able to purchase each of the upgrades and fully experience the game, taking down anything that may come in your path.After playing the demo and then buying the game during the Steam summer sale, in true Bleed fashion I give it a B+. Bleed catches the eye, paired with addictive gameplay and intuitive dynamics it is destined for success. Although a tough one, this game is a joy to play and even better with friends. Endless creativity at your thumbs, there isn’t a bad thing I can think of when it comes to Bleed. Needless to say, the game is beautifully designed and creativity “bleeds” out of every scene, making this game well worth the buy.Graphics: 7/10Playability: 7/10Story: 5/10Challenge: 9/10Replay Value: 7/10"

So that's it for the story, but you would only play it for the gameplay of course!As a bulletstorm you'll need to move fast and hit things as fast as you can. The level design is very well built with so many traps, different situations and are well-paced. Enemies don't vary much but they do the job and the bosses smash you to pieces! You can only carry two weapons at a time but in-game you can switch to another set but it's annoying that I can't simply change weapons with the number buttons. This is a PC game, you shouldn't go through this trouble of the two-weapon system.  Many of the weapons are generic, however, they're fun to use nonetheless.Once you finish this short game, you can replay the different locked characters and difficulty modes. The difficulty modes in this games don't just make the characters harder to kill, they change the spawning and the behaviour of the AI. This is how games should differ their difficulty modes, not just making the enemies bullet-spongy.The score system is nothing new but it's good. The more you kill, the higher is the classification level. Try not to die so many times and also don't suck! When you finish a level, use the points you got to buy linear and uninteresting upgrades.Bleed has a pixel cartoony artstyle which I  very much like. The colours are very livid and are enjoyable to see.In conclusion, for a small duration and fun arcade game, Bleed does the job very well and I recommend it!"

But BLEED is the only game in my opinion which really feels like a good old NES game. Actually I'm really young and I haven't played NES games when the console was new but I played a descent amount of NES games later(over 50 titels). And BLEED really captures the felling of playing an old hard Game. It's kinda like METAL SLUG but with bullet time and dashing. Some enemies really require you to dash through the air to beat them. And slowing the time down is also a must if you don't want to get hit. This game has a really great 32BIT estatic and also has an very cheerful chiptune soundtrack. It manages to feel retro and kinda new at the same time.And if you really wanna have the difficuilty like an old NES game play it on hard on arcade mode(no continues). The only complaint I have is that it's rather short but I mean NES games also have only 6 levels or so ;D8/10

The two standout features are a triple jump/dash and the ability to slow time. The combination of these features makes for some pretty fun and crazy times. Imagine a dozen or so bullets are flying your way, all from different angles, and you jump in the air, slow time, dash to the right and curve up, and then dash down and back to the left, all while dodging the bullets. Pretty intense.There are four difficulty levels. Normal is pretty challenging, but it's the perfect way to get used to the game's mechanics. The real fun (and frustration) is at the hard and very hard difficulties. That said, it's short. Only 7 levels long. I think I've spent about 6 hours total on it, and I've done everything but clear arcade mode beyond easy. More levels would make the game even better. Really, my only other gripe with the game is that the achievements do not always trigger, even when you accomplish something like beating a boss with an S Rank."

I think that infinitely spawning enemies/obstacles are bad game design, and this game uses this a lot (especially on very hard).  It requires practice and learning boss tells to finish.  I think that enemies could telegraph a little better.  There are also a few attacks that I still don't understand how to beat or evade, even though I managed to beat the boss.  That's not ideal.  Still, it's rewarding to win at this game because it's so difficult.  If you are seeking a challenging two-stick shooter, this is a good choice.Also, use a controller.  I never use controllers, but I tried it on this game and it makes the double jump work so much better.  It's harder to aim, though, because instead of just putting your mouse near the thing you're shooting at, you need to manually correct for angles when you jump or move.

I just wish the story mode wasn't so darn short; I finished the story on normal mode in a bit over an hour, and the very hard story mode in not a whole lot longer than that.  When I finished that, all I could think was, ""Dang, that was so much fun!  I wish there was more!!""  Fortunately, there is Challenge Mode, where you can fight up to three bosses at once, and Arcade Mode, where you can try to complete Story Mode with only one life.  Achievement hunting can also add a good chunk of playtime to the game as well.  Another little tiny gripe (if you can call it that) is that it seems the weapon you start with is quite a lot better than all the weapons available at the store, but maybe that's just me.Anyways, at $5.00, I couldn't recommend Bleed more.  Great music and visuals, and outstanding level design, bosses, and controls.  I'm probably biased because I really like platformers in general, but Bleed will probably go down in my book as one of my favorite games of the year.  Well, I don't know.

I used KB/M, and it worked fantastic once I got used to them (only took about one level), so no need for gamepad in my opinion. The actual story is pretty short, but there is a bunch to do after you beat it, including going back and improving your score.My only wish is that the other weapons were more useful. I ended up buying the shotgun and planned to use that most, but the dual pistols given to you at the start were clearly the best weapon available. But maybe that's just my playstyle.The story is also pretty limited, but that's not even an interest of mine when playing games like this.Incredibly fun and fast paced.

It's comparable to megaman in that it's a platform game with shooting and bosses, however there are a lot of big differences. In Bleed you are able to slow time. Now this might not be the most unique mechanic to video games in general but here it completely allows the game designers to be creative and make normal play very challenging, encouraging you to make careful use of the slow time mechanic. The game starts to feel extremely difficult until you realize it's designed around this mechanic, and you start to get better at managing your energy and slowing time during difficult sections or certain moves from bosses. The game is also different in that as I mentioned you shoot using any angle you wish, which again leads to enemies being more creative, more mobile, and generally harder to hit, but because you have the freedom to aim wherever you want this becomes all balanced out.The game itself is flowing with creativity. The levels will surprise you from a moving train to a level that actually rotates while you're moving through it. The levels are designed to be very different and throw you for a loop, hoping for you to slow time to makes things managable. The bosses are also very well done. They have a lot of variety and expect a lot of your attention.Bleed gives you choices in difficulty as well as some RPG elements in terms of upgrading your character and getting new weapons. In playing on the normal difficulty I was challenged but I was still able to beat the game without getting too frustrated. The game is generous with checkpoints which is always a + from me, but it even gives you the option of playing the game in a traditional arcade style with 1 life. The game is a bit short (that might just be because I couldn't get enough) but with the additional modes and difficulties and items you can gather on top of the just overall great feeling I had playing this, it's worth the $5 and a no brainer during a sale.I really enjoyed this game. I hope that the people behind the creative design choices will continue to make games as it is so blatantly obvious that a lot of love and brilliance went into this. I don't really have any complaints, I wish the game was longer so I could experience more from this company.8.5/10"

I find this to be fun cheaper alternative, with the intense joystick gunplay, slow mo mechanic, but to me my favorite assest of the gameplay is the tight and terrific triple jump, with combined with the slow mo and walljumping makes dodging almost as fun as the shooting.It's a pretty simple game, however full of personality from a fun main character; Wyrn, who has fun one-liners. It's a very self-aware meta game. Each level I played so far each have intersting and unique obstacles to give variety and engagment.This is a short game, though I'm not finished the game because I like speedrunning along getting S-Ranks, and grinding to get better stats, so I'm taking my time with the game. If you enjoy Practice gameplay. There's four mode of difficulties, so I'm sure anyone can play easy mode and breeze through the game, however I'm not sure the amount content in the game would be enough for most people, I bought this on a sale, and it's one of the best purchases I got from Steam, though 5 bucks is not that much anyway.I have a few problems with the game, no health packs at all, which it's a bit unfair, your expected to beat the game without dying, I think more than one death lower your score. Though once your max your stats, I'm sure it won't be that difficult, at least on Normal. Also really only Katana feels like a secondary weapon that's useful, I feel the twin pistols is much better than the shotgun and rocket launcher, so I suggest just buy more health and energy upgrades."

If you are lucky, it's fun, if you're not, prepare for an unforgiving bullet hell where you can only take like 5 hits and have only a second of invulnerability and 2/3 of that invulnerability is doing a knockback animation. Unforgiving and luck based but had some moments of fun, mostly annoyance though."
,Recommended,239800,8049639,"Posted: 14 December, 2013",all,A Fancy Fridge Magnet,"This game is extremely refreshing to play, as it stands out from a lot of other games out there. It plays like a twitchy platforming bullet-hell shooter.The controls are a bit weird at first, but manageable as you play more (XBox controller: Left Stick move, Right Stick fire, Right Trigger jump, Left Trigger slow-mo, Left/Right Bumpers toggle between weapons.) If you're in the air you can ""dash"" a few times by hitting jump.  KB/Mouse should work as well. Aiming at things far away is difficult with controller and probably easier with mouse, but the platforming and dodging is probably harder with KB/Mouse. I have no idea, but keep that in mind.So the key to the game is activating slow-motion, and jumping/dashing to dodge projectiles. You have infinite ammo, and can purchase additional weapons using points acquired from playing the game, or unlock weapon variations by beating the game. You only have to manage your health and energy bars, but there are upgrades you can purchase to help out.The game has 7 levels that get progressively harder. The action never stops as you're always fighting between ""screens"" of enemies with mini-bosses and bosses thrown in frequently. A playthrough on normal difficulty took me ~80 minutes. It is extremely easy to die, but there are checkpoints at every new section. There are no lives, so you can beat the game through repetition (think Super Meat Boy.) The more deaths you get, the less points you get, etc.You carry two weapons at a time but can swap out while paused. There are tons of additional weapons to unlock, all with their own style of use, but basic dual pistols are kind of all you need for the majority of the game (although Shotgun helped me a LOT.) There are also additional characters with slight variations in playstyle, but they require beating the game on normal/hard/veryhard.. So if you're dedicated, you can spend a lot of time in this game.I thought this game was awesome and well designed in all categories (except perhaps story :P)... but again, you probably won't like it if you don't enjoy any of the following: twitchy platformers, bullet-hell shooters, dying frequently, playing as a girl."

While the game doesn't have many levels and these levels can be quite short, the game has a decent replay level due to the upgrades that can be purchased, unlockables (that aren't merely just different skins or anything similar to this), a few extra gameplay modes and the different difficulty levels. Difficulty has a big effect on how the game is played - instead of just increasing enemies' quantity, damage and/or resistance, it also change how they behave, and also how some of each level's features work.While the game is easy to play, mastering it by effectively putting the 3 mid-air jumps and the time-slowing ability to use can be both challenging and rewarding.The main issues with the game are the very short story mode and the limited replay value - while upgrades, unlockables and the different difficulties can keep a player going for quite some time with the game, someone looking to just finish the story will find the game incredibly short."

For all the violence you dish out, the game never ceases to feel like it's cheering you on even when it throws the impossible at you. One of the few action games I've played that feels like a hug.That said, the game's learning curve is pretty steep and the strange control setup doesn't help. This is one of the first shooting games I've played where the right trigger is not for your guns but is instead for jumping. Thankfully, there are upgrades and additional weapons to be had that can make the game go a lot smoother.Lastly, my favorite touch was Wryn's comments on if she dies. There are not many but they range from shock to outrage to letting you know that she'll respawn in just a second.

,Not Recommended,239800,13561406,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Professor Badvibes,"The first thing that I believe should be pointed out is that the near entirety of this game was made by one person, with a few others for quality assurance, sound design, etc. While I can appreciate the amount of work it would take for an individual to make a game such as this, I am at first impressed, but then I remember Cave Story, a game made by another individual. Cave Story's composition displays immense amounts of experience and understanding of the craft that Bleed does not. Cave Story, in its original form, is also available to play free of charge, a privilege that Bleed does not, to my knowledge, provide. This is quite ironic to me, since Cave Story feels like a retail-quality game while Bleed feels like a high schooler's B-grade final project.After playing Bleed, I had no clue whatsoever as to why I had it in my wishlist for as long as I did. On the surface, the game looks bland at best. The background art is a few steps above being on the level of placeholders, the main character looks like something an artist in their very early stages of artistic development would draw in their math notebook, and the enemies look like thirty-second doodles with copious amounts of tweening in place of animation. All of these assets are presented in a style popular amongst indie platformers, which is somewhat inspired, if indirectly, by Cave Story, i.e. drawn in a digital paint program, then shrunk down and blown back up again. Despite this, all enemies explode in a high-resolution blood splatter, which is akin to taking a sledgehammer to the game's artstyle. Even if the game's developer was going for simplicity, they failed to take into consideration that simplicity functions best when based on rules of art that this game does not regard.The general style of the game as a whole seems to be more directly inspired by Hotline Miami, as both are ""retro-styled"" games with violent gunplay and twin-stick controls. However, Bleed is more than content with throwing a side-scrolling shooter or two (Megaman X and Super Metroid come to mind) into the stew. This leads to the player having to juggle free, any-directional aiming and platforming, making for a mediocre experience in both regards. One remarkably stupid part of the platforming side is the main character's means of vertical movement. The player is given a quadruple-jump, which combines the directional functionality of Cave Story's Jetpack 2.0 with some of Super Metroid's Space Jump's maneuverability. This is much less fun than it may seem on paper. While the Jetpack 2.0 restricts movement to four directions, and the Space Jump only allows the player one direction that can be adjusted slightly, the quad-jump in Bleed can be used in any of eight directions. The variety of orientations are very hard to justify, as diagonal movement is mostly unneccessary and the momentum from the horizontal jump isn't enough to be helpful.A further ingredient in Bleed's cookbook is Max Payne's bullet time mechanic. While admittedly the most fun part of the game is dodging enemies and shots in slow motion, the novelty wears off as no other mechanics take advantage of it, making it go stale quickly. However, it seems to be almost required in a few situations, the scenario with the helicopter in the game's first level coming to mind. The shots are practically impossible to dodge, since the level is designed with very little cover from the helicopter's highly accurate shots. This leaves the player hiding in very small crevies waiting for their bullet time to recharge.The game's balance is almost as laughable as its presentation. Levels are harbingers of torment despite having checkpoints in between every room. Meanwhile, bosses can be faced with comparatively little effort. One of the game's many plagiarized elements, the style meter, brings this to mind, as reaching a rank above a D only occurs once in a blue moon during levels, while it's to be expected to go as high as an A in bosses.Overall, Bleed feels like a love letter to everything wrong with indie games. The entire experience is bland, the music is forgettable, the art is embarassing, and the gameplay is a chore. Perhaps, wth experience, the developer can one day produce something great, since it is evident that this is a very early attempt at a fully-fledged video game."

,Recommended,239800,17427271,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,Ergaster,"Bleed is bleeding fantastic. I haven't finished it 100%, there's still a number of unlocks, difficulties, and achieves for me to go for, but after finishing the game on normal, I have to say that it's some of the most fun I've had in quite a while.So what it is? It's a classic-style action-platformer that plays like a mix of Megaman, Contra, and Gunstar Heroes. You have a number of weapons, ranging from the basic dual pistols and rocket launcher to explosive mines, a laser rifle, and a katana. Each one has it's uses situationally, but the game is plenty playable with whatever setup you prefer. I myself like the pistols for accuracy and the katana for its ability to deflect bullets. There's an incredibly controllable triple-jump, wall jumping, and bullet time to help you dodge the massive amount of ordnance that will be flying around. You'll progress through seven short levels, each with a miniboss and a boss. The levels are derivative, as this game is basically a love letter to its influences, but it does a number of neat things with the design. It operates on a checkpoint system, which is good, because while it's not that bad on normal, but it is approaching Nintendo hard, especially on the harder difficulties. Thanks to the liberal use of checkpoint, each inevitable death ceases to sting all that bad. Like Dark Souls, Bleed is very difficult, but never punishing. Every time you die, you will know why, and that's because you messed up. That's in addition to the absolute badassery you'll unleash. While for most games the triple-jump and bullet-time would be gimmicks, in Bleed they are central to both the combat and platforming and allow you to pull off some seriously awesome moves. Rather than being nastily cheap, Bleed gives you the tools to succeed and encourages you to rise to the challenge.The story is practically nonexistant, as it was in the old days. It is the year 21XX, and the last century was the time of heroes. However, the heroes have gotten old, there's no new ones, and a cotton-candy-haired girl named Wryn dreams of supplanting them and becoming the greatest hero in the world. There is a twist, if you can call it that, at the end, but ultimately this has a classic-style video game plot to complement it's classic-style gameplay. All it is is a setup to excuse the chaos. If you want depth, look elsewhere.One last comment. The game has a wonderful atmosphere. While most of the backgrounds resemble old SNES/Genesis backgrounds, the character designs are extremely cutesy, and pink is a prominent color in Wryn's character design. While I understand that this might be offputting for many gamers, the way the designer used it to contrast with the intense action is delightful, what little story there is is hilarious as a result, and the ending is pure saccharine joy. Give it a chance. Bleed may not be complex or terribly unique, but what it is is an absolute blast. Recommended to anyone who can deal with a bit of a challenge."

Now to the nitty-gritty stuff:PROS- Great game mechanic- Controls are on point- Unique and new play style make it all the more fun- Awesome 8-bit (I think) graphics- Pretty good story- Terrific jumping and gunning system- Fast-moving, fluid movement that feels good- Overall good layout in general- Soundtrack is amazingCONS- Definitely too short- Does not have enough replayability (the sense of replayability comes from beating each level on one of four difficulties)- Weapon mechanics are WAY unbalanced (the Dual Pistols are, in most situations, the best)- Should have had more 'meat' to its bones (as I said, more levels, as well as possibly a more extensive shop and upgrades system)CONCLUSIONAn overall great game. It nails the 8-bit (I think) graphic style and layout. The control style is one of the best and most obscure I have seen. The other character variations and modes are not overly appealing to come back to. Main things to work on is game content, as I completed the initial game in just under three hours.Definitely a great buy!"

76561198101453313,Recommended,239800,15389037,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,Mreitsma,"I am usually very careful about which games I buy, and do a lot of research on games before deciding to buy them. My research on Bleed left me on the fence as to whether I should purchase it or not, as it seemed very mediocre. I decided to pick it up when it was on sale. I was pleasantly suprprised within the first few minutes of playing the game, and my experience stayed pleasant throughout this 2D shooter.There's not much for settings for this game. You can choose to play with a keyboard and mouse or controller, with mouse/right stick used for aiming and the WASD keys/left stick for moving. You can't customize the controls for the gamepad. Only the keyboard controls can be customized, unfortunately. That doesn't matter, however, as the button mapping is done well (assuming you're using a controller with Xinput). Since you'll be using your thumbs to move and shoot, the remaing controls (slow time, switch weapons, and jump/ double jump) are mapped to the shoulder buttons, which works well. You can slow time with an ability, but it uses up a gauge that refills as time passes. Anyway, The only face button that does anything is the start button. The keyboard controls are also done well. It's nice to see some customizable settings that allow for more personalization. They include recticle color (the reticicle only appears if you are using the keyboard and mouse, rather than a controller), HUD position, sound options, and you can even turn off the ability to wall jump, which seems strange to me. Why wouldn't you want to be able to wall jump? Overall these features are a nice touch, and I especially like the ability to change the HUD position.The game has 7 levels, all of which are action-packed and straightforward; look to other games for exploration or depth. There's not much else to do other than slow time, dodge and shoot, so I can't really say much about that. Each stage is unique and has various elements: on one stage, you'll be on top of a train and have to move to lower cars before the train goes under a tunnel, on another you're inside a dragon, on another you must avoid laser beams that don't hurt you but send enemies after you if you trigger them... You get the Idea. Anyway, there's several mini-bosses in each stage, though I'm not sure if I should call them mini-bosses as they can sometimes be as hard as the stage's end boss. Each stage is extremely fun and unique, and changing the difficulty also changes the stage a bit, rather than just increasing enemy health and damage dealt to you, though it also does those things too.The game also has a lot of personality and charm. The music is usually upbeat and catchy (and reminds me of Megaman music), the main character expresses her emotions in game over screens and in the title screen, and when the game ends, it tells you to follow your dreams, never give up, all that jazz. It's refreshing to have something like that, rather than a grim-dark, edgy anti-hero using a ridiculous plot as an excuse to make pretentious social commentary. After beating the game, you unlock a couple of new modes. A challenge mode which allows you to fight up to 3 bosses at once, and an arcade mode that requires you to play through the ENTIRE game without dying. Unless I just suck, it would take many hours to become good enough to complete arcade mode on even easy, and I can't imagine doing it on any level of difficulty higher than that.The game's ending brings me to my next point; the bad things about this game. The first of which is the length, as I beat Bleed in a little over 4 hours on the hard difficulty. While I very much enjoyed my time with the game, I wish it lasted longer. You could argue that the arcade mode raises the time the player can spend playing this game before getting bored, and I agree, but I still wish there was more content, because what little content that does exist is fantastic. The next bad thing about this game is the weapon selection. Now, if you know nothing about this game besides what you've been reading, let me explain. You acquire points at the end of every level, and these points can be spent at a shop to buy weapons, health upgrades, and time gauge upgrades. All of the weapons available for purchase besides one are useless. The default dual pistols are the best weapons in the game, and even the one other weapon that isn't useless, the laser rifle, is only useful against some bosses, though to be fair, it's extremely effective against said bosses. All the other weapons either don't do enough damage, have too short of range, are only useful in rare situations, or a combination of the three. More thought and careful balance should have been put into the weapons, as I've never seriously used any of them besides the default pistols and laser rifle, because the other weapons are simply worse, and a waste of points.That's all I have to say about the game, really. If you like games of this type, you'll probably love this game, as it's one of the best of it's kind. If you don't like games of this type, you probably won't like this game. If you're on the fence, pick it up."

However it's full of contents and you can't get bored, even if you wanted to. Controls are a bit odd with a pad but very intuitive with a mouse (I recommand the mouse). The triple jumps are however a bit hard to handle.Graphics are very good, especially considering that pixel art is not easy. And the level design is also very well done.The game is rather difficult. That might be because the monsters and weapons could a little better adjusted and they are raising artificially the difficulty of the game. The infinite lifes helps you to eventually finish the game, which makes the game a try and die.I still didn't try to replay, but there are definitely some replayability between the items to unlock in the shop and the harder modes (which probably bring new ennemy patterns). And if you're into speed run, it's a game for you.Overall it's a good platform game with lot of action."

If you're like me and suck at hardcore platformers, Bleed generously checkpoints at the beginning of every (short) section, so you won't have to replay too much each time you die. If you're actually good at this kind of thing, you can remix the game with a customized boss rush mode (if I understand correctly) or play the Arcade challenge with only one life (hah!). This will net you a higher score, which nets you more points you can use to buy new weapons and upgrade the main character, enabling you to play harder modes to get higher scores, etc.Gamepad controls take a little getting used to (analog stick to shoot, shoulder trigger to jump?) but soon you get into a groove where the controls make sense and are perfectly intuitive. Except I'd find myself clutching the left trigger during especially tense moments, which prevented the time slowdown meter from refilling, which made tense moments even tenser.... and the game is essentially comprised of tense moments."
,Recommended,239800,12440890,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,zanzaKlaus,"Bleed is a short-and-sweet difficult platformer reminiscent of other video games and will occasionally reference them. The story goes that you and the main protagonist Wryn have to kill all 6 great heroes in the hall of fame who have hidden themselves from the rest of the world in order to join their ranks, and reveal them for who they really are. The game is pure enjoyment, and in my opinion is what a Matrix game should be, even if it has nothing to do with that franchise. Wryn can do three directional dashes while in the air, making her extremely mobile, if a little hard to control. You use the mouse to aim her weapons and can even go into bullet time (see why I compared it to the Matrix).  Wryn is probaby the best main protagonist in an indie game. She is just so adorable! The only real issue is the control. While you can get used to it, it can cause a lot of death, especially on stage 6.  Many may say this game is too short, but I honestly prefer short but amazing games as opposed to long dull games. This game will take you about 1 and a half hours to beat, but those 1 and a half hours will be some of the best in your life. 8/10"

The controls are a bit odd at first, as jumping is defaulted to a trigger, but this frees up your thumb the ability to run, aim, and jump simultaneously--seldom heard of.  What makes Blleed even more unique is its time-slowing ability, sort of like a Prince of Persia sand of time thing, but meter-based instead of amount of times used.  With this ability in hand and many achievements and upgrades to discover, Bleed may be worth well more than the retail price depending on when you stop playing (a run through of all levels on easy is less than an hour, but attempting arcade mode (no deaths) on very hard could take many many hours to practice for).

Looks like most said it was too short. I think the length is appropriate.  It is intended to be beatable in a single sitting (though it is not required) It is probably about as long as the games it is intended to resemble.I have yet to play the coop mode, but i do like that it is available.One reviewer complained about the twin-stick controls on the platformer being bad.  I did find it a bit easier to use WSAD and the mouse, despite twin-stick shooting in a platformer being a factor originally drawing me to the game.  Either way it is fun and well done.Graphics are retro in a good way.  The pixelation is definitely done to cater to the style, not to cater to laziness; the art is well detailed. For me the biggest downfall would be the title is a bit similar to another indie platformer. The plot is a bit contrived, but amusing and sufficient.  Maybe you require more ""reason"" to go around committing wonton acts of violence, but I feel this game is more about gameplay rather than the game's story, and it got gameplay right. It certainly was more fun that you just had reading my review.If you are considering the cost, I prefer quality over quantity.  It isn't very expensive, and is certainly long enough. But if you must be cheap--i totally get it. i also want to buy more games that i wont play--click that wishlist button and wait for the next steam sale, but once you get it you'll be sorry you waited so long.

Could describe it as a 2D Devil May Cry, plus time slow-down powerup.Insane difficulty, you will probably start it on normal then have to switch to easy at later levels (as early as the 3rd stage for me), finish the stage on easy, and then do it later on normal, with some more upgrades. Though it's nice that you can go back to previous stages in a higher difficulty (hard, very hard, and these will make you suffer) to farm a bit for some upgrades.Also, on higher difficulties, some parts are almost bullet hell like, when they're throwing a crazy amount of bullets at you, and the only way you can possibly dodge is by slowing down time, but still, the curtains are very dense (for those who understand danmaku terms).Even though I still haven't finished it, I definitely recommend it. I love the challenge, it's the kind of game that gets you actually talking to yourself as you play, and spontaneously swearing when you die. And finally, when you beat the boss, especially on higher dificulties, it's very rewarding. So you should definitely give it a try."

While the levels themselves are pretty short (you can complete each level in a few minutes), they are well designed, and the different difficulties increases the replayability.  As you play on higher difficulties, enemy attacks and stage hazards change in ways that significantly change gameplay.Since the story can be finished pretty quickly, the game strongly encourages replaying the stages on higher difficulties to unlock characters and weapons (although for the most part you'll likely stick with the default dual pistols).  There are also achievements that encourage replaying stages, mainly ones for maintaining a high style rating, or for completing stage-specific objectives.  There is also an arcade mode which has you playing through the entire game on one life (without any healing) and a challenge mode where you can fight up to 3 bosses at once.I personally recommend playing this with a controller.

Seriously I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is in to bullet hell and is just bored, it is a little short for 5$ but it goes on sale a whole bunch, so I think its worth it. I actually im trying to think of some cons and I just can't, this game is just so good! It was a really fun 2 hours (And I took my time, you can do it much faster) and I'm exited to play Bleed 2 as soon as I get it. Diffidently one of my favorite purchases this summer sale, 10/10!"

I feel like I experience time more granularly after playing it because of the incredible pace of the game.My biggest criticism is that I don't feel like the alternate weapons or characters offer any actual advantages over Wryn w/ default pistols, so they exist mostly to add extra challenge."

I was pleasantly suprised really, I remember seeing a video of the game in progress years ago on reddit, and I'm glad the developer finished it and I'm impressed by the game, so if this game is anything to go by, Bleed 2 should be great also.Pros-------The levels are really inventive and interesting.-Gameplay is really smooth with how you bullet time at difficult points.Cons------- The main downside is that I felt the game got easier after the 3rd boss, and felt like a rush through in story mode, but there's lots of difficulty options implemented for a challenge and replayability, so it's partially solved by that."

But if not, I wouldn't recommend you buy this game. I bought the game on August 8, and I finished it the next day with less than 2 hours on record. This game does have different modes but it is rather quick and easy."
