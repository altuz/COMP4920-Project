You start as a guy/gal working out of a cramped garage in the 80's and as you create popular games you'll gradually grow until you have enough money for a new premises as well as the option to hire employees.

,Recommended,239820,9979102,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,[AReV]BavarianGod,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9t7t05xkVkGame development is where art and technology run headlong into one another; an arena where money, geekery, hubris and passion collide compressing under extreme heat to form gaming's diamonds, or going awry leaving behind Superman 64 style turds... While many gamers think they understand the tremendous amounts of skill, passion and balance required to make a great game, one trip to a message board usually exposes how little some of them understand about the process and challenges of game development. Greenheart Games has delivered a simulation that illustrates just how many compromises are made in the developmental process by emphasizing the budgets and time constraints that most titles are developed under and just how disastrous it can be to misappropriate time to features that are not central to the type of game that is being developed. Game Dev Tycoon comes together to form an accessible but insightful view of game development.Like any entrepreneurial endeavor, it all starts with giving your budding studio a name before setting up shop in your garage and plugging away at your keyboard. Aside from providing a facsimile of running a studio, Game Dev Tycoon is also a bit of a history lesson with the in game timeline chronicling the release of fictitious consoles that are based on the real life machines that many of us gamers grew up on. The demographics an traits of these platforms is represented as accurately as possible, meaning that a family friendly casual game might be best suited for a mobile platform while an intricate simulation will probably have the most success on the PC. Likewise, pairing an appropriate theme to your game's genre will yield the best sales and reviews. Developing a medically themed action game is a great way to go belly up. In this way, Game Dev Tycoon isn't interested in giving players the freedom to create eccentric titles that carve out their own niches, so developing your own Katamari Damacy or Mr. Mosquito is not a dream that this game is meant to help players fulfill. It's about business—moderating costs and selling as many copies as humanly possible. To do so, you can hire and fire staff, develop your own digital distribution platform, choose appropriate marketing campaigns and research new features and technologies that will earn new fans.Developing a game in Game Dev Tycoon is somewhat reminiscent of playing Civilization, each member of your team has a Design rating and a technology rating. Each area of game development falls into these categories. Programming AI is all about technical experience while graphics are about design. As your game goes through each stage of development, your team will generate tech and design points and how many they generate depends on their rating in each category. The higher their rating, the faster they will produce these points. Balancing your point output to meet the needs of your game is imperative and team members can be trained to bolster their tech or design rating. The more experience a team member has the higher their level will be which also means that they earn a larger paycheck. Having six level ten developers working for you may sound like a recipe for success until your operating costs dig deeply into your profits. Fortunately you can hire and fire employees at any time. To manage costs.Costs also mount when researching and developing new technology. Technologies can then be implemented into your studio's in house game engines. Keeping up with the tech curve and developing proprietary game engines keeps your studio on the cutting edge and can help generate sales. Bear in mind that the costs of new tech are not limited to implementing them into a game engine—each title you develop utilizing  special technology costs extra so spending the money to integrate surround sound into your latest text based adventure is ill advised.Rounding out the fantasy of running your own development studio are PR and marketing opportunities. As your studio grows, the press will want to know about your latest products and your answers to their questions can earn additional fans and sales. Exercising unrestrained bravado and overhyping your games can earn your studio a Peter Molyneux sized ♥♥♥♥♥ slap, loosing fans and hampering your sales. Having a rabid fan base ensures a certain degree of success since loyal fans will line up to buy your newest project—even if it's titled Grass Growing Simulator or Guitar Hero: Nickleback. Also integral to the PR song and dance is having your own booth at industry trade shows. Having a booth requires a chunk of cash but with enough exposure, your studio can earn additional fans and prestige making it worth investing in. Investing in a marketing campaign will also boost sales potential but timing is key if you want to get the most out of your marketing dollar.While Game Dev Tycoon integrates almost every major element involved in bringing a game to market it does have a few faults. The largest of which is the lack of randomization. The proceedings are rather predictable, so don't expect any calamities to come along and shake things up. Your staff is always compliment and unlike real life they don't seem interested in seeking newer more lucrative opportunities, you never run into major development snags or delays that would force your studio to cancel a title. Combine this with the fact that running out of money simply means having to take a loan out from the bank and you have a sim experience that is far more forgiving than most. The genre and theme combinations never change nor do the demographics for genres and platforms so once you have discovered a few successful formulas in one playthrough, they will certainly work in an additional playthrough. All this comes together to make Game Dev Tycoon far less repayable than other titles in the genre.Game Dev Tycoon is an enjoyable game that offers a bit of insight to the process of creating games and it even gives younger players a bit of history about gaming. It's clean and colorful visuals keep the mood light and it's mechanics make it far more accessible than other simulations games. The downside is it's predictability and lack of variation make it difficult to come back to after a dozen or two hours have gone into it. While it's price is set appropriately, fans of other simulators may be left wanting."

76561198007559553,Not Recommended,239820,31993208,Posted: 27 May,all,rafvanhaver,"The road to succes in this game lies in the simple fact that every game you make (besides choosing the right mix of topic/genre/platform/....) has to be slightly ""better"" mathematically than the previous game.What does Game Dev Tycoon mean with ""better""? Simply that more 'Design' and 'Technology' points have to be put into your next game. You do this by training your employees to become better at writing and coding, and researching technology so your engine becomes more advanced (in a nutshell).However this means that once you create a bombshell game (large, AAA, whatever) you CANNOT develop a smaller game...ever...because the algorithm that defines how the audience and reviewers respond does not budge from your new game HAVING to be ""better"" than the previous game.For example: In real life this would mean that devs like Blizzard would never be allowed to create intermediate content like Hearthstone or the upcoming Starcraft graphical remake, since it's not as ""good"" as their AAA titles? That's just impossible, and to me it ruined the game since your just stuck in a chain of ""get more bubbles in your next game or else!"".This is probably also the reason why the game rather quickly becomes repetitive and a tad dull and linear. You have so many options that would potentially allow you to make a cost effective title that's still a lot of fun (who needs state of the art graphics on a gameboy?) but since the goal of every development cycle is simply MOARRRR this mechanic is broken from the start."

I recommend custom PCs to be built by the hardware lab. Just more things in general. This game is virtually complete as it reaches the point of modern technology and can advance no further. people complain about the lack of content and while it may eed a little bit more it does have just about everything. I recommend you get mods for it once it gets boring on normal. The mods and more topics and allow you to build different stuff. Be careful though as you may break the game and have to restart from scratch. I highly recommend this game it is defintatly woth $10.00.

See ConclusionNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)INTRODUCTION:The first game developed by Greenheart Games, Game Dev Tycoon is a Simulation game that, not just tries to mimic the events and hardships of game development studios, but also teaches the player a little bit of history on how our favorite pass time (or hobby) grew into this giant of an industry we see today.STORY (No Spoilers):Game Dev Tycoon places you in the shoes of a start up developer who will be making games for the different gaming platforms. Starting from the early days of the PC and Govodore G64 (Commodore 64), the game will send you through history up until the Console wars of the MBox One (Xbox One) and the Playsystem 4 (Playstation 4). Make games, hire staff members, research new technologies and build yourself to be the most popular and successful Game Developer in the world.PROS:+ Very nice 'Fash' type Art Style and animation+ Surprisingly fun game mechanic+ Relaxing and pleasing sound effects and music but...(See CON #1)+ Great Re-playability+ Fairly accurate historical progression on the video game industry's history+ Good Value / Play time ratio+ Minimal system requirements+ Steam Cloud and Workshop Support+ Devs trolled pirates of their game (They uploaded a cracked version of their game that, if played, would backrupt the player's company ironically due to piracy.)+ Relatively cheap (at $10 or your regional equivalent) for its highly replayable game timeCONS:- Could use more Soundtracks- Could use more randomized and recurring events- Limited Staff- Game Review is a bit lacking on information on why your game did well (or poorly)- A bit predictable if you followed the Game Industry's history since you can easily bet which platform would be most successful.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Easy to understand and easy to learn but very difficult to master. It is a game that both Hardcore gamers and casual players can both enjoy.WORTH IT?For $10 (or your regional equivalent), the game is well worth its full price and should be a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Playing this game gives a great feeling of satisfaction as well as a bit of understanding why game developers make the decisions they do.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

After more than a decade on this side of the fence, it was time to see how the other half lives – it was time to become a Game Developer.  Much to my surprise, it was time to review a Tycoon title.Starting off in a small garage all by yourself, Game Dev Tycoon casts you an aspiring game developer.  You’ll kick of your career like most indie devs – mere feet from boxes and your tarp-covered car.  Picking a name for your game, a topic, a genre, a platform, and an engine to power it are the building blocks for pushing a title out the door, at least in the beginning.  With humble beginnings you’ll only have a few topics to pick from – sports, medieval, military, and space, but a great many more are just waiting to be unlocked.  Similarly, genres are fairly limited in the beginning, giving you action, RPG, simulation, and strategy to start.  Much like the real thing, in the beginning there is only PC as a selectable platform because consoles and handhelds haven’t been ‘invented’ yet.  It’s nothing if not simple in the beginning.After nailing down the elements of your game you’ll work through the development process.  There are three phases to releasing a game.  In the first phase you’ll chose how to divide your time and resources between story, gameplay, and the engine. The sliders for all three can be drug all the way to the top, but this does extend the development time of your game dramatically.  When you are a one-man shop with very limited funds, this is a dangerous gamble.  The second stage of development asks you for the same decision on dialogues, level design, and AI, then stage three gives you the same thing for world design, graphics, and sound.  As your fingers dance away at the keyboard, your development bubbles up game points towards technology, research, and design.  It also bubbles up bugs – bugs that will cost additional time and money to fix…that is unless you turn a blind eye to them and hope your fans do the same.During development you can also add additional features.  The pool is pretty shallow to start, but like genres and topics, you can use research later to unlock many more.   These can be mono sound, 3D graphics, joystick or steering wheel support, and other bullets you might see on the back of a real-world game box.  When the game is finished and all the features are locked you can release it immediately, but you might want to think about fixing those bugs first.  The longer your game dev goes, the more points will bubble up towards all of the development areas.  When it’s said and done you’ll earn experience in all of the areas where you’ve focused, as well as personal experience for you as a developer.  Publishing the game brings the moment that all developers absolutely love, anticipate, and dread – reviews.  Shortly after completion you’ll get a stack of four reviews from a random slice of fake game reviewers.  They all come with a short blurb and a score from 1 to 10.  These scores have a direct impact on the sales that follow, so putting out a well-reviewed product becomes important quickly.  You’ll earn more fans with a great game, and build your fanbase with great releases.As you develop you’ll also earn research points that you can spend on learning new topics and genres as well as new features for your basic engine.  New topics, multiplayer, online support, and much more can be attached to the engine, eventually transitioning it to a fully-3D system.  The best dev houses out there build their own engines though, and you’ve got an opportunity to do exactly that.  Building an engine is a costly proposition, both in terms of development time as well as researching and building features.  Adding stereo sound to your custom engine instead of just mono might not be all that expensive, but moving to a full orchestral soundtrack is a colossal undertaking.  Your engine won’t take you forward year after year though, so you’ll end up making several over the course of the game.  You can’t switch engines mid-development (Prey, Duke Nukem Forever, Anachronox, Too Human, etc – pay attention) so selecting the right features and sticking with it is your only choice.Sitting around cashing the dwindling paychecks from your freshly-released game might be great, but when it dries up you’re gonna have a bad time.  Your game will only stay on the market a limited time, and audiences get awful upset when you release a sequel immediately (e.g. Left 4 Dead 2), so branching out gives you a slight bonus to your experience as well as a better reception with fans.  Spending research points means not spending time developing games, so you might find your cash beginning to dwindle. To help keep your shop afloat you can also take on contract work.   The contracts ask you to generate a certain amount of design and tech points in a specific timeframe.  Failure to hit your contract goals forces you to pay a penalty, so biting off only what you can chew is critical.  Given that new contracts only pop up every 6 months, you’ll have to use them wisely.People don’t want to work in your stinky, greasy garage.  To begin your development in earnest you’ll need to build a team – you can’t do everything yourself for long.  Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff and develop their skills as well.  At this stage you’ll have access to books and classes that help build up your design, speed, tech, or research skills, as will your staff.  Just like time developing an engine, it’s not being spent on building games, so balance is key.Hiring talent isn’t cheap or easy, so advertising the job will cost you somewhere between 20k to 2 million.  Getting a good mix of specialists and generalists will help you create a team of world-class game developers, but balancing budgets and payroll against income starts to affect the types of games you make as well as development time.  Strategy really begins to kick in here. When you get to the point where you can start making Engine specialists, Level Design specialists, and other disciplines you’ll have to carefully plan to not tip the scales too far in any one direction.The game industry is in a constant state of flux, and platform leaders have a chance of changing with the introduction of new devices.  Snarky plays on the real world give you things like the “Play System”, “Ninvento TES”, “G64”, and many more that I don’t want to spoil for you.  Developing on these platforms means paying a huge lump sum to the parent company before you can even start, so building a game on a new platform could be costly.  That said, if that’s where the market is, you’ll have to join the fight where it lies.When I finish some games I smile, nod, and then shelve them forever.  Once I completed Game Dev Tycoon I immediately fired it up for round 2. For the price of a cup of coffee you can pick this game up. Don’t be one of the 97% that pirated it.  Game Dev Tycoon is the one Tycoon title worth buying.Recommended"

,Not Recommended,239820,7958741,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,SpaceJammerSlammi,"Game Dev Tycoon is a lot of fun, but ultimately pretty shallow.  The lack of a randomized console marketplace means that if you know anything about the game industry, you can just make X type of game on Y console at Z point in time and easily crush the marketplace, over and over and over.  And while that's fine for one playthrough, the whole thing plays out the same every single time you go again, meaning there's little to no replayability due to the predictable nature of the game.Visually it looks nice, audio-wise it works out well.  There are a few confusing gameplay elements, things like MMOs and how/when to release expansions aren't explained very well to the player (with some trial and error you can figure it out, but you might bankrupt yourself while you attempt to understand it), and sometimes it's hard to get a sense of what else is 'happening' in the industry as a whole, so you can't really respond to it.If the game added random marketplace behaviors and simulated other companies alongside you(instead of just releasing X game at Y timestamp every time), it would be fantastic and very replayable.  As it stands, I can't recommend it for more than a cheap steam sale purchase.Though there are some mods available for this game that could potentially alleviate some of these issues, it would be better if the developer dealt with them themselves.  Unfortunately, they seem to be done updating the game and there are still some core design decisions here that are unfriendly towards repeat playthroughs."

In my opinion, it is very replayable and you can easily put in many hours on this game. Once you ""beat"" the game, you can continue, although no new consoles will come out other than your own. The UI is simple and not cluttered. I notice many other tycoons make their UIs complex and harder to get the hang of.

Second of all, I am truly impressed with this little indie gem. Telling about the history while going into history. Or at least memory of the players.I remember back in early 2012, developers released article about them, software piracy, and paying for games. I thought it was just a promo for the game that is about that at some point, but then again, it was truth. (If anybody know of wchich article I am speaking, send me a link to it because I cannot find it anywhere.)I am not entirly sure, why this game got me that much. I assume that it was during the time I was writing my seminar work and it was actually about history of gaming industry. Me myself, I am not even considering this game as a Game Dev Simulation. For me it is more about history and I want to say it is tribute to Gaming Fewer era back in the days, when it was hard to get a game, when it was hard to get a thing to play a game. And not even to the era, but also to the game itself. Companies and devs too.This is complex history, in absolutely awesome way provided to the gamers. For somebody it might be repetetive after while, but it all depends on how you do it and how you play it and if you enjoy going through the history and being inside the history. I have replayed that at least 4 times and still do not have enough.I am like the virgin after first sex now - I cannot get over it.However, this is first Greenheart Games project and I am not even going to lie - I WANT ANOTHER!Also I saw some requests of making DLC to the Game Dev Tycoon, and for me, I would support it definitely.Let us updated Greenheart!Bonus Point: Back To The FutureRating: 9.5/10"

It is a fun look at the history of real life game development through a fictional alternate world view. So, instead of an Xbox, for example, you have an Mbox. anywya, developing games and seeing how they pan out critically, watching their sales, etc...while also training your staff and learning more about developing games so you can create more powerful game engines that in turn allows you to make more powerful games, while trying to determine which console/computer type to release your games, what genre of game to develop, whether you should go multi plat (later on), whiole seeing what genres are trending, chatting with the press, fielding requests, teaching students, and so on and so forth are only a small part of what is actually a simple game, despite all that, lol.Plus, you can name your games whatever you want. I went with crass, vulgar, and offensive, lol. My company name in fact is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disks for example (and that is relatively minor in my list of awful offenses in the game, lol).Anyway, this is a really, really, really, really fun game that I recommend trying out.

Unfortunately, it also has quite a few bad things going for it that limited my enjoyment. Overall I'm marking this negative because even though the game was enjoyable, I find that it isn't worth $10.Before I get into the negative aspects I'll say what I liked about it. The graphic and graphic style is very nice. The sounds are pleasant and satisfying. The UI is a little finicky, but overall quite nice. Gameplay is also quite calming, and I found this game fun to play while watching something on my second monitor. Micromanagement is obviously a part of the game but not so much that its overbearing.So here's the bad parts. First, how the game works (in brief). In this game, you develop a game. You then get a rating from 4 reviewing companies on a 1-10 scale. How high your game is on the scale directly affects sales.This is all fine and well, but there is some obvious tom foolery in how the rating system works. You can read more about the finer details on other reviews here, but in short, if you do well early on, you'll do worse later. That's right: you can develop an amazing game with a damn near perfect design/tech ratio, release time, console match, playerbase match, ALL the matches, and get an average rating of 6.75 because you released a blockbuster game a while ago.Effectively the game punishes you for doing well. Pretty lame, right?There's also some more drawbacks. Things like the fact that there's no competition. Nil. You feel like you're the only person developing anything because you ARE. You're always the developer of those smash hit games like ""Dance/Casual"" for the ""Wuu"" (AKA Dance Dance Revolution). There's no such thing as a topic being overdone by anyone except you. This is a HUGE drawback for a game that is essentially a business tycoon. Hell, you can set up booths at video game conventions to build hype for your game, and the game tells you that you were the 75th most popular booth at the convention.Who the hell are those other 75 companies ahead of you? You have no idea because they don't exist!I wanted to play as the gamer's-dream, consumer-friendly company that eventually rises above its competitors because of how committed it is to its playerbase. But you can't do that because there's nothing to rise against except game reviewers that critique you based on a game you released 8 years ago.Another problem I have is the lack of choices. You'd think that, being a game development company, you'd be able to be creative in how you run your company. But really, you don't do much. You make games of a certain genre and topic (which you'd think is room for creativity, but it really isn't because you're essentially just forced to methodically go through and exhaust every genre/topic combo you have). You give the game a name. That's about it. Sometimes you have choices, like some fans want you to release an old engine you made. You can choose to release it, sell it, or not release it at all. The problem is, there's virtually no drawback to NOT releasing it. You lose a bit of money by releasing it but the amount is so small that its virtually insignificant. The only reason you would choose not to release it is if you want to roleplay the ""evil moneygrubbing company"". Which while fun, is still roleplaying, rather than just playing the game.So overall I found the game okay. It's worth about $5.00 in my opinion. I think the developers of this game did an alright job, especially for a first release, and what is clearly a passion project. But they left out some key components of what makes a good business/management tycoon and that's what put this review in the negative section."

As you go through the game you get new technology such as 3d graphics and branching story lines. As you level up and make money the game opens up more research topics for you to use and new office space.This game doesn't offer a huge amount of options as you play through, however what's here is done very well. I have played through 2 careers doing slightly different things and still find it fun. WIll this be a game you play a year from now? Maybe for the fond memories of it, but it's not really engaging enough to keep you playing it all the time.However, the creators did add a couple of nice messages in the game thanking you for the support and for purchasing their game which I thought was kinda nice,Price vs playability: 7/10Graphics: 7/10 (this is two people who developed the game)Enjoyment: 9/10 for the first couple of play throughsOverall: I am going to give this an 8/10 simply because I did enjoy the game as much as I did. And yeah, I will add more hours to my play time, at least for awhile anyway."

Not exactly.Game Dev Tycoon is one of less than a half-dozen in this very specific genre. That is its success. It's failure is that, in a world full of very solid sim games, it lacks balance and depth, delivering only moderately clever puns and a menial supply of easter eggs to keep you coming back.If there were a better Game Development simulator out there, I'd be playing that one, but there isn't. Game Dev Tycoon as a title represents what I want in a game, but not what exists.Final score...4/10 Not good, not bad... simulation games are great for pc... ;-)"
76561198030788488,Recommended,239820,12925931,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,Cracktus Jack,"Game Dev Tycoon...is a casual business simulator. From the post-console crash of the 80s to modern gaming scene, you run an indie game studio from your garage with the goal of becoming a world-renowned developer team.⚠DescriptionTo develop games, you must pick a genre (action, simulator, RPGs, etc.) and match it with an appropriate theme (aliens, sports, fantasy, etc.), after which you allocate the time you spend working on the game during its three phases. For each game you produce, rating and success are based on how well you matched genres and themes and console, and making sure development generates sufficient design and technology points for the picked genre. The quantity of points is determined by where you allocate your time during the three phases of development, and your own experience with the different phases' fields and the technology your game engine uses.You start as a single person, working from your garage in the early 80s. As you start working on larger projects, you will move to a small office, and then a larger one, while growing your development team. Working on your game will randomly generate research points that you can then spend in training yourself and your team members into different specialties, or in the research of new themes or technologies (3D graphics, savegames, multiplayer, branching story, etc.) for your own game engines. Implementing new technologies require a minimum time allocation in the appropriate phase's fields, so you must pick and chose which technology will benefit the genre and theme of game you're working on.☺ProsThere's an astonishingly large quantity of themes to choose from, which you combine with one (and later two) genre, determining console and eventually target audience, allowing almost limitless possibilities. Unlikely combos even get their time in the spotlight, as there will randomly be time-limited niche market trends you can exploit to boost sales, in addition to various marketing campaigns, convention booths, or developing sequels to popular previous games. Success doesn't just bring more money to develop more games, but also builds your reputation with a dedicated base of loyal fans that will enhance sales and hype.As you develop more games, you can research your past games and learn from their success or failure, eventually recording what general combinations of genres, themes, target audiences, consoles, and development phase fields work best together. Because you only start with 4 themes out of dozens to be researched, you'll get plenty of replayability from attempting all the different combinations. These records can then be loaded into future playthroughs.As the years go by, you're often informed on news of the video game market, events, speculations and new console release that parodies how events actually unfolded. Your knowledge of real-world events might just help you avoid the mistakes of real world companies (such asbelieving newspapers claiming the Gomodore64 will kill the PC market, or that the Vena DreamVast will topple all other consoles). This is a funny wink to ""old school"" gamers who've been playing games for the past 30+ years.☹ConsThe game is very, very simplified. There is no clear competition, no way to determine how much you concentrate on tech use (besides selecting whether or not you use them at all). You will forever be limited to a small indie company, no way to grow into a larger company (the likes of which EA did, from a small indie studio to one of the largest publishers).In the real world, gaming platforms and consoles were often built or killed by genre-defining console-exclusives, but you don't get to affect events inGame Dev Tycoon. You can release a the single biggest, most popular 10/10 game and nothing will topple the failure or retirement of a console at its scheduled time or in any way influence video game industry events.While a multitude of indie studios have thrived on the development and specialization of specific genres, you are forced to alternate between multiple genres and themes, because using the same ones too often will quickly drop your ratings for being too redundant. Also, you will forever be measured on your best game to date, so as soon as you develop a game that skyrockets, you can expect low ratings for years to come unless you invest heavily in the training of your staff and the development of new technologies. And even then, you'll eventually cap when you reached the point where your staff is trained to maximum capacity and no new technologies are being released.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ -""It's up to you.""This is a fun and addictive game! Sure, there are games that dig in deeper into realism (such asGamersGoMakers), but if you just want a casual game you’ll play an hour or two (or more) at the time, give this one a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

So very recently, I've got myself my first Steam Acount and played only Level 1 of this game. So was the game good as I remembered it when I played the DEMO or a waste of time?Sounds:So the music sounds okay. I can hum a few tones from the game.  6/10Gameplay:So this is a business tycoon game. A really popular concept. Now I've heard that there is another Game Dev Game, but I think that this game is better. Plus I'd never played the other one people talk about. You are going around making games and getting fans and money. And if you make a hit game, you may get an office. Now I haven't played the office yet, but holy crap is this game fun.It also makes you think sometimes. If I had a few flaws, when you start the game you may get a white screen unless you clear the cache or something. Also it is pretty hard to come up with some ideas but that is a realsitc concept so maybe I am bashing it for what it is. The games really fun and I think you should play it! 8/10Story:The Story is just epic. While I don't think younger gamers would really understand it (unless they look in the history books), it well be faithful to some gamers. Due to copyright issues they changed the company's names but you can get an easter egg if you type one of the Offical Names. I hope it gets better! 9/10Graphics:They look pretty darn good. They look very smooth and maybe a little generic but I don't have a lot of complaints. 7/10Replay?:This game is something that you may play a few times after 43 years in the game. It could be very fun to create a ton of games. And maybe you would like story. Just to be fair I will give Replay: 7/10Is this game Good?:Yes it is! It is a game that I think every video gamer should play unless they hate tycoon business games. It is fun and faithful to gaming. I'll give this game 8/10 A must buy!"

The bank lending me money at least once during almost every stage of the game, but it was actually a bit funnier and more challenging when I constantly fluctuated between hits and failures.The last phase was way to easy on my first playthrough, because I had no specialists in my team, so I didn't go into the labs. But even though spending money on discovering things in the lab and building consoles made it more challenging, it made it way more fun, and on my last years of my second playthrough I had the second generation of my console out and a hit MMORPG.The reviewers in the game can be jerks. On my first playthrough I made a lot of hit games, and there were constantly two of them that switched between giving me 9, so I got 9.75 instead of perfect ten. Felt like they were just trying to keep me from getting the achievement. :( And like I said, I got worse at the game the second time, so I'm probably never gonna get that achievement.There is a lot in the game, but it never gets too complex to manage. The game that comes closest to the same experience of playing for me is probably the sims series. Where you just keep playing and there is so much to do, and a lot of minor variables, but it is all easily presented and managable. However... It suffers from the same problem that the main Sims games have for, which is that there are no natural ""exit points"" no real quests, so it can be hard to stop before you reach the end and can lead to game burnout eventurally. (I know sims doesn't have an end, but this game kinda has one where you get your end score) You could argue every time you finish a game within the game it is an exit, but then you get the reviews, then it goes on the market, and while it is on the market or before it gets reviewed you put your team on the task of developing, reaching, or training something else. So there is no place where the game feels like it is a natural place to take a break I would love if they make a sequel or spinoff game where they include some kind of quests or in game objectives beyond the achievements.But it is still a topranking simulation game, and I am glad I bought it. 9.75/10"

,Recommended,239820,10781013,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,HalfSquirrel,"Game Dev Tycoon is a game that can be challenging at first, but is extremely satisfying once you get farther. When I started out, I really hated how all my games that I thought would be really cool came out with crappy reviews and awful sales. I didn't like that to the point where I decided to use guides on the internet to try and improve my games. I don't regret doing it, because I really hated playing the game without it, and it helped a lot.One thing about this game is that it's really hard to get started. It takes a long time to get all the hints and then to know how to use them to the best, and I still haven't unlocked all of them after creating Game Reports after every game. I've still been continuing to use guides, and it's been improving the game for me.Another thing I don't like is how random the game reviewing system still feels. Sometimes I will follow the hints and guides exactly (and since I'm using the hints too, it's not just the guide being wrong) and the game will still come out with a 6-7 review.I think it can be challenging to determine what I should be using my research points on, and even more so as I'm getting farther in the game and I need to start having specialists in certain areas. I know this is something you have to learn on your own, but this is a situation similar to getting the topic-genre-gaming device right where it's not worth the effort to look into, and it's a nice thing to know in advance.The one thing in the game that has bothered me the most, however, is the lack of a reminder to name your game. My biggest issue for a really long time was forgetting to name my games, and I know you aren't reminded to do that because it affects the reviewing process, but I feel like if you got a little reminder to name a game it could go a long way. In my opinion, it doesn't even make sense to let a game called ""Game #38"" onto the market anyways, it doesn't sound like a game at all. The way I finally got myself to remember to name games is by being in a skype call with my friends and getting them to select from a bunch of options to develop my games, and then getting them to name it to make it more fun. Other than that, more than half my games have been unnamed.However, this game is still really fun. Where it does have it's downsides, there is still something that keeps me playing. One thing might simply be that I haven't completed the game yet, or that I want to get more achievements, but one of my favourite things is easily how satisfying it is to make a successful game. The income rate is amazing, I love seeing my money increase, and every time I see a ""10"" on the initial reviews I know I'm in for a treat.Overall, this game may not be worth a full $10, but if it's ever on sale at a price of less than $5 I easily recommend that you get it. It has some faults, but when you succeed it's easily worth the sadness of previous failures."

,Recommended,239820,8006326,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,Aussiedroid,"Fun little management sim with some limitations. Although enjoyable for a while, there is not a lot of depth in the gameplay. You basically choose a combination of genres/topics/platforms for a game, researching and improving your skills along your journey to make more complex (and hopefully better rating) games. The better the ratings after release, the more money you get to grow your business. You will progress from your garage to corporate office and hire employees along the way. There are also a few other basic things you can do like training employees, research new tech, marketing & sign with publishers. Game Dev Tycoon uses some play-on-words to'loosely'follow historical references to progress the game through release of new consoles and hardware to modern day.Gaming combinations that might be popular in real life don't necessarily correspond to a good game in Game Dev Tycoon and there are also some strange ones you can choose. Mastering the game really come down to memorising what combos works (through trial & error) which starts to detract from the experience after you have played a few games. What you have learned in previous games can be kept for future games to help out.I was really hoping there would be more strategic depth and more varied tactics you could use to change the game outcome and wanted to be able to go all the way to an EA or Valve type of game dev. Regrettably, you can only have 6 employees and is not designed to be open ended with a fixed end point finalising your game. A game on making games is a great concept. Fulfilling many gamers fantasies of developing their own unique games, but this needs more content, more detail, much more customisation & strategy to become something special.Game Dev Tycoon is still a decent bit of fun, despite it being simplistic and with limited replayability so gets the 'Thumbs Up' from me!If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

I just don't think the $10 price tag is at all worth what you'll get here. The game lacks any engaging gameplay and doesn't give you enough infromation to properly create your games. Everything feels up to chance and the game never tells me what I feel like it should to make my outcome better. Things like ""Dark Fantasy and RPG are a great Combo"" is nice, but I still don't know what using 3D graphics instead of 2D graphics does for me. The entire game feels like a slot machine. I feel like I'm just cranking games out, and I get burnt out when projects I think sound fun in my head get low scores even if I put a lot of money and effort into them yet the Flight Sim I had no interest in and just made it for a quick buck is still the best selling game I've made so far. I makes you feel like what you think is fun just really isn't and the whole game dictates what is and isn't a good idea. It's not fun to try something new and see it flop almost all the time because the game decided thats not profitable. Not bad for a first game, it's actually really good. I just think it needs work. Maybe if Game Dev 2 has more features I'd play it. If you have any interest this game is worth a shot, I just burnt out on it way to quick to justify the $10 I spent."

You might not think so at first but as time goes on you begin to realize that the mechanics are extremely simple yet arbitrary in unnecessary ways. Accomplishments really seem to come all at the same time in each play through and failures are too common for unnecessary reasons. You will find yourself constantly building a company and then watching it come burning to the ground because you released what you thought would be a high ranking game. Game Dev Story on the mobile platforms is far superior to this copy-cat. I really wouldn’t recommend this game as it’s ultimately more frustrating than fun.

This game is the reason i started game development im not even going to lie when i got to the end game i felt like i wanted to create games and began learning basic code and design and since then ive done nothing but learn and i have this game to thank. Now for the game review i would say it is an addictive yet fun game to play as it pushes the player to try and get better scores with reviews and explains pretty well how games are developed and can even teach players of this generation to apreciate what developers can go through for a game to be published. I would also say for an older type of game that the pixel art looks nice and runs easily for any PC. I strongly recommend for users that are intrested in the games industry to play this as it could maybe give more insight to what happens behind the scenes.

I bought this title because, I want to be a game developer.   The Premise of Game Dev Tycoon is, rather... well you are a game developer, and you play through the ages and generations of video games, starting from the NES era of gaming and work your way through today.The game progresses from you working alone in a garage, to a small team in a smaller office, to a massive corprate headquaters where you can pump out tripple A titles.So the question is thus, what about the game development part.  Well basicly there are three parts to game development, and three sliders per part.  Pending on Genre and type of game pends on how the sliders need to be set, where you need to spend your time and resources into making a good game.  Then you watch bubbles (With one of the most addictive sound effects) float up into a compleation bar.  That's about it.So in all honesty theres not much to gameplay at all, its simple, it's straight foward, and I quite like it, personally after hashing out a few sequals it makes you think on what you are creating, and has given me some neat ideas for games just because I kept pumping out sucessful sequals in this game.So All in All, I recomend this game, it is a handy timewaster, it is fun in it's own way, a little addictive, and is easy on the CPU.  So by all means give it a whirl.Note to the Developer: I think a demo of the first garage era would go a long way for this game to get more people to play it."

THIS game is the same basic idea (Sim Games Dev) with a really pleasant presentation. Hire and fire, develop game features and engines, churn out cash-in franchises as often as you dare and throw as much marketing money around as possible to push you over the top.It's essentially a toy for people who like games and gaming and the games industry and think about them a lot."

First, you get to experience being the manager. Managing is really hard imo, but this game can be a motivation for some because it requires skill and hardwork in order to succeed in the game. Second, it enhances one's creativity. You get to choose genre and categories to create the game you want. You can even name it.

In fact, you are gauranteed to win if you follow a wiki on what levels you need to put into one of the three categories.  I memorized what to do without the wiki.  The game practically tells you how to make better games with popups and hints.  This feels like a mobile game converted to PC, and for a mobile game, I'd buy it if it weren't for the fact I already got it on steam.  It's fun for a bit, it's different, I did have enjoyment, however, it's very repetative, not complex, and down right gets boring after you beat it.

For example, I got to the era where the ps3 was released, so I decided to try and make a type of retro game using a old engine and maing it small. You can probably bet the critics hated the crap out of it and they did. I think that game got a score of 2. Also, the way the scoring system works is really weird and counter-productive.Doing well in the early parts of this game will hurt you in the long run.I guess its because the critics get their stardards so high that a game made sistematically perfect by a guide will end up doing average.Also, the lack of a real competition system with other game devs hurts the game overall. In the endgame, you can go number 1 in G3 always as long as you pick the large option.Overall, this shouldn't be considered a tycoon game for its missing flexibility and the lack of in-depth sistems."

It is averygood game at first, despite a lack of polish here and there (inexplicable error message on first launch, the odd spelling/grammatical error in the dialog boxes, etc.). Therefore, I think it is worth gettingon sale.However, it quickly gets old; mostly, I think, due to its cyclical mechanics and unrealistic time scale. As a simulator, these factors take away from the experience. For example, a game may take as little as several months to produce, bug-free, and is ""on the market"" for only a short time, even if it is a smash hit. The result is that you must constantly churn out game after game, whereas I naturally tend towards producing 3 or 4 titles that I can release the next installments for periodically -- not unlike real life. By the fourth year, having produced several hits and sitting at a cool 4.4 million, with a new office, an employee, and lots to research/train, I said to myself, ""Just 31 years to go...ugh"".So that's basically it for me. Something tells me that I stopped right when the game was about to get its second wind. I've no doubt that I'll pick it up from time to time to tinker with.

Of course I have dreamed about making my own games at times.  So I just had to try this game.  I have played it a good bit, and I am not quite done playing it still.The game follows the historical progression of gaming technology in a parodied way.   Instead of Xbox's it is all Ybox's and stuff like that.  In one way I enjoyed that because it takes you down memory lane.  Ah yes the fabled Dreamcast.  However it also left me knowing what to expect.  I didn't bother buying licenses to produce on certain platforms because I already knew those platforms were not a big sucess in the real world.The trailer says ""create games your way.""  You can do that, but they'll flop.  This game seems to have a fairly narrow view of what kinds of games will be successesful.  Although it's entirely possible I just have not figured out how to break out of the mold.  It's ironic because the devolpers of this game are thinking out of the box somewhat with their game about thinking within the box of of what maybe EA games would tell their staff to make.  Just like the historical technology in the game, the definition of what can be a success also appears to be tied to gaming history.They have opened this up to the workshop, so that's really cool.  I haven't used it yet, but am excited to see where it takes the game.Even with my reservations I really do like the game.  It is a fun simulation and it is challenging.  I'll make my company grow for a while only to run afoul with a couple flops and then be strapped for cash.  It keeps me wanting to try again.I think it is a fair price and would be a good addition for anyone who likes simulations or is interested in the history of gaming.  Also worth mentioning is that the game has a good bit of educational value as well.  It teaches bits of finance and company management.  Good game!"

Slightly high price (considering the simple game mechanics).This feels more like a $5 title than a $10 title.However I bought it at nearly full price to support the developers and its well worth it.2.

There are also some very big flaws in the design of this game, i.e. any new technological innovation you've made has to be incorporated into an entirely new game engine, you can't even properly make a sequel without researching it first when you get the option to in the midgame, and you will randomly get punished with bad or mediocre review scores for really stupid reasons, even if you sink a lot of design and technology points into your release.Mods only go so far as to fix some of the game's glaring flaws.

As are most of the 'challenges' added by the devs to hide the fact that you're just calculating values and comparing it to the devs spreadsheet. Yawn."

This is a very casual version of a simulator or tycoon game. You'll never manage more than about 7 employees at any time and you can't control their pay. If you like micromanagement, there's none of that here.The story follows the actual events of the past 35 years of gaming and so it's incredibly predictable even on the first play through. The development of game is initially challenging, but once you figure out the forumal you'll be rolling in cash. Marketing is just lump sum - no advertising AFTER the game has been released. That means if you have a runaway hit you have no means of pushing it for greater sales.This feels much more like an ipad game than a true simulation. If it's on sale, get it and enjoy it for a few hours. I do not recommend it at it's retail price.I would LOVE to see this game (or a sequel) that really involves true simulation/micromanagement/etc. Let me really manage the employees, the advertising, the packaging, heck even the janitorial services.TL:DR - very casual, loses appeal quickly but initially fun and addicting"

Those memories were brutally shattered after two playthroughs. At a certain point, about seven hours in to the game, reviews change instantaniously from 8.5 and more to 4.5 or less. On two different save files this happened, so I went online and read up on what games to create and great consoll, genre and audience combinations. Regardless the effort, getting back the sales and reviewes that had been given consistently since ""the garage"" was impossible. The twoes and threes kept coming. Fantasy/RPG, you name it. Bankruptcy on all attempts. So I jumped back on both save files and tried following game creation guides from a point where it all seemed to be going great. The reviews where flying all over the place, 9.75, 9.5, 9, everything was going great again, I could finally get that fuzzy feeling again when Game Dev Tycoon came to mind. But on both occations, with everything researched, the reviews turned sour at the same point as previously. So I do not recommend the game as it now appears. There is no logic in the difficulty patched by the developers of this game. If you crave for a great game dev game, Game Dev Story is much better."

So is a Typing game with a steering wheel.Positives:-Charming, plain graphics that aren't too hard on the eyes.-Provoking, legitimate strategy when it comes to making a successful game. It isn't just about having correct focuses such as Gameplay or Artifical Intelligence, but also properly using your game's theme in conjunction with the Rating/game console, using specially trained employees to highlight game aspects, research, etc.-The game's difficulty and complexity growth isn't too sudden, most mechanics are pretty easy to understand when they're introduced.-Overall charm and dialogue of the game is fun, it's clear the developers were intentional with their easter-eggs and choices.-Mod support, though modest, is still available and can add to the experience like with many Steam games.Negatives-There are only a couple of soundtracks used, and though they're nice the first time around, it does get a bit tiresome as they loop often.-Replayability is a mixed bag; it's fun to try different strategies and game-styles you didn't try before, but if you know what you're doing, it can become an easy trip until the later years/consoles. Though going for certain achievements can help spice things up a fair bit.-This is a personal note, but I find that the only way to get some of the most interesting parts, such as making an online MMO or your very own console, is to play incredibly optimally or to have the year limit higher than default. More of a nitpick than anything.Overall, I really like Game Dev Tycoon! The price is near perfect for what the game gives you imo, and if you're a fan of tycoons or simple strategy games, this one should be right up your alley.Just make sure to get all the bugs out of your game and you'll be golden!"

It's the first game in two months that made me stay up late so I could keep playing it. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, allowing you to get right to the important business of building and customizing your games. And when you finally get that first 10 rating, and that first million bucks, everything has been worth it. Greatly looking forward to sequels/updates/mods/finishing the game.-----This is five weeks and 40 hours of additional gameplay after that first paragraph. I still recommend this game, but with a lot less enthusiasm. The game gets very repetitive after a while, especially because financial success hinges on putting out one near-perfect game every few years or so, with everything else just being filler. I absolutely hope there's a bigger badder sequel in a year or two, one that addresses the following issues:Idiot Publishers: Your mid-game is overly dependent on using publishers so you can make larger games for more money and fans. But more often than not the publisher will either ask for a game you haven't researched, a format you don't have rights to, or a terrible topic/genre combo. I get that it's supposed to make you take chances and expand your options, but if I'm desperate and need a medium game fast, I'd like to actually be able to make one.Employee Stagnation: In order for their skills to improve, your employees must train. Making games gives them nothing; you MUST spend time and research points and capitol on boosting their skills. And you have to do this a lot, which means that you can't be constantly working on games - or researching new topics/engine elements.Chronic Indie Mindset: Even once you hit the late game and become an industry juggernaut, it's still just seven dudes cranking out a game. Yes, you can eventually develop a hardware lab and an R&D department, but they don't directly assist in game-making. I want to become a monster, with dozens - or even hundreds - of employees, making multiple games at once, training some people while others are dedicated to improving my engine and so on.Research Bottleneck: As mentioned above, you need research points to train employees as well as to research new topics and game engine elements. The only way to generate RP for most of the game is to make more games, a newer engine, or generate a game report. As such, you often end up falling behind in either training or engine (or god forbid, both) as you struggle to devote enough points to their multiple needs. I'd recommend being able to create an R&D lab much sooner, thus giving the player many more points to work with, rather than reducing point requirements.Hardware Focused: When I first started playing, I really loved how the game told the history of gaming consoles, as it's not something you hear about a lot when researching gaming history. But consoles are almost exclusively the only outside influence on your game-making. Nothing about software or legal battles or any of that. Just console development. And while interesting, it's such a small part of the story.Forced Conformity: One of this game's mechanics has you matching game topics to genres; the better the match, the better it sells. In other words, you can't make a unique game. For example, according to GDT, Prison/RPG is an okay combination. But what if I want to make a stellar Prison/RPG? Instead of just stating that such-and-such a combination is good or bad, it should be up to the player to make it good or bad. Also, the entire nation of Japan would like to say something about Romance/RPG not being a great combination; I have 60 hours of gameplay and that still messes me up.And yet despite all those flaws, it's still an enjoyable game. In my last playthrough I jokingly made a Vampire RPG called Count of Calypso and it got me out of the basement. The three sequels got me into the final game stage, paid for my R&D lab and new game engine, and became the game I was known for, respectively. I created the Fallout franchise with the help of Dave Johnson, head of Departure Science. Tom Schoffer is somehow a tech genius and became my first AI specialist. I made Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and won the game before I could releas Half-Life 3.

As you increase your ability as a developer you increase your stats of technology and design, which allows you to make better games.  As you make better games you make more money, which allows you to upgrade from your garage into offices.  Once you enter the realm of being a professional developer in offices you are able to hire employees and designate their responsibilities from design to technology to research.  All of it works together to allow you to keep upgrading your office, employees, and games.This game has a way of keeping you hooked.  You get so focused on making sure your next game release is better then your last.  Before you know it, hours have passed and you have work in the morning.I highly recommend this game.

The graphics while somewhat simple are actually quite a nice touch. In many respects this is not too disimilar to many other Tycoon based games. There are some really nice touches like how the pcitures of the different cosnoles acrtually look like the ones we all knew and loved (original NES, SNES, Master System ect). Overall the game is quite addicitve, especially once you get into developing and releasing MMO's and expansions.For the price its well worth picking up. It does have its moments, but I think once you have played it thorugh a few times you are probably done. Certainly not a timeless classic, but none the less a decent tycoon / sim game which you should get a few weeks of enjoyment out of. There are some mods you can get from the steam workshop which would probably add a bit more longevity to the overall expereince so well worth going there and checking them out. Only had this a few days, but I do like it.In a nutshell its simply, quirky and fairly addicitive in the short term."

Many of the combinations in the game are obvious, and the only real excitement you get is when you create a game that gets ""10"" reviews across the board from every ""reviewer"". These reviewers tend to be little ♥♥♥♥♥es, and before you ever create a perfect game, one of these little ♥♥♥♥♥es will give you a 9. You'll probably cry for a couple of hours like I did, but then you'll feel a little better and MAYBE replay it if you're feeling like you should be beat in the face a little more.I mean, the game has good replayability value when it comes to perfecting your algorythm and getting that perfect game, but it's tough to enjoy the game at face value when everything tends to not only be the same, but also ridiculously predictable, whether it be console releases, or which console will be on top in the ""war"" (SNES>genesis, RIP dreamcast gone too soon, and N64>PS1). There isn't a whole lot to discover in this game after you get three or so good combinations. It was too easy for me to continuously switch between sequels for my RPG ""ELDERLY WRITTEN PASSAGES"" and my shooter ""Shut up mom, I'm in the middle of a match"" and consistently get high ratings and drown in it (the cash, that is).Overall, it's a fun experience the first time, especially if you don't remember the early console wars, but after that, the fun dwindles down.

,Recommended,239820,7391565,"Posted: 15 October, 2013",all,Τinkerbell,"As an Indie game, this is not bad.I'm a fan of the original Tycoon games, so it's safe for me to say that this Indie game made it pretty far. If you think about it, it's not about the graphics or music - it's about the strategy and the satisfaction you get from that successful achievement of being, well, successful. This is one feeling we all have deep down inside and it can come from anywhere, real life scenarios, or video games.Rather you're fishing and finally got a hook, or moving to the next stage in this game it's the same feeling of accomplishment. The only thing the game lacks is maybe a higher time frame between console releases. It seems to be a little too fast-paced when you're actually sitting here playing it. This game could also use a meter on how fast you'd like time to pass rather it's real-time or 100x faster for example.Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Allows your creativity to fly-Good engine-Basic controls (Rather you're a gaming veteran or a newcomer, anyone can play with ease)Cons:-No control on the time flow-You'll mostly always feel rushed-Could use some more tweakingOverall, I'd give this a 8/10. I can tell this took some time to actually develop - as I said before it's not about the graphics or music that made this the game it is today, it's the gameplay. From what I can tell, it took awhile to actually make this game fully functional which needs to be credited. This could be a text-based game and I'd still enjoy it.Would I recommend it? Maybe, I wouldn't say $10 USD would be worth Game Dev Tycoon, however I'd say around the $4.99 or lower range (on sale) would be reasonable. Some have regrets about buying this game, you need to give it time or maybe start over. The point is, have fun."

It's just so easy to pick up and play,  and it can take a very long time to master or even simply complete the game. I often found my self ecstatic whenever i made a perfect 10/10 game, and  what makes it so special is the reward you get for creating a master piece, keeping you exited and happy.

You are supposedly warped back in time to 1985 to a reference-filled (hint: flux capacitor) garage, where you begin your endeavour into the gaming history books. Like any developer who travels in time to 1985, you are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥at programming because the technology is so different.  You have a computer that's literally worse than a modern graphing calculator, yet you decide to make games. If you are successful, you can grow your garage into an actual company, with actual people, and actual results. You have to strategically market your games for specific audiences (you know, like ""T for Teen"" or ""E for Everyone"") and try to match genres to different gaming platforms to different audiences.For example, kids. In the real world, devices like the Nintendo DS (which reminds me, tell you later) or the great old Gameboy are very popular. Add a role-playing/ adventure game like the Legend of Zelda, and you're all set. Target marketing at young people, and kaboom: ez skins, ez life. Although ""skins"" probably means nothing to the world of the 1980s and 90s.So, now, about the NDS. The developers, in an effort to give you a good laugh, and avoid copyright infringement, have sort of parodied every console on the market. If I'm correct, the Nintendo GameCube's counterpart is the GameSphere. It's actually kinda freaking amazing.I'll give GDT a solid 8, maybe an 8.5 because of the extensive workshop mod support.TL;DR: Time travel to 1985, make games, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es, get money. 8.5/10"

While many games can be reduced to the math to some extent, the art of hiding this, or simply increasing the complexity to the point where optimization is no longer feasible due to multiple constraints and varying situations, is crucial.Game Dev Tycoon has nothing to do with making games. It is solely concerned with making the player drag around a set of sliders to find the optimal combinations, in the pursuit of ever larger numbers. The window-dressing of a game development studio is immaterial, as it impacts precisely nothing.This is not to say that it is a bad spreadsheet, in and of itself. The game is perfectly functional, and the puzzle of searching for ideal combinations might satisfy an evening, or more for the kind of person that enjoys the optimization challenge.

,Recommended,239820,14472013,"Posted: 14 February, 2015",all,daniel,"The story of the game is that you go back to the year 1985 and start your own game company. You start off in a garage which you can upgrade to a technical suite and more! As time progresses there are news popups which describe events that are taking place in the gaming industry at the time. For example: Vonny has just released their second video game system. Some games you make may be a smash hit but others not so great, you must be wise with the topic, genre and console. You can earn millions or become bankrupt. To improve the chance of making a great game is to hire staff which becomes available in the upgraded garage (becomes the technical suite). The staff can be used to help make games, research topics and research different features of the engine.When you start off, the game may be a bit tricky but once you learn which topic matches with which genre it will seem easier. With the ability to make games there is a cost. At the start of each career you recieve a certain budget which you can use to develop your first game! It randomly selects the first topics you can use so don't excpect to get the one you want. During making games with the budget you can go bankrupt, although it seems bad you can get two chances before you finally go bankrupt and have to start over.Overall Rating: 9/10 (Highly Recommended)I rate this game a 9 out of 10 because of how addicting it is, the details of the game and the dream of any gamer to make their own game company. Green Heart Games need to make a few tweaks which are only little ones. For example when the reviews of the games you make pop up it takes 20 seconds to display all of them. I feel that this wastes time but you can download a mod off of the workshop to reduce it to 1 second but hopefully they will change it anyway :).Thanks for reading this review and good luck with your game company :)Daniel"

,Recommended,239820,8481912,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,Bit Bandit ツ,"Game Dev Tycoon is a strategy game developed by Greenheart games. You begin the game by naming your character with limited customization and naming your company, then with a very helpful tutorial system, you're off to create games as you see fit.When you start, the only thing you can do is create a game, you can make it text based or 2-D gameplay, but as you progress through the years you will be able to research new things such as the ability to make a 3-D engine, better A.I., environmental effects, all that stuff. To get these research ideas, you must get research points by making a game, engine, or doing something like creating a report on what you did wrong when developing your game.When you begin making your game, you can choose the genre, which topic it will be based on (Ancient history, ninjas, spies) and choosing which systems it will be onYou can also create your own engine with many of these research skills, which can cost quite a lot sum of dosh. When developing your game, you have to use 3 sliders to see how much time you want to spend on a part of a game, for example, do you focus on the story more than the game or vice versa? Graphics or sound, A.I. or Dialogue? As you develop your game, Journalists will ask for interviews and ask on you're opinion on things such as what's important in a genre of a game, you can also hype up the game by saying stuff like ""*Name* will be one of the greatest"", you can also sign missions such as a plan to get women into gaming which will cost you, but earn you a lot of fans and respect. Once you've created your game, you will gain experience in pretty much all your skills such as your story writing, gameplay designing, sound and graphics, etc. The game will also then  be reviewed by 4 reviewers, you may start by getting 5s, 4s, and probably 2s, but once you've managed to get your first 10 out of 10, you will want to raise your hand in success.If you've done badly, you can generate a game report which can give you advise, such as the Commodore 64 has a large adventure fanbase, or the PC community has a large strategy fanbase, and whether things such as dialogue is important for certain genres.However, if you still manage to do badly, you will enter bankrupcy and will have to take a loan from the bank, fail that, game over.As you earn more money, you can move into bigger offices where you can recruit more staff members as well as make the place look very pretty.As you make good games you will gain fans, who will definatly buy your games and if you got 100K of them, you'll be able to self publish your games, you can also sign publish contracts with companies such as úbersoft or Electronic Mass Productions to gain notice in the industry, but they'll call the shots on what you make.Later in the game you can also build your custom console to release onto the market.I gotta say, the gameplay is pretty damn addicting, so much so I've been spending 6 hours into a single play session which I never really do a lot, and that says something for me.Nothing to say in the visual department, it looks clean and reminds me of a few flash games.The sound is pretty good too, nice beeps and bloops and the music keeps a smile on my face 99% of the time.As far as complaints go.....well, there isn't any on the top of my head to be honest, I was too occupied in making games and having too much fun to notice any.Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is a brilliant game and you should absolutly purchase it as soon as you can.I'd play it for decades.9/10"

In that time you upgrade your HQ add other game devs to your team. GAMEPLAY: Click anywhere on the screen to go to a menu usually I either reserched or devoloped a new game. When you develop a game you pick a topic, pick a genre,( two later on) what console it will be on, the engine, and the name(which doesn't effect the game at all). When you start developing something it'll have these dots( either orange: design, dark orange: bugs, blue: technology, and dark blue: research) they will go to these tabs and these also depend on how good your game is. Also these menus pop up where say you can only have 99 jelly beans. Which Those are divided into 3 parts (3 times for a game) you can only have 99 jelly beans so, say if you want to focus more on graphic than sound then sound could be like 66 jelly beans and the other two are 33.

Even with multi-genre mixups it's pretty self-explanatory on how to allocate your time during development. Past this thin surface level of gameplay, there really isn't enough depth to keep you going.A lot of seemingly obvious features are missing from the development process, probably to keep the game simpler and more accessible, but I feel like a lot of replayability is lost in their absence. For every step in the development process of a game, I found myself wanting more concise control, but this is by no means a game of micro-management. You market your game by pressing ""market"" and have little to no input on HOW your game is marketed, for example. The success of your game winds up relying on when you release your game, and how you allocated your time. It's so bare-bones and minimal that the sense of achievement wears off quickly and you begin to feel like you're not working for your success.That being said, I still played for about 10-12 hours before it was effortles and mundane, so I think I still got my moneys worth. If you're looking for a simple game to relax to where you don't have to do much aside from click through menu's, it's a great choice, and that's really all I wanted."

The plot is fantastic and I love how it uses true events with slightly renamed consoles and games, far better than if they made up all the consoles and games. The game gives you a lot of choice, is very simple to understand and with so many different possibilities and outcomes, the game has yet to become stale for me so far.However, in my hour so far of playing, I am already finding it very hard to make perfect games. Whilst game reports are a very good way to get information about good and bad combos, the reviews are lacking in depth with some simply saying things like 'Enjoyed it' and 'Good'. If the reviewers went into more depth like they sometimes do when mentioning things like 'medieval works really well with strategy' then I'd much prefer the reviews and actually find them useful, however, as it stands, the best way to get information on your game is to file a game report.Whilst I have not played this game for too long, my first impressions are for the most part very positive. The game is very simple to play and is perfect for some relaxing late-night gaming. The game adds enough challenge with its numerous choices and certainly does require a lot of thought into some decisions in order to maintain enough money to save yourself from going bankrupt, however isn't impossibly difficult to grasp.Overall, my opinion on 'Game Dev Tycoon' is very positive, however I do feel the lack of in-depth reviews really does hinder its potential. But this is one con among many pros and should certainly not put you off playing this wonderfully unique experience.Rating: 3/4"

76561198103953421,Recommended,239820,12784403,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Mr. ZAP,"Have you ever dreamed of being a game developer and designing the perfect game? Well, now you can!Game Dev Tycoon is a charming business sim where your main aim is to make great games (and rake in cash by doing so). The system is fairly simple: pick a genre and platform, then adjust the sliders as needed to allocate different amounts of time to different aspects of the game, and assigning different people to handle said aspects. However, while the basic development process is simple and easy to grasp, there's a surprising amount of depth to the game. As you progress through the years, new platforms will appear on the market, and you'll be able to unlock new genres of games to make, and new features to put in your custom engines, so that you can customize your games to be just about anything you want them to be. Eventually you'll be able to do massive projects like AAA games, MMOs, and even original consoles. Mods for the game often add even more features, topics, and events, increasing the customizability. All of this makes a really simple but entertaining and addictive game, as you let your imagination run free.The game has very bare-bones graphics, but it doesn't really need much to work anyway. The main appeal of the game is letting your imagination form its own image of what kind of games you're making, and trying to make them as good and successful as possible. It doesn't have much music either, but what few music tracks it does have are nice enough, Still, it wouldn't have hurt to add a few more songs.It's not a perfect game, though. While the customization aspect is one of the main draws, it can actually end up a drawback as well, in a couple of ways. First, there are sometimes simply TOO MANY options, and not enough resources to obtain them for use (a problem that can be exacerbated by mods that add even more). See, the way you unlock new genres and engine features, is by researching them by spending research points. You get these by developing games and engines, and by completing contract work, but you don't have any control over how many you get, while new features keep costing more and more as the game goes on (each new genre costs 10 RP... early engine features like mono sound also cost 10-15, but more advanced ones will cost 20, 40, 80, or more, up to 200). You also have to spend research points to upgrade your team's skills, spreading them even more thin. This can often feel imbalanced, and like you never have enough points to upgrade what you want.There is also, unfortunately, a degree of railroading in the customization as well, because while you can make whatever kind of game you like, there are pre-set combinations listed as successful or otherwise on different platforms. You CAN go and make that Horror Simulation game for Young audiences, but you shouldn't expect it to score or sell as well as a Fantasy RPG, or indeed very well in any case. It would have been nice if the game had let you be a little more innovative and out-of-the-box with your games.Still, despite these drawbacks, the core of the game is still very solid. It's still loads of fun to make new games. It's fun to try and get new features to add to them. The business end of it, while a little on the light side, is also good. Altogether this makes for a good, if not amazing, simulator that you'll still find yourself sinking plenty of hours into.As a bonus, it does come with a lot of fun achievements of various levels of difficulty (a lot of which are hidden but can be looked up), and Steam cards, for those who like those kinds of things.Good luck, and remember: always aim for 11s."

Consols come and go and you almost have no chance to develop anything for them so you stay at one system you know well (the PC) and stick with it.You have to train your avatar and staff using reseach points, which are not to easy to get in abundance.When you have enough research points and a trained staff at the final phase the game is almost over.Some of the user interface is also no designed perfectly, but that may be my personal taste.All in all a fun little experience with potential."

Period.Game Dev Tycoon is a game about starting from the bottom to rise up the ladder and become a sucessful Game Developer. There are many various events that occur during the timeline (early 80's +) like new consoles, office upgrades, offers from ""Agent Blowfish"" to savatage other game companies, and scammers from other countries. It is very easy to play and understand, but can be hard to survive the years without going bankrupt.When I started playing, I started 2 or 3 saves and went bankrupt in the Garage on each one. Then on my 4th, I survived long enough to move into the first Office. I stayed there for a while and even managed to survive to the first Office upgrade. But alas, I went into the land of Bankrupcy once more. Then, I got the gist of the game and tried again, this time with some new stratagies. Now, I'm waaay past the last event and the console lab. All my employees are 1000+ on every aspect and still going strong. In my games, I make maybe 4-6 new games during the start, then I just keep making sequels of them (For Example: I make a Music/Simulation game called Musik Maker, then I just keep making Musik Makers on and on every now and then (Musik Maker 2, Musik Maker 3, Musik Maker 4, etc.)). I may occasionally make another new series but I usually stick to the same games, and all my games are always named after real games! :DAnother great thing about Game Dev Tycoon was Mod Support. If you go on the Forums, there are plenty of Mods available and being made (The game was made in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so it shouldn't be too hard for Programmers to mod). And you are probably thinking, ""HACKS, CHEATS, UNLEGITNESS! NO MODS FOR ME!"". It turns out, most of the Mods are just Expansion Packs adding new consoles or events or options. To my knowledge there is only 1 Cheat Mod, and it's called Cheat Mod... :P It's actually pretty fun to use on a seperate save (Call it ""CHEATERZ"" or something) because you can skip to any place in the timeline and when you are developing a game, there are little plus sign orbs below that add points to your game design and technology (I have made games with 50K points each :D). I'd reccommend Mods to users who have played Game Dev Tycoon a lot and are bored of the origanal and are looking for more and for those who just want more.The game itself takes maybe 5+ hours to squeeze all the story out and is actually a bit short (But with expansion mods, Game Dev Tycoon = MOAR FUN!). Some of the achivements are really hard to get (Oh yeah, MODS DONT DISABLE ACHIVEMENTS! So if you are REALLY stuck, the Cheat Mod comes in handy :} ) and a bunch of them are Easter Eggs (I'm not spoiling :)).Overall, this game is really worth getting. 10$ is a BIT much, but it's so worth it.

After playing around with various combinations of genres, you can import the effectiveness ratings for any new games that you make in a new playthrough.Gameplay: Many people who pick up this game have likely come across Game Dev Story from Kairosoft. Obvious influence aside, this game adds its own flavor to the game dev ""genre."" Without spoiling too much, eventually the game opens up to give the player many options through building a research team. The progression is streamlined and feels complete. The player starts in a garage and eventually finds himself the head of a major gaming corporation. With this progression, the complexity of the game changes drastically, but, for the most part, these changes are largely cosmetic in nature. The core gameplay is not particularly deep or even challenging. Any gaming vet will know which combinations work vs. which don't through common sense alone, without the need for a guide to hold your hand.Price/Value: Overall, expect to invest somewhere between 10-20 hours on this game. If this is something you deem fair for a $10 price tag, then by all means go for it. Those 10-20 hours will be a lot of fun. However, if longetivity is your concern, then perhaps wait for a steam sale. At the time of this writing, the game is on sale for $5. At this price I can wholeheartedly recommend you pick it up.Score: 7/10"

,Recommended,239820,7943195,"Posted: 6 December, 2013",all,Red Leader,"Game Dev Tycoon is one of those surprises that you find along your game year. I was waiting until Steam Sale to purchase this game, due to lack of reviews/people talking about it. You see, I'm a big fan of Tycoon games, and its easy to play one of this genre and see a lot of mistakes/bugs ruining the gameplay. This is not true to GDT. If I knew what I know now, I'd purchase this game right away.Combining a good mixture of good design and gameplay, Greenheart Games made me feel like the little guy in the garage building my first game. You see, with Tycoon games you usually see yourself as the manager or some kind of God Like creature. In this title I felt so compelled to strive that I couldn't wait to release my major game and everytime a so-so review came in, I felt dissapointed.The pacing is great. Along the years you see consoles rise and fall and new technologies appear. Eventually you move out of your little garage and a office takes place. Then a fellow co-worker or two...And when you realize, its been 20 years already and you're a multi-million game dev studio, with lots of employees and each one with a different skill.Although the interface is not winning Design award of the Year, it's still very user friendly, and will leave no room for doubt as to where things are and how they work.This game takes me back to the time where I found a sentiment of ""wonder"" in games.

The gaming industry can be very finicky, and usually successful games are successful if the market and timing is just right. But to anyone that thinks that they can make video games, here ya go. Starting you off at the beginning of the video game revolution, but just after the Video Game Crash of '83, this game puts you in the role of a software designer. I use that term over video game maker because you can develop game engines, pick up white hat hacking jobs from different companies for cash and develop games for a variety of consoles. I got as far as the Playstation/N64 era with my games, and saw the release of the Dreamcast, but I failed due to poor decisions, rehashes, and bad marketing. It's not that the game is tough, you should just know that you can't expect a great game just because of a name, which is true to real life. I highly recommend this game, not only because of how real it felt, but also because of how much fun it is. If you've ever wondered if you could make video games for a living, believe me, this game is for you."

Also, there seems to be a pretty active mod scene but I didn't go into that.The concept is a simple simulation or Tycoon type game where you play as a one man indie game developer who slowly grows his/her company into a major game developer woth tens of millions of dollars.This is done through a really simple interface. You just pick the topic and type of game you're making and then allocate resources to various aspects of game development such as artificial intelligence or level design. This gains more nuances as you advance in the game but game development remains the same simple core mechanic for the whole experience. There's also other things you can do to benefit your company such as contract work, marketing, etc. There are also random events that can hurt or benefit you depending on how you respond to them a la FTL.It's a fun experience overall if you enjoy these sorts of business simulation games. It also strikes a special chord with a lot of gamers who can take the opportunity to name their games after popular franchises or just push stupid crap onto the gaming audience.I do have a few gripes though. Although the game does retain some information on how certain games should ideally be made the game doesn't really tell you a whole lot. There were several times where I thought I was following the instructions on how to make a successfull game but it flopped and I had no idea why even after doing a game report. Also, I think it's unfair that certain topic/genre combinations can't be successful if handled properly. I personally think my Werewolf RTS game would be great. Also, I think it's unrealistic that 1. People in this universe seem to follow game reviews very closely and 2. It's not possible to have a huge success with a bad game, that♥♥♥♥♥♥happens in real life all the time.However, although I might pick it up again eventually, especially to try out some mods.

Yine bu barlarıda arttırıp azaltıyorsunuz.Örn: Bir aksiyon oyununda yapay zeka önemliyse onu yukarı çekin.Tüm barları ayarladığınızda yine ''tamam''a basıp bir süre adamınızın o barlara göre oyunu tasarlamasını bekliyoruz.3.Aşama: Bu aşamadaki barlar ise , dünya tasarımı , grafik ve ses.Burada da barları yukarı veya aşşağı çekerek vericeğimiz zamanı değerlendiriyoruz.Örn :Bir aksiyon oyununda grafik önemli ise onu yukarı çekiceksiniz.Bunları ayarladıktan sonra yine ''tamam''a basıp devam ediyorsunuz.Ve oyununuz hazır ! 3.Aşamayıda yaptıktan sonra karşınıza bir ekran çıkıyor ve 2 seçenek beliriyor : Çöp kutusuna at veya oyunu yayınla.Siz oyuna yeni başladığınız için tabikide oyunu yayınla seçeneğini seçiceksiniz.Vee oyununuz yayınlandı ! Oyununuzu yayınladıktan bir ekran beliriyor sonra yaptığınız kombinasyona ve barlardaki yukarı aşağı seçimlerinize göre 4 adet oyun profesyoneli veya dergisi(artık ne diyorsanız) oyununuza 10 üzerinden bir puan veriyor.Aldığınız puanların ortalamasına göre oyununuzun satışlarıda değişiyor.Örneğin hepsinden 10 puan aldığınız bir oyunla , hepsinden 5 aldığınız oyunun satışları arasından bir hayli fark oluyor.Oyun hakkında anlatılacak daha çok şey var fakat çok fazla şey yazdım.Oyüzden burada bitiriyorum.Eğer oyunla ilgili sorunlarınız veya bilmek istediğiniz şeyler varsa bana mesaj atarak ulaşabilirsiniz.Ve oyunu almak hakkında tereddüte düştüyseniz hiç tereddüt etmeden alın.Verdiğimiz paranın her kuruşunu hakeden bir oyun ! İncelemem hoşunuza gittiyse ve oyun hakkında ufakta olsa bir fikir edindiyseniz ne mutlu bana... İyi Oyunlar !"

Keep in mind, that I'm not that good at speaking English, but I hope it's okay for you.*Game Dev Tycoon, was mache ich nur mit dir?In Game Dev Tycoon könnt ihr die Historie der Spieleentwicklung erneut miterleben. Ihr seid ein Programmierer, der in seiner Garage beginnt, Spiele zu entwickeln, sich hocharbeitet, eigene Spiele-Engines entwickeln und schließlich eine Firma mit bis zu fünf Angestellten besitzt. Ihr könnt im LateGame auch eigene Konsolen entwerfen oder einen Online-Dienst anbieten.Ausschlaggebend für euren Erfolg ist die Qualität der Spiele, wenn sie richtig gut sind muss auch die Frequenz der Releases nicht allzu hoch sein, da ein guter Titel sehr schnell sehr viele Einnahmen bescheren kann.Das Spiel ist in einem humorvollen Stil gehalten, was auch die einfache, comichafte Grafik wiederspiegelt. Da die Entwickler von Game Dev Tycoon anscheinend nicht das Geld für Lizenzen der großen Spielehersteller bzw. Hardwarehersteller hatten, entwickelt ihr beispielsweise später im Spiel Games für die mBox oder das PlaySystem. Diese Anspielungen sind durchwegs lustig und haben mir immer wieder ein Lächeln auf die Lippen gezaubert.Doch nun zu der Core-Mechanik von Game Dev Tycoon, und diese ist der Grund, warum ich mich nicht entscheiden kann, ob es gut oder schlecht ist: die Spieleentwicklung. Der einzige Weg, ein Spiel zu entwickeln, ist, indem ihr jeweils drei Balken so verschiebt, wie es euch passt, wobei euch das Spiel nie genau sagt, was wofür zuständig ist. Wo liegt beispielsweise der unterschied zwischen Graphic und World Design? Ist beides eine ""Design-Category""? Oder doch ""Technical""?Auch die Reviews, die eure Spiele bekommen, geben darüber nicht wirklich Aufschluss, und ihr könnt zwar sogenannte ""Game Reports"" erstellen, allerdings bringen auch diese nur bedingt einen Vorteil. So wisst ihr dann zwar, dass zum Beispiel Action und Military oder Dungeon und RPG gut zusammenpasst, oder dass für eines dieser Spiele die Dialoge sehr wichtig ist, allerdings kennt ihr dennoch nicht die genaue Zusammensetzung, und so ist es manchmal fast mehr Trial&Error als Spaß.Mich persönlich haben diese Negativpunkte aber nie wirklich massiv gestört, so dass für mich das Spiel immer noch Spaß gemacht hat. Ob derartige Probleme für einen das Spiel vermiesen oder nicht, muss jeder selbst wissen.So kann ich zu guter letzt nur sagen: Wenn euch die von mir angesprochenen negativen Aspekte nicht allzu stören (ja, es klingt absurd, ein Spieleentwicklungs-spiel in dem das Spieleentwickeln die Schwachstelle ist^^), und ihr so wie ich mit den positiven so eine Freude habt, dass diese dafür aufwiegen, schaut euch Game Dev Tycoon unbedingt an. Vor allem in einem Sale ist es richtig günstig zu haben, allerdings können die ganz Enthusiastischen unter euch auch beim Normalpreis bedenkenlos zuschlagen.*****Game Dev Tycoon, what do I think of you...?In Game Dev Tycoon you can take part in the history of gaming and replay it. You are a programmer, who starts to make games in his garage, then works his way up, starts to create custom engines, and ends up having up to five employees and being one of the big players in gaming developement. In late game, you can even create your own online-device or launch your very own console.To be sucessfull, you've got to develope good games. In case you manage to make really good ones, you don't need to publish a new game every five minutes, only a few will be enough, but if you're games aren't too good... EA knows what I'm talking about. :PThe game is in a humerous and funny style, which is supported by the comic-like graphics. Another funny thing is, that the developers of Game Dev Tycoon probably hadn't had the money for licenses, so later on you develope games for consoles such as the mBox and the PlaySystem. This was something I really enjoyed.But now, let's step into the core-mechanics of Game Dev Tycoon, and this is the reason why I can'T decide wether I like the game or not, wether it's good or bad: developing games. You can only develope a game by moving the kind of bars, which represent one aspect of game-developement. But there's a problem with those, because they aren't well explained. For example: What's the difference between Graphic and World Design? Is both to put into the ""Design-Topic""? Or is it the technical part? Or something totally different?Furthermore, when your game is reviewed, you don't get any more real information about what was good or bad (mainly meaning the bars). Well, you can create a game report, but they don't tell you too much either. For example, they might have you know that Action and Military or Dungeon and RPG are a good combination, or that for a certain game Dialogues are more important than for another, but they don't tell much, so in some cases it's more Trial&Error than fun.For me, the negative points haven't been too bad, so I still had fun with the game, but if you think of buying the game, you have to decide yourself. I'm not saying it's super good or super bad, it has it's qualities and shortcomings, but you'll have to decide yourself, wether it could still be fun or not.Finally, there's nothing more to say than this: If you don't care to much about the negative points (yuhurr, it's sounding absurd, a game about developing games where the game-developing part is the shortcoming^^), and you still think like you could have fun with Game Dev Tycoon, go, take a look at it. But I'd recommend buying it in one of the Steam Sales, it's pretty cheap them, but if you're really enthusiasthic, you can also go and buy it straight right now."

But it’s wasn’t enough to just make games with such primitive technology, and thus I built the VGE 1 (Vosoros Games Engine 1)…or VEG as I liked to joke at times, and still do.Oh I could hear the groans of my future staff I one day hoped to hire and help me build this company up further…And so it eventually came to pass that I did outgrow my garage and did hire those staff I envisioned needing the assistance of.  Our game engine grew with the company too, subtle changes at first with the VGE 1.1, but then transforming our lives (and those of our fans) with the VGE 2 and its 3D graphics.  As we continued to innovate with our engine, so too did we continue to innovate and improve with our games.  Our skills and finance grew as our successes chained beyond our wildest dreams.About 20 years after I’d started Vosoros Games we moved into our very own building (where we still reside today), setting aside space for a future R&D Department and a Research Lab to craft our very own console when finances permitted.Sure enough, with the creation of the VGE 5, we began to build the VGS 1 (Vosoros Games System Console 1), and it was a roaring success.  As a new game engine was built, so was a new console to accommodate the latest technological and gaming innovations we bought to our ever-growing number of fans.Today, Vosoros Games is the leading company in game design and innovation with the VGE 8 (our masterpiece game engine) and the VGS 4 (our masterpiece console system that accompanies it) with its virtual reality headset.Game Dev Tycoon is a gem of a game well worth buying…’cos Vosoros Games made it!  :P"

Explain the nuts and bolts of this game out loud and you may think this can't be enjoyable. You would be wrong.Game Dev Tycoon stimulates your imagination by letting you fill in the blanks. In the game, you are a game dev (duh) starting out in the garage at the beginning of home video games. The game follows 35 years of history and goes a bit past present day with all of the names of the real life game companies replaced with psuedonyms. It's your task to create games for the different consoles over time while developing your skills and eventually growing your company out of the garage and into a sweet office building where you'll be faced with new challenges managing your staff. You never see the games you make; you come up with the title, decide the genre, console and prioritize what aspects of the games will be worked on. It sounds kind of meh right? But I've spent hours imagining what the games I came up with looked like and  how the cover art must have looked. It's like reading a book, where theatre of your mind is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.  Game Dev Tycoon is a great title for any fan of video game history and is reasonably priced. If you're still unsure check out Videogame Dunkey's video review. That's what convinced me that I would like this title. For ten bucks, there enough here to justify the price tag.

The core gameplay of Game Dev Tycoon is similar to that of other tycoon games in the sense that you're out there trying to make a fortune, and what a better way than starting your own videogame company? You start in your garage, and watch as the game consols we grew up with pop up on the market, and develop for them. As time progresses, and you amass your fortune, you can move to larger and larger facilities, and hire more staff. Along the way, you research newer game engines, new topics, and even completly new ideas with your R&D department, such as project grid.

From there on out you have to use your limited budget to try and develop games, grow your fanbase, and hopefully move your company out of your parents garage.The gameplay is rather simple and user-friendly which is fantastic for the beginning player but can get a tad tedious once you're on your 7th or 8th run through of the game, that's not to say it makes the game less enjoyable but it would have definitely been a plus if the game let you get a little more hands-on at points. As the game progresses you get to choose which consoles you want to purchase a developing license for, as well as create new game engines as new technology becomes available to you. Careful portioning of your budget is vital to gameplay and a rash spender will soon find themselves bankrupt and bought out.The game is incredibly simple but has a fun, addictive quality that certainly kept me playing for a good long while and I'm sure that most of you will enjoy as well!"

Even if this was there 100th, this is an elegant and simplistic art work. One word can be used to describe it and that word is ""Masterpiece"". I can't wait for a sequel!

My first time playing, I got to one million dollars by make a really small game, so it is not the big game that make the most money. It's the small tiny games that make up for making a big game, but if you want to take the risk go for it. A cool thing about this game is that every year you get to chose to go to G3. This was made to get more fans for your company, and more money for you to work on bigger projects. Late into game it starts to lose the  fun, because you can't come up with new games, and the fact is there is not a lot of topics in the game. A good thing is it that the company that made didn't put it together in a week, and I see where they were going with this game. It was a reasonable price for a game its size, only ten dollars, so I'll give this game a 7/10 for some reasons, but  you should buy it is fun, because I played it for days and there are some cool things in it.

The main part of the game focuses on 35 years of gaming history and important console releases (They don't have the licenses for the real names, but it's easy to work out). You start out in your garage developing games on your computer, once you have enough money you can move into an office, start to hire staff, and in time you can even get your own R&D lab.The acutal 'developing' of the games is fairly straight forward, you start with a small list of topics (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, racing etc...) more of which can be unlocked via research. Once you've picked a topic you choose a genre, there's 5 to choose from, you choose which system to develop the game for, to start off and later on once you've started building your own game engines, you can pick which engines to build on too, oh; you can also choose the 'audience' for a game too; Young, Everybody, Mature.Once you've chosen all the above, the actual development is divided into three sections. Each section has Three sliders that have different things connected to them, things like; World Design, Engine, Graphics, Sound etc... Set the sliders to what you think makes that particular game good, and there you go game made! Certain combinations of topic/genre/audience can work brilliantly in your favour to sell more copies, but on the other hand it can also lead to some absolute stinkers too. After you're game is complete and just before it's released you get a quick run down of experienced gained, and then on to the dreaded games review, which actually reflect how well the game will sell, so the reviewers pan the game you won't shift many units, likewise if it gets glowing reviews you're sure to make a good amount of money. Rinse and repeat until you game your own gaming empire. After a couple of releases you can start to research better graphics, sounds, AI, better story lines etc...The graphics and sounds aren't ground-breaking, but being a simulation of sorts, then they aren't going to be. I've left a couple of things out of this review as I'm sure you'll want a couple of surprises but; All in all Game Dev Tycoon is a nice fun little game, easy to get a grasp upon. The price asked for the game is definitely worth the money as there's hours and hours worth of play."

Whilst it is a very good concept and has decent execution, the way it works is simply too unpredictable and would take hundreds, possibly thousands of hours to know how to build each game in the right way without a Wiki as the ingame system gives you poor feedback on what each topic/genre combination needs to be successful. However don't think that engineering your game perfectly will give you perfect scores, or even high scores sometimes because that feels extremely random too. Using the Wiki and precise calculations, I made a AAA simulation military game with a team of extremely talented developers, millions of credits budget, numerous and advanced features and perfect amounts of time allocated to the A.I/Engine/Gameplay/Graphics etc and the game flopped despite being engineered to fit the exact criterias required for high scores.That isn't to say the game is bad, it can be very fun most of the time, but nothing is more frusterating than creating a brand new game/sequel on a highly advanced engine (usually way more advanced than what the systems at the time can handle) with perfect planning and time allocation only for it to score 4/10 for seemingly no reason.7/10, a decent game for the price."

,Recommended,239820,8578536,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,BtheCarp,"Definitely a fun and addictive game, but needs more content. You start in the 1980's making games in your garage, and as you sell more games you can expand your company. Ultimately, while you are given many genres/topics/platforms to use to make your games, Game Dev Tycoon always follows the same path of progression. Once you figure out how to consistently release high scoring games you will be able to make money consistently and gain lots of fans. Since most of the gaming devices are inspired by real world events, if you know anything about gaming history its not hard to figure out the ""right"" choices. There are some random events to change things up, but I find they are few and far between. It would be nice if the market would be more dynamic rather than follow static events, kind of like being able to play ""what if?"" in gaming history. i.e. What if the Dreamcast had a major title that drove up console sales? Would that cause Microsoft to stay out of the market instead of trying to challenge Sony? What if the game with the most hype was really bad and led to less sales for the PS2? You do get to enter the console market with your own device, but this is so late into the game that it doesn't really mean much. Other suggestions, it would be nice if there was more to the game when it comes to sales and profit. Whether you self publish, or work with a publisher the amount of money you make seems to be only determined by the review score. You can take advantage of randomly generated trends in the market to boost sales, but if you make a good game it sells well regardless. It would be interesting to have random events in the market that can negatively affect the sales of  high scoring games. Finally, the managing of employees could be more interesting. Maybe have them leave to form new studios, demand a raise, retire, happiness rating, etc. This would provide nice challenges to managing your studio besides training/replacing/send on vacation. Overall, I enjoy this game very much, but would like to see more depth to the gameplay to make the game more dynamic."

I bought it not expecting much but because I'm a hopeful Game Dev myself and thought it would be fun but I was very pleasantly surprised.It has a few minor problems in that it doesnt feel very well optimised considering my computer can play high end games in high graphic settings but had a few points of lag once I had unlocked everything and had a few tasks on the go. It also has a system which as first seems very odd as making an RPG with high AI settings and better sound quality results in a bad game when you would think it would just result in a better game. Once you've got used to the mechanics and realise what helps what it is a very good indie game.Overall it's a very good Indie game and deserves all the praise it gets!

Strategy wise it's got all the hooks, do you make another game now (+$), research more tech (-RP), build a new engine (-$ +RP) or train your employees (-$ -RP, but long term gain) so much to do so little time!It's worth mentioning that this is IMHO one of the best examples of game design I've seen in a long time, it adherers to the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle which is probably one of the most important things a small Indie developer should do.

I began watching people play this game and just simply having fun watching them play it and desperately wishing I could control what they were doing. I decided to get it. Sometimes you can catch this game on sale for $5 but the $9.99 is worth every penny. I'm finishing up my second playthrough of it now. If you aren't a believer, just watch someone play this game like I did. Find someone on Twitch or YouTube giving it a go and (if they have some entertainment value) get sucked into their adventures of the gaming industry. This game starts you fresh in a garage as a 1-man-team creating your own games back when it all first began. You journey through the years gaining more technology, more people, better equipment, and much more to advance into what we play and do today. There's so much to do which makes your first few playthroughs completely different. Your first go with this game will be you learning a lot of what you can do and then with that knowledge you can have even more fun on another go. The timeline on this game is pretty much spot on, you even get to witness the break-up of Sony and Nintendo and begin making games for the PlayStation (or PlaySystem as it is called in this game due to copyright) when it drops. This game came out before XBox One and PS4 did so of course once you get around that time there is a bit of make-believe but I think they did good with it. This game doesn't just end at the current stage of gaming. It goes on a bit longer and allows you to eventually make your own consoles and your own games for your consoles.

You start with a ""buisiness"" in your garage and try to develope new games.Every game walks through 3 stages and in every one you need to decide which part of the game should be emphasised in the development, like graphics, sounds or story. For the different genres and settings there are different parts important. After yopur first game, which normaly fails, you can analyse it and therefor learn what went good and what went wrong, e.g. that the K.I. is important for a strategie game.With this imformation you develop the next one, and the next one, ....The Graphics of the game are not the best, but good enough for the idea of the game. It was fun to play and there are several ways to play it.For me the only minuses are the short real-time in which the game-time evolves and the kind of repetitive playstile due to it. Within a certain time, there are new consols etc. But you cannot use all of them, because the time between the consol generations are too short in game time. This leads to a certain pattern for your playstyle you choosed at the beginning. So an option to play a ""marathon"" like game would be nice."

The game is both interesting as you are a game developer but the game is still limited by the developers budget nonetheless and the whole game shows that. However, it can be a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend that people pick it up.

,Recommended,239820,13556443,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,HaroldFGH,"I had submitted a review for Game Dev Tycoon more than a year ago. The game has gone through a lot of changes, and I have learned a lot more while I have kept playing it. For this reason, I have decided to update my review and make it more extended.First of all, I think Game Dev Tycoon will keep expanding and growing, it's a game that shows a lot of potential. Since Game Dev Tycoon implemented Steam Workshop it has evolved a lot, especially via the ability to create and utilize mods to modify the average experience. I believe Game Dev Tycoon will continue to evolve, progress and attract more people to buy it over time because of Steam Workshop and updates done by the developers.To continue, I wish to say this was Greenheart Games' first game. Seriously, these people deserve a round of applause! This is a truly amazing game that most companies can't pull off, especially as their first game. I am excited to see what Greenheart comes up with in the future; I know it'll be just as great as Game Dev Tycoon, perhaps even greater!Following these statements, I would also like to point out that I haven't noticed a single bug in this whole game, and I've played it a lot! The game runs very smoothly in my computer and all of its artwork is stunningly beautiful! All the consoles, all the names, all news, it is noticable a massive amount of effort was put into each of these aspects to make the game as marvelous as it is.Finally, I would like to higlight tha fact this game is super easy to understand! You can be a gamer, as you may be a non-gamer and enjoy this game. That's why I recommend this game to each and every Steam player; especially newcomers who haven't bought a single game. I am sure Game Dev Tycoon will continue to be a massive success, like it has been so far."

Games and genres that work well together don't change but I noticed that the same games I was doing were not getting the same high ratings as my first attempt did. Many other factors such as personal and employee skills, marketing, publishers, demand and previous game release all play a role in the outcome of each game.

You re on your own, in your garage / working station, creating your company somewhere in the late 80's, with a passion to make it to the continuously evolving gaming industry. Your only tool is your pc and your only companion is your creativity.The game progresses through the ages, following loyaly the evolution of gaming, providing you with news from the companies as to their upcoming plans for gaming and technology to support it (both on consoles and pc) as well as the current tendencies of the gaming audience (i.e. there is a current tendency for strategy games), giving you opportunities to deliver something that will appeal more and more to your growing fanbase.As you are becoming more and more successfull on what you re doing, the game allows you to ""evolve"", taking your company to new, bigger offices and with the potential of hiring the first members of your company's staff. Each of them can be chosen based on their specialties (design, technology etc) so that they can provide a valuable asset to what your company needs most at any given moment.But for me, it s the little details that make this game shine. As your company is getting bigger and more successfull, the game provides you with random, sort of ""pop up"" choices that do fit to how a gaming company can handle certain things. From fan requests to possible ""foul play"" on your companies side or staff requests. The decisions you make have an impact on various things. Fanbase, staff productivity, market acceptance etc etc.To sum this up (and not spoil the fun this game can deliver), if you want to take a break from ""hardcore"" gaming and want a casual but funny and addicting game dev simulator, I highly recommend this game.Pros:-Low system requirements-Escalating but enjoyable difficulty-Gives the potential of going in depth to it but not as a necessity-Amusing way of avoiding copyright infringements-Personalised skill development for each of your staff-Steam Workshop support-High replayability potentialCons:-Could give the player a little more insight as to what you re doing wrong or right (although you can figure out things... through ""pain"" :P )-Sometimes it gives you the feeling that the years go byreallyfast, making developing titles for particular consoles a bit pointless. Unless you re willing to keep buying licences for the next gen consoles that their companies make.Overall score:9/10For what this game is and does, it s a gem!Personal note / tip for new playersRight now my company is in a big office, with 7 people as staff (me included) and we ve made a name in the gaming industry, being currently at the 15 spot (out of 100) in game conventions, with a 70+ million budget and still going. So my advice to you is to be, think and act like you want the real gaming companies to be.Be modest.Once you make a couple of successfull titles and see the money filling your bank account, don t go cocky. Don t start buying expensive, highly educated personel (more than you can afford), in thehopethat your next title will also be a success. Or you ll be in for a surprise... Take it slow instead. Listen to your fanbase, fulfill their requests as long as they are logical and keep it like that. When you re giving an interview, don t overhype your games. Cause if you do and the game doesn t live up to the expactations, it s gonna be double the fall. Don t worry about growing your fan base. Fans will come as long as your company stays true to it s original ideals and passion for gaming."

E, claro, há tipos de jogos que combinam com determinado tema e outros que funcionam de forma desastrosa. Não se faz um simulador de música, nem um RPG de corridas de carros.

Thinking it would be a game that would collect dust in my Steam librarary, I was surely proven wrong when I started this game up on my Mac due to a lack of Mac compatible games in my library. My first experience on Game Dev Tycoon was frustrating. I spent my time trying to figure out why I couldn't make a game that could get more than 4 stars. This made me more determined to succeed. After about three restars of my game company, I finally was able to efficiently manage my research to create games that got 7+ stars. You would think that a semi-linear game that has the same events occur at the same time through every playthrough would get boring but I found myself only getting more and more addicted. The micromanagement and depth put into developing games on this simulator will keep you hooked for hours. I still find myself wanting to continue my adventures on Game Dev Tycoon after vesting 21+ hours of gameplay into it."

Players are tasked with starting a game development company and controlling the development and release of games as the years pass. New technology is introduced as time passes, which can play a role in how you wish to develop your games and company. The game is scripted to have release events of real consoles (named slightly differently for copyright reasons I am guessing). The release of these consoles is actually quite comical- you'd just have to play to see what I mean.Games can be named, sequels can be made to games. Research can be done to unlock tech, employees can be selected and hired and trained and their roles can be specialized so that areas such as ""World Design"" or ""Artificial Intelligence"" can be professionally implemented in your games. You can control which employee works on which part of the game and how much time they have to spend.. different types of games will favor you spending more time in different areas. For example, RPG games will require you to allot more time in World Design and Story/Quests.Overall, the design mechanics are a bit repetitive, but if you wish to have a lot of variety you can choose to develop different kinds of games. I was continually pleasantly surprised at how much detail was in the game and how much you could actually control and do. You can eventually create your own console, MMO's and even expansion packs.The economy of the game is forgiving enough for new players, but in order to succeed to a high degree you would need to think carefully about what you are doing.The first night I played, I played almost all night and managed to basically finish the main story line. That being said, I felt like there was a choice of pathways. I could go back to this game and not feel as though it was the exact same experience. Is there unlimited replayability? The short answer is no, but if you have a good imaginination, you could have fun almost every time you decide to play."

I wasn't expecting much going in, but it had a fun idea and it was on sale so I gave it a shot and have ended up loving it.  It has just the right balance where it's pretty easy to learn, difficult to master and despite a simple and user friendly interface and design it can get challenging and has a relatively fast pace and in game clock and while I will admit I think it maybe moves too fast  in that regard as even the most successful of your games won't stay on the market much longer than a minute and a quarter.  Still, there's a flow to the game and its worth toying with and has a nice depth and I do like the fact that it gives you more control over the actual services the company you run provides, in fact the game actually eschews the model of designing your building and micromanaging dozens of employees almost entirely in favour of static levels (Though you still have win conditions based on how much moolah you have and how effecient your workers are) and instead puts the meat of the game into having a direct influence on your studios games from naming them, creating custom engines for them, selecting their marketing, choosing who develops what aspect of a game (At least when you get to medium game projects) and researching new development aspects and parts for your next in-house Engine.Admittedly I'm pretty bad, I have finally gotten to a point where I can usually make it up to the release of the ""DreamVast"" and ""PlaySystem 2"" but almost always lose all my capital right around the time the ""mBox"" shows up.  I honestly don't fully know why, it seems I could take a winning formula and give it over 120 points in both areas, set a record, and then still get scores of 1 and 3 and then watch as my fans and my money get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away.Oh well, it's still a lot of fun and that's the point, ain't it?

When I heard about Game Dev Tycoon, I added it to my wishlist because I wanted to see how it was.  It finally came on sale during the Winter Sales, and along with almost 30 other games, I bought it.  It took me a while before I decided to download it, and an hour into the game, I realized it was a mistake to wait that long.I am actually the co-writer and a voice actor of one of my friends' projects they are woking on.  I've always been interested by video games.  After starting it, I see you start with 5 genres and 4 or so types of games.  You had to do research to unlock more genres.  There was also the very immersive engine builder.  It covered soooooo many things that you would actually have had to do if you were building your own engine.  But most of all, my favorite part of this game is the extreme care and precision in following gaming history.  All of the consoles are based off of the game consoles we've actually had, along with accurate facts for each and every one of them.  While they are missing some game consoles (like the NeoGeo), the developers covered everything important.Since this is actually realistic and tailored with real gaming history, I will add that rating as well.Gaming History Friendly-9.5/10Detail of the In Game Mechanics-9.5/10Realism-8.5/10Graphics-N/A (not applicable) | N/I (not important).  Yes, this is actually one of those games where graphics don't matter.  Accordingly, I won't factor in Graphics to the final rating.Music-6/10Replay Value-9/10Overall Value-8.5Recommended buy price-$12 USD or cheaper.  Worth the price.Note: I do not recommend modding this game, though it is supported.  Beware that installing/uninstalling mods can corrupt your data.

76561198052491613,Recommended,239820,14129609,"Posted: 23 January, 2015",all,Hilleon,"preface:  In this review, keep in mind that I am following release dates to the US-only releases of products. I am not going to include EU or JP release dates due to this games setting being in the US. With that out of the way, let's get on with the review.-Game Dev Tycoon is a indipendence medium-game developed by Greenheart Games. And let me tell you: It's fun and addictive.Game Dev Tycoon is about ''You'' being a video/PC-Game devloper in the post-1983 crash/Atari Shock and working your way up top all the way up to the year ...2018? I think.-[Let's talk about the story]The story isn't mush to talk about.It begins with the post-'83 crash were computer-games survived the disaster, Nintendo reviving  consoles in late-1985, Sega releasing GENESIS in 1989, SONY releases PS1 in late-1995 and so on.The story is abridged though, so some events have been cut-out... such as Apple in the 80/90s, Linux, SEGA Saturn, all the add-ons for the GENESIS and *Panasonics 3DO*Though the 3DO didn't do well in US and EU and is nothing in comparison to GENESIS and SNES, it deserves recognition in gaming history for selling well in Japan.-[Let's talk about the gameplay]When developing a game, you are presented with three development stages and three pillars for each development stage(total of nine pillars).You adjust the pillars  to what works and what doesn't work. Whether you want to focus a lot on gameplay or focus a little on A.I. or don't focus on the story etc.After all the three development stages are done, you then wait for reviews.If you get very bad reviews, then that's going to give you negative fans and make less money depending on the reviews and if you hyped the game before release.If you get great reviews, then you are going to make a lot of money and have a huge following. journalists and critics will mention your great feat and with recognition you will get offers from different people.Game dev Tycoon has a... sort of.. roguelike feel to it. If you mess up in the beginning and make a wrong decision then you could get a game-over.If you make 1M dollars, you then move to an office and hire more staff and make bigger games.Though I think this is a great gameplay mechanic, I still think there are a couple of ''missed opportunities'' in the gameplay that could have been in the game. Such as:-You can't make a launch title. Or/and getting an offer from SONY or Nintendo for an exclusive title.-You can't put a price on a game.-Why can't you make something viral? like spreading a rumour of a hidden room or a mythical creature or something, like GTA with big foot. Or Mortal Kombat with the blood code on SNES.-Why can't you make 2 games at the same time. one small game an a large game for example.-Why can't you make an expansion pack on a normal game? You can make an Exp. pack, but only on MMOs.-Why can't my character have a background? not all companies starter out as one guy like Bungie. Some starter out as three guys such as Blizzard....and so on. I have a mush bigger list in my head of ''missed opportunities'' with GDT. These are a few example.-[Let's talk about the Graphics]Game Dev Tycoons graphics is hand drawn animation. I like Game Dev. Tycoons graphics.-[Let's talk about the music]For a simulator that's all about developing games, the music in this game isn't really that important. Game Dev Tycoons music is relaxing and kind to your ears.-[Before I give my ''Final Score'', I would like to say something]GDT opened up my point of view of how it looks like when developing a game. Before I played GDT I thought ''Ok... developers keep saying in interviews that the reason they can't make a sequel is because it's NOT that easy'' and I am all like ''well... maybe they're just saying that because they just want to make money and don't really care about the fans''. And after I played GDT, I finally understood what developers were saying about ''It's NOT that easy''.-[Final Score]GDT is a great game... but I feel like there were a lot of missed oppertunities. But it can be forgiven because of the addicive gameplay and for being an indie-game. I didn't like that the story was abridged and your main-character was ''another avarage Joe''. That's why I give GDT a ''great'' 8.5/10 and a ''recommended'' for anybody.I can reccommend game dev. Tycoon to anybody, even casuals. Even If you're not familiar with Simulations. And also, if you have the motivation to learn and such, then GDT is for you.[Here is an idea I have for ''Greenheart Games'' if they ever make a sequel]If Greenheart Games ever make a sequel to GDT or an Exp. Pack. Then I am would like them to add those ''missed opportunities'' that I talked about in the ''gameplay''-section.I would also like the sequel/exp. pack to follow the gaming history more accurately.-...And that's my review of GDT. Peace out and have a good one."

(In which case when that happens I will make sure to update this review.)Overall this game is lots of fun to play with and could easily be on of the top games I played this year!"

I've played a number(however not too many, so maybe i'm overselling a bit) of tycoon games in my life starting with Lemonade Stand Tycoon shortly after the genre came around and I must say, this is one of the best tycoon/sim games I've played. There's some great humor and history of gaming with the in-game story following the history of game developement, but with names that aren't actually copyrighted, and the concept behind it is simple, but implemented in a great way that will keep you trying to make the best company possible.. There are lots of different ways this game can be played, leading to some good replayability, and every time you find something new that you hadn't gotten to the point of being able to do the last time around."

This game is a breath of fresh air as this game does it right providing a realistic simulation of being a the owner of a game development company. This is accomplished by fighting legal incidents, attending to fans and managing projects. Even though this game does a lot of things right it also does quite a few things wrong aswell like not enough research and topics and some sort of online mode is missing here. These aside the game provides hours of time sunk into this game and is worth its price tag. Highly recommended unless you have a game like mad games tycoon. I rate this game a 7/10."

Some stuff is probably flushed out in the modding community, but I don't have time to dig through all that to get the game I want.I also wish there were more opportunities to be creative: write taglines, interview answers, game descriptions, reply to fans... stuff like that. Even though it's impossible for a sim game to ""score"" stuff like that, I always like when sim games have this kind of creative input allowed.Still, I played through this game like three times (and I don't replay games any more) so it's pretty doggone fun."

At any point you can write a game engine which is capable of supporting any number of known technologies. You can write many games using a single engine.

It has a decent amount of depth that you could expect from a typical tycoon game, and more. It is pretty fun, and can easily have you playing for a few hours at a time.Pros:- Carry out God's work and parody real life gaming companies like Activision and watch the results;- Parody franchises like Call of Duty; make the same thing over and over again, and watch your company burn;- It has a neat amount of customization options;- Surprising amount of depth.Cons:- You are limited to only playing the role as a Game Dev (I know it's in the name, but similar games have it so you play the role as the Publisher/ Game Console developer as well if you choose etc).

I haven't played many other tycoon games before getting this one, the only other one I remember playing before this was Roller Coaster Tycoon. But if they're anything like what this game has to offer, I definitely need to get more.This is also a very challenging game, it's one of those games where in order to complete it, you really need to know what you're doing ahead of time. I can't evencounthow many times I've gone out of business, as even if you know the ins and outs of the gaming industry, it can still prove difficult. And that's honestly what I like about this game, it's very realistic with how a business in game development would play out.What also helps make me put more hours into the game is, while the main game only lasts around 6-7 hours, you can keep playing for as long as you want. Which not only puts more hours into the game but helps get some unlockables you didn't get during the normal playthrough as well. And that's not even getting into all the mods you can get for the game, furthering the replay value.Overall, I had a fantastic experience, and I'll definitely continue to play this game. Anyone who hasn't gotten it yet, and just wants an addicting game to play, I highly recommend it.Also, my final score was 30,301,570 in case you're wondering.

But alas, it's only a minor hit to your score if you don't change it. Nice too that system requirements are light so it will run on a potato."

I've only had it for a few weeks but it feels like there are topics i haven't even found yet. A thing that bothers me is how you are making a AAA title and your employees need to go on vacation in the middle of development causing the game to be bad.

But it's so much more than just that.The goal of the game is basically to build and grow a succesful game developing corporation by creating good games, making money, hiring new workers, and researching new things to add to your games and make them better. Simple concept, but it works flawlessly.The depth of this game is surprising for that of a simple indie title, a game that basically allows you to choose any path you want as a developer. The amount of game genres, training tasks, research topics, and employees is simply amazing. You forge your own path, hire new people, and basically become the biggest game developer in the world. Sometimes, you'll go bankrupt, and have to start over. Other times, you just keep growing towards the eventual end of the game. You'd think you've experienced everything the game has to offer after one playthrough, but you'll find new things and new problems every time you play.The game is enhanced even more by its modding scene. Since they added Steam Community workshop for the game, you can download tons of different mods that can give you stuff like more consoles to sell games on, more tasks and research, money cheats, etc. Modding adds so much to this game and extends the replay value even more.In summary, Game Dev Tycoon is an amazingly crafted indie game whose goal is simply to just make games and be successful. Props to the devs, they truely have created a masterpiece."
,Recommended,239820,11040570,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,Yureina,"A silly little game that is basically a homage to gaming development from the 80's to the present. You start as a 1-person dev team, and your goal is to make games, make money, and get fans. The basic gist of the game is quick to grasp, but I wouldn't call this game ""easy to master"" either. It has a rather nebulous review and scoring system that left me confused and disappointed at times when I put a gigantic amount of effort into making a good game only to see it fail at reviews. Because apparently reviews are a comparison based on your past games, so if you make a smash-hit expect to make a bunch of ""meh"" games for quite a while after it.It can be difficult to not go bankrupt, and since sales/reviews go together quite alot you have to develop a long-term plan of making slightly better games each time, and to not make such gigantic leaps forward that you find yourself to be a victim of your own success.Anyway, game. Is it good? It's okay. I'd say anyone who has had a long interest in gaming may want to take a peek at it, if only for a few laughs and nostalgic bits. But once you are done with it there isn't much left to do here other than kill time. Ultimately it gets on the repetitive side once you've basically unlocked everything and are just grinding your way up to try for that absurdly difficult Unobtanium achievement.Might be something to get on a sale. If nothing else, you can get funny moments playing this game, like having a Romance/Adventure game for the Game Boy being a cult classic 10/10. >_>"

I'd also have to establish a lot of connections within the gaming community. Game Dev Tycoon skips the whole learning phase and gets you straight to the core: making games. Well... almost. While it limits your options for a game to just a genre and a few funny adjustable pillars, it does give you that authentic and exciting feel of building your own company and trying to rise up to the top of the pack. You also get to relive the history of video gaming with the rise and fall of real companies and consoles, building your titles on a wide variety of platforms from the NES to the PS4. Overall, it is a great experience for fans of video games and those who don't have the energy for making games in the real world. Just don't expect too much depth or choice in the actual creating."

Creating a low rated game as a high rated developer can kill you fan base. This game lacks some features though. Once you have created your gaming empire, you start to run out of things to do.

There are options to things and choices such as different sized games or Marketing for AAA games and I am not quite sure what they do and do not have a manual for reference. Also with a bit more depth and a Civilization style 'Tech tree' it would be even better.Apart from a couple of niggles it takes me back to a golden age of simple but fun games that do not need fancy graphics or a multi-million dollar development team to create a movie'esque style plot.

(If you look in my screenshots, you can see that the critics don't respond like they would in real life, ""Dialogues not important in Half-Life 2?""

When you first start the game, you get this cute message from Greenheart Games that thanks you for purchasing their game, when you finish the game for the first time, you get another nice message from Greenheart Games that says that they hope that you liked their game, and that if you like it, share it with your friends.

Once you get the rythm and flow, making money is super simple and you basically cannot lose at that point.Not so much in this game.The difficult curve is absolutly appropriate but a tad unforgiving. I made a hit game in my 4th year (gametime) and moved to the bigger office and life was good, for about 3 years. I could not maintain the momentum to keep my business running and thus I fell into bankruptcy.It was a blast. Not the bankruptcy but the challenge of how to make a hit game which is not as easy as it sounds.

It is the kind of game that, once you get the hang of it, you can't let go. I beat the game in one sitting (which isn't too difficult) and immediately went back for more.

The grind at the start is my favorite part trying to work out different combos for games.Then once you get a real few best sellers (Which is such a great rush to see your game do well), you have the oppurtunity to move up into an office, and even hire your own staff. Along the way, newer consoles emerge, and you can research new technology to put into your games.The rest, i'll leave to you to find out and enjoy. There's much more to do once you go down the line. I just finished the main 'story' of the game, and am still not bored. I continue to research and develop games and even more. Once I get bored, I will start over again, and take some different approaches. Then i'll dive into Mods. Which could really open this game up to countless more hours of playtime.Overall, this game is a must have. This game is something I would classify as ""Perfect"" as it comes to scoring. A 10 out of 10. I can easily grind some hours into this game and be extremely serious, or play only for a short time and have a more fun, reckless, and relaxed view. Either way, it's an enjoyable experience.Great work, Greenheart Games"

A little bare-boned. But the game costs 9 Euro and you probably get 10-20 hours of fun gameplay out of it. Sure, you can get Rome: Total War for the same price, and have hundreds of hours of playtime, but for me, Game Dev Tycoon is well worth the pricetag. Apparently they are working on a sequel that I'm looking forward to."

Does it matter?  I don't think so, should no one else be allowed to make a city simulator because Maxis made SimCity first?  The fact is this game is a lot of fun.PROS:-Good graphics.  Really pretty.  Not going to max out your gpu, but the cartooney style looks nice-Sound.  Its hard to explain but the music and all the little sound effects are really pleasant.  It'll keep you from getting fatigued.-Re-playability.  You might put in say 10 or 20 hours and feel like you have done it all, but like other sims you should be able to come back at a later date and have lots of fun all over again.CONS:-Some of the genre/topics don't work when they should.  Like Werewolf and RPG is a terrible combo - Why?  Ever heard of ""Wolf Among Us?""-The game isn't very random, you could basically play THE EXACT same strategy and turn of events each play through and have the same outcome-The whole game is based on your title's scores.  The scores are based upon your previous scores.  I really don't like this, by the end of the game it becomes harder and harder to get titles earning 10/10 marks.  In other words, to get a second 10/10 game it has to be better than the previous 10/10 game.Overall - this game is really fun and I definitely recommend it to sim fans of any type."

I first started playing this game about a year ago and the steam community is only improving the game. The game starts you off in a garage with nothing while the only thing you can do is make a game. Tutorials provided by the game are extremely helpful and never seem out of place. A simple formule is used when you create a game. For example, if I was to create a warewolf - action game, it will tell me that is a good combonation of genres.As I said before, the community create some great mods. I have recently downloaded the DLC mod and it is great. This spasific mod is a way to add content on to your game after the release (obvious I know). Overal, this game provides a great amount of gameplay. It just shows that you dont need a massive game world, bunch of action sequences and a convoluted plot to have a successful game. I would recomend this game for a time where you can't be bothered with Counter Strike or DOTA and just want a casual game. Now casual does not mean bad as proven by my overwelmingly positive review.My personal rateing of this game is a 7/10 - which in my eyes is above average score.Personally, I would feel more emersed if there was more interaction with other companies such as over time developing a rival or being able to create a piece of tech/merch to coinside with your game, just thinking off the top of my head here but maby creatin a mascot for other companies to buy rights to would be good. Of course I understand the developers wanted a simple game but these are just some things I would like to see in the game.(Quick side note, for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, it's my first time doing a review so I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to this. I did try my best.)"

According to steam I played for 9 hours straight.What that game is not: an accurate simulation of owning a company of game development. That would be almost impossible; unlike a city sim, this is about producing art, a very subjective topic. I thought this should go without saying but there you go. It is a management game. The main gameplay element is figuring out combinations that work well with each other, and you can kind of use your intuition to figure a few of them, like medieval and rpg are great together as everyone knows. But when you play game dev tycoon you must keep in mind that this is only a caricature of game development, some combinations might not make any sense; the game expects you to experiment to find good combinations. And that's the fun and challenge of the game! I love how even as a large company I would still release several small games to test new combinations, and then close the cycle with a AAA game using some previously discovered formula.There is plenty of depth to explore. For example, you can't keep remaking the same game with the same formula, so you have to keep finding new combinations. That's not to say you can't make sequels! you can, and there's even a special option for that. But you have to wait a while and preferably use a new engine. Yes, you have to make new engines, which require constant researching. These are some of the things that you have to juggle while playing it and it feels quite satisfactory.I have one big criticism. After you release a game and analyze it you get a report saying what aspects worked (platform and targeted audience is good etc), but only a few of these are explicitly indicated to you when you start a new project. So you have to rely on your memory for many of these precious bits information. I ended up remaking bad combinations a few times without noticing I already knew that didn't work.Fun fact: I bought this just out of curiosity and didn't expect to play for more than a few minutes. I got curious about some of the negative reviews I read (I only read negative reviews on steam, as the voting system completely buries actually helpful positive under highly voted but unhelpful positive reviews)- CEO of seu cu games"

I had a lab and the other development area and all options done, and spent several hours just heavily training my guys. Researched everything. Developed several AAA rated games, got varied responses from 2/10 through to 9/10. Couldn't hire more staff. Maxed out very early on. Developed about 4 consoles, all didn't sell well, despite max funding and making games only for that console. Couldn't research anything else except the games conference.The game hits its peak after about 4hrs of play. To me, it was addictive, and working in a Simulations business I enjoyed the similar vibe, but there's much more that the game could have done.. My suggestions are;1. In-house staff (i.e cleaners, IT systems, project managers, business development managers, finance staff, admin, sales, security, facilities management, etc)2. Contracted staff - i.e 6 month, 3 month, etc. It would be good to hire people only for a particular project/game3. Fix the hiring system - I kept spending about 2M on staff selection and continuously got nothing of interest.4. To be able to incorporate Merchandising and in-game purchases into the game you develop. It needed something like those ""pay to win"" games that you often get on some consoles and a majority of the android/apple devices.5. Make my character tired - I seemed to be the only person that never took a vacation.6. Events that remove key members of your team - i.e they get sick, quit, family emergencies, poached to another company (and you can poach from other businesses too), etc7. Colaboration with other businesses/developers.8. I liked the idea of going ""green"" - putting in solar panels as a popup option in the game. Maybe a breakdown of the building for facilities management would be nice to add, such as getting your programmers to write scripts that shut down computers after work, putting in green options into the game to reduce your bills, or go the other way.. invest in servers and pay for their upkeep and require a standby power generator (i.e a shipping container) nearby in case of emergencies, etc.9. Team cohesion. Have people argue with each other. Not everyone agrees on how something should be done. Let the staff fight over their choices and you have to take sides or be neutral. It could affect the game, or other aspects of the game.10. Bonuses for staff - for high performers, give them incentives.11. Fix the game engine thing. Can't we just modify an existing one? If I just want to add one feature, I shouldn't have to rewrite the entire game engine.. i.e to add some small thing. Allow incremental updates to game engines.12. Old game revivals. Websites such asGOG.comare re-releasing old games. Allow the player to re-release their old games but on new consoles.13. Make the Games convention more interesting. I desperately try to click my way past it because it appears to have no real benefit, even when I have over 3M people visit my booth. Allow my business to network with other developers or hear insights into what games are trending, etc. Let me get to know my rivals a bit better.Oh, the list could keep going.I'm still going to give this game a positive review.

Please note these are rough estimations as well)-keep in mind the genre of your game when determining your sliders as well (casual games should not have any AI)-think about the real life equivalent console and what types of games came out on them (By ps2 you should be using 3d games, NES didn't have any successful Simulation games so why would the TES and don't try to put dialogue trees in a game with no dialogue).-don't neglect training to improve the skill level of you and your employees but don't train in quick succession.Now that that has been said,  9/10.Pros:+very innovative approach to a tycoon game+you can easily tell research was done into not only the history of game systems and their success but also topic-genre relationships.+it had the perfect mix of focusing on creating a game and managing both the content within as well as publicity.Cons:-wish it had more topics (rectified with mods)-hoped for ability to assign how each slider/thing added to the game is applied)9/10"

You have a game engine, which you can upgrade and add additional features like better sound / better graphics etc, however sometimes it's pretty hit and miss. I've sold game with a 10 out of 10 rating with one employee and the most basic engine and made 2.5 mill and then having 7 people really well  out working on a game I still manage to get the odd 4 out of 10 game.Couple of points which get annoying, training staff takes research points and cash, really need a way of making it one or the other, otherwise you struggle then to research anything.It's not really got much to return to either.

Easy controls.Setting how much time you spend on different things, horrible. The controls are all slide based, so you're always guessing the percentage. Instead of giving you some wiggle room, the game demands percension.Just as an example here. I inputted the same game combo, tweeked with the settings, I went from an 7.5 to a 9.5 rated title.

As you play, you learn the different trends, information on what kinds of games go best with which consoles, and where best to focus your energy to create the best games.  Still, as with the real world, the game can prove quite challenging at moments.It is the progression of the game, I believe, that makes it so addicting.  Starting in a basement by yourself and working your way up is no easy task;  sometimes you fail before it really feels you begin.  When you get more comfortable with the trends of the game and begin to strategize, only then are you able to succeed long enough to grow your company.  As with any good game, this then raises the stakes and makes failing so much harder.I have played it through a couple of times now, and I'm trying to wait to pick it up for another round because I know it'll suck me in yet again.

,Not Recommended,239820,18078394,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,Bob Star,"I really had a good bit of fun with this game... for the first hour or so.  Then it became very apparent that the game's events are scripted and the success you have is based on a very simplistic formula.  I played to the end, but found the whole experience a bit empty.This game is essentially a better version of Game Dev Story, a mobile game by Kairosoft- they should get credit for the concept.  I think some of the enhancements this game makes on that game's formula are great.  The problem is that the base game mechanics are highly flawed and hardly improved upon in the version.  This game should play more like a roguelike, not an interactive book.Things that would go a long way in making this game extremely fun:- random generated events, nothing scripted- I already know what consoles are going to be successful- randomly generated gaming companies- randomly generated game consoles- simplistic economy where you are competing against other simulated game releases- dynamic system for technically advancing console/pc platforms rather than scripting them- competition that you try to put out of business- better model for working/competing with publishers- modding support that allows you to add new dynamic technology and eventsThe concept of simulating a game dev studio has so much potential that it's incredibly frustrating this game is so simplistic.  It definitely does not deserve the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews.  The game is getting a thumbs down because it's essentially a clone of a (worse) game and does not offer enough to improve on the formula to justify the positive review."

Why can't I progress through the game?"".Just to realise that the game does want you to spend time playing through it and getting to properly know its features before introducing you to new mechanics.Yes, I do have only about 10 hours into the game and I have not yet come close to have fully progressed through it but I believe I played enough to be able to tell you about certain things.Fist of all this is not a simple game, there are certain things you need to consider when developing a new game and if you think ""I can just do whatever and I will progress"" then you will painfully fail and end up bankrup.You have game engines to develop, dialogues to write, 2D and 3D, level designs and much more.Also your garage is far from the best of the adventure that you will go through as a game developer and owner of your own company.There will be people to interview, consoles to develop for and workshop mods to give you more gameplay depth.I hope this gives you a small insight on what you can expect from the game, I don't want to give you spoilers as to what is next in your adventure as a game developer.Buy the game in the link below in the description of this video to embark on this journey.*Note*Thisvideoreview was not brought to you by greenheart games or IGN 8.5/10Enjoy!"

Well I got my couple of hours in and then I got a few more. It's just so relaxing to play that I've found myself wasting away entire weekends at the helm of my little company. The most difficult thing for me in the entire game is coming up with good names for my games. Since sound isn't very important for this type of game you can easily listen to music, podcasts, or a video in the background as you try to earn as many points as you can during the development process.For $10 you can't go wrong with this game.

Don't pass on this game without trying!EDIT June 29th, 2014: Coming up on 10 months since I got this game, I can tell you I still enjoy playing it. The only realy issue I have with it is the fact that it starts stuttering real bad on the late stages of the game (when you have the biggest office and both labs). It's not like it needs any more of the major resources it has (CPU time, GPU time or memory), as my computer has plenty of those to spare, and the game barely registers on my performance monitors. I read somewhere the game has a major memory leak, which could explain this weird phenomenon. Other than that, the game is a real gem!"

If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same ""feel"" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it."

The game is also informed by real-life video game history, which gives it an informative edge for a typically straightforward, cartoony genre.Here is where the pacing problem begins though: most of us are familiar with which consoles came out when, what types of games were played on these consoles, and how they faired against other consoles. The time-ticker in the game moves so fast that the player can't keep up with the fictional technology of the game. For example, by the time you release a single game for the ""TES,"" the ""Super TES"" is on the market. This demands a very fast pace from the player, which simply clashes with an otherwise casual game.I recommend this game for players who know they like tycoon games. It's good for its price range, and for a fledgling developer, but if you have never played tycoon games before I wouldn't recommend starting here."

,Not Recommended,239820,8159985,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,Billco Tabarnak!,"This game fell very short of my expections.  I have two main issues with it:1. The scoring system is kind of stupid.  Each game you make  is based on a (secret) calculation that figures out how true to the genre/topic your choices were, as well as the performance of your employees.  This is then turned into a rating from 1 to 10.  The problem is that the rating is dependent not on your total score, but on beating your previous high score.  You could make the exact same game twice in two different sessions and get a different rating, because it is dependent on all your games up to that point.  This makes absolutely no sense to me.2. It is extremely repetitive.  Once you figure out the right choices for each genre and topic, you basically do the same thing over and over, training your employees in-between, and you will generally get a good rating.  It gets boring very quickly.  The whole concept of game design flies out the window because of those simplistic and sternly enforced targets.  They try to entice you with things like new consoles (that eventually become obsolete), but you're better off just developing the same 3 PC games over and over.It is somewhat ironic that a game development RPG is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  It's an interesting concept that got murdered in the execution (no pun intended).  It is far too simplistic to live up to its name.  This basically plays like one of those Pizza Tycoon games where you just have to click the right things at the right time.  The game dev theme is just bolted on without any real logic applied to it."

The only motivation would be to spent another 4 hours doing all of the same to improve a highscore. Not enough.Some players commended the game as deep however it's not all that deep after you learn what works and what doesn't.

Let me take you to the magical world of Game dev Tycoon.Info:Game Dev Tycoon is a simulator in which you start your own gaming company to produce games, make engines and progress through the years as consoles compete with each other and eventually can make your own console. This game is most likely based on the game ""Game Dev Story"" available on the iOS app store. Let's be honest, there's not going to be a lot I have to say about this game, it's not such a big game.First experience:Made a company called ""Rob Schneider"" as the newest asset to the gaming world, sadly ""rob schneider is a racer"" did not fit as title for my racing adventure game, such a damn shame. Made my first game as a single developer and got about 4 out of 10 (which is good for the first game, somehow...) You start out with little knowledge, little money to spend and little money to earn.Second game called ""Call of Schneider"" which was a militairy action game, managed to rack up a 6 out of 10 somehow, if this was an Adam Sandler game fans would automatically give a 10 out of 10, I hate you Adam Sandler. (but somehow I love you).Third game called ""Rob Racer"" as a sequel to ""Rob Schneider is a racer"" somehow got a 3 out of 10, from there it all went downwards for Rob Schneider as he eventually landed into a spiral of making the same stuff all over again, I was sad to discover this game was not realistic, since it does not overrate actors and glorify all of their work. But it makes the game satisfying in some way.Verdict:Game Dev Tycoon, it explains itself just by the name and there is not more or less you should expect. In the beginning it's hard to get a grasp on what to do or how to make the good games but once you get the formula the game gets really, really easy. The game is enjoyable and definitely worth the price as I had many hours of fun playing this. It's something I play whenever I get bored during class and it keeps me busy and out of boredom. In price to quality ratio this game is well worth its price, not more or less. And for those who are a fan of these kinds of business simulations this is definitely a game to feast your eyes on.Pros:-Many hours of fun-First of its kind-Good progress system-Much random eventsCons:-Repetetive after a while-Could have been much moreA good  game for a cheap price, with a lot of hours of fun packed in, you will definitely fail sometimes but this makes winning all the better in the end.Rating:7/10 -Lives up to expectations but could've been more"

At the time of my writing this, I've put 10.2 hours into the game.... 9 of which were today; if I weren't about to play DayZ with a friend, I'd still be playing it.I just... I can't believe how wonderful and addictive this game is. Yes, it gets challenging at some points and you'll likely go bankrupt and lose a few times, but once you know what to do and how to do it, you barely want to look away from the screen even when creating a game engine that costs 1700 Tech points.Do yourself a favor, though, if you get this game.... stay in the garage until you maintain around $2million; it'll make the office upgrade much easier and proffitable."

I finished it in about 10 hours, now I'm just playing to get all the achievements.It still feels kind of repetitive; you develop a game (using a guide on how to do it perfectly, which I would never do *cough*), release it, get money and train your employees. Even if you don't use a guide, it seems way too easy to simply get rich and have no problems with money or anything. The game's kinda missing a challenge.Mods make this game. They complete it in some ways in terms of finances, for example. Also, I wished you could choose what building complex you would like to upgrade to and maybe be able to hire more employees. Apart from that, the rivalry with other game dev brands in-game is almost hidden in the background. The game's simply missing some reality to it.Nevertheless, it is a lot of fun playing it, trying to explore all ""compatibilities"" of genres, topics and consoles. At some point, which is, in my oppinion, quickly reached, that is over, too. And then, there is no more sense to it, playing it.BUT it takes around 20-40 hours to get to that stage so it DOES entertain you a LOT. Thanks, Greenheart!"

I suddenly make a very successful game, it achieves over 1mil in sales, then I move to a new area, invest in new staff etc. and my money's blown. What do I do?Without a doubt, the game makes it difficult to keep your bank account in the green all the time but, because of this, you will have to think over your stratergies and plan ahead of time.Overall, I reccomend this game, but don't be surprised if you're bankrupt quickly.

Different genres need more focus in certain elements, along with a carefully crafted balance of design and technology. Topics such as Fantasy can appeal to every age, while only the youngest gamers are drawn to games about Virtual Pets. Finding the mix of genre, topic, and design elements that lead to an industry-defining game design takes a lot of trial and error, but the rewards are worth it--assuming you don't go bankrupt first, a real concern as you struggle to balance training your staff to produce better games between actually releasing new titles to generate income.Game Dev Tycoon's clean interface and simple but well-defined graphics contribute to an overall rather pleasant experience where you never really have to wonder what's going on. The only negative things I can really comment on here are that things like game reviews and convention screens can be mildly annoying to sit through, and that the development screen doesn't give hard numbers on how much time you're dedicating to each area of a game's design. Otherwise things run quite smoothly and it's always easy to find exactly the option you're looking for.If you like business simulation games (a combination that does quite well inside of the game itself!), Game Dev Tycoon is a simple but very pleasant example. Even if they aren't normally your thing, it's possible any gamer might enjoy a small look inside the world of game development."

Perhaps that's harsh, but this game is built upon one of the more intriguing concepts for a game I've ever come across, and that's what initially drew my interest. Sure I spent several enjoyable hours in-game, but at the moment I have no desire to ever play it again.At a certain point, you realize that the only way to create a game that will be reviewed well by critics and actually make you any money, will require you to spend an ungodly amount of time on the wiki, reading guides on the games little intricacies, and that's a real shame. Reviewers give you no feedback other than a numerical score (which at times feels as though is completely chosen at random by the game's algorithm), and games that you invest a great deal of time and money into suddenly tank your company as a result of poor reviews.I love difficult games, but this game isn't difficult, it's unfair. Instead of rewarding you for hard work and commitment to making the perfect game, Game Dev Tycoon plugs all of your choices into a random algorithm that spits out either a great success or a complete flop for your company. Which will it be? WHO KNOWS?!?!As a result, I cannot recommend this game. I would love to see more from the developer in the future however, as this is still a very interesting concept overall."

Developing games is very much trial and error, and finding the exact formula can be a challenge but it is a great feeling when you make those 9/10 - 10/10 games, giving a great sense of accomplishment to this title.Pros: Fast, streamlined gameplay, highly addictive.  Easy to understand and grasp.  Lots of options for game genre's and systems.

Valve picked up Call of Duty, renamed it  Call of Pooty and turned it into a mutlimillion dollar franchise, allowing the company to toast EA.

You'd know all the tech trees, you'd know not to start a land war in Asia, you'd know not to leave boats parked in Hawaii, you'd probably start your atomic research program at the first available opportunity.Now be me - a middle-aged gamer who's owned &/or played on almost every system depicted in Game Dev Tycoon including the legendary ""G64"" (The Commodore 64 IRL). Armed with this extensive knowledge of gaming history you would expect to clean up, like a time traveller with winning lottery numbers. Well you'd be half right.Just as historical military sims don't care that you know which despotic nutjob with a moustache did win in the end (Spoilers: It's Stalin), Game Dev Tycoon plays its own little tricks to keep you from demolishing the game with your 20/20 hindsight. And of course because of this, it's a better game for it.Knowing which game system and game type dominated the market of each period depicted in the game will help you to a degree, but you'll still fall foul to fickle gaming reviews and occasional bad luck. Naturally if you ignore what you know and foolishly create a Text based Spelling Adventure game for a hand held console, your virtual game developing company will end up buried in Alamogordo.Game Dev Tycoon isn't a particularly complex or complete history of the video games industry but that doesn't matter. As casual simulations go, it strikes the right balance between entertainment and challenge. It's unlikely that you'll play it for hundreds of hours but it's fun while it lasts.It's a nostalgic cartoon joyride through the history of video games. Everyone who loves games should play Game Dev Tycoon at least once and it's worth every penny."

As time passes and you develop more high quality games that bring in more money, you are given the option to upgrade to an actual office, where you can hire more people to design and develop higher quality games. Eventually you can upgrade yet again to a large office, with more employees, and the option to start a (highly expensive but rewarding) R&D lab.This game is very intricate, yet seemingly simple. A lot goes into developing a game, depending on each and every genre. Obviously an RPG title needs more focus on Dialogue, rather than A.I., so when you are making these decisions, be aware that they have a tremendous impact on your sales and success.I had bought this game on sale, and it has been on my wishlist for the longest time, but having played it...I would've bought it at full price.

I created one game that randomly became a smash hit, no idea why. Next one totally bombed, again no idea why and the game had no inclination to provide feedback in either case. I shouldn't be forced to use a guide or a wiki just to understand the basic core mechanics of a game. If the game had any kind of tips or feedback added that actually explained things as you went along- what caused a game to succeed or fail, I'd easily change this review to a positive, but it's frustrating to play along and just feel like you're stumbling aimlessly through with no guidance."

Feels like the devs try to steer your story like it would have gone in real life, like the fact there was no outstanding RPG on the N64. In the game, making and succesful RPG for that system is not possible. You might think you made a GREAT one, but it will still get abysmal scores, simply because its on the 'wrong' system. Also, in what world is a 4 out of 10 considered as an ""OK"" score?It's interesting to include the userbase of console to the success of your game, but its taxing on your freedom as a player. I should be able to gain some knowledge about how games work, and mostly why some DON't work. Like, a ""Wild West"" theme doesn't gell with a ""Adventure"" structure, are you kidding me? I can't make my Advance Wars on the NDS without getting terrible scores? In real life, Advance Wars was the ONLY great and successful strategy game on the NDS, and because of its solitary success, the devs of this game don't want to encourage you to make that genre for that system, so they give you really low ratings in the game. That is simply not fairThe worst thing is, they don't really say that. The reviews you get in the game simple give it a score with somtimes a comment like ""Wild West and RPG go well together"" ( in this case that review would give it a high score).There's an extreme lack of feedback. Getting intel feels like a process of trial and error,  because you don't always gain the info you need. The player agency, like choosing your theme and quality of the game is locked away behind the invisible, fictional, iron bars of the creators of this game. Just let me make a racer on the SNES, for crying out loud. I have to keep rollling the dice until it is optional?It's a neat little game, that captivated me for 8 hours until I simply noticed I couldn't make a difference even with a guide next to me. I hope to see another Dev Tycoon in the future which should resolve these problems. (Ironicly, formulated conclusions like this one are NOT in the game itself)."

You'll like growing your small company and making games based on genres you love and even naming them after classics. Once you get to the mid-game, however, things begin falling apart.The most frustrating part of Game Dev Tycoon is the obtuse game rating system they used. While common sense would dictate that you should do your best for every game you make, this is actually how you ruin your company. Now some may say this DOES make sense, becuase ""doing your best"" is expensive. No, the real reason you'll ruin your company is that making three great games gets you WORSE ratings than releasing three average games, each subsequent game being slightly better than the other.In order to get good reviews you need to artificially hold back on technology and techniques, creating worse games than you could, so that way the next game can be incrementally better.While this system makes little to no sense, it could be accepted as a game mechanic if the developers had actually bothered to explain this in the game. They didn't. Which is why every forum discussing this game is full of people who have no idea why they're making great games that get bad reviews and why they then go bankrupt.It's a bad system that feels ""gamey"" and adds an unwanted and unneeded level of artificial complexity. The developers would have been far better served finding a way to add complexity in a way that makes sense, but apparently that level of critical thinking was beyond them."

The problem is it relies on the kind of addiction that is less about 'this gameplay is just so enguaging' and more falls into the realm of 'I'm invested in this studio and numbers are going up.'  While I think that this is a fantastic first game for Greenheart studios, I feel like they failed to escape the trap of creating what ultimately turns into a well themed skinner box.The Positive:  Thematics are very strong and its fun to release a sequeal and then try to line up all your ducks in a row to make it a worthy title.  Its enjoyable to train your employees in specialization and create a hot new engine.  Very solid thematics.The Negative: Yes you can create unluck that crazy topic multigenera game you have always wanted to make, but the game will probably tell you that it sucks.  The value of different combinations are static and unchanging every game, pretty much all the time.  Its easy to fall into the patern of 'find a few generic games and pump out sequals forever' just like in the real game industry!  But that sad things is at least in real life we can hope to break the mold.  In GDT.. not so much.Also the gameplay suffers from a lack of feedback or an ability to predict success ahead of time.  The game is undertuned, because in large part you have little way of knowing without using the internet if any particular decisision will be a decent one.  Once you know however, the result will never chnage, so its a very linear process, and success seems to be primarly about know what will work apriori.  This extends to the systems too.  If a game tanks often you will get no information on why, and that horrible mechanical misunderstand you developed will endur until you are eventually told you are wrong on the internet, and your immersion is broken.The major flaws in this game could be aliviated by randomization, letting you play in a parallel world where as it turns out, your weird mash up of ideas might be able to work if executed well, and then giving the players to tools they need to discover the ins and outs of their randomized consumer tastes."

Except it turns out that unless you spend the maximum amount of money on everything, the console ends up being pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not sellind well. The tutorial also neglects to tell you until after you make the console that you'll also have to continue spending a ridiculous amount of money every month to repair consoles. It costs millions of dollars over the course of a year to repair a few hundred consoles.Another financial issue: the bank offers are absurd. Who the ♥♥♥♥ would ever agree to a loan with 100% APR, which, if not paid in one year, results in the complete dissolution of your company? It's punitive. Yes, companies should tend to not run on deficit spending. But a successful company that's been in the green for its entire life, and drops in to the red once due to investment on a new game engine and a pending hugely hyped game release -- this really shouldn't be punished as harshly as it is. You're already taking a risk by investing that much on something new, and then the bank pop-up comes and says, ""By the way, you instantly lose the game unless you agree to take this loan and pay twice as much next year.""Your success in this game hinges entirely on your ability to make a ""hit"" game, which is all rated at 9s and 10s when released. If you go a couple of years without one, you basically have one last shot after agreeing to one of the horrific loans from the bank.There are some other small quibbles, but these alone make it a bit too frustrating to justify the reward that the gameplay offers."

If you create a 9-10 rated game, you pretty much just sabotaged your career, although it won't be immediately apparent.In order to complete the game, you must always create games that are just a little better than the previous one, which, by the way, is much harder than it sounds as this is all calculated in the background.To summarize, it's a good idea but the mechanics are horrendous."

,Not Recommended,239820,9101512,"Posted: 14 February, 2014",all,perk11,"Brief gameplay description: You develop video games. First you decide the name of the game, genre, topic, platform, target audience. Then you assign time on different parts of the game. When development is completed game gets a review. Better review=more sales. Ones you get $1mln you can hire another employees.At fisrt I liked it. Yay, I made a game that got almost 10/10 score! But then I just couldn't do it again, my games were worse and  eventually I went bankrupt. Ok, let's start again. The story completely repeats. I went bankrupt even earlier. Ok, here comes the third playthrough. All the same messages about game market development become repetetive at this point, but you can't disable them. Also waiting for the ratings takes aboout 15 seconds. It's nice on first playthrough, to be a bit in ancticipation but is really annoying when you try for the third time. I tried playing completely different strategy and still went bankrupt around year 15.Okay, at this point I though - I'm definitely missing something here. So I went to the wiki. I was overwhelmed with amount of information. Turns out the best way to play is with Excel spreadsheet open in another window. Of course the formulas used are never mentioned in game. But that's ok, sometime I like playing with Excel. But after reading further into wiki I realised the most disappointing thing about this game and the reason of my losses. Though in game it looks like you're competing for customers with other companies, in fact you're only competing with yourselves! So once you made a perfect game all the games after it somehow become less valuable for customers. Of course the technology gets better and you probably still make better game if you're lucky with the picking good topic, genre, audience, platform match and assign time right you might get a better game. But good luck keeping cash coming while you try that.And the easier strategy is just... not to make the best games you can. Just make your next game slightly better than the previous and you'll get more profit than if you make one extremely good game in the beginning.Once I realised this, it completely killed interest in the game for me. I like the idea of this game, but the gameplay needs improvement. I think competing with yourself idea was introduced to add challenge, but once you know what the optimal strategy is, the whole game makes no sense at all."

Game Dev Tycoon sadly has said rotten mechanics, and it really is a downer for a game with so much potential for fun.Of course the fun for the game comes from creating your own games. Where else can you create spoofs of classic games from the early 80's and onwards. And for the most part it works the way you would expect it to, and as you forge more and more games you unlock hints for genres and themes to help you create better games without needing a spreadsheet. It gives a satisfying sense of progression for an otherwise hollow feeling game.That is the other thing there is negative about the game before I delve into the mechanics of the game. The game feels empty in terms of aesthetic. It feels mechanical, it has no character despite giving everyone a name. It just pumps out numbers to you and tells you to interpret its vague cryptic messages without any assistance. It can make you lost on what to do when you keep getting bad gamesbut don't know whybecause all you have been doing is what you thought you should be doing.This is where you would naturally look up online what is going wrong, and where you discover the rotten food beneath the rug. What does it simulate? Only two things, the year and your game ""scores"". There is no competator, nothing else going on besides timed events and actions, modifiers and so on. As well the only games it simulates is your own games and your own scores. So how do you get a good rated game, well you need to beat the previous high score. Its simple. So why is this a problem then? That is because the mechanics the developers use to determine this is all based on dice rolls and arbitrary calculations. But why is getting a good score a problem? Because you need to get a good score to get good sales.Thisis a perfect example of why this is the case. Despite getting 11 billion sales, it was only ever 8th top seller, why? Because it only get a 9.25/10, not a 9.5 or a 10/10. The game is incapable of calculating anything outside of whatever games you develop, which means it is easy to abuse to create good games on a consistent basis, and even then RNG decides to throw you a curveball and mess with you. It becomes a chore to sit there and pump out the same drivel because it makes you successful, and is incredibly dull in the long haul.So while the game's premise may have been thinking outside the box, the game hardly gets anywhere close to doing the same. Game Dev Tycoon is a neat concept that is worth a few dollars on sale, but inevitably will only leave you dissapointed with its shallow mechanic's that leave a lot to be desired.See more reviews by following this group -http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JSJaRG"

But having played through the game three and a bit times now, that confusion has turned into pure frustration and even a little bit of anger. In a sentence, this game is a broken, confusing mess that only succeeds in creating the illusion of fun gameplay by keeping every element of its flawed mechanics as vague as possible, and draping itself in a facade of whimsical pseudo-creativity and nostalgia.- The overall gameplay is simplistic at best. In real life, most games are fun because their gameplay is based around things like skill (e.g. Call of Duty), decision-making (e.g. Civilization), creativity (e.g. Minecraft), or emotional manipulation (e.g. Gone Home). This game is based on none of those, and is entirely guesswork or ponderous repetition.- The core mechanics of the game are illogical and counter-intuitive by design. For instance, the reviews your games get are not based on the quality of the game, but how many 'development points' it has compared to your last game. This is opposed to real life, where games are judged both on their own merits and on their relative quality when compared with competing games. This system means you will get a 4/10 for a game that is essentially perfect.- Nothing is explained. As well as the core mechanics, almost every other gameplay element is also completely opaque. All too often games will fail for no logical reason, your staff will sit there doing nothing for weeks (by design, not a bug), training staff yields little to no results, important research will fail to unlock because you didn't do some unconnected thing that's never explained, and random events are baffling and pointless.All these problems mean that there are essentially only two strategies to this game. The first is to make every game you produce as good as it can possibly be. This will lead to huge success mid-game, but means that due to the aforementioned illogical way this game handles reviews, you will hit a brick wall two-thirds into your playthrough where it is more or less impossible to get a good review. The other strategy is to follow the ""success guide"" from the game's wiki word for word. This basically tells you to make mediocre games for your entire playthrough in order to avoid hitting that progress wall. As is the theme with this game, that strategy requires you to perform actions that make absolutely no logical sense, such as hiring incompetent staff or deliberately including bugs in your games in order to prevent your games being ""too good"".In summary the game is lacking any kind of intelligent choices or design elements, favouring repetitive gameplay with vaguely defined and mostly illogical mechanics. It's somewhat fun the first time through, if only because it forces you to use your imagination and dream about being a real game developer, or simply, imagine playing a good game.Despite all my criticism though, I would like Greenheart Games to give it another shot. It's clear they tried their best, and even though the result was a shallow, nonsensical and frustrating mess, there was just a little bit charm and a little bit of promise to the game that demands another try. If they made a sequel with a completely new central mechanic that actually made sense, then I'd be more than willing to give them another chance."

Your team's abilities count less than one would think and there's no room to expand outside the predetermined choices of success.  You won't be creating THE god game for example unless you follow all the predetermined ""best practice"" choices.  Lastly, the music is annoying after a very short period of time.  Game Dev Story just does game development better."
,Not Recommended,239820,21861891,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,Fromagerie,"Now, first, this is a solid game......but I have to mention my first instinctive negative reaction to the game, which was: 'Oh, so you don't really have any involvement in the SPECIFICS of making a game. You just kind of combine a bunch of parameters, hope they work with the genre you chose, and then watch the money roll in.' ....... but I quickly rationalized that away in my head by saying: 'that's completely unfair because it's completely unfair to expect the actual game developers to give you a game in which you actually MAKE GAMES. And besides, the game is about being a developer, not actually making games, so be cool with it.' ...... but after playing it some more, I've realized why that initial reaction is such a huge, legitimate problem: which dude who actually wants to go back in time and make Commodore 64 games actually cares about how much money those games made? The joys of being a young kid navigating DOS to play Ultima and Monkey Island has nothing to do with knowing how much money those made (because most of those games made nothing), it was about the games themselves.So ... this game goes back in time to allow you to make 'Mature Fantasy RPG's for Genesis and gives you absolutely nothing to do with that game but make money off it? I sold 7M copies of a 'Horror RPG' for PC, and I realized: 'Oh, this isn't fun, and certainly not realistic. This isn't actually a simulator of 'game development', it's just a general manufacturing sim in which you get to name your products as though they're videogames.'The fact that I can ostensibly make 'Chrono Trigger 2' is ostensibly fun, but if you don't give me anything more than that, ANYTHING more that helps me to actually play out my vision of what that sort of thing might be, then I have no idea why I'd continue to play this."

You could play the whole game in 3hrs or less. The replay value in my opinion is short lived and can get extremely repetitive  after 3 or so times. I feel the value of this game is worth $5. Theres just not much else being added other than mods, but no additional content from the devs. Games like this I feel should have a strong focus on replay value because its putting the gamers in control, hence the purpose of the ""Simulation."" The time I spent, was because I believed there was more to offer...but found out theres not much. In the end its a good game, if you don't mind spending $10 on a game that loses meaning once you reach the current time frame.

,Recommended,239820,21988410,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"This has been my most recent addiction. This is the first game that I've played that has made me ignore phone calls, knocks on my doors and basically anything that happens in my everyday life. That game is Game Dev Tycoon.The way the game works is that you start off as a small indie developer who develops games in his garage and your main objective is to gain popularity and you do this by making popular and well received games (so basically don't be Digital Homicide.) You might be thinking this is easy as the game doesn't look that hard, but that's the thing. It is easy to be OK at it, it takes a few hours to be good but it takes alot to master. I played this game staright for one day and sank 13 hours into it in 1 day. You need to manage statistics and think what's more iportant in the genre of game that you're creating and if you focus too much on  a certain subject, you will get worse reviews and worse sales, you also need to manage your marketing correctly to achiee better sales. There are tons of stuff you need to manage and despite me not being that much of a fan of strategy games, Game Dev Tycoon gets a pass as it's a really simple game and eas to use by any age.One criticism that I have about Game Dev Tycoon is it's ""story."" Now people that have already played Game Dev Tycoon, you might be thinking ""There is no story in Game Dev Tycoon, I'm not sure what this idiot is talking baout."" That's not entirely true. The developers of the game even say there is a story when you reach the end of the game. The problem is there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between the story mode and when you comlete the stroy except that there are no new consoles are coming out. So you could sort of say that the story is the evolution of the game industry but it's not because it disregards a few of the things that were essential and had a big impact on the game industry. Despite the story not being good or there being a lack of one, that was consumed by the addicting gameplay.Graphics aren't really something to write home about but they look decent showing some good 2D cartoon characters & locations that have been created in a way to give a 2.5D effect. I do have one complaint though. When I moved into my final office, at times the frame rate dropped into the single figures then going to 40 then dropping again to 30 and then going back to 60, this happened on a regular basis.I can guarantee you that when you start playing Game Dev Tycoon, you won't want to stop. It pulls you in and you keep on challenging yourself to see if you can make the absolute perfect game on your favourite platform. I was only able to manage this after developing 70 games, yeah so you're gonna needplenty of practice and have plenty of knowledge of what genres fit with each theme and which genre is best played on which console.I can tell that I'm going to be playing Game Dev tycoon more than you originally think you'll be laying it when first buying it and I recommend this to anybody that has a fascination with games as a whole.Pros+ Addctiong gameplay+ Easy to pick up and play+ Decent 2.5D graphics+ ReplayabilityCons- Terrible ""story""- Frame rate drops at timesFinal verdict: 9/10Steam Curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

When I started it up for the first time, I played it for almost 8 hours straight without realizing.While in the game, you start out in a garage and you slowly move up in the world, the opposite takes effect in real life. Soon you will be moving out of your nice cozy home or apartment into somebody else's garage... but... then I guess you could start making indie games and strick it rich. Maybe. Probably not.As addicting as this game is, it is kinda limited after you get the hang of it. Things like platform releases and success are all scripted and play out exactly the same every time, so as long as you can guesstimate what big games came out at the time, you can usually be pretty successful. I think this game could benefit a lot from some sort of random market influxes, product releases, maybe some rival companies to directly compete against because those things influence game sales and company profitability in real life. Then again, naming your video game company ""my♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; probably would influence your sales in real life too, but that doesn't come into play here so maybe it's for the best.This game has a civ like addictive quality to it (one more game... just one more game...) and mixing and matching game genres and topics with different emphasises on story, gameplay, engine or others is a lot more fun then it might sound. I found this game to be the most fun when I was experimenting with weird combinations for games, which sometimes turned out better or worse (usually worse) than I thought. (Try Hospital Simulator or Music RPG!)So my score?Game Dev Tycoon - 8/10- ""Played it for days."", Ethan the Drake"

As the game says, you are a Game Dev working hard to create the greatest video game development company. This game starts in the 80s with the Commodore64 all the way to New Gen PlayStation/Xbox, giving you a throwdown of gaming history. Now game mechanics, the first and most important mechanic, Game Developing. Game developing in Game Dev Tycoon is simple you choose a name, topic, genre, console, and engine, then you are greeted with 3 Development stages. In the all the stages you adjust sliders representing Game Ingredients (Gameplay, Graphics, Story, Engine, A.I, Level Design, etc.) you have to adjust the sliders based on your topic and genre this get slightly more complex later on. You can also hire staff once you move to a new office, this is when the game becomes more challanging and where the real test starts, whether or not you can become a successfull video game company.-----------------VERDICT:-----------------8.5/10 - This game is great filled with fun content but is more sutible for people with huge imagination, people who love making stories, or people who love the video game industry as a whole. If you aren't like this but still are intrested wait and see if you can get it on sale.-----------------COMMENTS:-----------------I basically lost my life with this game, 100 hours... anyways I'll go hide in a corner and think about my life desicions, see ya later folks!"

Its only redeeming factor is that it holds a sort of logic aspect, a kind of common sense quiz on video games that anyone whose been around long enough could guess. It does well to unload mechanics onto you as you progress but that doesn't distract from the fact that the gameplay is just menu clicking and progress bar watching, there just isn't anything here to warrant it being a good game, sadly, unfortunately, it's boring, but at the same time addicting.I spent an entire day clicking through menu's and it's this fact I regret, for what did I waste that time for? for what was the purpose of me doing this? I could've been sketching, drawing, studying, but instead I played this, this is not an experience that gives back, it only takes, it only devours, it is not worth your time, and it was never worth my time.Avoid this game, not because it was badly made, it's very sound in its construction and does what it sets out to do, but because there isn't anything here, it's as devoid as any smartphone app, it's not clever, it's not an artistic or technical achievement, it's just mindless junk-food in the form of an EXE file, you could do so much better with your money than this."

The rating for this game is an understatment in my opinion. The games difficulty in some people's eyes foreshadows everything good in the game but aren't games suppose to be I challenge? I mean you don't want to beat a game in 2 minutes, games are suppose to give you a thrill and leave a lasting effect on you. People treat Game Dev Tycoon unfairly but give it a shot and I promise you will like it. Just because you don't make it the first time doesn't mean you should give up on the spot, you have to keep trying until you achieve success. Some people call this a Game Dev Story clone which I agree it is but in it's defence that game if for the iPhone,Android,etc. This is kind of like a PC port of it (of course better because you can mod), I truly enjoyed Game Dev Story but I enjoy Game Dev Tycoon even more.

The graphics are also simple, yet there are nice details in the art assets. The plot is good, though not really a good indication of what it's really like to develop games.

My average games are high-octane and usually require a lot of attention and dedication to get somewhere good, to meet goals. For that, I find Game Dev Tycoon to be a nice relaxing break, I can just left click anywhere on the screen to pause the game at any point. It does require thought, don't get me wrong! One can go bankrupt and fail if one does not put thought or pay attention.After playing it a whole bunch I think the biggest gripe I can come up with is how the game plateaus after 35 years have passed in the game. After the 35 years had passed, the worst game I made had an average score of 3.75 ... It was terrible, and yet I still managed to pull profit out of that game.Game Dev Tycoon will play nice by giving you the ability to have a sort of on-the-fly chart to use as a rule of thumb for when you develope new games. Let's say you develope and release a game, shortly after you may analyze it and in return you will get back between one and three pieces of information, statistics to help you the next time you develope a game. In some sense the game will kick your butt, but in another sense it plays nice and helps you out.It's difficult to put into words, but it doesn't stop me from recommending this game.

Even just simple number indicators next to your staff to show their stats would really help. Also the research options umbrella too much and need to be seperated into certain sections so it's a bit more simple.Also it's a Game Dev Story ripoff (which I'm sure just rips off other business management games) but that's okay.

76561198007572703,Recommended,239820,29430549,Posted: 22 January,all,spaceman_spiff1980,"Very well thought out game. I like the replayability where, in part, you randomize what a company can start out with concerning types of games to make. It seems there are other random factors at play since my first time playing, I breezed through quite a bit even with some challenges on the way. But playing it the second time, my company's just getting by and I am noticing what perks I had with my first run are hard to come by in the second one, i.e. the advanced graphics buff, getting online play early, etc. So, bravo on making each play somewhat different. (10/10)I am also liking that this was not overthought at all and even with the simple adjustment of levers for making a game, there is that complexity of what to put with it from the engine you built to see if it will enhance the game and make it a big hit or not at all.  All around, this was well put together. (10/10)If there was a con to this delightful game, I would say that they did this so well that there really isn't a need for a second version. Allowing mods can extend play, but ultimately it's great as it is. I'm sure someone might think it needs a facelift and might be able to squeeze out another neat take on this, but hands down this is a great game. I thought the interface was different than how I approach keeping track of history, such as how you view your game history and the lack of graphs to see your finances. However, that all seems like splitting hairs and just a different point of view since what is in place is very straightforward and easily accessible.There is one point, though, that I wonder what the team's thoughts were on: Competition in the game... Yes, it mentions it, but it's as if you're completely independent of compeition. Your efforts are defined by randomness as well as how your company is advancing rather than that AND what the competition is doing. Did it add too much complexity? Based on how you made your game, would it make tasks too stressful? I could see how given what a player has to go through for the game phase and trying to be very progressive with keeping people trained, getting games out fairly back to back, and supplementing income on contracts from time to time or simply farming research points to get more features for your game engines---that that is quite toss about for responsibilities. To add how competitors are progressing and what they are publishing versus what you are can make that feel heavily pinched. So, perhaps right there is another interesting take to the game if a second version was put out and that given what is already there, how can you rightly put in a more challenging aspect to get more out of the game?... (9/10)Keep up the good work! (9.7/10)"

You could be literally any gaming company you can imagine, from a mobile developer to a ""mature games only"" company. You could even roleplay as your favourite game developer and start way back in the ""Commodore 64"" era. The game takes you from a garage to an office and eventually to a million-dollar R&D facility, which gives you a strong sense of achievement when you reach your goals and get a hit game. Every major console is covered in the course of the game, ranging from the golden era of the late 80's-early 90's, to the gaming boom of the mid-late 1990's, all the way to modern times.The strategic nature of the game is not AS important as in some other strategy titles. Game Dev Tycoon is a lot more casual of a strategy game than things like Europa Universalis 4 or even the Rollercoaster Tycoon series. However, I can tell you that the game is enjoyable regardless of your experience in strategy games.Overall, this is an amazing game. Can't wait for the sequel. 10/10."

,Not Recommended,239820,16929086,"Posted: 7 July, 2015",all,The Dokta,"Technically, Game Dev Tycoon is better than Game Dev Story by Kairosoft.  It looks and sounds better, it's got more depth, more detail and allows players more freedom to experiment, make mistakes and excel.Yet despite that, it's not a better game.It boils down to two fundamental reasons:Firstly, it's a little too deep for its own snorkel.  There are too many variables to track between individual developer stats, distribution of time and talent and all the little RNGs that are somehow still simplified into two numbers (not a fantastic representation of what makes a game great btw).  The key to success in GDT basically boils down to balancing a buttload of numbers.Secondly - and very importantly - its means of quantifying a great game are borked as a spork.**SPOILERS**I'd like to repeat how unpleasant it is to see a game's value reduced numerical expressions of its technical and design value.  It's ironic to see a game that - in all honesty - wouldn't score that high in either category focus on those two particular qualities.What really makes unhappy though is the fact that your success boils down to a very controlled escalation of those two numbers over time.  If you suddenly create an international success, your next game HAS to be at least 110% or it will flop on its face.Just to reiterate:  In order to succeed at this game, you spend most of your time juggling a bunch of numbers that fall into one of two jars, and these jars have to be just a little bit more full than the last time you filled them.  Too little and you lose, too much and you'll lose the next time.  This is a step down from Game Dev Story's whopping FOUR jars (still an oversimplification mind you) and forces you to hamstring your own efforts to maintain a controlled advancement curve.I need to be clear:  I didn't go out of my way to find this information until a runaway success was followed by a slew of disaster releases, despite reliably high numbers.  Finding out that the game is built to punish accidental excellence isn't a great feeling.Knowing what I do, I really can't bring myself to play any more than I already have, because it's no longer Game Dev Tycoon.  It's RNG Accountant Tycoon."

,Not Recommended,239820,17398188,"Posted: 5 August, 2015",all,VELASARIUS,"This game is fun, but not for long. There are some things in the game mechanics you should know about.* The title of your games matter, but the game rewards you based on how similar your game titles are to real life game titles. For example, if you name your title, Zetroid instead of Galactic Knight, your game will receive greater praise over your original idea. This takes away from the premise of the game.* Unique Game Combinations will receive poor reviews if they hold no mainstream popularity, and that is bad. One of my early titles was called, Last Operative. It was Adventure Genre plus Government Story Line, but it received poor reviews more for being a ""bad combination"" than for me not developing it correctly.  I only received one research remark about how game engine was not that important to this type of game. That's not fun. What the game should have done is, if you did a nice job developing the game, reward you for the uniqueness of the game. 'You have made an unpopular combination a success! There are few games likes this out there, so more people are actually buying it!' or something to that effect.* You can't make sequels to your games!  That's not realistic at all.  Sure, you might say, well if your game does really well, than you just might milk your sequels and that would not be very challenging. There is some truth to that, except that in real life, developers do milk the game sequels!  Even if that were a good reason for a simulation like this, a simple mechanism that says, 'You recently released a game with a similar title, make a few games and then make your sequel.'  That would have been great.*This is just an idea, that DevTycoon could have used one more factor to add to your fun. As it stands it is very simple to create a game, you pick a name, a genre, a topic, and then you adjust how much time you focus on what aspects of the game you will dedicate greater resources to. This is fun, but in a game where cashflow is volative, where you can be rolling in the doe one minute and see half your funds dry up the next, it would have been good to add one more factor in creating each game. Say for example, out of three parameters that you must choose from, World Design, Game Play, and Sound, and you choose World Design to take up much more than the others, than you would get more say in why or what makes our World Design so interesting.  This would add more depth to this game.Other things that are just okay:* All your developer does while he works is scratch his head. More animations were needed, don't you ever jut feel like banging your head against the screen?* The developer could have used better appearance options. You only ever see the back of his head, even while you are choosing what the back of his head looks like. They could have given you more hair options, like mohawks, or buzz cuts, or military cuts, etc.* The game should have done more for the developer's surroundings while he climbs up the success ladder. You only get changes in your environment when your office changes. There is so much that happens between those moments, and there could have been more effort to add little changes to your environment that happens here and there as you perform well or not perform well. Say for example you broke 100K sales, and the game acknowledges this to you, it would been great if your car in your garage got a paint job from gray to red, or your pong poster changed to a yellow ball with eyes on it, etc."

The core mechanic is well thought out and entertaining, although I didn't like the time limits imposed on development. There's no ""when it's ready"" in this game. Can be a little obscure in some places, so I'd recommend doing a little reading up on guides etc. if you really want to maximise your awesomeness.The side mechanics (the R&D lab and the marketing hub) are sort of vestigial, and not nearly as fleshed out as the main mechanic - all in all, rather unfinished feeling.The gamedoeshave a limited timeframe during which things happen. You can continue to play afterwards, but no more events will take place. You'll just churn out games one after the other.Still, all in all, I really enjoyed my playtime on this game and strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the tycoon genre.

I developed some great game's like blackflops etc. I was a game devlopper making big names. it was greatit is so sad the game doesn't go further to the future with new consoles.... i know this isn't verry logical to guess wich console there will come etc. but believe me if there was a DLC for like €2-4 with new consoles and new things to rechearch i would be the first to buy.

Sliding the bar up and down for gameplay isn't going to give you a 10/10 game. You have to match the genres with the topic and see waht combinations work(eg Space and action is a great combo, Space and adventure is ok), so you WILL have failed games published. That's fine. It won't affect the reviews of future games. You also need to research things like better sound, graphics, etc. There's a lot more stuff that you will have to find out for yourself.  Yes, I know many people are complaining that after you beat the game there isn't much to do. FIrst of all, you can't really beat it in a couple of hours. I'm not sure how long, but after 2 hours of consistent gameplay I still have a long way to go. Don't forget the price of the game. It's $10. But also don't overlook the simplistic graphics, old release, and simplistic-seeming gameplay. Give this game a try. I would still definitely recommend it in 2017."

Of course, to solve this I tried to develop more games to counter it the difficulties and cost of a AAA MMO, but it just didn't work.In the end, my empire fell.

But saying that, I still reccomend it and here's why.This game is very light. It's hard to call it a,""Simulation,"" game because of how casual it is. It's kind of arcady, but in a good way. It has sliders and such, as you can see in the screenshots, and there's customization here and there. There's only so much you can do with the sliders though, only so many different varients, little tweaks here and there. There's a good amount of product genres, and there's many different people to hire. Later in the game, SPOILER ALERT, you can make your own game console, though you're very limited. It's also got the regular, expected, customizable character, the ability to name the games, change work places through events, name your company. You can imagine making a whole series if you wanted to.Overall, it's a short but sweet, casual simulation game.

I would have enjoyed the game more if I could have spent more than 20 minutes figuring out a console's high and weak points.  The most fun is at the beginning of the game when things are real basic.  I got a warning that it's ""game over"" about 4 months before my flagship MMO was being developed, I haven't researched past 3d graphics v2, and AAA titles aren't available yet.  Maybe I should have spent less time making awesome games and more time investing in a tech specialist/ R&D Lab that only generates research?-There's no way to do any market research on what genres, platforms, and topics combo best other than thrusting wildly into the night, developing an experimental title that will potentially tank your team and funds.  If you go look up a guide there is basically zero challenge anymore and it becomes a spreadsheet victory.-Why the hate on strategy games!?

Also, while the game tries to teach you things gradually (and does very well with this initially) there are some periods where the rate of development means you find yourself not knowing how to do something successfully. It is also not explained how employee skills related to the different game areas.

I find Game Dev Tycoon much more realistic, as it doesn't focus on all those points you get when developing the game; you have to advertise your game properly, all while dealing with critics, piraters, and other life-based legal issues. There's also the option to develop a game and let a big company publish it, where you get a fraction of the money (usually around one tenth).This is a very realistic game developing tycoon simulator, and anyone who's in to these kind of games should definitely pick this up when they can."

F.e. why can I code an Engine and then use it on ALL current platforms and even those not jet developed? Shouldn't engines be platform-specific?And why is it impossible to update or fix an engine whatsoever?How can I make top modern RPGs without ANY sound support and still get great ratings? Likewise, how can my engine support tons of questing and MMO-handling, without my guys actually spending any effort on a game's engine developement?I would dare to say the game can still be expanded and improved on a large scale... but it's nontheless very fun to play already. I'm on my 4th playthrough by now and are gatherng ideas how to make my 5th one. And I, by far, didn't yet discover most of the possible genre combinations.Lastly, I would like to give this game a + for being the FIRST GAME of it's author.

Do NOT buy this game.This is not a tycoon or a simulation game. This is extremely simplified version of what would be one, it looks and plays like an iPad game.Playing this is impossible as this is way too much simplified and became unrealistic at certain points. You just move sliders up and down and hoping it would come out at good. But what about other developers in the virtual world? We should've able to look at their scores with their games and take lessons from them. Orherwise, how the hell am I supposed to know Werewolf and Adventure is a terrible combination before doing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (oh yeah, this is indeed true as my next issue with the game.)Werewolf and Adventure is a GOOD combination in real life. They gave me terrible scores because developers coded the game terribly. A lot of real world topics which came out as fantastic ideas are just 4/10 in this game. This is just because of hardcoded programming, game has no proper AI, it does not think about new/fresh ideas or silly ideas that gave birth to great games. It has a logic in two state; it is bad and it is good.Gameplay is extremely repetitive and boring, with the added stress of having bad reviews, this game is not fun at all. But as everyone else is already pointed that out, I am not gonna stay on that matter.Another major issue is, even when I make a game and get bad reviews on it, game report says it is a great combination and it is on a good platform. WELL; WHAT DID I WRONG THEN YOU BULLCRAP GAME?!Please do not waste your time with this crappy game.Also, NVidia users need to tweak the game out on Nvidia Control panel, because it thinks this game is a game called ""Russian Roulette 2"" and uses wrong performance presets on it, so it causes severe performance issues, making game unplayable."

Even though I don't have many hours played, I've played through the whole game a few times and it's always a good experience. It can be repetetive, and that's probably why I have a lack of hours in.You start out as a nobody, starting up a game developer company with the name of your choosing. (A few certain names will give you achivements). You can give your character a custom look, but this feature is very minimal, but at the same time not really needed in the game. The goal is to become a successfull game developer that's rich, but in the beginning all you need to really worry about is to not go bankrupt. The bank account starts with 70 000 dollars. It seems a lot at first, but then you begin your first game and you will see the money goes down to 30 000 or even 20 000 if you're a big spender. As you can see, money can become a huge problem fast if you don't get good reviews and taking a loan at the bank is a never ending circle, so I would recomend going bankrupt and trying again if this is the case. Researching new topics is a must. There are 4 topics avaliable at the start, but there are far more ready to be unlocked with 10 RP points each. These will make all your games more versataile and the reviewers likes this. After a while you will find yourself making new engines for more advanced and detailed games, this is also a must, and you will need to find out yourself when a new engine is needed in the marked. These engines are expensive, so you need to prioritise what to put in them.After some games you start building a solid bank account and you can move in to some new sweet offices were there are four spots for new employees. This is a turning point where you will probably lose a lot of money if you're not smart about who you hire. More people, means games with way more depth than before, and with this comes more options about your games.When you've hired more people and more money starts rolling in, even bigger offices will be unlocked, this is the tycoon part of the game. Earn money, buy♥♥♥♥♥♥that can make you more money, etc. After many years you will eventually hit the ""end"". You are congratulated and will have the option to continue on. It's at this point the game get's pretty stale, but thankfully the developers have added in the Steam Workshop where you can install different mods to have plenty of more time to dig into the game. I havn't tried these, but they are said to be really good."

I don't know why it's so fun, it just is. My Racing Sim series has been my most successful series so far which makes me happy lol.The names they use for the consoles is funny, to avoid having to pay them they mix the names up (For Example, the gamesphere lol) Sometimes games fail when it doesn't seem like they should, and I have run into this odd thing where when a message pops off it cuts the sales for that month. I don't know if maybe the sales are just fluctuating that much, but it seems like a glitch when the second month is lower than months 3-4-5-6. But aside from that I've not run into any issues. But when my first title reached 1 million units sold, I was hyped and just wanted to play more lol.I've been stubborn and been an indie dev the whole time, those publishers won't get their claws into me.I've enjoyed myself far more than I expected. For the current sale price its absolutely worth it, but honestly if I'd known I was going to enjoy it this much, I wouldn't have bought it on a Sunday night, and I would have bought it before it was on sale. It's been sitting on my wishlist for awhile.It was also a very nice touch seeing a thank you message in the game from the devs, for purchasing the game.

It can get a bit reptetitive, but allows for enough complexity as the game progresses that I will be spending a lot more time playing this one.The formula for this game is simple all in all, however Greenheart Games (GG) has managed to make the repeatable formula interesting. The combinations of Topic, genre, platform, and engine allows for all kinds of wacky combinations. (my favorite was a music RPG for the Gameboy XD) As the game progresses, more complexity arises, and therfore more strategy is involved with each individual game. I have not come close to being finished with this game, I'm excited for the parts of the game I haven't gotten to yet, and I am even more excited for what GG will bring to the table in the future. Good job guys!Early in the game, the fear of the market going against you mixed with the anticipation of releasing new and interesting games to the few fans you have creates a sense of excitement and dread. Figuring out which platforms will survive in the early days is just as fun as making your games and watching them turn out. I heartily enjoyed trying to figure out what platforms were what in the real world. GG uses similar but different names for each platform in the game.Later in the game as the company grows there's more strategy in each decison. It becomes more of the management game that the tags suggest. You start having to manage more and more people, and figure out the value-proposition of training vs developing vs researching vs fatigue. At first this seems simple, but then you realize, nothing is as simple as it seems.This is about as far into the game as I've gotten. I'm excited for what I haven't seen, happy with what I've gotten so far, and can't wait to see what GG has in store for the future.Happy Gaming :)"

Simplicity really is a virtue with this one, simplicity that combined with slick execution (give or take some unwarranted slowdown at endgame stage) has caused me to put, well, frankly an absurd quantity of time into this game.Graphics are simple and to-the-point, the UI is streamlined and accessible and the character is all yours- the product of what you put into the game. On the face of it you see Game Dev Tycoon’s lack of complexity and minimalist smartphonesque mechanics are its chief limitations; this is one of those games that if you play to ‘win’ it, you’ll barely get more than your money’s worth out of it. On the other hand when you throw in a little bit of RPGing, dreaming up elaborate studio-making series with characters and lives of their own this simple game becomes infinitely more enjoyable.You’ll be following the ups and downs of your favourite releases, cheering on those occasional standout successes and grimacing at bank balance ruining failures. You’ll be running your little studio into the red ink-splattered ground, before seeing it soar back to the black skies of success with that one desperately needed #1 hit. You’ll be specialising your studios more and more with each successive playthrough, going for RPGs and adventure games with one and action games and sims in the next. Before you know it you’ll be laughing maniacally and… O.K. so the point is I like this game a lot.For all this though the game isn’t entirely unproblematic. ‘Player-generated story’, that key element in what would otherwise be a niche little business sim, isn’t as well encouraged as perhaps it should be. You can name your games, studio and avatar but that’s the height of it; no major studio customisation is to be had, there’s no system whatsoever for importing custom cover art for your titles. The simplicity of the core mechanics too can get grating- fullTheme Hospitalstyle work-environment planning is underdone in modern games and the mechanic would work well here, but as it is you can’t so much as rearrange the desks.Also odd is the sense you get at some point that the entire games market consists of your company, with any pretence of a market beyond the strange white ether surrounding your office fading away into mathematical abstraction. Consoles come and go, sure, but never do you hear mention of any game but your own. Never does one of your competitors set a new record for game quality you have to match up to. This lack of any sense that you’re playing against anything may be somewhat calming, but sits uneasy with some of the premises of a business sim. The lack of multiplayer, too, limits the scope for playing the game in any pseudo-competitive way. Not that one should try to though, it’s a far better experience taken easily.And that is, at base, what I think this game is best thought of as. Not so much a vaguely serious self-retrospective of the gaming industry as simply a very fun little game, one which I’d gladly recommend."

Whilst still a work in progress this game has a few interesting hooks and a charming home grown style that certainly appears to my inner massive game sperging fanboy.Starting in the eighties with just your own main character with a simple studio name and your bedroom you too can try and survive almost thirty years of video gaming history. Either by innovation, smart marketeering or simply leeching off trends and popular consoles it really is up to you and your growing expanding company. Your progress of course is measured in money and your ever growing fandom the former you will always gain no matter how terrible or generic your games are the latter a constant never easy to please jaded crowd who will leave you the instant you have a rubbish hit. Despite the bare bones interface and obvious scripted nature that will limit you to one or two play throughs a year I find the art style and tongue in cheek parodies of gaming culture, tech and general development amusing.Sadly though the bare bones nature does limit some things. The main draw of creating your own awesome/hilariously stupid games is simply limited to Name/Type of game/Genre of game/Platform/Engine and seeing if you can make it big on a couple of stupid concepts. However I am easily amused and once you make it big you find yourself risking your vast fortune just to see what the dumbest combination of things can at least sell (Government Romance RPG Simulator go). Still, I would have liked unlocked half the genre tree in my second play through to mix things up a bit more at the start.It'd be pretty cool too if you were competing with other AI game companies like your rivals in Theme Park and there was a deeper Award system like in the classic The Movies.At the moment in time, I would pick this up during a Sale. Even a minor one. I did enjoy it but it still needs a bit of work. Happily I see they have Mod Support and when they get around to finishing the game hopefully STEAM Workshop will come to save the day and tweak some of the minor issues."

So many different components go into the game development process in a way that a slight mistake could really cost you. Though, the game can go on for a long while, if you will it.-AddictingI had to tear myself away from this game. It was insanely addicting and I'll probably play it more tomorrow once I have the time. It makes you feel like you could go just a little further and do a little better over and over again. ""Just one more game. I'll nail it this time--""-ComplexityIt shows a lot about the different aspects of the game development process and is actually pretty informative for people who don't know much about what goes into games. While it simplifies the process to a degree, it still gives you an eye-opener into all the crap game devs have to go through.-Adorable art styleLook at the cute little devs in their little chairs. Aren't they sweet?-IndieWhile ""indie"" isn't really assurance of perfection, it's really inspiring to see such a thorough and well-developed game, especially one that breaks the 4th wall in such a charming way. They deserve every dollar I handed over.ConsI can't really come up with any specifically bad things other than things that are teeny tiny annoyances that really aren't much of a problem at all.-Learning curveYour mistakes early on can really cost you in revenue and reputation. While that's more of the fault of the player than the game, it can come as quite a shock. Be careful how you invest your money.-Long campaignTechnically not really a con either so much as the hours put into a campaign can make quick replay difficult. Not that it's a bad thing though. Besides, there's also an option for a shorter one... or longer if you're up for it.All in all, I really liked this game. It's charming, informative, challenging, and worth every penny."

Steam Workshop is a real treat.This is a multi-stage business management sim centered around the somewhat fast paced production of videogames. Action always happens in only one screen and the visual representation of the office acts as a series of clicker shortcuts for quick actions. You start with only one clicker hotspot which you can train and which gains XP and you gain additional ones as you expand. It is mechanically fairly well designed and the videogame theme is for the most part well implemented and the game feels not too casualized with market trends, researchable game features and staff management."

However I soon realised that all the creativity in the game was infact happening in my head. I could barely customise any aspect of my games, or do much of anything MYSELF to make the game better. All I could do was give a super vague idea to my staff and let them get on with it and hope for the best. This is what it's like to be one of those rich suits that get credit for a game that they didn't put any effort into.I don't feel like my purchase was a bad one, but looking at this game now just makes me sad. Realising that even end-game it never gets that much better. All the things I expected and hoped for were missing. It lacks both fun and realism.Here's a list of improvements off the top of my head. Skip to the bottom for the short version:Make each step of the game creation process a game itself, allowing the player to have some influence on the quality of their game. And also to make this actually feel like a game. With gameplay.A big deal is made about your company and how you make it better, but it's like you're the only company that exists. Adding AI companies opens up MANY options! Like the more realistic way of starting out by working on other people's games. It's so weird you can't do that, and the closest thing are the offers from publishers. Similar to this, once you're big enough It'd be nice to have you hiring the smaller companies to work for you. But I'm not done yet! You'd also be able to learn about rival games being made through potentially illegal means, and then intentionally make a game very similar but quicker to make their game bomb. The rivalries of Nintendo and Sega, or Microsoft and Sony, these are things so huge in gaming and yet they are ignored here. Would laso make it clear how much effort you need to put into a game because right now it feels like I get 3s or 11s totally at random.Revamp the sequals, add expansions. Sequals should not just default to the same things the previous game had, but actually SKIP those parts if you so choose, because you'd be re-using stuff from them. Like Doom1 to Doom2 you'd not put any work into changing the gameplay or graphics and such. Instead you'd just do the story and level design again. Making sequals a very easy thing to do. Just like in real life. And also bypassing the problem where a genre would become less desireble the more games there are of that genre, which is something that should be added. I know you have something kinda like that, but it only applies to like 2 games made simultaniously.Expansions would keep the whole, not needing to work on them very much part, but would limit buyers only to those that bought the base game. So a bit of predictive thought is required there, making it a nice gamble for more money. Adds some actual strategy to the game. Also, I don't get why you made new engines need to always be made from scratch to add just one new feature. What ever happened to copy-pasting code? The only time this'd make sense was if you were using a bought engine (this needs adding too) and you wanted to copy it's features without comitting a crime. Also comitting crimes should be a feature.From the get go, your staff should be good at the more specific parts of game design, rather than such broad categories. And they should each work on their own areas at the same time, instead of everyone working together on each bit one at a time. If someone dies a bad job on their area, you should be able to micromanage and have that one area redone and not just scrap the whole thing. And on that note, you should be allowed to bench a game if you want to wait a bit longer to release it incase it's bad timing. And I don't mean just not pressing the release game button, because that elaves the staff sitting around unable to work on a new game anymore. The ability to canibalise an unreleased game to make a new one would then be a cool feature to add from this. This benching or simply moving the staff away to work on something else means that 1 staff member being on vacation wont ruin a game anymore. As they can finish off their part once they get back and nothing is lost but a little time for it's release. But not production time, as your staff will be doing something else now. Which brings me to the most important thing, being able to make multiple games. You should be able to get enough staff or hire enough other companies that you can do more than 1 game every half a year or so. In all my playthroughs I have ONCE ever had more than 1 game to show at a convention. That's unrealistic and unfun. Unless this is a Blizzard Simulator.----TL;DR. Add minigames for the game design process. Allow making multiple games. Add other companies (and rivalry stuff). Allow putting a game away for later. More micromanagement. Revamp sequel and expansions.Maybe you never meant for this to be anything than a time waster, I dunno. But I hope that if you make a sequel you will treat it as a proper game and give it the features it deserves."

Making grading of games entirely relative to previous game scores rather than anything objective.

It tries to compete with more popular tycoon games like Rollercoaster Tycoon. This would be fine if the devs put in the work to make the core mechanics of the game fine. Alas, they didn't. This game lacks the basic features of what you would imagine a tycoon game based around developing video games requires. For example, when you make a game, and the reviews come in, the reviews will never give you any meaningful information as to how to make a better game, if you made a good game they will almost never give you useful information (I say useful because they do say stuff like ""The idea to combine sports and simulation was good"", which is so blatently obvious it hurts), and they won't give you information as to how to earn more money next time. They also, from my experience, felt almost random, where a nearly identical game creation as to one I created before would get often a much worse/better score, and if you remove the few variables of my staff needing brakes and such, you honestly still believe it might be random.In conclusion, maybe get this game if it's on sale for like 90%, you might get a kick out of it for 30 minutes, but other than that, don't get it"

Neither the BETA without-workshop (why is not having a Steam Workshop a 'feature'?) and the base version with Workshop completely break the game in different instances. Some people can't seem to get the game loaded, some experience constant crash to desktops, and others are getting entire save corruptions.The mods available on Steam Workshop are often incompatible with previously downloaded mods from other sources, both corrupting them and making the Workshop completely fail even after deleting and re-installing the game.The Team that made the game seems very disinterested in adding new features or content, constantly telling people to ''make their own mod'', which completely ignores those who brought it because it's a casual game, and have no interest in learning to code anything.The 'community' is highly self-insulated and treats new people or those seeking technical help with utter contempt, being often vicious and cruel because they've not ''invested enough time'' into the game or ''don't know how code works'' because they don't want to spend their downtime learning to code.The game is extremely bland without heavy modification, and doing so requires excessive patience and battling against the mod authors and game makers. Not worth it for the price asked for, unless you enjoy paying to do a lazy game makers job for them.Ironically, the above issues do not exist in pirated versions of the game. A friend owned a pirated version, and after seeing it on sale here, it inspired us both to buy it. Sadly, my version constantly fails, and his version doesn't load et all. The above experiences are a summary of our experiences with legitimate copies of the game.Would not recommend for Tycoon fans or rogue-lite fans - buy Rollercoaster Tycoon or Theme Hospital instead for tycoon fans. For rogue-lite games Binding of Isaac and Hand of Fate are great. Both paired sets are much more in depth and problem free than this game."

The core of the game has you picking the topic and genre of the games you wish to develop.  You then give your employees the percentage of time to work on different areas of the game (graphics, sound, world design, etc.).  If you pick a good topic/genre match, and manage your time well, your games will receive high ratings.The main problem I have with the game is that you are left to guess which topic-genre combinations the developer thinks are good and which combos he doesn't.  For example, if I were to create a game with the ""Business"" topic and the ""Action"" genre, the game would claim this is a bad or terrible combo.  Well, there's no reason a game developer can't make a great action game about business.  It might actually be pretty sweet.  You could call it Corporate Warrior and have your businessman hero fight rival businessmen, or hippies.Great games are built from innovative, even strange-sounding ideas.

But with Game Dev Tycoon, my laptop overheats within ten minutes at the later parts of the game.I know, my crappy computer is not representative of the average gamer's experience, but it still bothers me that a game this straight-forward requires such an immense amount of computational power. There are no fancy graphics, it's not running a hundred dwarves through path-finding like Dwarf Fortress. There is no reason that so much CPU is necessary to run this game.I am, on principle of what must be poor algorithmic design, to leave a negative review, but I'm certain that most people won't actually be troubled by the inefficiency that makes this game unplayable for me.

Your games are rated as a function of your development points versus your direction, and if you cant increase your dev points game after game you will stagnate and lose (even if you hit the perfect Fantasy RPG Everyone PS2).  The idea is you have to do ""good"" on one game, then ""good +n"" from then on, because if you keep delivering ""good"" it gets rated lower and lower.  You can get around that with a cheatmod, but then all of your games sell millions of copies and this title becomes uninteresting.If there were some way that the point requirement decayed or was relaxed (such as a difficulty setting) maybe the average player could get past the release of the mBox.Kudos for the challenge though (but still, boo @ the hidden handicap).

If I want to specialize my studio in RPGs, why force me to make sport games and mobile games I have no interest in? The game punishes you if you do the same kind of game twice, or if you start a series and make a follow up to the first game instead of a totally new one. This is not true in the real world, continuing existing successful IPs is more reliable than starting new IPs all the time.- Gameplay is basicly watching progress bars go up- Gameplay is basicly playing ""wack a mole"" with game genres and plateforms matchups trying to find what would be successful, so boringREVIEWBottom line is : I did not like it. It was a huge waste of time.First most of the game consists of watching progress bars go up. That's the whole gameplay. But the main problem is getting bad scores on your games even if everything seems to be fine and you respect all the concepts that the game explains to you (the right plateform and genre and affinities and target audiance and priorities, no bugs, high quality, no repetition) yet you get 3-4 marks without knowing what is wrong. Game seems random most of the time, and it seems hard to play without an excel document referencing what the develpers //think// are good combinations.Yes there must be a logic underneath, but the game does a poor job at telling you what went wrong or at explaining the mechanics.

Most of the fun comes far too late in a career's lifespan, and I have consistently been unable to access the research lab until around 10 years after the main game ended.

That has no basis in reality. Why do I have to make an research an alien game when really I just want to research ninja. This could have been handled better.

It allows you to feel like you're developing games, creating new franchises and consoles in your image, making the games you want become the best. However, this is about as far as it goes and in the later stages of the game this excitement at creating the games tends to get a little stale. To my first point, I would recommend this game if you got it while on sale and if you use it as a meaningless distraction, maybe on your break at work or something.However, as a stand alone game with the aim to creating a gaming industry it falls a little short, if anywhere, on the rewards of such. As others have mentioned your games get rated based on a very sketchy out of ten by four different dudes that seem to have no particular focus on any aspects of the games. This scores then get based onto your previous games according to how good your previous title was and how good the current one is. While this can be realistic (come on, admit that you sometimes say a game is crap just because it's not as good as a previous game in that series despite that on it's own it would be considered pretty damn good) it doesn't add to the gameplay and instead serves as more of an annoyance and demotivator.Most of the other features are pretty decent but nothing more than you would expect from a decent flash game. The effects of adding features to your game engine and then trying to implement it into your games are rarely noticed and I felt that if anything it restricted me from making the ideal game. I felt that there were too many moments that I had to sacrifice important aspects to a game in favour of others purely because they would not be completed on time. While I understand it's the developer basically saying that you can never get everything you want in a game otherwise it would take too long to produce, most of the features that I have to choose between I know are in pretty much most games nowadays so that still detracts from what we have in our world now.Overall, this game is a decent crack at a unexplored mini genre (Game dev) with a well thought out game production process. However, there was a small problem in the execution and a couple of the feautres didn't really add to the gameplay and instead detracted from it. A good game when idling, but nothing to sit down to and play solidly.If I had to give it a score I would put it around 5/10."

Sadly, I settle for ""No"", because on the balance there's probably not enough here to justify your money and time.Game Dev Tycoon is a simple simulation/management game in which you start a game development company from your garage and steadily try to build an empire. If this seems reminiscent of a certain mobile experience from a developer named Kairosoft, then you already know how this experience works. And, on the whole, Kairosoft brought more polish and charm to their experience than Greenheart Games manages to summon.There's not a whole lot more to say at this point. This isn't a bad game, per se, it's simply not good enough to merit a recommendation."

The gameplay to this is simple, select type and genre, and then use sliders to adjust values for the game. Different types/genres need different slider values to succeed, and the only way to figure out how is to release games before you know exactly what to do (or just look it up). However, there is a fairly low ceiling. There are no competitors, you only compete against yourself. If you make a break through game early on, it becomes way more difficult for the next few hours as you aren't able to consistently make games of the same calliber. Eventually, you hit the ceiling, unable to make any better games at all. Despite all this, the game feels ridiculously easy. Until you screw yourself over, the game is a cake walk, and there are not enough mods out there to change the game enough to give it any sort of replay value. I've never beat the game, yet I've felt satisfied losing. I felt no need to try again and get to the end, or do better than my previous play through. It's a decent game, but it's getting outclassed."

ESRB 18+Okay, I'm gonna go into more detail now, it's not really a bad game but it isn't great and I don't think it deserves anywhere near as much praise as it got.For convenience let's make a list:- THERE IS LITERALLY ONLY ONE MUSIC TRACK AND THIS GAME IS A COUPLE OF HOURS LONG (oh, sorry, there's two and one is the theme song)- It plays and feels like a flash game (which isn't necessarily bad) but goes on for WAY too long without much change- The whole game is just you clicking on Agree, Disagree and Three sliders- It has a really strong anti-piracy message (understandable), even though i'm in charge of this company, so I should be able to make the decisions- You cannot be an indie developer until you have a large fanbase (except for the very beginning), you will fail otherwise, no matter what- You can't put focus onto certain aspects of certain games (if you want them to be successful anyway) even though plenty of real world counterparts do, because they should- AAA games seem to broken, it's really difficult to make them succesful, even if you've made nothing but best sellers for your entire careerI'm sure there's stuff I missed i'll update this as I remember them.TL;DR Snape kills Han SoloIf you want to buy this game go ahead, it's certainly not horrible but I wouldn't recommend it at full price"

Exactly how a Tycoon game should be :D The game's developers Patrick & Daniel Klug from Greenheart Games have created this delightful gem of a game and playing it... one can easily tell that a lot of love has been put into the game... On my first attempt I made 3 games before my most successful game entitled 'Space Wars' made over 1 million dollars, rated 9/10 across the board and enabled me to move out of my garage into a studio and hire 2 other people... Unfortunately my last game saw me bankrupt.... I guess I shouldn't have named it Colonial Marines huh?!?!? Anyways, I do NOT regret buying this game....but I do regret that I have to go to sleep as I have an early start..... Congratulations on your first milestone 'Greenheart Games'....

It is very interesting to point out however that once again 'professional' game reviewers have no idea about what 'real' people enjoy in games. Over 15 thousand positive reviews is by far the most positive reviews I have seen on steam and the critics rated it a mediocre 68/100.£6.99........probably the best value for money on steam in a long while.

It progresses the same, has the same fundamental game making mechanics, and the player guide is so similar it hurts. This game does offer a few different options like making your own game engines and designers need to take vacations after making a few games. You can unlock genres by research and certain platforms are more tailored to certain game types. There is also Steam trading cards and achievements, if you're into those things, that can help sway you to purchase.The problem I have with this game is the game developing. In Game Dev Story the production bubbles are flying up and there's all these power-up sounds. It feels like your really working hard. Then each development phase focuses on that certain aspect of the game itself; so you have a clear idea of what's being produced and how well your team is doing for each game element: Graphics, Story, Sound, ect. Contrast that with this game, Game Dev Tycoon, the production bubble slowly float up and make barely a sound. Your developers seem to float over the keyboard and lazily sip coffee, instead of appearing like they are in a rush or really working hard. This game has development phases, but they are inconsequential. Each phase it tells you what you are going to work on, but your developers produce production bubbles for other game aspects. Why include a development phase if your team is going to do whatever they feel like?For $10 is this game really worth it? If you've never played Game Dev Story and always wondered what it would be like to be a game developer then I think you will enjoy this game. However, Game Dev Story does cost 75% less, is more exciting and presents a much clearer focus. However, you don't get as much in-depth play and Steam bonuses; so it's really up to you. Personally I feel gypped and wish this game provided a little more excitement to the developing process."

Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who sues the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his florist friend Vanessa (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume BLEACHBee Movie is the first motion-picture script to be written by Seinfeld, who co-wrote the film with Spike Feresten, Barry Marder, and Andy Robin.

Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) has recently graduated from college and is about to enter the hive's Honex Industries honey-making workforce alongside his best friend Adam Flayman (Matthew Broderick). Barry is initially excited to join the workforce, but his courageous, non-conformist attitude emerges upon discovering that his choice of job will never change once picked. Later, the two bees run into a group of Pollen Jocks, bees who collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. The Jocks offer to take Barry outside the hive to a flower patch, and he accepts. While on his first pollen-gathering expedition in New York City, Barry gets lost in the rain, and ends up on the balcony of a human florist named Vanessa (Renée Zellweger). Upon noticing Barry, Vanessa's boyfriend Ken (Patrick Warburton) attempts to squash him, but Vanessa gently catches and releases Barry outside the window, saving his life.Barry later returns to express his gratitude to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not supposed to communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close bond, bordering on attraction, and spend time together frequently. Later, while Barry and Vanessa are walking through a grocery store, Barry is terrified to discover that the humans have been stealing and eating the bees' honey for centuries. He decides to journey to Honey Farms, which supplies the grocery store with its honey. Furious at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, including the use of bee smokers to subdue the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race to put an end to the exploitation of bees.Barry's mission attracts wide attention from bees and humans alike, and hundreds of people show up to watch the trial. Although Barry is up against tough defense attorney Layton T. Montgomery (John Goodman) the trial's first day goes well. That evening, Barry is having dinner with Vanessa when Ken shows up. Vanessa leaves the room, and Ken expresses to Barry that he hates the pair spending time together. When Barry leaves to use the restroom, Ken ambushes Barry and attempts to kill him, only for Vanessa to intervene and break up with Ken. The next day at the trial, Montgomery taunts the bees, which causes Adam to sting him. Adam's actions jeopardize the bees' credibility and put his life in danger, though he manages to survive. While visiting Adam in the hospital, Barry notices two people smoking outside, and is struck by inspiration. The next day, Barry wins the trial by exposing the jury to the cruel treatment bees are subjected to, particularly the smoker, and humans are banned from stealing honey from bees ever again.Having lost the trial, Montgomery cryptically warns Barry that a negative shift in the balance of nature is imminent. As it turns out, the sudden, massive stockpile of honey has put every bee out of a job, including the vitally important Pollen Jocks. As a result, without anything to pollinate them, the world's flowers slowly begin to die out. Before long, the only flowers left with healthy pollen are those in a flower parade called ""The Tournament of Roses"" in Pasadena, California. Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal a parade float, which they load onto a plane to be delivered to the bees so they can re-pollinate the world's flowers. When the plane's pilot and copilot are knocked unconscious, Vanessa is forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.Armed with the pollen of the last flowers, Barry and the Pollen Jocks manage to reverse the damage and save the world's flowers, restarting the bees' honey production. Humans and bees are seen working together, and certain brands of honey are now ""bee-approved"". Barry becomes a member of the Pollen Jocks, helping to pollinate the world's plants. Barry is also seen running a law firm inside Vanessa's flower shop, titled ""Insects at Law"", handling disputes between animals and humans. The film ends with Barry flying off to a flower patch with the Pollen Jocks.Voice castJerry Seinfeld as Barry B.

,Not Recommended,239820,15676922,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,Wrath,"Another game I've spent far more time thinking about than it deserves.What's the problem here? Realism.It's an unrealistic look at game development. Working from your garage, somehow it takes $47,000 to build a game over the course of four months. Unless I'm playing blackjack every night, I'm not going to go through $47,000 over four months when I'm my only employee, Christ that's small house. That said, you can build a game in four months? This means that every small indie company can produce three games a year over the course of 15-20 years. So every game manufacturer that's existed since I was a kid should havewritten, not publish mind,written60 games by now, regardless of success. Meanwhile, Blizzard has, what 12 or so? Even if you take the Sandlot/popcap route, you aren't making 60 ♥♥♥♥ing games. Spamming out bazillions of games really just took out the care I had for each one. Whenever you do three or so new research ideas, you have to build an entirely new engine. So I ended up with a million of those and could hardly tell them apart.Realism.The maximum number of employees you can have is seven? Dude, there's a healthy medium between a one-man-show and the team that put Age of Mythology together, but in this world the latter doesn't exist at all.  Why after 15 years do I just get the option to research ""ethical choices""? Why after 10 years do I just get the option for ""martial arts"" style? Mortal Kombat isn't groundbreaking. So many things are frustrating and don't make logical sense.Realism.I think the most frustrating part, aside from the mass production being unrealistic and devaluing how much I cared for each individual game, was that you may have ample resources, but you are confined by time no matter what, even if you are wealthy and self-publish. In a large or medium scale production, there are three stages and you assign a person to one of three topics each stage. Effectively, when it comes time to determine how good your game's sound is going to be, no matter what there will only ever be one person who works on it. So, if you want surround sound and a soundtrack, something is going to suffer because sound guy can't do everything at once (although somehow if you wanted to make this happen, taking away from graphics is a solution??). In reality, if you wanted to do everything, you don't have to crucify your worker you can just take more time, no one is going to die and the devs aren't going to complain about getting paid longer. Nothing's on the market, you can pay your bills, we don't need to cut content because you're desperate for your 78th million dollar. (of course in reality, in reality, you could just have more than one ♥♥♥♥ing person do everything because your maximum staff size isn't ♥♥♥♥ing seven.)Realism.A major problem with the game is that you're confined to work within the game's parameters of what it considers game development, rather than being to expand your schedule, employee roster, or creative potential like any sane company actually would. Case in point, the game is programmed to simulate how much the audience will like a game based on the amount of work you put in certain areas. So if you make an RPG fantasy game and put a lot of work into the engine, but not a lot of work into the soundtrack, your game will suffer because three of the nine possible concentration areas will rock someone's world for a theme-platform combination, and the rest mostly won't, this translates into all possible variations of it. So a text-only game with a killer soundtrack is completely acceptable, despite being completely unrealistic in your 20th year as a game company. The only room for different strategies between plays is to say ""I will only work on these themes, these genre, or these types of platform"" There is no such thing as an unusual randomized combination. If you make a ninja game, it must be targeted at pre-teens or it will fail no matter what. Sorry, Warframe.People type at a desk and icons indicating their productivity rise over their heads and make it look like a flash game. To be fair, there's not a lot to work with in terms of action when it comes to ""People sitting at their computer and typing code for money"" tycoon. So why would someone ever buy this game? ""Well, because they don't know a lot about the topic of game development."" I don't think it necessarily educated people on something that people don't know very much about, like I said this game has a certain disconnect with reality. I think it was a topic an unfathomable amount of people are interested in and I think those people wanted to simulate that experience in the way they perceive it to be. So, as a simulated game dev, I can spam out eighteen games with guaranteed zero bugs. If some come up later, I can spend a week making a patch that will fix it forever. I am exceptionally well treated and can go on paid vacation when I show the slightest sign of strain. I make $47,000 a year. The company pays for all my training.None of these things are true, but it's what's in people's heads when they complain on an internet forum about how game devs don't care about them and are incompetent at their job. Game Dev Tycoon has extremely positive ratings because people are pleased with this unrealistic experience and feel it is indicative of the industry. Whatdoesgame development require, that this game has told us about? Sometimes game companies publish games. Those games usually operate within an engine. Game sales mean dollars. You get more visibility and lower revenues with publishers. I think that's the extent of it.Overall, it's amusing enough if you don't take it too seriously and don't expect a lot out of it. There's replay value in Roller Coaster Tycoon, or any game where you have the ability to take more than one approach, but you can't find that here. If I were 12-15 I would have found Game Dev Tycoon much better, and I'm thinking that those tycoon style games have that age bracket as their target audience. I may have enjoyed this game at one point in my life, but I'm too familiar with how this industry actually works to not get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at how this game misleads its players."

Game Dev tycoon condenses every aspect of video games from the 80s to modern times into one easy to digest, entertaining package. Although, if you are looking fora bit more depth, you're going to need to use mods to add extra topics and features like ""Announcements"" and pre-orders, and setting the price of your games.. If you like sim games and tycoon games, you can't go wrong with this title.The game just got Steam Workshop support today (August 11, 2014) so you can only expect more and more mods to come out.Seriously, as simplistic as the game is, it's wonderful."

It will not teach you on this point.Game Dev Tycoon is a time-travel from the good old (C64) to the future console (PS5)Why i have used () brackets? Cause this game does not have the rights to use real names of course. So the C64 went to G64, the Playstation went to Playsystem, the XBOX is a mBox and so on.The game-story is also time-dependent, it starts in a time where the C64 came out (~1982) and ends where the future console PS5 will come out. All in one ~35years. The time goes a bit to fast i think so that you will lose control when too much new consoles or handhelds will come out all the time. You have to concentrate on max 3-4 systems, that's the best tactic. You can play further after 35 years.You start in your garage creating your first little game, later you can have your own office and employees, you can create your own console, your own gaming platform, your own engine and and and...The game does not have much animations, it's a really simple simulator, you see your avatar and your employers sitting on there desks and creating games, that's all. You create a name for your game, choose a genre, choose which engine you will use, you follow the process, you will earn knowledge for make better games such as AAA titles and then you will be rewarded with bad points by game magazines...Game was ok and somehow a bit addictive but the price of ~9€ (Sep2013) is too high.Grab it on sale for max. 3€. That's ok and will give you some fun if you like simulations.7/10"

Give it a try and you'll find yourself still playing far longer than you intended...as long as you don't get hung up on a few caveats.As an incredible geek, I tend to either try to replicate some of my favorite developers or produce a ridiculous RPG factory and quickly run into a few walls. The designers decided to go with gameplay over simulation in unlock progression: sequels are a mid-game research unlock and the topic research will have you making games with medieval or cyperpunk topics long before you can unlock fantasy or sci-fi. There's also a few design assumptions I disagree with like RPGs being more compatible with PS2 than PC or Graphics being more important to an RPG than Sound. With some explanation of terms like Civ's research paths, I could have at least kenned to what the dev's intention was and played by their rules, but instead you'll find yourself annoyed that you can't really make Zork or Wizardy or Dragon Quest early on or run into some confusion when you unlock sequel research right after making My Awesome Adventure XII.Still, these are flaws that are really only as much of a problem as how much you enjoy the game and there's plenty else to satisfy the ideas you want to bring in. More problematic for sim fans is the lack of extensive detail on what you've done before such as being able to see how you prioritized past developments or exactly where you went wrong with a flop. This is definitely more a management sim than a historical sim and it's definitely more about moving forward into uncharted territory than building on past achievements.Accept it for what it is and you'll have fun; try not to hit your head on the doorway if you try to bring too big an idea in."

Dynamics and gameplay are fast pased and that can throw some people off at the start cause everything moves so fast since the beginning. But once you get the hang of it, the game is going to be much more enjoyble. If one little critic is allowed, however, I'd make this one: Because of this speed in the gameplay, I noticed that some of the contents are way too much rushed through. The game could offer such a massive huge potential in terms of longevity, quality and quantity if the contet and developing of the characters from the personage we have down till the last employee we hire, from the first technology we develope and research down to the 1 Milion dollar Custom Engine we build. I mean, this game could really be a ""Large"" game, a full scaled, fully developed game. Except for this tiny little dettail, that by the way you won't notice until after you start play for at least an hour or two, GET THIS GAME!! ITS AWESOME and it's every gamer's dream!"

,Recommended,239820,10655872,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Guru Cube,"It's not bad. I'm on the fence on it because of it's contraversy.I love a series of iPhone/Android games by a Japanese developer call 'Kairosoft'(http://kairopark.jp/android/en/). Their games are genius, simple and addcitive. A little repetitive, especially between games but each games has it's differences and they have a good sense of humour.Now, this game 'Game Dev Tycoon' is an exact copy of 'Game Dev Story' by Kairosoft. Now, the developers give a 'nod' to Kairosoft within the 'About Me' section of their website but I, and many others, don't feel this is enough recognition for what is a complete rip with enhancements on top. The developers of this, GDT, seem to imply that it's a completely different game when it blatantly isn't. To me, it's apparent they ripped the games completely and then added some mechanics that were not in the Kairosoft game.To be honest, I wouldn't mind if they gave the right recognition to Kairosoft and were honest about it. Sadly, they see to keep justifying it and saying it's ""...very different"" when it's not.The game as it is; Is it worth a few quid? Yes. Is it better than GDS from Kairsoft? It has a little more depth (as you'd expect from a port on a more capable platform) but it lacks the character of GDS.So, I'm on the fence due to the politics behind it.On the plus side, they seem like good guys. They also are keen to ensure their game gets good PR and suppot it well. It's good to see developers who care. They also have introduced a good mod option, which will allow the game to be tweaked further. Kudos for all of those."

The concept is good (making videogames), and the gameplay isn't the worst (all you do for the first part of the game is decide the title of the game, what genre, and you use a slider to decide how long to put your effort in each section of the game)It may get repetitive but this game is absolutely addictive as pie.You put hours into your company to finally make that one game that will get perfect 10/10 rating. You try and try but there's always one reviewer comapny that always give you a 9 (Thanks AllGames). You then hire more people and keep training them and yourself in your videogame making skills. You then make a sequel to your most influential game (First Fantasy) and you then get the legendary perfect score.

The time I played this game was enjoyable and I can easily see myself going back to it in the near future. My only gripe is the algorithm that is used to gage your progress. If you do too good too early the game will be impossible. Maybe it is imitating real life, but it is a shame that you essentially cut your throat if you create a ""masterpiece"" too early in your career."

Ok so maybe not buggy, but it could have a lot of optimization done. Toward the end it will really tax a lower end computer. And there are a few things I noticed that were just... inconvenent.3. Easy to read. A lot of the procedures in the game (how it ranks the games you make, how well they do in the market, etc) were somewhat easy to follow. Luckily hidden enough so I couldnt tell exactly what to do to get exactly what I wanted, it still seems pretty simple.Pros:1. Addictive. Remeber that old Lemonaid Stand game everyone used to love? It's kinda like that, but x10. I was glued to my chair for the entirety of the day.2. Replay Value. Maybe not for me personally, but there is a lot of potential in this game. It can go far, and you can log a lot of well entertained hours for a fairly cheap price.3. Design. The music may be awful, but the visuals are appealing to say the least, and it has some clever values to it that I really enjoyed seeing in a game.Overall I truly enjoyed this game. Whenever it showed a hint of getting monotonous or boring in any way, it threw a curve ball and had you working over here on something entirely different. It keeps you entertained all the way to the end, as short as it may be. However it did feel a little incomplete, and could use a couple patches.Even with all that being said, and being (in my opinion) a tough judge, I have to give it at least an 8/10. It could use some updates for small annoying things here and there, and it was pretty short, but overall a fantastic game."

Although incredibly simplified it really feels like you're a game developer, except without all the crunchy coding nonsense. My biggest complaint would have to be that it all goes by too fast. The game caps your score at 35 years, which for me was about 4 hours or so. The game gives you the option to continue after the 35 year mark but no new consoles will appear on the market and no more ""plot"" will happen. To combat this however when starting a new game you have the option to carry over all previous hints you got from the last playthrough, hints such as which game genres go together on what console and what audience, allowing you to get an even higher score than before. The gameplay itself is very packed, there's never a time where you wait for more than a few seconds and so there's always something to do. The graphics are cute and seeing the dev's alternate history of strangely similar consoles is pretty fun. (Ninvento Gamesphere anyone?)It's a fun game that honestly teaches you a little about the video game industry and its history."

If you're looking for a strategy game this game is very challenging. There is little gameplay, and more of an emphasis on balancing numerical figures against logic to make your games a success. The renaming of real life consoles which release in the corresponding years is a nice touch. When you progress into the story you gain access to bigger offices, better staff, and you are constantly forced to research and discover new items such as 3D.

Some of the writing is pretty funny, and the game is pretty addicting, but it feels like some of the gameplay should have been a bit more refined.  You can't slow down or pause time to give commands to your employees, and after a game is released the popups and interruptions can fly at you pretty fast.  Better analysis options in the game history would be fantastic; as it is, you can only scroll through your previous games in chronological order, but sorting by ranking, sales, profits, types, etc would be really useful.  It's also oddly resource intensive, given that there are no complex graphics involved.  And you can't change the screen resolution or display size, so whether I have the game in fullscreen or windowed, it still cuts off part of the screen.  Still, I'd recommend it as a fun timewaster, and if you like Steam games, you're probably the kind of person who would love to pretend to be a game developer.  Falls a bit short, but fun and it's probably worth a sale price."

Sometimes the descriptions are vague.For instance, I went almost the entire game without using boosts because I thought they were a money pit. I thought it was way, way, way too expensive for a temporary stat boost. Then after I bought it near the end of the game because I was more than rich to buy it I discovered that it, in fact, regenerates and you don't have to buy it again and again, as I had reasonably assumed.Then we come to the bugs; occasionally, when you send people on vacations, they take FOREVER to come back. I've had employees stay away for months at a time, even when their little 'exhaution' bar has returned to full. In the real world, that employee would be fired. I would have fired them in game if I thought that would change anything and wouldn't be a pointless endeavor.Another bug is that the employees will ocassionaly do nothing, just sit at their desk and be unporductive, game in progress notwithstanding. I've seen employees waste an ENTIRE 3X boost! And they were at their desk with full energy!This bug is game-breaking; you start a new game as you commonly have to do, but at the top it just says 'starting new game' FOREVER. It's not possible to cancel the failed starting game without reverting to a previous save.And the transitions between your labs are so laggy, for literally no reason!Out of ten, I'll give this game a 7.25.Good game, terrible bugs."

It's got replay value, it's fun to play, and it leaves room for the player to genuinely have fun with it.

Research new technology, hire staff and, of course, make games and profit! Quite a funky game; interesting art style, surprisingly catchy music and an idea that's so simple and yet works so well.This game is great, but of course there are a few things that I would improve upon; particularly making the main game longer - there's so much content that you can't always reach by the end of the 35 years; sure you can play on afterwards, but it's not quite as satisfying when it basically leads to nothing. With that said, conversly I would also like more content and features; the game's addictive as it is, but with some more stuff to do as well as some other content (Fortunately there's mod support which I'm going to go into in my next playthrough) but some more customisability such as perhaps box art design to increase your last-minute hype score at release? More intricate designing when it comes to the custom consoles (There's really not many choices TBH) and delving more into future technologies - a console generation where they incorporate the player's subconscious as the game engine - allowing all sorts of possibilities (Basically Matrix-like gaming).Of course, the mod support solves most of my issues, but still.Besides those, nitpicky, points; the game's great - especially for a price of £7 (Although I got it on a sale).GreenHeart Games' Game Dev Tycoon gets a 'Near Perfect 9' rating from me.

Resembles GameCorp off ofkongregate.comonly way more features and freedom.Bugs:I feel there are still a bug or two though. One, which i'm not sure if its intentional or not, is i can do a game review of a previous game i made if i'm in development of one. Second, the Name Box for your games i have to click high or low along the borders to type. If i click in the center it clicks straight through and brings up the ""develop game, develop sequel"" etc menu.Cons:The Topics you start out with are random, I've never played a game about law, movies, romance; at least not individually. So i feel there should be a default 5 or 6 topics you start out with, then keep the researchable topics random as it is now.Slow down that damn time! I'm on my second playthrough(1st went bankcrupt) and i realize that by the 3 or 4th playthrough i'll probably have all the ""Hints"" for genre types and what works game wise, but i'd like to be able to fully experience the game, not feel like i'm rushing to try and enjoy this and that. I think if the progress of actions(training, game dev) stayed the same but their ratios to the time it took decreased by say 20-35% it'd allow us(players) to enjoy all of its features more completely.The 4 skills: Design, Technology, Speed, Research, aren't really explained as to what parts of development each affect. I've been guessing and have looked through the ""Help"" and haven't found anything that shows what correlates to what.Pros:It's damn addicting, and somewhat challenging until you get the hang of it and even then you'll be pondering what configuration will really bring the 9 and 10 ratings. I've also had to take out loans on both my plays and managed to bounce back on this second time so i feel the money making and costs are SPOT ON! don't touch em :).7.5/10 Very enjoyable and fun, fix those cons and possible bugs above and it'll be a 9.5/10 in my book."

Become even more successful and you’ll be able to expand even more, even to the point of creating a research department as well as a technology department.There’s all sorts of things you need to research to improve your games, as well as improving the skills of your staff.  If you don’t keep up with the research then your games will suffer and people won’t buy them, and you won’t make money.What you shouldn’t expect with this game is fancy graphics nor a visual representation of the games you’re creating.  The graphics are simple and the games are statistics only.  This doesn’t take anything away from the game, though, since it’s very addictive.  I found it a bit like the Civilization curse of ‘just one more turn’; in this case, it’s ‘just one more game’.There’s plenty of little changes and additions that could be made to this game to make it an even better experience, and I’m sure the developers know all about them.  The game is being updated so some of them might be included in future patches.  If not then they’ll likely make their way to ‘Game Dev Tycoon 2’ (hopefully), and I for one would buy it without hesitation.  This is just a small indie game developer, who, for all I know, might well be one person at a computer in their garage!  If you have any interest in gaming (and who here isn’t?) then I’d strongly recommend you give it a go."

The developers definitely have a good sense of humor, and have put some careful thought into the whimsical take on other developers. Little jabs at big companies, and even brings out some of the older generation of gaming for those who can still remember that far back.The game itself is pretty easy to figure out, and yet will probably still have you scratching your head at times, trying to find that perfect combination. Very easy controls. If there's a downside, the controls for getting the menu to come up on individual employees can be a bit hit and miss at times. Other than that, they've done a great job.Definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves games, and follows a bit about the market over the years. Grab it on sale, the game is a little short, but still good for hours of entertainment."

The only drawback is that it's so short I beat it in one sitting.

It's an immensely enjoyable experience that is eating any spare time I happen to have, which I am just fine with. In this game you begin your own games company back in the days of the Govodore 64, and go right through to the days of the mBox Next and the Playsystem 5, witnessing the turmolt of certain flop consoles through the years, something I laughed maniacally at as my company made miiiiiillions.The fun of making your own video game company, developing your own games and eventually consoles is brilliant, and I feel it has only gotten better as the game has gone on.Sadly some parts of the game can be a bit off balanced (MMOs and certain game combinations), but that doesn't detract from the overall experience, and for $9.99 off sale it's a steal. If you liked other Tycoon games you'll love this, and even if you didn't, but love video games (Which is probably why you're on Steam) and want to relive the Gaming Industries history, you're set.If this was Metacritic I'd give it a 9/10, but we're on Steam, so I'll give it a Recommend out of 10 instead."

But sadly the game is not very big and after 20 hours of gameplay you have already done everything and it is not a big deal anymore to make a good game.First you start your company in a garage and write pretty simple games. But after the first hit you can move into a bigger appartment and already hire up to 4 employees. With them you can develope much better and bigger games. And when you have earned enough you can move to the biggest company building where you can add a research lab and a production part in which you can produce your own Consoles or invent new technologies.

It's so easy to fail and go bankrupt even though the game makes it seem like it isn't that easy. Like you could pull through with just a little more effort. Despite this, when you actually figure out what works best to make a successful game and climb the business ladder, you get to see how technology has evolved over the years. Also, the game makes it really fun when they include the brands of consoles we all know and love, but change the names so that they aren't having any copyright infringement and what not (such as Apple being called Grapple).Personally, I found that once I got the hang of creating fantastic games that got high ratings, it was easy to fly through the game without much difficulty, but when I produced that one game that didn't quite reach where it was supposed to, it was easy to fall into the pattern of creating mediocre games from that point onward. It was just like an actual video game producing business that it completely made me lose track of time. I get so involved in trying to make my business flourish that I even forget to take breaks to eat, let alone use the facilities.Honestly, if you're a video game nerd, this game is utterly perfect for you to play. You can enjoy all the tid bits of seeing your favourite console be ""born"" into the video game industry all the way until the present day where no one knows exactly where we're going to go from here."

I decided to give this game a try and conquer the gaming world one release at a time.The positives: Once you release a few hit games, things can take off rather quickly. Your money starts to grow, your fan base increases, and the elements you can use to improve your games is almost limitless. There are option mini missions in the form of ""contract work"" and ""publisher deals"", but which ask you to achieve a desired outcome, otherwise pay a severe penalty.The negatives: The first hour or two of the game can be extremely boring. You have the option of about 4 genres of games to create and very little to do until your capital begins coming in. The other thing I'm not fond of is how a game/combination can go over so amazingly at one point and not much later sink like a rock. I can't even begin to count the number of times I thought I had a hit on my hands, only to have the game receive horrible reviews. Also, the lack of detail on subjects and genres doesn't help either. What exactly is a ""comedy"" as it relates to video games? Or ""alternative history"" for that matter?Game Dev Tycoon is a great game that I've enjoyed playing thus far, but it does have it quirks.

The interface and usability are simple as a caveman with no fire, all the while offering a deceptively complex design which enthrals the player whilst maintaining a charm which leaves you wanting more....and more....and..  The only downside is that when you've completed all the research and options available you will be waiting with baited breath for some form of expansion.  Greenheart Games have supercharged our imaginations, greed and determination to succeed; let's just hope there's something more in the pipeline to give us our fix of this wonderful world.  With some inspired DLC in the future, this game is a certified10.  Without, they receive a7.7simply out of spite!Gameplay:The game begins in an incredibly simple manner, your first game will only warrant a couple of clicks for development to be underway.  The bizarre revelation at this point is the fact that you are thinking 'is that all I need to do' and 'that was fun as hell to do' at the same time.  You will ask yourself, 'I'm having fun already, but is there more to it later?'  Yes, yes my dear Steam user there is.  Hiring and firing, specializing your staff and aspiring, your attatchment to virtual review scores is wonderful as well as worrying.   You will dip and dabble in; marketing, game engines, your own console, improving A.I, flexing your popularity muscle at the vaguely familiar and ego boosting 'G3' game convention.  The name of the game is earning your gameplay rewards, which is where 'Game Dev Tycoon' thrives.  Each time you make a rip-roaring hit you can bet you'll be placing your well earned capital towards research in order to build your next game engine, or console in order to fund your next big hit.  The pace at which you receive new research, marketing tools etc. is nothing less than smooth and natural.PresentationThe graphical fidelity of the game won't put a frown on CryEngine 3's face, but for the tone and friendliness of the game the developers have it done perfectly.  The interface is easy to use and thanks to the well paced introduction of new features you won't have any issue keeping track of the substantial variety of gameply assets being introduced.  From the tutorial to the news feeds about your games the written text radiates charm and an amicable nature, which adds to the fun of the experience.  It will have you feeling so bubbly that even when you receive a 1.25 review score for a rushed and rubbish game you won't slam your keyboard down to 2 letters, but rather giggle and retry with a better game formula, of which there are many to choose from.  Our only woe about the presentation is that it said we had 1,000 million credits instead of rewarding us with the sight of a cool 1B credits.Summary:It is cheap, charming and full of future potential in the way of DLC and sequels.  Easy to play, yet deceptively complex.  You will want more, so buy it, support them, and make it so.  In the spirit of how the game presents it's reviews We will say this:10  ""Just can't get enough""8  ""Give me DLC now, or else!""9  ""Is this really their first game?""9.5  ""Game dev and simulation are a great mix""Score:9.1"

When a game is reviewed, if it gets an average score, you'll get your money back with a small profit (and I do mean small), if your game gets quite a low score you'll be lucky to break even, these make the rewards for creating a good game so much more worth-while.  The time scale means you always want to be making more games as time passes faster than you would expect and later on means it's quickly round to that time where you extend a series of a game.Everything about it just works really well giving the game a really good game.

Most notable the fact that you are continuesly competing against your own previous score when you release a game, thus you need to keep a steady climb. also you have to add new technologies constantly in order to make big sales or get good reviews. Once a new game engine has been used you wont get any more good reviews untill you release a new game engine with new technologies.Its also unclear what the levels of the employes actually mean or do, or how it affects the game or your products."

DLC: The game needs some form of DLC, such as competitors, or more custom consoles/custom gaming computer.2. More Realism: This game only lets you have one office for delevoping, whereas, comapnies like Ubisoft or Activison have many different studios, deticated to the own part of development.3. Cheats: Personally, I like games that have cheat codes because they add a certain aspect of craziness to the game, and that they also make the game a little more thrilling (Like how I overkill-cheat on Crusadier Kings 2).Hope you enjoyed reading this, and remember to check out the game."

Got it directly from GreenHeart Games, along with their cheerful email full of thanks and appreciation. I proceeded to play the hell out of it; angering myself at my inability to make a successful game. (Many bankruptcies were filed.)The second time I bought it was shortly after I realized I needed the purchase confirmation email from GHG in order to update the game. At this point, it was available on Steam, and had a bunch of updates, and more achievements and stuff. I figured it would make sense to be able to update the game, and I had money in my PayPal account, so I decided I might as well.Now, I ought to review this game(s) I've spent $20, so here goes.It's everything I loved about Game Dev Story on my iPod Touch back in 2010, but with the added bonus of actually being able to customize stuff. Admittedly, I liked GDS's idea of recruiting freelances to contribute to the game, but once you had a team of hackers, the games just made themselves.The lighthearted (or greenhearted) nature of GDT is a real winner, though. The first time I managed to ""set a new standard for game quality"", I actually felt like I had accomplished something. It wasn't just scores, it was the entire article you would clip out of a gaming magazine as an indie developer who had just made a name for him/herself.As I mentioned earlier, Tycoon beats Story in customization. Early on, you gain the ability to build engines. While it's not exactly groundbreaking early game, when you can chuck millions into a bells-and-whistles powerhouse, that really adds to the experience. Sure, you might not be able to fit all of the features into the game you're making, but the fact that they are there just pushes the realism.There's only two cons I can really think of, and they're reaches.1. Maybe update the UI a bit. Just a bit? I dunno.2. All Games.10/10 because I made a Casual-Romance game called ""Dating your Children"" and it got a crappy score."

But really, you should get this game; it's worth all $9.99. I love being able to sit back and watch the money pile up. Or, if I neglected my MMO for long enough, the server expenses piling up.

The game takes your through what is a history of video game machines (changing names slightly for whatever reason, lawsuits not actually wanting to copy, etc etc take your pick) but one thing started to niggle me about this it does not follow history well enough. Consoles for instance are mentioned as what would be the NES being the kickstarter for a new type of gaming. Well yeah if we neglect the game seems to ignore Atari ever existed and the extensive amount of consoles they made in the 70s and 80s. And the Atari Lynx never got an equivalent despite being a 16 bit color hand held made in the 1980s while Nintendo were trying to figure out that all amazing green and monchrome display of theirs.Perhaps I am being to realistic here so I will get to a conclusion.BUY!

,Recommended,239820,8845691,"Posted: 25 January, 2014",all,Scoutmaster Rosie,"Let me start by saying that I buy a large number of the games I get on Steam when they're on sale. But I watched a favourite LPer of mine play this game, and while she made it entertaining enough on her own, I really fell in love with this game. This was a game that I not only wanted to play right away, but one that I actually wanted to pay the full price for. I wanted to support the developers as best as I could, and I regret finding out later that I could buy the game directly from them.Really, though, this game gave everything that I could have wanted from it. I've always been in love with the idea of being a game developer some day, and while this is of course far from the same thing, most of the reason I want to make games is the ideas for games that I have, and Game Dev Tycoon does an amazing job of letting me live out my fantasy and then some without the long process of training and work it would take to become a game developer. (That's not to say that going that route wouldn't be worth it, I absolutely still would love to work in the gaming industry some day--I just mean that this game let's me live my dreams now for a few hours at a time).The game is simple to learn, difficult to master, and brings not only a lot of fun goals to shoot for and easter egg achievements, but along with that a pretty great and informative history of modern gaming, too. The only thing I would possibly change is to add a more accessible records system, but, to be sure, the way it is now does not detract from the game at all.All in all, if you think you even might like playing this game, then I absolutely recommend it. Simulation games aren't necessarily for everyone, but even if you don't love them, I still think that with a dream of video game development, a love for gaming history, or just an interest in supporting a talented group of individuals and their passion, then this game is definitely worth it. I would personally recommend buying it directly from their site if you are able; nothing against Steam, but it comes with a Steam activation key (I'll be totally honest, I would imagine that more of the profits go to support Greenheart Games if you buy it from them, but I don't really know how exactly all of that factors). So, yeah. Definitely buy, I would've paid double.EDIT: Sorry, it should also be noted that I have not in fact played only four hours--I spent ten hours the first night (maybe a wee bit overboard) playing offline, so the total is more like 14 hours of playtime, really, and I'm nowhere near done."

The game offers you some information, but it's kind of a ""discover it for yourself"" thing, making you feel rewarded. The game has an addictive personality, possibly due to it's ""highscore"" mechanic when you beat the game, making you want to beat your last score.The game I feel has one major flaw which is some of it's balancing. Some game genre's are have more of a positive inpact than others.

While i normally despise casual games, this is a really addictive one.It is based on Kairosoft's Game Dev Story, but takes some different approaches. You have to consider the importance of different developement fields like graphics, story, game engine, and so on, and also get, depending on genre, the ratio of design and technology right. Instead of just improving your staff, you can also research and add new features to your games to make good games. Only thing I don't like is the fact that you essentially only compete with your own games, and therefore you're just keep beating your last good game. That's wasted potential, but still, a sweet game for a startup.If you expect a deep management simulation, this isn't what you're looking for. Still, this is a fun game and I really recommend to play the demo and buying it if you like this kind of games, or at least to play the demo to see if it is something for you.

Initial impressions are of the flash game nature, which maintaining a expressy objective and graphic based opinion, that is really all this game is. Give it a little time  and you will begin to respect the attention given to detail, and the depth that unfolds once you begin to get the hang of it. That having been said, particularly early in the game, I feel like both the UI and the options are a little watered down. I've learned, that as with all managment titles, patience is a virtue, and this game expresses enough of a uniquely playable and pure nature that I am willing to give it the time it needs to build upon itself. In short, this game has a quick 'design and reward' sting to it, it is simple and fairly even paced, it seems to lack most user visual customization,  and it does take time to progress, thus if you are not the patient type, this game will surely bore you. Overall, good stuff."

During the Summer Sale, I picked it up for a few bucks and was pleasently surprised when I started playing it. From first glance, it's a typical sim game. The more you get into it though, the more you start really working the system. I actually went bankrupt the first time I played. Starting the second game, I ended up trying to really put myself in the scenario, and took a few risks. I almost ended up bankrupt again, however, I ended up pulling out one game that would set me on the right course. Throughout the gameplay, I ended up taking a lot of risks, which luckily panned out. The game itself almost forces you to, or else you'll just get enough money to barely do anything with.Also, there is a point where no new systems will be released, however, you can still continue to make games, in case anyone was wondering.If you're curious about it, I would wait until a sale, and pick it up.

Yes it is kind of short, maybe 8 ish hours, but it really makes you budget and think of what needs to be added and taken away from a game during development in order to be profitable, and get it out as quick as you can without going bankrupt. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who want something to kill a little time here and there or if they want to go all out like I did and beat it in one night.Pros: Short, sweet, straight to the point strategy game. Great comedy. Name your games clever titles (my fav I named was Chambers&Wyverns)Cons: Constant windows popping up that stop everything.

,Not Recommended,239820,21894430,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,Urban Raccoon,"Don't fall for the funny reviews, the little quirks & refrences are probably the only great thing about this. As a tycoon game is it pretty shallow. For a game about game development, it really doesn't have many features at all. In fact this concept was done earlier and more competently with the mobile game ""Game Dev Story"", I suggest you pick that up first.For a tycoon game, there is really no management tools for you to use. No finance history, no altering game price, no viewing demographics, no summary of everything you've learned so far. Development becomes monotonous. Though more and more options and features open up as the game advances, and there is a good amount, they really don't add anything unique and are just additional checkboxes to tick to make a better game. You can pick features to include, but there is little reason to not include them once the money starts rolling in. Its far too easy to make money once you're established, and it becomes a game of ""MORE"" instead of offering any real strategy. Console releases mirror real life so if you know which ones were popular and which ones failed, there really is no reason to pick anything other than the ones with largest marketshare each generation. There is no randomization either, a system will live or die whether you exist or not, and you cannot release an exclusive HALO equivalent that becomes the ""killer app"" and effects marketshare. There are no competitors, thus no reason to really innovate in a particular area, and no way to know if its worth developing a new feature to keep up, or if it puts you on the leading edge. Its buggy and unoptimized.The devs seemed active with the community, but they really should have spent more time making something worthwhile. Its sad because it has a lot of potential, but this seems like it was made over a month rather than a polished product. Mods try to add more options but the backbone is not there to make it anything more than more genres/systems. You shouldnt need a mod to add such basic functionality as finance graphs. Hopefully there is a sequel in the works, but I'll wait for a steam sale on that one too."

Finding the right balance to create successful games was a sufficient challenge and the longer I played, the more in depth things got.  Leading all the way up to a full staff, research and development lab, and even a hardware lab where I could make my own consoles.  I have already sunk many hours into this game and will probably continue to do so.  This game evokes the, ""just one more"" response something fierce.

Read the next paragraph, otherwise, skip it.Greenheart Games, those who made Game Dev Tycoon, simultaneously released their game, the one you can buy, with a cracked version findable on the most popular torrent websites. The two games were identical, except for one thing. At a part of the game, in the cracked version, a message would pop-up telling that the person's game business is quickly losing money, because a lot of people were cracking their game. And indeed, in a short moment, they were getting bankrupt because of those pirates. Just for trolling hackers like that, they deserve some respect!Now, more on the game size: it's quite great. Once you end the game once, you saw about everything, but still. It's worth it.

It bases your game's success based off what they feel are good matches, like Fantasy and RPG.

This stops it being too easy, and there is plenty to do after the game has ""officially"" ended, but it does feel like it happens too soon (although you can adjust it in the settings menu).Every game has its down-sides of course. With this one:- The ""boost"" option doesn't seem to have an effect with game-making (no clue is given in the option's description)- The menus are slow to respond if you're trying to do everything quickly- Dragging left and right to the research and console dev labs can be irritating (use left and right arrows on the keyboard instead).You will find others - but good luck finding any bugs, it is well-programmed.So yes - buy it for a play-through (or perhaps two), if it's on offer."

The replayability is incredible, and the fun it brings is even greater!Game Dev Tycoon reminds me of the golden years of PC gaming, when it was all about the idea and the fun that comes from playing, rather than pushing graphics to extreme, and betting on technical performance.You start in the 80's as a start-up, a one man show, garage based company led by a visionairy, a gaming messiah - YOU! And then it's all ideas, mixing and matching genres and topics, researching new technologies, concepts, and maybe even eventually developing your own gaming platform!I have many more hours of fun with this game, than what Steam recorder, as I often play it offline, while traveling. It's PC strategy gaming at it's best, and it's one of my all-time favorites, which I put next to legendary titles such as Civilization, Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis. Obviously the complexity, and specifics of the Game Dev Tycoon are much different, but it absolutely equals the games I mentioned in how Legen... wait for it... dary it is!Don't think about it - just but this game!!!"

Lacking a little polish especially with inadequate tutorials (popup dialogue boxes you can find later on but no searchable index and some complex concepts inadequately explained) and no data available on previous expenses. This later part is especially important when it comes to building your own console and you can't work out easily whether you've made a profit or loss overall. Also game mechanics has you competing against your previous best for most of the game rather than rival developers. This somewhat penalises you for doing well early on while being too forgiving for consistently poor performance.Nicely tells the story of the last 3 decades in gaming hardware for those who are interested.8/10.

Everything from cyberpunk RPGs to racing games to casual iPad puzzle games. I made nearly a billion dollars and was the most successful game company in the world.So, about the game itself. Despite feeling a bit like an advanced Flash game, it's a lot of fun for the first playthrough. If you're a fan of gaming with any knowledge of history, it shouldn't post too much of a challenge though. Obviously you don't want to spend $4 million bucks on a racing RPG for the Ouya or develop an immersive 3D engine and mature horror game for the Nintendo DS.So with that knowledge, you should be able to glide through with ease, which kills any replayability. It's hard to consider that a con though, because just as the game ""ended"", it was starting to feel like a chore to play it. I'm not sure I could stare at the same screen for another 6 hours (much like my poor, overworked developers).But, for $5-$10 (depending on if you're buying on sale), this is a good value and a great way to spend an evening. It's immersive enough to keep your attention, but casual enough to be playable by casual gamers or a multitasker."

The simplicity of the interfaces makes creating games much simpler than their real life counterparts, while adding challenge as time goes on through managing your employees health, training, and any additional costs that your company may acquire over time.My one frustration is the counter-intuitive scoring/grading system the game has built in.  While you have multiple easy interfaces to work with, the game has a complex background ranking/grading system that you must be aware of if you want your games to constantly score above an 8.  My first several playthroughs I was completely unaware of this background system and had to consult guides for other playthroughs.

You can make any game you like providing you have researched it and have the right idea. How will your game turn out? Well depends on what you focus on like design and engine's or AI. This game has really polished and unique graphics. This game even goes the extra mile to add more game consoles towards the end and even gives you a tutorial on how to be succesful. Game Dev Tycoon makes you work towards your research and development which makes it be not too easy but just gives the right balance between easy and hard. The game gives progression and makes you have to think about management and financial to make it more realistic. Game Dev Tycoon even renames alot of game console manufactors like Microsoft and Nintendo and even has some beloved game refrences and Easter Eggs. This game is just so awesome there isn't even a way to explain this. This game has a really high potential and I highly recommend playing it.

I started playing this game one night, thinking that I'd give it a go and then hit the sack shortly after. I unwittingly found the game so addictive that before I even realized it, sunlight was already peaking through the shades of my bedroom and it was time to get ready for work. It's been a long time since a game was so immersive that I failed to notice the time fly by - much less forget to sleep.The game feels light and pleasant all throughout, largely thanks to its intuitive system, easy learning curve, relaxing music, and colorful graphics. But most of all, the game gives you so much to explore in spite of its simple concept that you'll always have to try that new combination of elements for that next game, and then the next, and the next, and so on. And while you may always dread the few seconds between releasing a game and finally seeing how your game is reviewed, you will want to keep coming back for more - whether it be to make the next big hit, or to make up for a flop.The great thing is that you'll still love every second of it, dread and excitement alike. I like to imagine the game developers experiencing the same dread on a much grander scale when they themselves released this gem. It may not be the first game developer themed title, but I think it's the first (that I've played) to get the ideal balance of elements and presentation right. I do however feel that the game's appeal lies much in the novelty of its execution rather than any actual innovation.And while I absolutely love the game (enough to make it the first game I'd write a review on), I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'd like to see a sequel. I would of course, love for the creators to prove me wrong and eventually make something that'd top this. Either way, hats off to Greenheart Games for their great work on Game Dev Tycoon. Great deal and value for its asking price."

The re-playability is not really there because once you learn the trend of what will be successful and what wont you end up just re-doing the same things with slight changes. They have tried to stem this by changing what topics you start out with, but even then, all you need to know is what consoles will be successful and what topics and genres work on them and you will pave your way through this game in a golden chariot. Though this is actually the goal I feel, being that this game is marketed to people who know the games industry and history. If you have even a small bit of knowledge to the history of games in the last decade you will find this game pretty easy.

Maybe, its the fact that you get to manage a company to success or failure based on your decisions instead of having a boss tell you what to do at work.  Whatever the answer maybe it is as unique as the individual who plays this game is, and that could be the secret to its success.  All I know is I enjoy it and would play it multiple times just to find the right combinations to score a perfect 10, which is admittedly a hard but possible event in the game.  That is what makes it worth playing, at least to a part of me."

It is rather short, but just because you finish the main ""quest"" does not mean you are totally done with the game. Even after the new content stops showing up, you may still play and develop your team further to attempt to release a AAA game. I beat the main portion of the game in less than 12 hours but spent an additional hour and a half just trying to make a hit AAA game. You will most likely go bankrupt your first playthrough (if you are not using the internet as a resource) but whatever you learned in that playthrough is brought into your next playthrough so your chances of success get stronger with the more you know regardless of if you go bankrupt. Once you become a multi-million dollar firm it really is not that hard to keep that money. By the end of my game I had $400 mil and a fanbase of 2.4 mil so any game I made sold well. Just keep your assets in check during the later stages of the game and whatever you do do not make an mmo unless you plan on making expansion packs for the rest of your life.My guys name was Leo Head (spoof off of LionHead)My company was Glacier Gaming (GG/ Spoof off of Blizzard)3 custom consolesDragon Quest sold 20 Mil unitsHad 3 games sell over 10 Mil units2.5 Mil Fans400 Mil DollarsAll in all, I loved this game. It is a very fun, simple game that let's you be creative. It is very addictive, but an easy to set aside style of game. The only piece of advice I can give aside from not making an mmo is to market your product. It is a separate step and without it you will make 3-5 star ratings all the time."

Just a ""meh"" with a shaking sideways hand. If I had to make a choice, I would say that I enjoyed the game a little more than I didn't.As the name implies, Game Dev Tycoon is a video game making simulator, where you manage your time to develop a game based on the topic and genre you are making. You also decide what platform the game is on, the length of the game, and what features it has. It's satisfying when you make decisions to a ""good game"", and it's a sobering moment when your game fails, but you learn from it. Over time, you move to better offices, hire other employees, and do contract work with otheer companies for extra cash. Developing a game earns you research points, which you use to try to develop a better game engines and new game topics. Each person, including yourself, has a few stats that determine the quality of the game and the speed at which you develop it.What's cool is that game's timeline mirrors that of real life event in gaming history. The only difference is that the names of game consoles and game companies are changed slightly (perhaps to avoid copyright). In a way, this game is educational, showing you the rise and fall of game consoles and companies. Occasionally, there are these random events, in which a certain genre of game is popular, which means more opportunity to profit.The main issue with the game is that it is inconsistent with its feedback. Every time you finish developing a game, after the reviewscome out, you can choose to research and create a game report. It tells you what was a good or bad match with the game. Did you develop on the right platform? Did you have the right audience in mind? Did you manage your time to highlight the more important aspects of the game? Sometimes it gives you good info, other times you get almost nothing.Another issue is that the game suggests that some combinations of genres for a good game are impossible, which I partially disagree with. Apparently, according to this game, action and adventure are the antithesis of each other. That's doesn't make sense to me. Action games can come with an immersive world and a good story, but not in this game. In this game, only adventure games have immersive worlds and good story. I have yet to figure out what goes into a good action-adventure game (within the bounds of Game Dev Tycoon). Don't you think that an action-adventure cyberpunk game sounds awesome? You can't make a good one one in this game. I've spent several hours reloading a previous save to go back and develop it, but the highest average score I got was a 5/10.All in all, considering the good and the bad, which include some UI problems, this game is worth it only on discount (50% or more in my opinion.) I can barely recommend it."

From researching topics, to developing technologies for building game engines for making better games to eventually hiring employees to help in game development, Game Dev Tycoon is surprisingly fun to play.Heck, towards the end of this game, the player can develop their own games console, providing they have a lab established, done the research and more importantly have the availiable funding / finances! :)I should note that there are many fun mods already available in the steam workshop that actually flesh out this game a bit more and adds more to the overall game for example more topics, researches, platforms to make your games on, graphic/pie charts etc. There's plenty of good mods to extend the life of this little beauty of a title! :)The theme and game itself is not everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it very much.

While I'm not fond of tycoon games, this one managed to gain the interest in them, specifically this one. The graphics are beautiful, but if you're playing on a laptop with switchable graphics (like the one I own, the Dell Inspiron 15R SE), you'll have to disable one of the chipsets, and even then you'll get some graphical glitches. The music isn't really outstanding, but the sound effects work well. The gameplay is you running a video game company from the days of the PC revolution in the 80's (No exact date is given) where it will grow depending on how you manage it. If you do good, you could possibly win with a big cash flow (my first playthrough ended with $1 billion) and if you do bad, you are bought out by the big company Electronic Mass Productions (EA). In fact, most products in this game are parodies based on real life items (Example: The Vena DreamVast = SEGA Dreamcast) most likely to avoid any legal issues. Bottom line, the game is a masterpiece that everyone needs to at least try. Play the demo first to see if it will you be something you will enjoy."

The game is based on developing your own games and selling them to a growing market, and evolving with the choices you make in it and sometimes paying the price.You start in a mid-80s garage with a computer and some funds to make your first game. When you make your games, you have complete control to decide, whether you focus on gameplay, graphics, engines, dialogue, SFX, etc. Eventually, you'll have the choice to create hype around the game with marketing, but the games better be good or you'll suffer. New consoles rise, and old consoles go. You'll grow your company with great games or fail with bad ones. It's all up to you.For 10$, this game is a classic masterpiece.

The game starts with the PC and G64 (Commodore 64) and basically follows the timeline we were in! Except for the part that Atari doesn't even exist in this game and the fact that the company and system names are changed due to copyright... I guess. You can also game over, which is somthing I don't like. You can also mod the game using the Steam Workshop. There are tons of mods on more genres because there are bearly any. Only 5 to be exact. There are also ones about more topics, although who really needs more topics? There are also cheating mods and mods that add Atari! So that's cool There's also a review system in the game, which tells you what works and what doesn't. (TRY PRISON AND SIMULATION) Did you get 4 people who gave it a 10? Then make a sequal with a little more work put into everything! And there's another mechanic, and it's a big one that makes Game Dev. Tycoon... well... Game Dev. Tycoon. Choosing how much effort goes into what when developing your game. You want no dialoug? Then choose to not have dialoug! Want to have the best sounds ever heard of? Make it so that your game has the best sounds! Without this mechanic, this game can't really be called a game. There is a lot to this game, and most of it is good. Game Dev.

First up, the interface could definitely use a rethink. It isn't bad right now, but it could definitely be better.

This isn't helped by the fact that all you can do during development is adjust a few sliders depending on the topic (Sound, gameplay, Level design) etc. However, the game refuses to tell you what any of it means, so you have to make a random guess and hope its right. For instance, does World Design in a racing game mean that you are designing tracks? Does AI in a Strategy game mean Enemy AI?

It shows the history of gaming and lets you be a part in it. You can get to the level of EA and other Big Players but you can choose for yourself if you support the community or not. You can decide wich genre your game should have. Which topic it should be and for which of the many platforms it should be released. You get great feedback about your games and can improve them the next time and some of your games might even write gaming history.There are only 2 downsides from my point of view: I would like see that you can create new content for a game instead of just releasing a sequel and the size of your team. The maximum i can have at the moment are 6 and my team develops games that make a profit of more than 100 million $. That is not realistic at all.

I honestly didn't know what to expect when I bought it, but wow, what a hoot!  It is  addictive and entertaining.   I was surprised at the depth of game and the sheer number of choices. Even when I chose the wrong product for the wrong market, I laughed at the amusing comments from the 'game reviewers'.  My first attempt in the biz did not go very well, but I still had lots of fun.  Apparently I learned from mistakes in the first game because by the second game I was cruising big time. My joy is strategy and RPG games in  real life, so that is what I focused on as the GDT.  After turning out a number of well received games I finally got four '10's.  Can you say blockbuster!?There are lots of tech trees to research and choices to make. Which platform do I put the game on? Well, that's majorly important.  You can research marketing so that you are better informed about your potential customer likes.  HIre staff and train them. Better give them time off and pay them well or they will not be as productive.Want to build small silly game for kids for quick $$$? You got it.  Or maybe you want to make that HUGE MMO with the mega soundscape?  Sure, if you got the bucks to invest, go for it.  If the critics and customer like it, you'll be hailed as a game dev GOD!   Better watch those finances, though.  If you don't, you can find yourself in debt with the bank.  Guess wrong on a major product and say hello to the bankruptcy lawyer.If you are REALLy successful, you can even start development of your own platforms. Move over Mr. Jobs....Love this game!

From there, you make games, research game topics, make your own engine, and try to make the best games possible.You then mov eup and hire more people to helo you make new gamesThe gameplay is pretty great and rewarding, you focus on a certain area in development of your games to make the best game possible (Example: an RPG game will want more dialogues and story focuss while Action games want more gameplay and less story focuses). Witht his, you iron out the game by deleting bugs and release the game. Once it's released, the critics will rate the game and epending on your score, the game will either bomb or sell like hotcakes. THAT'S the rewarding nature of it. I'm not actually programming, but I do research and R&D to develop the best engine possible and then make the best game possible that people can enjoy, in the end, me selling over 500,000 - 1 million units gives me a nice sparkly feeling inside because I feel like my attention to what makes a certain topic good paid off.I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys simulators and company management, it's  certainly a gem."

Another thing that, for me, was not necessary is that some genres of games have good and bad focus subjects, i don't think that it is correct because nowadays, we either get AAA title or different ideas. And the game does not let you come up with other development focus in some genres, and if you try, the game will probably fail. That's the big downside.The gameplay is rather simple, as you want in a tycoon game. The graphics are decent.

This game is addictive in a short burst. It is the type of game that the ""dollar per hour"" rule applies in that you will spend at least 10 hours on this game and you will enjoy those 10 hours or more. That being said the game is inherently flawed in its design. You are constantly trying to beat your previous score. What amounts from that is there is no one to compete with. There are other companies but only in name only. You do not get to see what they create or even scores they get, only that they may be there in the form of a publishing company. The game feels more like a flash game in dynamics and limits yourself to repetitive asset distribution that leaves no variability. Everything comes down to following a formula, it is the type of game where you could literally follow a step by step manual and there would not be the least bit of a problem. The game mechanics are even limited in that regard it feeels too simplistic but vague. It has many interesting nods to previous gaming consoles and follows how they would fair in the game market during the concurrent time but other than that, they are not versitile at all. I made a game with level 3 3d graphics for the equivelent of the original game boy. It isn't the problem with this not following how the gameboy or other consoles were in reality, it is the problem with little to no restrictions to how these consoles work. They are, again, just a medium for reaching an audience and not a deciding factor in much game design.overall this game is super enjoyable at first, you will enjoy it for the 10+ hours no problem. Just be careful when you pass that mark as the game's problems become more pertinent"

I didn't expect it to be fun beyond half an hour.I also didn't expect to enjoy it so much I played it for seven hours straight and only stopped once I hit year 35.Game Dev Tycoon is a comparatively standard tycoon-type game, but once you get into it the game reveals itself as a love letter to the game industry and to gamers at large. It will resonate with you if you were born in the 80s or the early 90s. Otherwise you won't be able to appreciate the game's early years.Building games I think I'd like to play is great, and waiting for reviews to come in for a new game is more tense than anything I saw in big budget horror games from 2014.There's a ton of replay value as it doesn't seem to be viable to invest in all genres, all platforms, and all game types in a single session. Total game time to go through the full 35 years appears to be between 6 and 7 hours, so there's a fair bit of meat in the game.If you like games, game culture, and/or work in game development, pick this up.I hope to see more from the developer!"

You slowly work your way up to become a top of the line developer with thousands or millions of fans and an elite team of designers and programmers. You can name yourself and your company anything you want, and so can your games.The game allows you to mix and match genres and topics to create games. You can follow the tropes (Military/Action) or be creative (music/action, or something weirder). You can also create games for certain audiences (vocabulary game for young people, or alien games for more mature people). There are many topics in the game, ranging from School to Mystery.The game allows you to train you and your staff to help make better games, and even allows them to specialize. The game also allows contract work to earn some quick money, custom game engines, and even custom game consoles.Like all games, it has it's flaws. Reviews give you bare, if any, information. Many simply say ""It's good"" ""It's eh"" ""It's horrid"". Contracts give you chump change, and are only worth the research points. After a while, you just have too much money that you don't know what to do with."

It doesn't go very deep in what you can do or how you can tweak things, management overall is kept pretty basic, jsut enough to keep it interesting and keep your attention across the board about, what you are doing and what you need to change, for example, letting your personel take a holiday to recharge or making sure you can pay your bills and make money in the long term.You can't just 'jump' in and make THE best game you would like, you have to build your way towards that, research, gather a good team and get some funds to pay for all of this.the game gives you some simple choices that can affect you later on in the game, like do you please your customers or not ? if you do you might get more customers later but loose some money because of it or gain money but loose customers...I liked it, the price was okay, maybe it's a bit low on the content, the game was over pretty fast, you can keep playing if you want but, it's just not interesting anymore if you have researched almost everything.I really liked the arty style too, Kept...I don't want to say simple..but effective, not too much. cartoony, and it fits perfectly.if you are looking for a REAL game that will keep you playing and interested for a long period, this might not be for you, but if you are looking for a game to have some casual fun and this theme seems interesting to you, you don't want to go in depth too much, then this game might just be what you are looking for.I'd give it a 7/10 would have given it an 8/10 if it had some more play time, more content."

There are mods out there, so maybe they add something to the gameplay as well (though Steam Workshop doesn't exist yet which would make installing and running those mods much easier).I wish I had waited a few days to buy this though as I paid $10 for the game just before it went on sale for $5.  It isn't the first time that's happened to me with a game on Steam ($5 isn't that big of a deal...last time it was when I was new to Steam and didn't know there were ""sales""...I spent $50 on a game that went on sale the next day for $24.99...ouch)."

Since I will - most likely - never actually develop games in real life despite being very passionate about them, it was nice to live this little fantasy for a while too!The only complaints I have are minor ones. Sometimes I felt like it really wasn't clear why some games didn't become succesful (sometimes the response felt almost randomly generated), but maybe there was just something I missed.Personally, I also would have liked the option to create my own covers for my game, and perhaps promotional posters and the like. I'm not sure what the developers could have done with this out of a gameplay perspective, but it certainly would have boosted my immersion!Overall, very nice little game and I look forward to a future sequel!"

Just numbers getting higher. Where do you go after 30 million fans and billions in the bank, a tripple A MMO and workers skilled to the max.Success shouldnt be some ratio that practically never changes.If they ever add sth or make a new game, maybe the features you put in games should actually affect the game, that way I can hype a game with mod support and then ban all the players and start charging for mods.....yeahGood Game"

It is a typical 80s / 90s economy based game. Like a Mad TV or Reeder etc. in earlier days.Du to the limitations of programmers, this title is also not very filled  with infinite content.But do you know wgat? Game Dev Tycoon does not need all of that.In Game Dev Tycoon you develop your own Games, just as it say. You start alone in your garage and make all the way up to a big Game Dev Tycoon, that creates AAA titels in masses.But you have to take care to manage your finances, and decide whether a prequel might be not so virtuos but stable to sell etc.The graphics has found its way out of the 90s, but also the idea of Videogames comes with it! Imagination.Many things you can influence in your games, but you will never see actual any one of them! So most time you have to focus about your fantasy and what you think could be in the title ... just as real Game Developers als have to do initially.

Start out as a game developer working in your garage and become a game dev legend. The progression is almost historical in nature, you begin in the 80s with the ability to make low level 2D or text based games, once you begin to make some money you can research and develop better games. As time goes by new consoles hit the market and the demand for better games grows with them.The only thing missing is a sandbox mode, but once you reach the end of the campaign you can continue developing more games and researching more technologies (maybe even developing your own console!), so that pretty much covers it!Game dev Tycoon is a creative and rewarding experience I would happily revisit over again.

The gameplay revolves around developing games by ajusting sliders wich simulate time allocation. Whale makeing small games in the beginning is fairly simple as you try to make larger games you must hire and assign staff to work on seprete parts in each design phase. on these mechanics youll build your gameing empire from a garage in the 1990s (like any good company) to A large building In the 2000S. As you grow your company youll be able to develop games for diffrent consoles as they enter and leave the market as time goes on. When the consoles come and go is actually based on how those consoles did IRL. For example the TES (Based on the NES) will last for a long time and hold lots of market share. As it did in real life.

Then you choose what theme you want your game to be (horror, comedy, zombie), then you choose the style of game you want (RPG, Casual, Action, Adventure), then you have to decide what you want to focus MORE on in the game. Some games require more time spent on different things. Like Simulators require more time spent on Graphics rather than Storyline/Quests. (spoiler?)This game is one of the very few games that can actually RUN on my computer without requiring  $1000 graphics card, so I'm happy.Anyways, if you enjoy casual-strategy games that you can sit back and play for hours then this game is something you might enjoy. :)"

Playing a part in the gaming industry is enjoyable, especially as famous consoles enter and exit the marketplace around you.  This game is very true to history, so it's important to know which consoles succeed and which ones flop.  The tutorial is extremely helpful if you're just getting started, but the game's complexities are very far-reaching.  It will take a lot of trial-and-error early on to get the hang of things, and even when you do start to get a good grasp you will still find yourself struggling from time to time.  At full price, the game is certainly worth a look, but it seems to go on sale frequently so you can probably wait for a good deal to come along."

Once you learn how to play, this game is a time stealer.  Be prepared to spend many hours playing.The trick I discovered from not going bankrupt, is not to leave the garage until you have at least $10 mil in the bank.  If you do, the new office and new employees will suck up about $3 mill until you get a hit game out.  The $10 mill will prevent you from going bankrupt until you get some hit games out there.One of the cons of this game, to me, is the overly abundant amount of dialogs you have to click through.  It gets old quick.  As a suggestion, I think perhaps a scrolling list of events on the left top side of the screen to reduce popup dialogs would be helpful.As an industry professional of 15 years, even I found some elements of this game to be... educational.

It's just randomized.I have tried going to a website that has all the algorithms for making the successive games, I tried about 10 of them only for them all to fail. I've made a game before I used these algorithms with the exact same stats and it was a hit. Like I said, this game is merely based on randomization.3/10Not bad, not good....Simulation games work well on PC."

Fortunatly when you cant continue there is a cheat mode.The one thing I found very frustrating the reviews. My first game always gets around 8 and then after that I can get about 6. That really gets frustrating as hell. Especially when I used the cheat mode to have the best workers that you can get and still I cant get a decent review. I dont know what the review depends on but I have to say I am not happy with that aspect of the game.I like the little notes from the devolper that you get when you start and finsih the game, which thank you for buying the game. I think thats very nice.Overall I like the game even tho I dont seem to understand the rating system.I can really recomend this game, tho I wish it was avalible for ipad instead of computer."

You the player are free to create hundreds of different games.  Also, the player can do contract work and build their own software.  As the game progresses it will get more challenging as games cost more to produce and your overhead increases.  The game itself is well made, is not CPU or graphically intense of a game and will run on most computers.
