If you're like me, you're not there for the game -- you're there for the experience.  If you're looking to recapture the original experience, it's all right here."

So in actuality, Space Ace is the better game. However, Dragon's lair will always be a classic."
76561198112866114,Recommended,240340,29667700,Posted: 3 February,all,kyzka,"Welcome to the game that made me poor as a kid!!!It was originally released in 1984 a year after 'dragon lair' and followed the same principle that being a laser disc arcade. 'Laser Disc' technology was like the 'future' back then and playing a game like this would make a kid feel like he was time travelling into the future of gaming. Oh what little we knew!Like its predecessor its art style was all thanks to Don Bluth who worked on masterpiece animation films such as 'The American Tale' and the 'Land before time' amongst other great works. Like FMV games today, the novelty of controlling a cartoon by moving a hero around the screen away from incoming danger was a popular trend. However ‘Space Ace’ added another dynamic which ‘Dragon's Lair’ did not have. Not only was the objective to move your main character in the direction of provisional yellow flashes, or to hit the shoot button when the heroes gun flashed yellow, but now you could also occasionally change the main character to an older version of himself changing the dynamics and pathway of that adventure which provided even more animation fun and a very large number of novelty death scenes.Problem was though that 'Space Ace' was never as popular as 'Dragon's Lair' and people wanted more of that than they did a sudden mock up. No one really knew where the concept of Space Ace came from? The Game unfortunately may have seemed too 'Alien' for some of the general public.In truth though, there was a very old adult comic back in 1952 named 'Space Ace' and personally I thought some of the concepts were very loosely based on that. In that comic 'Ace' is a Marshall who has been hired to protect Earth against interstellar crimes, but other than that the game seems to be as different from the comic as chalk and cheese. Let me illustrate...The VG itself informs us the story about Kimberly and Dexter both Officer and Marshal hired to protect the Earth against interstellar crime. Borf a hideous looking alien smurf with a face yelling amphetamines and yet a belly screaming couch potato, has got himself an infanto-ray which as the name suggests is a deadly ray that can make anything it hits younger. Borf plans to use it against the planet Earth if Earth does not surrender itself to Borf's total control. Borf shows that he isn't joking either by immediately performing a test run of the infanto-ray changing our unsuspecting hero 'Ace' back to his younger self 'Dexter'. While Ace likes to shoot things first and ask questions later and likes to get himself into punch-ups, Dexter on the other hand lacks any hero experience and has to simply rely on running away and dodging trouble. To make matters worse Borf also kidnaps our sidekick Kimberly leaving the planet Earth vulnerable with no hero in sight.The original manual that came with the arcade stated that Dexter had a unique connection with unknown cosmic forces which enabled him to momentarily reverse the effects of the infanto-ray and become his alter ego again known as Ace, and other than that, the VG and manual offered no other explanation. While the game could never be taken seriously thanks to its assortment of wild shenanigans of diverse creatures and robots, there was never any introductions to such enemies or main characters. Hence because everything just seemed to magically appear and disappear just as quick, there was no real emotional attachment ever invested in such characters.There was a real earnest effort to try and improve the games popularity by spawning in a season of 'Space Ace' cartoons that were to be showcased on Saturday Supercade, but other than 13 episodes it never went on for a second season. Also a new Space Ace comic was released, but other than a very few rare to find now copies, even the new comic never really went anywhere.Still if anyone has seen interviews with Don Bluth then they would know that Space Ace holds a special part in his heart as much as it does with many nostalgic retro gamers. And if you want a history lesson then this is a good place to start.To get the most out of your experience I strongly suggest this, there is an achievement in game where you have to try and complete the game in Ace mode (hardest difficulty) with no movement hints. This is how it was when the original arcade came out. Keep a tally of how many times you had to continue your five lives. Now remember that the original arcade to play was $2.00, so multiply that cost by the amount of times you had to continue and that was your history of arcade gaming.One last thing to make your mind seriously go WTH. The cartoon series that spawned after the VG revealed that Dexter and Kimberly are brother and sister. Now reflect on the motor bike scene in this game. HMMMMM!? Cringe!!! However, it is unlikely that any of these interesting titbits will be known to any newcomer to this game which seriously makes we wish for a 'Definitive Collection' of 'Space Ace', which should include not only this version, but even all the other versions which are quite different, but based on the same principle, for example the snes version. This collection could also include the 13 cartoons and even the comics that spawned thereafter. That’s the collection that the fans of 'Space Ace' truly deserve.https://youtu.be/7BrDSzNosUI"

The gameplay is fun, with the problem of it being short. At this time, when I have approx. 3.5 hours, I have beaten the game multiple times. The game is pretty short. If you think you'll replay it alot, I can recommend this game. On the other side, if you want to have a game with more hours of gameplay, I cannot really recommend this."

This game plays the same way ""Dragon's Lair"" does except the story line is in outer space instead of a medieval theme.  Gameplay in this Steam version is customizable. You can play as the game was released in the arcades or you can play with visual and audio cues. There are varying degrees of difficulty and Steam Achievements to farm for as well.This game along with ""Dragon's Lair 1"" and ""DL 2"" are basically old arcade laser disc games.  The game would play the laser disk and your game would start.  You (as the player) would have to make the correct move(s), as the laser disk played (usually an animated movie).  Making an incorrect move would start an alternative movie clip that usually showed you dying.  These Steam versions do a great job of recreating that feel.   An excellent game but ONLY BUY ON SALE !"

It's awesome, witty dialouge, amazing score and sound effects and outstanding animation by Don Bluth will have you wanting to play this game again and again. All modes of difficulty are pretty hard to beat without dying, but you feel rewarded by the end when you defeat Borf. Score does not even matter."

It was 20p per turn.They also had Star Wars, the original vector graphics arcade game. That was only 10p a go.Even though Space Ace cost more, I persisted in playing 'because it looks so cool, just like acartoon'. I have no idea how people clocked this with no move guide because it's impossible.I died too many times before realising. I was a mug and should have played Star Wars more!The End"

The last masterpiece to be made by the Bulth team that was any good but what a way to finish off the Franchise that started with Dragons Lair.Space Ace is identical to the Laser Disc version that haunted us old school gamers back in the day by being incredibly hard to finish, mostly due to the fact that we didn't have enough coins to keep whacking in the arcade box to continue haha.This is the 3rd game in the Bluth Laser Disc franchise and to say that this was the best looking game that existed back in the late 80s and 90s is a gross understatement, back then I was amazed that you could actually interact with a cartoon!The game itself is not very complex (you respond to directional cues/icons on screen) but is instead entertaining and rewarding.  It makes you want to continue on just to see more and more of the cartoon antics and story, not to mention the hillarious death scenes.If you are an old school gamer or liked the Dragons Lair games or you are a collector of classic games then do not miss this for your game collection, this was part of one of the biggest milestones for games during the late 80s and 90s.Finally for those out there like me who played this as a young teenager simply buy now and just soak up the nostalgia whilst reliving those great memories of a miss spent youth.An absolute treasure!"

I played this game about 6-8 years ago, I think it was the HARDEST difficulity and it was MUCH easier back then. You got infinite lives, so you'll beat the game in about... 72 minutes on Normal (captain) difficulity without move guide. (it doesn't show which of 5 buttons you have to press so you have to figure it out by yourself in less than a second)  So I recommend to turn move guide on.P.S. failing is fun, no blood, cartoon violence."

For maximum enjoyment be sure to turn off the move guide for your first playthrough as having it on eliminates half the challange of the game. Especially for your first playthrough. With it off the game will provide and incredibly higher amount of play time. This is true for all the Don Bluth games.Though I will say with the move guide off (e.g. playing the REAL game) prepare to die.A lot.

I like being able to play Space Ace on my PC, but there is some blockiness at times more than Dragons Lair. I would recommend and update to get rid of the blocky distortion to the video, and to do a better job remastering these games. I expected Space Ace would look as good as Dragons Lair, but it doesn't, and controller support would be nice, the arcade version I played has a joystick and a button labeled with the gun icon, and keyboard controls aren't bad, but some of us would like a closer to authentic experience. These were the first QTE games I ever played, and would appreciate better treatment to the games."
