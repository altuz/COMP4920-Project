,Not Recommended,240620,18212747,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,zooboo,"Wanderlust Adventuresis the follow-up to Leth's 2011 game,Wanderlust: Rebirth. It's an Action RPG with online multiplayer, and it plays like a pseudo-MMORPG. The game boasts a huge open world to explore with randomized dungeons to keep action fresh and entertaining. There are 4 character classes to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I decided to give this game a try afterRebirth. Leth promised players that he'd listen to their suggestions and improve upon what was lacking in the first game. Unfortunately,Adventuresstill suffers from many of the same weaknesses.First, the gameplay is largely uninteresting. Most of combat is based on using an autoattack, followed by building upon different skills as your class. As a result, combat not only feels clunky, but it's really quite boring. There doesn't seem to be any weight to your actions; it's only spamming and repeating. None of it feels very satisfying to do as a player. Secondly, the loot and crafting systems don't add much to the game. Instead, they detract from the experience with tedious work that it doesn't need. Getting good drops seems incredibly unbalanced, and crafting doesn't seem to yield much better gear. Thirdly, although it can be enjoyed as a single-player experienced, it ultimately feels like it was meant to be played with others. Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't up to par with what other games in its genre can deliver.Still, Leth poured his heart and soul into this project. He is an extremely dedicated developer, with many fans that have been clamoring for this release. He is very responsive to questions and concerns, he streams development regularly, and is steady at releasing updates. The game's art and music are pretty good; the pixel art is easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack was done by Chris Christodoulou ofRisk of Rainfame. If it looks interesting to you, by all means, try the game. It can be pretty fun if you have friends to play it with, and maybe you'll enjoy what it has to offer."

The game is extremely easy, and the ""massively procedurally generated world"" is non existant and a joke. The combat gets old fast, and the game is very poorly balanced.

,Recommended,240620,17522085,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,Sayned,"TL;DRGame itself is good and worth attention and money, but, compared to Rebirth, there are some things I disliked in AdventuresIn generalGame is pretty well made, devs did really good job avoiding mistakes done in Rebirth. I personally enjoyed the game, the plot, the gameplay, music and graphics, etc.I will mention some good things about the game later on in this review, but I actually will focus on things I disliked in the game (is that weird?).Game isn't as linear as WR is. I actually have finished helping 4th outpost before helping 3rd one and it didn't affect plot that much. That's a good thingGood graphics, good music, good plotExploring world is not boring!Yet, there are some things that could be done better:(-)Dungeons are lame.In game we can see like 10-15 possible layouts for a dungeon and we can always predict where exit is. This is not the only problem with dungeons. Another thing is that they're boring. First 2-3 dungeons will be quite interesting, you'd want to explore them to see... a couple of rooms with nothing inside or an altar that wants to consume your soulcharge. But I have to admit, that exploring world is much more interesting than exploring a dungeon!(-)Grind.We all know that grinding something in any game is just pain. A lot of achievements and materials shall be literally grinded in WA. In that case you'd have to spend hours just to get a single contract of this ultra rare omen scarab or to get this last orange blueprint that only drops in epic Arena.Compared to Wanderlust: Rebirth (WR)WR had a lot of issues, that Wanderlust Adventures(WA) doesn't have and vice versa. Some of the advantages of WA over WR are obvious so I didn't mention them(+)WA is balanced compared to WRCompared to WR, there's no way you could call certain class OP or a certain build stronger than other. At least because different builds offer different playstyle. For example, carrying Energy+Ice on mage gives you aoe, control, some protection and mobility, while Earth+Fire gives you a lot of aoe, dps and a lot of protection. And yea, you could combine any elements in WA, unlike in WR you had to stick to either Earth+Fire or Ice+Energy because of how crit mechanic worked then.(+) WA isn't as linear, as WR wasThis one is self explainatory.(+) WA is less hardcoreI have to admit, WR was quite hardcore. I don't remember if I have actually managed to complete game on medium difficulty, but I do remember that walking through easy difficulty, well, was hard. Wanderlust Adventures is much easier to play solo, and is fun to play co-op.(-) WA is way too causalYet as a WR fan I expected game to be much harder and challenging than it is. Yup, I know, epic difficulty makes it A LOT harder and that's a good thing, but I really do want to mention that easy difficulty is WAY too easy. What I mean is that I died to a cactus in first location when started the game, but as soon as I finished my first quest, whole easy mode was like way too easy. Every mob died to a single spell that I casted. Until I started Epic mode. Epic mode is love.(-) WA bosses are much more boringI don't mind bosses be less challenging, but I expected them to be much more interesting, have more interesting movesets and so on. What we've got:-a Barbuda without his rage stance, which is boring-Slurge is pretty much the same-Grizzly became really weak and boring. Basically a no-threat boss, unlike WR-Golem thing has REALLY predictable and boring pattern.-Blood golem is like M E H. Really boring. This one didn't even heal or become untargetable or something.-Cillus. Yes, I am comparing Cillus from WA to Cillus from WR even though this boss' appearance in WR was quite short and I'm sure not everyone will even remember Cillus from WR. Basically, Cillus in WA was really boring. This fight didn't FEEL like the final boss, unlike Zemn in WR. And in general this boss' pattern was similar to Cillus from WR, but you don't really even hit Cillus in WA. I mean, you kill his minions, but how on earth would it lead you towards defeating him? Another thing - Cillus didn't touch you either. Blah blah blah, GIVE ME ZEMN AS FINAL BOSS D:<-All the mini-bosses (optional ones), such as yellow slime from Ooze Cave or Grizzly from Smelly cave, or The Watcher from The Portal, etc. are basically nothing special. They all have similar and boring patterns. While in WR we had this jumping fishman lord thing, which was quite challengingJust one last thing about bosses: Bosses are not mobile and usually are no treat to you since they're really predictable and struggle vs block or any mobility spell/skill. Unlike, for example, N'veia who had ability to dash around and deal tons-o-damage to you. And if you even manage to block those spells, then she started using her magic powahs to punish you.(+)But there are 2 interesting bosses actually:+Crystallis became much more interesting and harder to play against. And is easier to find (DAMN YOU'D NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW TO SPAWN CRYSTALLIS IN WR YOURSELF. LITERALLY NEVER.)+Mind Blight was quite interesting boss to see in game. It's cool how devs combined bullet hell with a puzzle game in one boss!(-)The Crawl:It's like my biggest complaint EVER.The Crawl in WA is literally BORING. You keep killing always same mobs on same arena with NO EVENTS AT ALL!While in WR you were fighting at different locations with different mobs (which were stronger, I have to admit). And after you beat 5 rounds, you could start some random events likeEpic Sax GuyBlood Golem, or Protect Marty. Even fight Kraken! D:<What you get in WA is like a ""Grinding simulator"" minigame. Which literally is IMPOSSIBLE to have fun at!(-)No secrets, no secret interactions, not that much of interactions in game in general:We had a side quest in WR - lead Marty back home. And in case if we'd do that, we'd unlock another quest - to find Marty in sewers. I didn't know about second quest until I decided to play from chapter 1 to 10 in 1 game. Another thing - you can't find a red bARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRell, put it near a crack in a wall and enjoy a secret boss. You actually can't lift red barrels anymore. WA has like no interactions between player and world, aswell as no secrets (or maybe there are secrets, but I didn't find them yet! which is unlikely, since there are no hints anywhere that there would be a secret. for example - no suspicious achievements :P).AND NO MORE EPIC SAX GUY!(-)Escorts are way too easyEscrorts are like no challenge at all. Person that you're helping to is like never focused by enemies. Or if it gets focused, you will most likely oneshot enemies. Or die from one hit, because epic difficulty is hard :POne really important note:Even though I've mentioned a lot of bad things about the game, I didn't do a mistake pressing ""I recommend"" button. Those things I mentioned, are things I PERSONALLY missed as a person who enjoyed previous Wanderlust game (Rebirth). Talking about real problems, the game has: there are only 3 things that are actually relevant and bring negative experience: The Crawl, Grinding, Dungeons. Other bad things I've mentioned are not that relevant compared to those 3 and actually is just something I personally wanted to whine about.With all that being said, I recommend this game to everyone, except those players who loved The Crawl in Wanderlust Rebirth. Let's be honest, in Wanderlust Adventures The Crawl sucks. It really does. SORRY, DEVS D:"

,Recommended,240620,17715796,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,Jono,"GameplayWhat’s Good:- A solid gameplay formula for loot hunting/exp grinders out there- Each class has a good variety of abilities to progress and choose from- Randomized maps make each session feel relatively fresh- Varied biomes for each area made them feel distinct.  One area in particular was very bizarre and unexpected.- Various events on the map were nice and sometimes would feature more than just combat with puzzle gameplay- Day/Night cycle system that changes up the adventuring experience- Companion system that allows you to obtain nearly every enemy in the game as a combat pet and level them up- Crafting system- Good amount enemy types/bosses/minibosses- Main boss encounters were mostly unique with an interesting fight strategy and not just damage sponges.- I liked all the exp combos and awards you could earn from combat, it made each encounter feel rewarding.- Various mini-games were nice extras even if they weren't vital to the gameplay (Fishing, Mining, Slot Machines)- Hard mode available for those looking for more challenge and replay value- I've seen frequent patches with bugfixes and other small changes which is a great sign of active devs that careWhat’s Bad:- Would have been nice if the storage stash in town was shared between characters to allow you to transfer items between them.- Game completion progress is shared between your characters which some players may not like, quests are repeatable though.- Waypoints are nice, but I wish there was one in each major outpost.  When playing early on I wasn't finding any so was making long treks through low level areas trying to get where I need to go.- The overall journey did feel kind of samey as you essentially go from outpost to outpost doing a handful of quests at each, if you just enjoy exploring and killing mobs this may not be an issue with you though as you are free to do this at any time.- While this may not bother some players, the game is very gear dependent as important stat values like HP mostly come from gear and gems which enhance your gear.  Without the HP buffs from gear I found myself getting killed instantly quite often.- The dungeons while varied in appearance, seemed very similar layout wise and typically involved moving from room to room clearing enemies until you found the exit.  I may have preferred the main dungeons to have been hand-crafted experiences and keeping the randomized ones for optional locations within the world.ControlsWhat’s Good:- Support for keyboard and controllers, however I solely played with a controller.- While it may take some getting used to, the controls and various options available for customizing them were acceptable.What’s Bad:- One of the only things that frustrated me with the controls at times was the auto target locking of ranged Sorcerer spells.  It is possible I could have been able to turn in this off while I was on the simple aiming feature which felt the best to me, but I didn't see it.Graphics/PerformanceWhat’s Good:- A lot of great pixel art throughout the game, although still not as impressive as some other similar games.  The larger enemies and bosses in particular stood out as the most impressive.- Lighting effects during night look neatWhat’s Bad:- While this may not bother everyone, the framerate is locked at 30FPS which did leave me wishing the game looked and felt more smooth.SoundWhat’s Good:- The soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou was easily one of my favorite parts of the game.  I initially became a fan through the Risk of Rain soundtrack with its tunes that perfectly fit the bizarre alien worlds of that game and once again these tracks seem to perfectly fit each biome and theme.- Sound effects are average, can't really say anything bad about themFinal ThoughtsWanderlust Adventures is an excellent indie co-op 2D action RPG for any fans of looting hunting and grinding style games.  While the main quest may quickly end for those that rush to finish it, there are still reasons to keep playing and progress your character further if you like by hunting for and crafting new loot.  My favorite parts of the game were the boss encounters and the soundtrack, while on the negative side I was hoping to see more handcrafted locations for the main quest rather than pure randomization.Verdict: BuyThe content that Wanderlust Adventures offers easily fits the 15 dollar price tag and many may even get much more value out of this price if they decide to level up multiple characters and do a lot of loot grinding.  Just make sure you come in knowing that this is a more combat-focused and character progression style RPG and does not feature very many puzzles or a strong story due to the focus on randomization.  For those curious about length, it will likely take somewhere between 5 to 10 hours of gameplay on your first normal difficulty run-through of the game which may be much shorter or longer depending on if you rush or do a lot of optional content and exploring."

,Not Recommended,240620,17632336,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,Mofu Mofu,"First of all, if you play with other people, I do recommend this game. This is a negative evaluation for a solo play, because anything is fun with friends. And I'll add to that that I did finish the game in solo.So... Where to begin. I'll start by the story. You can ignore it, because it doesn't serve much point, wich is a bit sad for a rpg-ish type of game.Next we have this ""randomized"" system that says the world ""always change each time you play""... yeah, that's not the case. What you get are kinda different spawn of ennemies from the same pool in each area. The map doesn't change, the location of quests and dungeons either... anyway there is nothing random about this game, and each playthrough is the same if you start over or if you join a ""new world"" (wich you will have to if you want to ""continue"" your game since only your quest progress is saved and your teleport points)Oh. The teleport points, let's talk about them. Their placement is pretty bad, but the worst thing about them is that they are the only thing that are left for you to travel when you start the game again... So ok, that's maybe good? But the problem is, you cannot go back to the lich tower for instance directly. Wich raises one problem : you have to do the last ""zone"" plus the last dungeon in one go, because if you leave the area, you need to do the walk from the last (very far away) beacon you crossed. And you'll have to go back, because your inventory will fill up super quickly.The events now... They are probably the highlight of the game, different elite mobs that spawn, as strong as some bosses or at least that represent a challenge... Except that some of them can one shot you (or close enough, in normal you cannot die in 1 hit, but you're left with 1hp).I was playing mage, so maybe that's why I take a HUGE amount of damage, and I'm fine with that, but I'm just giving advice for the people who want to play this solo.And talking about mage, let's talk about why this game is broken hm? Some bosses (a lot of them) are bugged at the end of dungeons, meaning by that, you can exploit them. The only ones that cannot be exploited are the ones who attack as soon as you come in the room (like the huge slime) or the ones that you have to walk to to activate (like the Mind Blight and the Lich). But other thant that, the Death like figure in the last secondary dungeon for exemple, or any other boss like that...? If you are a mage, you can enter the boss room... and not moving, and just shoot fireball. The boss will never react, and die. Quite a huge mistake to make in coding these hu? So mage is really easy to play alone, you blink against packs, and you do nothing but clicking against boss...I do not know if that works in harder difficulty, but I would guess it does.I did not play the harder difficulty yet, I'm waiting for friends to reach the level 15 (or play with them to that point) to do so. So I cannot comment that... But honestly, if you want a game like this without friends, I'd play the previous game of this series, or Secrets of grindea, wich are both really good in solo and multiplayer.There are a lot more things to say about this game, like the fact that I never got any compagnon contract dropped, or any legendary crafting recepies wich I guess you get in Epic mode, or that all the loot is worthless compared to what you can craft... This game could be so much better than this.As I said, it will be fun with friends, because you'll get epic mode, and fight in a crazy setup where you would die very quickly and will pose a challenge. But that's all this game has, the rest deserve to be fully remade."

,Not Recommended,240620,17784776,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,holytacoz,TL;DR  Wait for a steam sale.While is looks like a charming game with clean visuals but the gameplay could have used more substance. Classes seemed to revolve around very linear combat paths which can make you lose interest after extended gameplay. Even when playing with two players the smaller rooms could get cluttered with graphics and monsters making a mess of your screen.For a game that seems to be designed for a multiplayer experience I would expect a bundle price but 15 dollars per copy is way too expensive for the 10 hour story line and questionable replayability. Playing with a friend I found that there were many glitches from spawning at different points from each other when entering new rooms or having the camera lock onto your ally even after respawning. Seemed like it had potential but too expensive for its price.

Instead, I've just spent my time roaming and exploring the area for dungeons of interest and the like. Most normal mobs are rather easy, which does lead to a problem.

You better bet it, mister.Multiplayer, that adds in more mechanics and harder mobs per player? Tried it, andI want to do more multiplayer.But this is just me playing it so far, and the few quips so far is that you can kite enemies moving diagonally, avoiding most enemies/roaming bosses and their attacks (until you get mobbed, then you played it dumb!). And the lack of feature to either mass sell items in town (equiments mostly), or having item lock to prevent selling or ridding of them. (Haven't encountered that, but I bet people will sooner or later! Look before you sell too many!)All in all, It's great to me. The music is there, the surprise elements makes it fun for me, and the multiplayer makes it so you can band with others (but so will the enemies!).

,Recommended,240620,17886657,"Posted: 4 September, 2015",all,Tundra Scorpion,"While not exactly ground-breaking or revolutionary, Wanderlust Adventures is still a worthwhile and arguably addictive gaming experience with plenty to offer.A 16-bit open world RPG, Wanderlust offers an impressively sized map, randomized areas and random events that offer a good replay value. You are given the choice between one of four classes to choose from before you embark on an adventure to save the land from evil and yadda yadda yadda. The story and setting are cliche and have honestly been done to death, but it if ain't broke, don't fix it. So the story don't matter for crap here.The gameplay offers a lot more depth than I would have initially thought, instead of thoughtless controls like ""swing sword, cast spell etc"" you can block a certain amount of enemy attacks, and if you time the block just right you can counter-attack do dish out a steaming-hot serving of pain. Just my experience, since I played through as the warrior class.What really sells me on the gameplay are the skill trees. I found them to be diverse and thought-provoking, encouraging me to pick and choose which skills and perks best suit my playstyle, and my decisiveness was rewarded since the level cap is 25 and I didn't have a single wasted skill-point, covering all the bases I felt were necessary but also keeping an interesting challenge curve as the game progressed.Another solid point on gameplay are the companions. Almost every enemy you fight in the game you can get as a follower to help you in your battles. This can be done by finding a ""mercenary contract"" item that you can turn in at town to buy a new companion. Companions are unfortunately little more than battlefield distractions, keeping the focus away from you while you slash away at enemies while they focus your buddy. Also despite what the banner image may suggest, you cannot get a giant scorpion as a companion (oh god WHY NOT?!?).Exploring the map gives the player the opportunity to experience randomly generated events, ranging from run-of-the-mill ambushes where you are assaulted by a wave of the enemies native to that portion of the map or a tougher mini-boss. Or you can come across more interesting events like puzzles, traps or enchanted loot containers that trigger a stronger wave of enemies.The enemies in the game are varied and each one having their own range of attacks to be mindful of. There can be standard RPG enemy archetypes like bandits and skeletons, or you can square-off with Sand Sharks, Snake Women or Giant Scorpions (WHY WONT YOU LET ME HAVE YOU AS A COMPANION?).The bad points of the game are very noticeable. Most notably, the uninteresting loot system. Part of what makes a good RPG is loot, finding and collecting all the best items for your characters to help even the odds a little against your adversaries, in Wanderlust the items you find while adventuring are 99% useless. Items you can build with blueprints at the town's blacksmith offer stats miles higher than what you'd normally find, which is a pretty big letdown. Once you build these items, there is legitimately no point in searching for loot anymore, and in my playthrough I got the best possible loadout in little-under the halfway mark.SPOILER ALERT! Read ahead at your own riskThe biggest letdown in my opinion was the final boss.The boss battle, to put it simply, sucked. This ""Lich"" dude was built up to be the baddest dude around, an unstoppable force of dark magic that could never be destroyed because any human who killed it would become the next Lich. How did the battle play out? You dodge a few spells, fight off some waves of dungeon enemies and the fight's over. While this in itself is pretty pathetic, it gets even better. Not only through the final battle but also through the final dungeon you have no choice but to be accompanied by an essential story NPC who is invulnerable and uses the most overpowered spells, making what could have been an epic final dungeon crawl leading up to a spearpoint final battle feel more like a hand-held daycare. I legitimately just let this NPC tank most of the boss minions and he killed them all without any contribution on my part. Severe letdown there.So while Wanderlust Adventures isn't absolutely perfect, I still found myself enjoying the overall experience. Given the hours I've logged for what I payed, yeah, I'd say it was worthwhile. So pick it up if you're looking for some good old fashioned RPG."

I LOVE THIS GAMEThe experiences this game is giving me are amazing, each dungeon you clear and you didnt die you feel so proud of yourself. Each time you carry your partners in a difficult arena wave or a sticky ambush, you feel so great, with so much pride and without limits.And when you are low level in a epic dangerous dungeon(or arena) you will be scared, just running around trying not  to die and yet still being able to help your team. And let me tell you, this feels rewarding too. Just knowing that you werent a dead weight for the team, and going to town with your loot handed to you with two or three extra levels you got in that dungeon. (congrats, you are on the way of becoming a pro in this game!)Now, If you are buying/bought the game I recommend: (seriously this some of the (actual) reasons of some negative reviews)-Play in coop (sometimes solo can be too unforgiving. And the game feels mostly designed to be played in coop) *dont be afraid of hosting-Play with friends (when you are playing the game with a friend on skype or teamspeak, that ""OH NO I DIED"" makes you feel so much engaged into the game, making completing quests and dungeons feel so much rewarding)-Got bored? (seriously?)/Tired of dying?.. TRY ANOTHER CLASS. Each class is so unique with different mechanics and possible strategies. it is almost like playing a whole different game! Take the one that fits most with your playstyle (you might not know in the instant you try the character, so give is some time, in the first 9 levels they teach you the basics of each class)- - - - - IMPORTANT - - - - - -- - - - -DO NOT CHEAT- - - - -You might think it is going to be fun just cheat engine through some parts of the game you havent been able to go through, but trust me this will ruin your experience with the game. I perssonally did cheat with my warrior (already deleted), but this made the game feel a lot more grindier. It meant zero risk-(of rain)- with the same rewards and after a while (2 dungeons) i felt super bored, i thought this game was thrash in that moment.The day after i decided to give the game another chance, with another class, with all the recommendations i gave you. And I was amazed. The game was the same, but the expirience was TOTALLY different. And it felt like one of the best coop game I have ever played. (dont get me wrong, this game is still awesome solo, but too unforgiving for some people)TL;DR : BUY THIS GAME, IT IS AMAZING, and it will give you a great experience. Replayable? im trying to craft every weapon in the game,with each character maxing every single one of them (and im still not bored). Play in coop (with friends pref). If you get bored (u got bored?!), try different classes. Finally, get good and dont cheat.PD: thumbs up the review if you found it helpful"

Now some people complain about how you get 1 hit by most things in epic but the reason they probably dont like it is cuz they charge headlong into enemies and dont play smarter it is possible to go through the map in epic mode with just yourself you just need to chance your original tactic. Not recommended that you do as you only have 1 revive and it takes a while to kill things which is why there is the multiplayer where you can find nice people to help or get people to help you in game, killing, farming, doing quests. Also while the armor dropped eventually becomes just money you can get materials for even better weapons and accessories in epic mode. There are plenty of companions that you can bring along and you can find which one works best with your playstyle. Skill trees force you to choose what you plan on becoming, a hard hittting warrior or a tanky one, support mage or one who does massive dmg from the outskirts of the fighting and so on. Would recommend this game though might be better if they had a 4 pack for people who want to send this to their friends to play with."

It's pretty fun that it is coop, something that always makes a game more appealing to us, and the coop is well implemented too.  The rest of the game however, is just not very fun. Combat is okay, but the skills/spells get pretty boring after a while and there doesn't seem to be many ""advanced moves"" you can do with them. Skills have their basic usage, and that's it, not many interesting combinations. Neither is there a particularly large selection to choose from.There is no mmorpg-style ""required grind"" to progress in the story, which is good, but the game still feels fairly grindy as you mostly just spend your time grinding monsters anyways. Quests aren't very engaging either, it's mostly ""kill 10 of these things"", ""escort this guy"" and ""clear this dungeon"".

After that, I decided to go straight into the mission, as that's what it directs you to do. While randomly travelling through the world to get to my objective, There's an NPC that starts fighting me, and I die instantly, despite having just increased my max health with a skill point, and blocking. The game became boring imediately after, and I sent a refund request."

All menus use this control scheme. At the very least, the main menu should be controllable with arrow keys by default.•When using an Xbox 1 controller and moving straight down or up with the dpad, unable to move diagonally and must change direction or stop moving to be able to move diagonally again.•No abilities until levelling up 3 times, making those first 3 levels insanely boring.•3 ability slots and 3 secondary ability slots, with 1 of those 6 being your standard attack. There is a million buttons on keyboards and standard every day controllers. You should be able to keybind all the abilities to whatever you want."

I feel like it's abandoned now and there's very limited content. As is, it's repetitive. If you want this style of game but with more playability, try Hero Siege. That game is still getting updates frequently.I just can't suggest buying this game unless it's marked down a lot on sale. Sorry."
