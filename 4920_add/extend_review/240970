,Recommended,240970,9726809,"Posted: 4 April, 2014",all,Phosphatide,"The second game in a series about saving the world in only half a minute has once again won my love in only half an hour. All the gameplay you know and love from the first game is back and upgraded just a tad for more dynamic fights without losing its original feel. If you've played the first game you'll have a good time seeing some subtle callbacks, but if you're jumping into the series with this game you'll still have a grand time; skipping the first game in no way makes the game any less fun.Outside of fighting, there's so much to be done. Weapon crafting, skill leveling, bonus content you purchase using gold saved up from missions, and so forth. It's so easy to climb your way up to 100% completion and yet so difficult to successfully achieve that goal with such a large number of tasks to complete. You won't be left feeling like you didn't have enough to do.Plus there's a leaderboard for benchmark testing the game on your computer so you can compare your results to other players for whatever reason. How can you not love this game?"

Do not feel disheartened if you completed the first mission set ---- Your journey is just the beginning! If you are a completionist, check out the gallery and unlock artworks, videos and soundtracks by finishing the game! The only complain I have is only the music transition while fighting against the enemies while not on any mission, since it gets rather repetitive. Steam Workshop support allows map creation for increased gameplay value.For the options, each gamepad and keyboard bindings can be customized to your liking and for the first time, occulus VR mode on a 2d game(?).Experience great soundtrack (especially the main menu!), improved battle (now you have skills, class, party and formation) and having the money-minded goddess along with your journey, HMH fans and newcomers will love it!"
,Recommended,240970,16484126,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Cpt. Moist Panties,"If you LOVED the first title you'll......feel torn on this one.It's not a bad game. Like all sequels it does everything its predecessor did with bells and whistles added. Unlike the previous title, you get an art gallery, unlockable costumes for the Time Goddess, and  a more cohesive plotline with cutscenes and character development.But that's what's off-putting for some. The first title had miniature 30 second quests selected from a world map where the boss, area, and quest were all self-contained. The bosses were made to be humorous and you'd get a small 4 sentence 'epilogue' to the quest that had a joke or two in it. The plot-line was backdrop: it merely explained why you were traveling the world.The Second Coming places the plot in center-row and heavily emphasizes it. You get cut-scenes pre and post quest, flashbacks while you travel the world map, and character exposition and development. Bosses are no longer humorous with ridiculous motivations for their actions: they are taken much more seriously. Granted, we aren't dealing with Final Fantasy levels of writing and exposition, but the humor is considerably toned down. You'll either appreciate the expansion or hate it vehemently.There were some casualties in transitioning to a story-driven game. Whereas you were timed in the previous title and graded on it after a quest, this game merely continues on with the storyline after a quest is finished. They've done away with the quest completion screen, which details your time and objectives completed, so the game places less emphasis on speed-running. Ironically, time is less emphasized in the series than ever before.The sequel DOES fu*k up in two indisputable ways: the ability to go back to completed quests in a time trial mode and the ability to level up in the over-world map. When you level up outside of a quest, your level carries over to the next quest. Which means the element of grinding is introduced in a series where a 30 second quest's challenges include getting strong enough to defeat a boss. You can realistically grind outside of a quest so that when you enter it you're already set to beat the boss, which is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this series. Secondly, while you can go back to completed quests to beat the clock, you keep all of your current equipment and levels, which is doubly insane and defeats the point of the 30 second timer and a time trial challenge.Granted, you don't NEED to grind, ever. But the fact that it's even an option is just as bad as auto-aim in a PC FPS.Two ♥♥♥♥-ups aside I'm really split on this game. The previous title had a more arcade-like feel and you could pick up and play it whenever and put it down a minute later. This title has a more continuous feel to it, and in transitioning to a serious RPG some of the humor of the last title is lost. I miss bosses that wanted to blow up the world because others confused their species for a similar looking species. But it's still an enjoyable title that tries something new with the base 'Half-Minute Hero' experience still lying underneath."

While the first one had several frantic levels to complete, this one has periods of calm to make yourself stronger at a slower rate, before you gain temporary levels at a rapid rate in quests. The soundtrack is intense, with the quests having pumped up, energetic sounds.This one has quite a bit more depth to the way you manage your equipment and party. You can actually position everyone and give them little orders, and you can also select a skill to randomly fire upon landing a hit.The story this time around is highly engaging. There is less humour in the first chapter of this adventue, but it makes up for this lacking with a web of character relations and situations. The fate of the characters are actually of high interest this time around. The story also brings back several moments from the first game.This is a more modern, better written Half-Minute Hero."
,Recommended,240970,11194351,"Posted: 11 July, 2014",all,Robot Maid,"The Time Goddess has given me more than 30 seconds to review this game, so I will make use of her charitable nature.Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is the second (obviously) Half Minute Hero game. With a good mix of RPG, puzzle, and action all packed into one hilarious RPG which lampoons pretty much everything in those games. You have several stories to go through which span an impressive plot which is told in a series of (technically) 30 second levels. The characters are colorful and the gameplay is amazingly fun. Keeping in touch with true frantic action, you must make all your choices quickly, lest those 30 seconds you have be wasted, or you could always pay the stingy Time Goddess.The game is extremely fun, with the game keeping the pedal to the metal at all times. The story and dialogue gloriously pokes and prods fun at many tropes present in video games, from forcing you to pick a specific choice to giant robots (who doesn't love giant robots?)! This game, like its predecessor, has an overarching story that encompasses several campaigns following different heroes of different eras, all helped by the Time Goddess.The gameplay is simple, but fun. You'll find yourself smiling as you plow through fields or Global Dungeons looking for EXP, gold, and items. During missions, you have to balance time and money, adding a strategic / tactical aspect to each and every mission. Do you plow through to the boss and risk being too weak or grind your levels until you're strong enough? Not only there, there's plenty of secrets in the game that'll keep you engaged for awhile as well.There's also a map creation system where you can create your own maps to play and download creations of other players, to further add to the content of this game!It also has a multiplayer function, though I've yet to try that out.Overall, it's an amazing game that is definitely worth the price tag that it has.Unfortunately for me, the Time Goddess noticed I called her stingy and has taken all my money, my shoes, and my shirt.Thankfully, I still have my pants. Wait, no. She took those too."

Oh okay thank you.The story is the sequel to Half Minute Hero Super Mega Bla Bla Bla and if you're planning to buy this game you have the chance to play the first one for knowing what should you wait after you beat the game. The story if you play it right should be long about 26 hours.The gameplay is simple, you have 30 seconds to level up to defeat the boss of the level. If you can't make it in time you lose.The soundtrack is one of the best I ever heard, Is composed by multiple people but one of these guys is Motoi Sakuraba, the artist who made the Dark Souls soundtrack.My last words are please buy this game, support the company!

The addition of freeroaming, the connected world, global level and permanent companions are just a few additions that made this game much more enjoyable than Half Minute Hero 1 (which I already liked). There are tons of hidden items, achievements, formations, companions, dungeons... you name it. The dialog and story is typical in the style of a cheesy JRPG. Not my taste but it's a minor complaint. While the very core gameplay is truthful to that of it's predecessor, the content compared was quadrupled. You can expect 20 hours of gametime, for completionists it's easily double. Overall a very enjoyable experience with minor flaws, definitely recommend buying it."
,Recommended,240970,28982249,Posted: 3 January,all,Lord,"Amazing Game, a parody on RPGs that is really underrated and a great sequel to the first game. The story is funny, and when it gets serious out of nowhere it is, most of the time, really done well.Compared to the first game, the tone is really different and the game itself stops being a complete parody around the end of the first ""chapter"" (Overture).The gameplay keeps the core mechanic of the first game and greatly expands it, being basically Hero 30 with classes, a new revamped Allies system and skills. It kinda slows down compared to the first one thanks to the skills but there is a way to turn their effects off to get the feeling of rush from the first game.While I do recommend playing its prequel first, especially because the story has some important ties to the first one, it is not required at all and most of the jokes and characters won't really stop being interesting.The crafting and cassino system are not really well done, but they are not required at all and are clearly there to keep the game going after it ended, though are not executed really well.On the other hand, the Time Attack, Map Creation are really cool and can keep people who really liked the game interested. The game has some really cool quests, but that can be kind of ""grindy"" if people didn't really like the Global System, which is a system that tranforms the game into a more traditional RPG outside of the main quests.Finally, the game has loads of content, and if people liked the core gameplay, they really won't be running out of time anytime soon, as long as they have the coins needed to keep going."

Then again, the first game constantly mixed things up to keep it fresh, so I should expect nothing less out of the second game.The story retains the same balance between parodical comedy and semi-serious drama, though it is significantly deeper this time around. Many characters from the previous game make a reappearance in some form, in fact, the bumbling but lovable Knight is back as a constant party member, and his interactions with the Goddess are hilarious.Give the game a shot, but keep in mind that the first Hero 30 is basically an extended tutorial, this game takes a while to get off the ground compared to the first one."

,Not Recommended,240970,12489110,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,Ksempac,"What a disappointing sequel !Half-Minute Hero was a very clever game. At first glance, it seemed to be just a parody : it mocked grindy RPG with cliche story. But once you delved into it you found a very original gameplay system, with lots of cool ideas. The maps were full of secrets and branching paths, and the combat system had some clever mechanics for people that wanted a challenge or wanted to find all secrets.The Second Coming, by trying to add more stuff is now...a grindy RPG with cliche story. The super cliche plots are force fed to you through endless and pointless dialogs. The ""metagame"" added is a grindy RPG (not sped up) with linear plot, repetitive gameplay, forced backtracking to unlock all items, etc. Exactly the kind of games the first game was mocking.The new combat features (Skills, formations, party, classes, etc...) are also completely broken. All attempts to use theses features will be constantly thwarted by the game, which reset your formations, party, equipment everytime a story event requires a single change (which is...almost always). ""Luckily"" you actually you do not have to use theses features most of the time, as brute forcing is often the way to go.Unfortunately, brute forcing can be applied to everything in the Second Coming. Most of the cleverness of the combat is gone : there are tons of items, but they don't have special attributes anymore like you could find in the first game. So you just get whatever give you the biggest stats bonus and rush. No need to be clever anymore, just go through the motions, endure the repetitive combats and you will win all missions. Even the secret titles, which used to be a challenge in the first game, are now rather straightforward and super easy to get.On the bright side, for people who are looking for a challenge, there is a very challenging ""endless"" mode, but i doubt you will come back to it once you've finished it, since the maps are always the same.Multiplayer has also been upgraded, but since there are very few players, I've been unable to try it, which will be the case for you too if you don't have friends who own the game.On the whole, I don't see enough good stuff in this game to alievate the bad, and I can only advise you to stick to the first game. I completed the game, but it wasnt because i enjoyed it, it was only for completion sake and to be sure i wasn't missing something...."

Pretty much what you would expect from playing the first game but what is different here is how the quests are bigger, theres overworld exploration, and even little dungeons you can go through without worrying about the time in between quests. The game also has roughly twice as much content in the story compared to the first. As for more gameplay you got time attack, infinite battle, multiplayer, and the custom levels you can make and play.So about the story I can say its pretty good. Starts off from where the last game left off but this time around it parodies the RPGs around like the SNES and PS1 era with more drama and character development (similar to that one quest in the first game). Even with that It still keeps its humor and makes me smile at some parts of it.With all that I say its worth checking out."

It's worth sitting through those for those brilliant silly Half-Minute Hero moments though, and there are more than enough of them to justify sitting through the boring overall story.This has a lot more features than the original game, which I've got mixed feelings about.Classes don't do much, but they're a nice idea. Battle formations are awesome. Searching for medals on the overworld? Eh, why not. I'm indifferent about skills and Hero Castle stuff, though I think a lot of people would probably like those. I don't know.Since you can now grind on the overworld for permanent level ups, and are allowed to keep the gear you've obtained in later quests even when redoing quests, there's never any point in strategizing as to which gear and path will let you earn the best time, as you can just come back later in the game with max levels and the best equipment, and redo the quest with no challenge. Maybe I'm being too harsh as there's a separate Time Attack mode that plays more like the original, but I just don't see the appeal of redoing story quests in a different mode.This game is much more friendly to newcomers and casual players than the original was, and so it is the best place to pick up the series, though veterans of the original may be disappointed that it's nowhere near as challenging.Still a great game though, and I had a ton of fun with it despite all the things I've nitpicked about it. I definitely recommend both Half-Minute Hero titles to anyone who's a fan of retro console JRPGs, and since you get the first game for free with this one, my complaints are pretty much null!TLDR; Very funny and good, rant about it being easier than the first game, and new features being meh, still worth your time, buy it!"

76561197995914563,Recommended,240970,9760152,"Posted: 7 April, 2014",all,Radiant Escargo,"""Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming"" is the sequel to Marvelous's Half Minute Hero, which I strongly suggest playing first. The first game is shorter, lighter, and a good indicator of how you'll feel about the sequel. If you liked the first game, you'll also like the sequel. If you didn't like the first one because it didn't feel enough like a JRPG, you should try this one. If you simply didn't like the first game, you won't like this one either.I'm going to write this review as though you're familiar with the first game.Quick summary:- Much longer than the first game. Supports multiplayer with lobbies and Community Maps. Community Maps are awesome and could add a lot of replayability.- Very much a sequel to Half Minute Hero. It's a JRPG/Puzzle/Action hybrid that focuses on fun, but allows for challenge.- Only has RPG-mode, so Evil Lord/Princess/Knight fans are out of luck. RPG-mode fans are in for a huge treat.- Story is more of a take on epic SNES RPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy VI) than of classic NES RPGs (e.g. Dragon Quest).- Story mode less arcade-y. All the half-minute quests are in the framework of a traditional overworld RPG, although quests are individually replayable with leaderboards.- Lots of secret equipment/party members, as well as significant post story content. Maybe a 20-40 hour game, unless you really get into score attack or user levels.- Lots of extra modes, notably user generated levels and infinite play modes.- Music, graphics (retro 16 bit), and gameplay elements are all a big upgrade over the original.From all this, you can probably tell if you'd like the game or not. It's definitely not for everyone. I personally loved it. I'm arbitrarily giving it a score of 9, mostly because it's a niche game and I'd understand people who find it repetitive. I'll go into much more detail now.- GAMEPLAY -Like in the original, you take control of different main characters in different eras. Unlike the original, this game plays much more like a traditional JRPG. It is huge world with a lot of text and a lot of cutscenes. You explore an overworld map, fight battles, and progress the story. You equip yourself, you choose your party members, you choose your battle formations, you can switch classes, and you can look for secrets.How does the overworld map work? You wander around and any leveling you do contributes to your ""global level."" Grinding this way is slow, but you do get unlimited dash. Grinding isn't necessary to beat the main game at all. As you explore, you run into areas that lock you into a subarea and start a Half Minute Quest. Your starting level is your global level and the quest plays out a lot like a quest from the original game, in which you have thirty seconds to defeat an Evil Lord before they destroy the world. Sometimes you have to trigger certain events, like finding a key or building a bridge, in order to find and defeat the boss. You can pay a money hungry goddess to reset your thirty second timer. When you finish the quest, the barriers and time limit go away and you reset to your global level. And you continue on like you were playing a traditional JRPG.The basic game mechanics are almost exactly like the first game, except that you can see your enemies. If you're at a much a higher level than the enemy, you won't be forced into a battle screen when you touch them... you'll just automatically win. The quests are still very creative in this game and there are lots of new gimmicks (hope you don't mind solving ice puzzles or dealing with flipped controls in 30 seconds...) Some of the quests feel really epic. It's a lot of fun.In addition to the five part story mode, there are four other modes to play.Time Attack: You can replay the quests you've unlocked from story mode. You can freely set your equipment, party, and formation to go for a high score.Infinite Mode: You fight an infinite number of evil lords. You go through different maps and have to kill ten evil lords that randomly spawn in the stage. After you beat ten, you move to a different stage and repeat until you can't restart the timer.Map Editor: Make/Share your own quests. This is pretty well done and not too hard to use. You can search for, download, and play other people's quests. Most of the highly ranked quests are really fun.Battle: Multiplayer mode, you compete with other people to defeat the evil lord first. There are eight different maps in this mode.- STORY -The story is a lot richer and more serious this time around, but it still keeps its tongue-in-cheek tone. It is a continuation to the original Half Minute Hero story. There are actually a lot of callbacks to the first game. A surprising amount of familiar faces show up again as villians, heroes, or both. It's a good take on the huge RPGs of the SNES era. I enjoyed the story (especially from the second chapter onwards), but I could understand people thinking it's too slow or too cliche (even though it's cliche on purpose.)The story mode follows three generations of heroes: Yuusha, Yushia, and Yuja. Yuusha is a play on the amnesiac, emo hero. He's even got one wing. He's captain of the royal forces on a special mission. Although he has a cold demeanor, he's a very caring guy. Yushia is a student of the Goddess school in a world ruled by the Empire. She's a bit naive and has to deal with a crazy escalating situation. Yuja is a brawn over brains kind of guy who's living in a post-apocalyptic type world that's been ruined by the gods. Each story mostly deals with saving the world within 30 seconds, but the overarching threat is different each time and each story has its own themes. Each of the heroes makes a contract with a Time Goddess who will reset time for them... for an increasingly high fee. Both main characters and supporting cast are pretty endearing.As you can guess, this game addresses a lot of RPG tropes. You get lots of adventure, romance, betrayal, artifact collecting, and plot twists. There are evil empires, dark lords, time streams, and rivals to fight. You take on evil groups like the ""Eight Elementals"", ""The Three Generals"", the ""Dark Time Goddess"", and the ""Venus Seven."" The creators use a lot of cliches, but they use them knowingly. The story is clearly a take on character driven SNES-rpgs, especially Final Fantasy.- PRESENTATION -The graphics follow the original Half Minute Hero's retro look, although this time around, the style is much closer to 16-bit RPGs of the SNES era. If you like that look, you'll love the art. There are a ton of sprites and a ton of maps. Most of the main characters and villians have concept art you can collect in game. The concepts were drawn by different artists and it's fun to compare the concept to the actual sprite.The music is really great and done by a large group of great composers. There are vocal songs this time too, which add a really epic feel.- CLOSING -I'm a huge Half Minute Hero fan and grew up playing SNES RPGs, so I really loved this game. It's not just more of the same, I'd say the developers took even bigger risks this time by trying to make a full length game. It feels like a loving, fast paced take on a great traditional RPG."

This sequal steps up the quality in almost every way which I find is quite rare in sequals these days.

Thankfully you have the goddess of the Time to help you... if you pay her.The difference with the first game is that while the first game had level selection, this has a map where you can level up and get gold and items outside the levels. But don't worry, the level in the map and the levels is different. In the map you earn the 10% of the gold you get in the levels, so buying weapons in the levels is cheaper (but usually you don't have time enough to buy them or you can't afford them because you are praying to the goddess a lot).There are more differences like a party and a formation for battles, but I think that is better if you see that by yourself.Oh, and there's a map editor.If you liked the first one you'll like this.

And it almost didn't come to the West at all. It was a Japan only PSP game for years before getting ported on the fly due to the success of the first game on Steam.Half Minute Hero 2 is a direct sequel to the first Half Minute Hero, and it contains similar gameplay to the Hero mode from the original. You play as a series of powerful heroes in different time periods and must embark on a mission to save the world from whatever threat exists at that point in time. The twist? It's only 30 seconds till the world is destroyed and only the Time Goddess can turn back time and let you survive - but only if you pay her.This sets the stage for one of the most crazy fast-paced RPGs ever made, and while it felt somewhat repetitive in the original game, The Second Coming turns it up to 11 with a huge cast of characters, eargasmic music from the greatest video game composers to ever grace the planet, and even a giant mecha-slash-castle that serves as a home base AND a robotic monster slaying machne.Very few games have used many heroes across time before, but when they do, they seem to pull it off very well. Just look at Live A Live. This game is no exception and the story keeps on getting better as the game progresses.That's not to say this game isn't flawed, far from it. The missions can still be a little repetitious as the game goes on, and the story, while fun, won't win any awards for best writing (though it may hit you in the feels). But as a sum of its parts, it's a glorious homage to old school RPGs while not getting bogged down with old school gameplay and being original enough to do its own thing."

All of the characters are flat, 1 dimensional and uninspired (which would not have been a problem in the original).The parody, jokes and 4th wall humour are much less and almost absent, making this game feel really empty compared to the first one.I tried to like this game but just couldn't.

Actually anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes in practice but it still has the ""Wario Ware roleplaying game"" feel about it.What's kind of interesting and ambitious is that the nature of the parody is naturally running a little dry, so the game doesn't sell itself strictly on its core gimmick anymore. That was a very smart move on the developer's part, in my opinion. It doesn't strictly feel like a series of action levels emulating an RPG this time around. This game is actually a true RPG as well. You explore, grind on enemies, search for collectables, all that good stuff. Just that the original game's arcadey gameplay is the meat of the story segments and are replayable in much the same way (with the ability to turn off the advantage the RPG-side of the game offers). The story is a bit more substantial and the characters have a more coherent and central role, with the ability to set your own party and no restrictions on equipment. It's not quite as *overtly* silly as the original game, it takes itself a bit more seriously -- but not by a whole lot. A defining silly moment for me is when one of the protagonists goes inside a virtual boy game and inside the game you have to use a controller to clear a path. Trippy.There aren't other gameplay modes besides the standard this time, but those were kinda weak additions to the original game in the first place. Instead you play through different protagonists across time and each story has a distinctly different tone or feel, ranging from deadly serious to a lighthearted Chrono Trigger-style affair. The best part to me has to be the expanded multiplayer functions  -- you can play any of the protagonists! -- and the ability to make your story maps. Being able to share through the steam workshop is a plus too. The interface is a lot better and it's a much more natural PC port than the original and doesn't suffer the same shortcomings i.e. the lag, bugs and cut features.It's a great sequel and consider it strongly recommended if you enjoy the original. The story has a lot of continuity and connection to the original, a really surprising degree. I'd recommend trying out the original game to really feel some of that impact, but it's far from required to enjoy the whole thing."

The writing was minimal and charming.This game is the exact opposite. People talk too much, and what they say is insipid, cliched, stereotypical anime writing.There are additional features which come off as ridiculous, like party members, unlockable skills and riding a moving castle. I say they are ridiculous because none of them seem to affect the gameplay in any substantial way whatsoever. The gameplay is still running around the map quickly and knowing what your objectives are.I think if you have mediocre taste due to watching bad anime, and you are desperate for any JRPG, you will enjoy this.

Trust me >_>Unfortunately, this port leaves unchanged what I felt was one of the greatest flaws of the PSP version, which is that the time trial mode doesn't limit equipment you can use in any meaningful fashion. This makes the mode extremely boring (having OP equipment makes most stages complete jokes), which is a shame; trying to get better and better times on each stage is what made the first game awesome.Furthermore, the translation is... questionable at best. Much of the original characters' charm is gone (for instance, there's a character whose entire shtick is that she tries to act dignified, winds up getting angered by something, and then tries to switch back to formal speech as if nothing had happened; in the translation, she never acts dignified, barely sounds like she's getting mad, and then says ""Yes, I would."" Yes, I would have liked her to be localized better); literally translated names make puns unintelligible (""Yuusha"" literally means ""hero""... Why leave this untranslated? And there's one character whose name is a shortened version of his name in the previous game, but the names in the translation are completely different!); and ""Ojisama"" was translated as ""Geezer,"" which makes me cry.I realize I've been mostly negative, so let me say again: the core gameplay is still solid. If you treat it as a JPRG with a time-limit twist, you'll be in love. But after how superb the localization of the first game was, and how addicting and satisfying it was to solve the puzzles that were the individual level runs in the original, it's a shame to see the ball dropped so... thoroughly."

Other times they hardly change the formula and are just an updated version. Others blow the original right out of the water and make you remember them more than anything else (example: Assassins Creed 2)I feel that Half Minute Hero 2 does just that. Adding more to do than just the story missions, easier ways to replay levels, and giving players a way to get a leg up in the next missions, rewarding them in a way for playing and exploring the world for the hidden goodies. Oh and that you don't have to replay a mission to go BUY stuff you missed is nice.Though this time the story is clearly the important part, which is more than fine by me. I just wish it was a bit more self aware than it is, more like HMH1, but that said, I DO love the world, characters and story enough so it doesn't bother me too much.So if you wanted a bit more meat than what Half Minute Hero One did, Half Minute Hero Two gives you a steak instead of BBQ Ribs.10/10 would pay goddess gold to reset time again... and again... and again!"

I have to give it an 8.5, I had a lot of fun even when I completed the game."

(With quite a bit of hilarous narrative too!)I HIGHLY recommend you play it, and play the first one first, since it can give you a good idea of what it is."

It has not only a deep difficulty curve but also a sense of panic as you are getting close to the wire. Only having 30 seconds to decide how to get from area to area. Which path is yours? Will you be able to kill enough? Will you have enough gold for the damnable greedy Time Godess? It all comes down to you in 30 seconds. Good luck. I very much recomened this game.

It even remembers to add that dash of epicness that just makes the whole thing a masterpiece. Wonderful game."
,Recommended,240970,29955892,Posted: 15 February,all,Flat Chests Incorporated ©,"Fun, fast-paced game with a story that makes fun of itself. The game can be flawed on it's repetitive nature, but the puns and the gameplay make it seem all but repetitive.The simple fact that the game acknowledges this fact by making fun of itself multiple times during 4th wall-breaking moments makes it enough to laugh at this fact.If you don't screw up too much, you should be able to finish the game just in under 30 Seconds.gettitActually it's something along the lines of 7-10 hours.The multiplayer aspect of the game however is completelly dead, as this game is getting old.

This is suppose to be a fast pace game but it is bloated with a lot of dialogue that aren't even that good the whole game felt like a chore.They don't even make fun of the characters archetype or the story itself. The story is something that is commonly seen that doesn't have a unique twist and the way they portray the revenge story was poorly written and the messages it conveys is terrible and the story lack a cohesive direction.Overall, half minute hero 1 had more variety of activities and deconstructs jrpg better."
76561198063920595,Recommended,240970,34117416,Posted: 8 August,all,Egres122,"Just gonna copy and paste my review of the first game since it is essentially the same thing with an expansion of the story and some mechanics:Probably one of the most intriguing games I have ever played merely because before I played it, I had gone a tirade on how grinding mechanics in single player, story driven RPGs is a sign of bad pacing and should be removed from them. Naturally of course this is a single player, story driven RPG where grinding is THE ENTIRE POINT of the game and makes it of the best paced RPGs I have ever played. I mean, it's genius. Just take a story of a JRPG, have the combat system be the most optimal move auto-spammed endlessly (like a usual turned based RPG for grinding), and have the combat speed multiplied by 60. Then BAM! You take what would have been an half hour grinding in a dungeon in a regular RPG is turned into a half minute race against the clock to beat the boss. I suppose on that point it is less of an RPG and more of a puzzle game, where you attempt to find the most optimal way to grind and beat the boss in 30 seconds. Probably one of the best examples of good pacing in an RPG, with strangely enough the most grinding in any RPG ever (since time is relative)."

This game is like the first although you can level up a bit outside levels so its a lot more forgiving and enjoyable for a larger group of people. The characters are also so amusing. Athena especially gives some good laughs if you cross her. There is an achievement for the more hardcore player that will add some extra hours of amusement or pain depending how you work. Honestly I can't think of anything I disliked about this game."
