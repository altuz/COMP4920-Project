It was a game that asked you to, for example, toast some breads using bombs, lasers, switches, conveyor belts, etc, in a Rube Goldberg style. The idea was novel and the game contributed to hours and hours of fun, even though I was too young to understand much of it.Then few years later, another similar game calledThe Incredible Toon Machinecame out, which from what I remember, added a few animals like Al the cat and Sid the mouse. It was not officially part of the series; everything looked more cartoonish, but I still spent even more hours blowing stuff up. I was older (therefore wiser), and it was still in the 90s.Toon Machine was the last game in the series I played. Fans like me have waited many, many years for a remake of this classic game. Imagine my joy when I saw Contraption Maker on Steam, made by none other than the creators of the original TIM.The game itself has over 100 official puzzles, not to mention the plethora of user-made puzzles on Steam Workshop. The developer continues to update the game with new stuff, and the puzzles are challenging. They may seem easy in the beginning, but as you go through them, especially in the medium and hard section, you may find yourself pulling your hair when you cannot toast those breads after 20 tries.In short,* if you had playedThe Incredible Machineand loved it, you will very easily love Contraption Maker.* if you (god forbid) had not played or heard of TIM before, but for some reason you like toasting breads with bombs and lasers, you will very easily love Contraption Maker.* if you had not played or heard of TIM before, and don't like Rube Goldberg machine, then I regret to tell you that you are missing out the fun and want to thank you for reading my review anyway.[/list]As an extra motivation, you will get two copies when you buy now. Give it to your buddy and let them toast some breads!With bombs and lasers!"

Electronic Arts was still the young Anakin Skywalker of gaming, not yet the Darth Vader of corporate exploitation and greed.  You had to learn DOS, to manage your EMS and XMS, and to properly set the jumpers of your sound card (if you had one) to match the IRQ settings in your config.sys.  And your 150 MB hard drive had more space than you could ever fill.In those days I played ""The Incredible Machine.""  And it was.  Incredible, that is.  One of the earliest sandbox games, it gave us a canvas for infinite creativity that was loaded with personality and possibility.  Then they made some more of them.  Then TIM just sort of disappeared.Now it's back.  And even though the game is no longer (capital i) Incredible, it's still just as incredible.  So if you loved the early 1990s original, buying this should be a given.  If you're too young, or just weren't paying attention, and missed The Incredible Machine, do yourself a favor and buy Contraption Maker anyway.  It's a great time to jump in.  It's a puzzle game for people who don't like puzzle games, as well as those who do.  It's great for young children, older children, and very, very old children (i.e. ""adults"").  It's an exercise in creativity without a point, just creativity for its own sake.Here's the basic premise:You normally [do X mundane, manual task] with [Y amount of effort] in [Z amount of time].  If C = Coolness, completing tasks the normal way would be C/100.  But if you could automate [X task] by spending Y+E amount of Effort in Z*1,000 amount of time, would C go through the roof!?  Yes!  It WOULD!  So if X = ""turn on a flashlight,"" Y = ""press a switch,"" Z = 0.25 seconds, and C = 0.1 (which is to say ""hardly cool at all"")... well, let's just say by adding a mouse, a bowling ball, a laser, some rubber bands, a hundred feet of pipe, and a boxing glove you can make turning on a flashlight the coolest thing you'll do all week."

SO MUCH YES.The Incredible Machine is a physics puzzle game. It's not just just any physics puzzle game, though; it was the first! Before Scribblenauts, before World of Goo, before Garry's Mod, even before all those crazy flash games on Newgrounds, it was The Incredible Machine that let gamers discover the joy of physics sandbox chaos. Many hours of fun were had feeding tiny children to alligators and dropping huge piles of cats onto trampolines. The puzzles themselves were sublime, teaching foresight and out-of-the-box thinking in ways that were unheard of at the time. I'd go so far as to say that The Incredible Machine 3 is probably my top pick for best puzzle game of all time.There have been clones and copycats over the years with varying levels of quality (Bad Rats, anyone?), but now you don't have to settle for imitations! This is the same game as it was 20 years ago, only with a new name and a fresh coat of HD paint it so greatly deserved. All the old machine parts are back, puzzle size and complexity is UNLIMITED, and Steam Workshop integration means that the world can see the puzzles you make (rather than just whatever friends or family you could trick into playing your custom puzzle). The music is almost as good as the old soundtracks, and just try not to shed a tear of nostalgia when you clear a puzzle and hear ""whew!""The interface still has some annoying kinks to work out, and some of the animal animations are atrociously ugly, but overall this is an amazing effort and deserves the time and attention of any puzzle gamers, especially those who enjoy programming-style games.I'll tell you what, I'm really loving this fad of ridiculously old puzzle games being brought back by their original creators. So besides this, we now have Chip's Challenge back as Chuck's Challenge, DROD is still going strong, Shadowgate just got a modern remake... what's next? Boulder Dash? LaserTank? Dr. Brain? ...Oh my god, Dr. Brain. Somebody please bring Dr. Brain back. Get a kickstarter going or something. Now. I'm serious."

This was on sale for only a quid, so I took a chance on it. I was amazed at its quality: The music is great, the mechanics were excellent, the UI is nicely designed and the graphics are nice as well. I was shocked, I did not expect this game to be good.I then looked up the company who made it and it all made sense. They're the same people who made ""The Incredible Machine"" in the first place! I was so impressed by how good this game is that I picked up another 5 copies to give to people in the future. I really, really hope they do a big DLC. They do free updates, but I'd be more than willing to pay money for a lot more puzzles. Not even new components, just new puzzles would be fine.Steam workshop integration is a huge bonus and means that you never really run out of levels anyway - I just prefer official ones as they're more consistent in difficulty and quality. Achievement integration would be hugely appreciated as well, this game has potential to use achievements in the way they were intended: For doing crazy things which the game doesn't actually require you to do at all.Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone."

So I decided to pick it as soon as it is on a sale (basically because I doubted the quality of the game. The mechanics are old and trusted but still... I was affraid to see a soulless clone). Happily, this one brought me a crazy level of excitement and (even!) laughings!The game is awesome and catchy. Once I laucnhed it to test for a while, I realised I have played like 80 minutes or something. And Contraption Maker didn't bore me at all. The missions are set in a very clever way, so each one is a bit harder then the previous, but not too much. You actually learn to play it step by step.The puzzles are interesting and (the main thing!) really really different. I guess their puzzle designer is a nice guy with a good sense of humor. Besided, every puzzle has some kind of a plot, so you even start to sympathyse some characters (My fav is Waldo, what a gorgeous cat!).The game is simple and exciting, it is very light and kind, reminds me the most childish looney tunes cartoons. The music is awesome, and the controls are very intuitive. The only thing I noticed is a small little difference between designs of some elements and characters, but that's not a problem at all, just noticed.I've picked it for 0.99 on a sale and even recieved an extra copy to give some of my friends. I believe it would be an awesome present.Hardly recommended. If you are lucky to see it on a huge sale, take it without any doubt. I am not a fan of puzzle games, but this one is awesome even for people like me."

Contraption maker not only modernizes what was already an outstanding concept, but expands on it even further. The puzzles that were presented have been challenging, but fair all the way through. The developers say you'll find those big ""aha!"" moments while thinking through each contraption instead of relying on pixel perfect placement solutions, and they are absolutely right. This is a puzzle game done exceptionally well, and with the ever present make mode there is so much more you can create. This is a perfect game for veterans of Incredible Machine and newcomers alike; if you enjoy Rube Goldberg inspired puzzles and wacky contraptions then you will fall in love with this game easily.These are just personal suggestions myself, but I believe if Contraption Maker were to add more content in the future, I would highly suggest some things like a wacky voice over guy like in the original installments, as well as include the music from the older games, such as Return of the Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions."

Even in its Alpha state, the game already has tons of building parts, many of them from the legacy The Incredible Machine series (also developed by the awesome team that made this!), and a few new ones, too.Some parts are still lacking proper art, but that's not something you should worry about - Contraption Maker is still in development, and many things in game can't be considered 'final'. Moreover, I think the developers have stated that skinning support will be available at some point in the future. Anyway, it is at gameplay that this title really excels! Playing with explosives, blimps and even alligators is completely safe here, not to mention plenty of fun. :)The new Alpha releases have brought a significant amount of content to the game, since the first one. New parts, bug fixes, some amazing pieces of soundtrack (which is great, as the original The Incredible Machine had excellent tunes) and even a working multiplayer mode! I see lots of potential here.All in all, would I recommend this game? Heck, yes! This is the kind of game I'd want my own kids to enjoy.Well, maybe if you really HATE puzzles and Rube-Goldberg machines you should stay away from this.

Besides, a two for one!? That's great.For me the puzzles didn't get challenging until hard difficulty. Perhaps I was younger, however, I remember The Incredible Machine puzzles being much harder. Therefore, the previous difficulties seemed to just take time to put the pieces in place.Play time included about 8-9 hours for me to finish all the official puzzles. Played some of the Editor's Choice community mods and puzzles. There certainly is much more content if you factor in the community puzzles. However, one challenge is that the game fails to keep a progress of what community puzzles you've solved--unlike the official puzzles.With all that said, it's a great game, and I recommend it. Perhaps a 8/10. Support the developers if you'd like to see more of these types of options.Certainly have some fond memories of The Incredible Machine, so I'm pleased to see this released!"

Nearly everything from TIM2 (or 3.0, etc) is there, featuring an interface that'll be second nature to any old veterans of the game.  It also adds in a few new parts here and there that take better advantage of a more robust physics engine and some graphical and design improvements you'd expect for a modern version of an older game.Definitely worthwhile for any fan of the TIM series.

Hours of my tutelage in the basement computer lab of my school were spent in blissful abandon playing that wonder of a game, comparing my elaborate constructions to my equally-enthralled pubescent minds, We were gods of all creation, and in our experimentation bonds of eternal friendship were erected alongside the craziest, most Goldbergian of useless designs. It was a fire of friendship that flared, roared, and fizzled away as we slowly grew apart.Now, in my twenties, apart from those pre-pubescent paragons of pointless perfection, the fire has been rekindled. This game is whimsical and childish enough to make you remember those happier childhood days without pandering to you.

One I do miss was the monkey on the bike where you pull the shade down revealing a banana then it would start pedaling, which is similar to one of the new items in this game, but without the ability to cancel the pedaling by impact i.e. dropping a cannonball on the monkey's head.tl;drI bought this game for $1.50 and it came with 2 copies.Puzzles were enjoyable but not very challenging.Replayability relies on the community as far as I can tell.7/10 (+2 Price, +2 Enjoyable, +1 Nostalgia, +1 Removed the pointless score system TIM had, +1 Ability to share puzzles with community)"

Game is great for kids and the child within us all plus I got a free copy for a freind. Game includes a sandbox mode where you can create your own stuff and share it with the world. Couldn't ask for more 10/10.
,Recommended,241240,11132347,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,Ronald Brain,"Contraption Maker really met my expectation - definitely worth the purchase especially I get an extra copy to share to friends.Quick facts for those too lazy to read on:+ TIM's successor with upgraded engine and physic+ Lots of new stuff to play with (parts, scenery...)+ Make mode for custom puzzle creation+ Steam Workshop (Share your own / play community's puzzles)+ 2-key pack (Great for gifting friends / do giveaway event)+ New content still coming everyone once in a while- Not working properly on small screen (Laptop users may find this bothersome)- Drag 'n drop replaced Click 'n drop, needs time to get used toNow it's full review (WARNING: Wall of text up ahead!)For those who are new to the party, Contraption Maker is your Rube Goldberg puzzle games - you are given some parts to fill up in the contraption to achieve specific goal(s), and it's up to you to work out how they connect with each other. Tutorial levels are a good start to get to know all the parts, and the puzzles get harder and harder (and trickier) as you play through Easy, Normal and Hard. The best part of CM, just like original T.I.M, is that you can create your own puzzle / contraption, and with Steam Workshop, you can even publish them for other players to play. Community work will definitely keep this game long live even if the developers stop updating. One more thing, unofficially, you are even allowed to texture/sound mod CM to your heart's content (Though, part's physical won't change, just their appearance). I've heard that the developers intend to make it Steam Workshop friendly in the future, so custom skins are another new thing we could expect.Contraption Maker hasn't changed much comparing to The Incredible Machine - if you love T.I.M, you will love CM as well because they are quite similar, and CM is made even better with new parts, physics and interface, something you definitely can't find with $15 for 2 copies pack. Of course there are some changes and tweak there and now (Such as you now have to drag 'n' drop parts and click on them to see additional options), but I guess we can get used to it in no time.Given that CM has just left Early access, there are still some problems with minority user bases (me included, which is why I will state here). This game will not work properly on small monitor (Under 1280 x 720), so if you are using ancient LCD like me now, wait till you get a bigger one first. As mentioned, the change from drag 'n' drop parts and click on them for additional options can be a little annoying when building contraption / puzzle - if you won't zoom in, you may not be able to select the part you want to as the game just lock to whatever part near it instead. Finally, there are still some issue publishing contraption / puzzle to Workshop - unfortunately, a single ""Failed"" messenger won't help you much, you'd have to play around with your invention until it gets accepted, quite frustrating.However, despite all these minor setbacks, Contraption Maker is still a very good puzzle game, whether you are T.I.M fan or not. Especially recommended for those who likes to play with friends, and Multiplayer Online is a great feature as well.Update: 2-pack offer is back, stated deep in the description so you may miss it. You can now get an extra copy for your friends like in 1.0 release.Update #2: After a rather random recommendation on discussion forum, I never thought the devs actually put back the ""Contraption Maker is a 2-copies pack - send the extra copy to your friends"" at the Purchase window. This just shows how much they actually care about the game and us customers :DUpdate #3: Those who keeps whining for Achievements, they are out NOW, so if you still refuse to buy Contraption Maker, I really can't think of anything to convince you guys further - come on, give the devs some support, really!"

I used to have a game called ""The Incredible Machine"" on my old Pentium 90 (!!) many years ago. It was like a 'crazy inventor' contraption maker sandbox/puzzle game. In it, you solved puzzles along the lines of putting some cheese down to attract a mouse to move along a platform with a hole in it, just before the cheese. Just before it could reach the cheese, the said mouse would fall down the hole onto a switch wuich turned on a fan pointing at a ball perched right at the end of a platform. The fan would blow the ball onto a trampoline placed just underneath that platform. The ball would then bounce up off the trampoline to trigger another switch which, when triggered, would activate a conveyor belt with a lit candle on it. Just above the end of the conveyor belt was a rocket, which as soon as the candle reached the end of the conveyor belt, it would light the rocket's fuse and the rocket would take off, thereby solving the puzzle (phew!).At the beginning of the level though, some of the above mentioned components would be missing and it would be up to you to choose the objects and place them in the right places to get the contraption to work properly and fire off the rocket. That was just one example of many puzzles, getting more complex and using more and more varied parts to make up some quite involved and ingenious contraptions.This is the successor to that game, made by the same developers. Contraption Maker Is one of the cleverest and ingenious puzzle games out there. It also has a sandbox, as well as the pre-made puzzle levels, where you can make up your own weird and wonderful contraptions using as many varied and different objects as you like, making them as convoluted and complicated as you like. You can then upload them for other users to try and solve, giving this game almost infinite replayability.They've even just added a multiplayer mode and as this is still a work in progress, there are even more features bound to be added. At the current price, this game is a steal!If you are a puzzle game fan, buying this is a no brainer and is up there with the best of the genre and yes that includes Portal 1 and 2 providing you can overlook the fact that Portal was 3D whereas this is in 2D - now there's an idea for a sequel; a 3D Contraption Maker! As it stands though, it will run on even the most modest of PC's.I can recommend this game without hesitation. So what are you waiting for?"

Aw man, I always wanted to play that when I was young!""In short, Contraption Maker is a puzzle game about making Rube Goldberg-type machines to solve some sort of problem. Put the basketball in the box, get the tool guy home safely, feed the dog, break the lamp, fire the rocket. Simple enough, right?Well, it falls into one of the problems you typically run into when making a sandbox puzzle game: Each puzzle typically has either one blindingly obvious solution, because all of the other possibilities have been prevented at great effort, or it has several solutions, each more convoluted than the last, and the player is likely to come up with a solution which is radically different from what the puzzle designer intended. Often a solution which doesn't resemble the intended one, and which typically doesn't use most of the parts made available, or which exploits something the designers never considered.All fine and good, right? The whole point of games like this is to come up with a creative solution. The game even includes a video recording feature so that you can make a video of your favorite solutions and upload them to Youtube.Well, except that sometimes the ""solution"" is not entirely clear, and because of this, the player may end up spending time solving the puzzle only to find out that what they thought was a ""solved"" state is... not? And there aren't any hints of any sort available in-game to help guide players towards the expected goal.I play puzzle games for the sense of accomplishment I get when I figure something out. Or to learn new tricks when I'm forced to give up and check what the ""official"" solution was supposed to be. After completing most of the puzzles in this game, I never once got that sense of satisfaction. I always felt like I was fighting against the puzzle designers, not figuring things out on my own, and as a result I found myself more and more prone to using cheap tricks and underhanded techniques to bypass what the puzzle designer no doubt thought would be clever contraptions. I viewed playing the game as less ""What's the next puzzle I get to solve?"" and more ""Well, I paid the money for it, I should probably finish it.""Finally, of course, I mentioned inexact objectives and that I only finished most of the levels? Well I ran into one level in particular which stated a fairly simple goal(put a pair of jack-o-lanterns in a cardboard box), but upon completing the objective, I found that the simulation continued running, refusing to give me credit for solving the puzzle. There's also one puzzle I was only able to solve using a glitch in the physics engine, and consiquentially my solution worked exactly once and was not reproducible(since each simulation run is subject to some randomness). I've come to expect a higher level of quality from the free puzzle games I play, let alone the ones that I'm willing to lay down cash for. Physics glitches should never be valid solutions.Also one of the songs sounds like an old west saloon remix of Maralyn Manson's ""The Beautiful People,"" which I thought was hilarious."

The puzzles start with a few contraptions in place and you have to fill in the gaps from the range of contraptions provided.

,Recommended,241240,16149549,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,sarysa,"This is definitely one of those ""guilty pleasures"" types of games. The graphics are pretty childish, along with most of the tracks, and yet the non-rigid puzzle design of the main game alone is pretty entertaining and addictive. There are a lot, and I mean a LOT of maps where you can ""cheat"" a solution with 3-4 pieces, most of the time exploiting the physics when a prop lands on the diagonal surface of another prop you place. Doing things the ""right way"" is its own fun, but there's a certain thrill that comes when you realize you broke the intended sequence -- and I have no doubt the devs left these in for two reasons. #1: Those ""aha"" and ""take that, game!"" moments are both equally enjoyable at the right time, but also #2: the main emphasis is on the creator (I think I got 4 popups suggesting I go there before they just gave up), and allowing players to think outside the box trains the player to fully utilize the creator when they're ready to move away from the puzzles.In any case, it's a goofy little Rube Goldberg device creator that's family friendly, and a nice little time killer. At the very least, pick it up for its uniqueness. My only complaint is the music gets repetitive after awhile, though it's definitely a nice throwback to comic tunes that could've easily existed in Rube Goldberg's era."

Too bad it is way overpriced in my opinion - get it from a sale. The game itself has quite user-friendly learning curve and puzzles get progressively harder. Even though many puzzles have repetitive elements the game is good for casual clicking and the harder levels make you think about applying for physics major or engineering studies (god forbid). I personally don't find (as a physics major, doh) patience to play harder levels for extended periods, but that might be just me. Luckily the levels ain't too bad so you will figure them out sooner or later.This game (as it's predecessors) has it's value in teaching concept of the cause and the effect. In that sense the game has potential not only to give fun moments for a casual gamer, but to be utilized for teaching children common sense and predicting how systems work. There's a tip for you Steam-parents! Oh, and drop a copy for your the most bestest parent-friends so their younlings can argue about the best ways to turn on the toaster.Tl;dr: Great old puzzle game from the past with hours fun (and agony) figuring out everyday problems.

,Recommended,241240,23115270,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,Techbane,"I bought this in 2013. Where does the time go? Probably the same place as the original Incredible Machine series, but oh well.So now that it's actually had time to come together, I can safely say this is the new, proper successor to The Incredible Machine. Parts abound, the new physics engine feels more realistic, and a bundle of new parts and part interactions means all sorts of interesting new puzzle opportunities. Vertically oriented scissors! Tie ropes to a bunch of stuff you couldn't before, including platforms used to precariously balance other objects! Create a recursive assembly line with part manufacture and disposal points! Expand the playing field to a theoretically infinite size, and build as much as you want! It's a real gem, and I regret putting it off for this long after the first phase of Early Access felt so chintzy.In some ways it does still feel oddly chintzy. The aesthetic of many of the parts very much rides the razor's edge between ""smoothly designed"" and ""cheap looking"", and some of them seem to have a terrifying size disparity. The interface screams ""mobile game"", even though it's PC-only. Some part interactions still feel like they're completely missing sound effects. You'll get a popup asking if you want to follow their Twitter. There are typos in the news on the title screen. There are visual bugs here and there, and the Camera Animation Tool is, while clever for presentation, one of the most infuriatingly buggy tools I've worked with.But you know what? It isthebest game yet for making some got-dang Rube Goldberg goodness, and it's criminally cheap to boot. Some of the golden standouts of the 80's and 90's are really finding new footing again, and this is one of 'em."

If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the art style is rather off-putting and at times it even confuses me, to the point where I can't tell what I'm looking at (which is horrible, because the original games were designed so that you could understand what most of the objects did by looking at them). Secondly, while I don't necessarily think the original games had amazing music, the music they have here is rather bland at best, to annoying at worst.But obviously I wouldn't be giving this a thumbs up if I didn't think it was worth it. Compared to all the contemporaries that have cropped up in recent years, Contraption Maker is a wonderful return to form for a series that has long been neglected. The game mechanics are good, the interface takes a bit of getting used to for a TIM veteran but I've grown to like it.If there was a way to create custom assets and different music libraries for this game, I would be glad, because virtually everything besides the underlying mechanics sort've lets this whole package down in a way. Not enough for me to hate it, per se, but I think the difference here is that I can play the old TIM games for hours on end, whereas this game I need to pause every now and then and wash my eyes."

Long story short if you dont run a 64-bit build of Linux, 64 still being the minority in the Linux world due to it not being as necessary, nothing will be downloaded and the game will in turn not launch. They have no plans to fix this so if you have been screwed over get your steam refund while you still can. There have also been a number of launch issues on other platforms in which the team has no longer proactive in fixing.Beyond this there are still a number of TIM gadgets from the newer games that are missing.My best advice is track down a copy of TIM: Even More Contraptions instead, the team seams to have really bitten off more than they could chew with Contraption Maker."

Yes, I see that the electric plugs connect automatically, and the wals and conveyor belts dont snap to huge squares any more, but whether that is an improvement seems ambiguous to me. No way to really edit anything substantial in the workshop has been demonstrated. Joins of different types of walls (or simply two pieces of wall) are not implemented (the original game's joins were absolutely spectacular)in short, the graphics right now are worse than the windows release of Incredible machine, and other sprite games of the period, for example Creatures 3. Looks more like something that would be on an iPad with microtransactions, such as Mega Jump. Perhaps the gameplay will be gradually expanded, but so far between the inferior graphics, the iffy controls, and the unnecessarily free positioning, I recomend the original over this.

Did you spend hours and hours in the puzzle editor trying to make ever more elaborate puzzles to stump your siblings and/or friends?  Good news, then: they may be calling this a ""spiritual sequel"" to the original, but this isn't justlikeTIM -- it is almost EXACTLY the same game. Which, in case it wasn't already clear, is a good thing.For those unfamiliar with the original, read some of the other reviews that are already here (tl;dr -- Rube Goldberg machine builder). They made a few changes in the decade or so since the old games, but they're all pretty much quality-of-life adjustments. The graphics have been updated, the physics engine seems to be more sophisticated, and the interface is far more user-friendly (electrical cords visibly auto-attach to nearby outlets, lasers have an indicator while you move them around so you don't have to keep turning your machine on and off to find out where they're pointing, and light/wind sources similarly show you how far they extend).More importantly, almost all of the parts from the old games made it in, and they've added some new ones! A timed laser repeater and a beam splitter for even more elaborate laser mazes, physics-enabled domino blocks, and a programmable ""part creator"" that spits out a stream of objects and will probably result in endless absurd shenanigans. Oh, and an egg. The egg is important. (Also, they've released free Halloween and Christmas updates with new parts!)Finally, the addition of community content naturally means that you have access to tons more puzzles than there ever were in the original games.This is just one of those classic games that makes perfect sense to update for the current generation, taking advantage of better computer hardware and Steam's platform for sharing player-created content. An old favorite that's even better than it used to be. Totally worthwhile."

,Recommended,241240,21431309,"Posted: 24 February, 2016",all,Loerwyn,"This really is like the old Incredible Machines games, even down to the selection of parts in many of the puzzles. It follows the same logic (or arguably lack thereof in some cases), and does encourage you to draw on knowledge from various areas, such as mixing primary colours. This allows it to work well for both adults and children alike, and I suspect its target is children supervised by parents for help with the harder puzzles. And trust me, there are ones even adults will likely have a head-scratch over (I know I have at times!).My only real gripes are that the controls are a little iffy, particularly with placing parts. The menus around items are not context-sensitive so it can get frustrating when placing items in certain areas, as you can't access the menus properly - you have to rotate somewhere else before putting the part in, as an example - which means some puzzles require more clicks than they need simply because there's no allowance made for menus going off the screen. The game also does seem to hold your hand a little too long, with many of the first puzzles (even past the first 50) being a case of 'clone/mirror the other half of the screen' or 'fill the obvious blank', so it can get a little tiresome early on.But do continue.

Icons overlap, moving can be finnicky and annoying. For a game that's centrered around moving tools around, resizing and rotating them, I would expect a lot more effort to be done.The graphics/sound/music are mediocre. They work, but they are certainly lacking, for examply the legendary ""Sid and Al toons"" game was much better in that department.So I do recommend it, merely because I have a lot of fun playing with my son (5yo)."

If you want just have a fun, you can make stranke chain reactions on your own or with your friends.. If you are about to learn coding, its great also.. And if you are good at coding and you want to try something logical with object in 2D, this is (in my opinion) the best engine."

I'm especially impressed with what the community can create with it, with some very impressive designs being present.A fun game reccomendable to anybody creative."

,Not Recommended,241240,17147225,"Posted: 20 July, 2015",all,MPO,"Works exactly as advertised, but just wasn't satisfying.  Puzzles are more like trying to fix something that's got a ton of parts randomly taken out of it; in other words, more work than play.  The premise and reviews looked good, but I haven't played much of this in the last two years.  You might be disappointed."
