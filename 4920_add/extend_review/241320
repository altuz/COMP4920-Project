,Recommended,241320,7754654,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Cameraman,"This is one of the best puzzle games I've played. Thanks to some ingenius design, the puzzle's difficulty scales with you, but in a very natural way. You can choose to get all the items before completing the game, which will give you more options to solve each situation. But the game is designed that you can beat the game without all the items if you want an extra challenge. And if you, like me, want the extra extra challenge, there's optional puzzles and dungeons that will make you feel dumb for hours while you try everything, before you finally get your EUREKA moment, then you feel like the smartest person in the world.On top of the great game design, the charming art and writing is perfect bonus that ties the game all together.Highly recommended!!"

Once you've played it through once it may seem like the replay value isn't there, but beating the game with different combinations of tools and crunching your brain to figure out shortcuts makes it something I'll continue to come back to.  The master's cave makes the normal game seem like child's play as well.  The characters are quirky and fun, and if you've played any of the old Zelda series you'll get a kick out of the homages paid."
,Recommended,241320,32765983,Posted: 25 June,all,jimbotherisenclown,"This game feels short, but if you're the target audience, it's worth it. Basically, it's a shorter Zelda-like game with a good sense of humor and a willingness to poke fun at itself. It's also harder than Zelda, both in terms of the bosses and the puzzles. That's it, really - if those last two sentences didn't pique your interest, this probably isn't the game for you.This game won't change your life.There's not an insanely memorable story.Even the mechanics are mostly mechanics you've probably seen before.But this game IS fun.

I am SO GLAD I ended up finally buying Itlle Dew! Totally has a Wind Waker vibe visually, and plays like the original legend of zelda with a top down view, grottos with treasure, dungeons with bosses and a handful of key weapons that you need to progress. The puzzles are a perfect ratio of frustrating:gratifying and, the game has no lives/game over system which, for me, was very motivating. All you have to sit through when you run out of health is a seconds long die animation and then it's back to entrance of whatever room you are in- it really helps keep me in a puzzle solving mindframe instead of getting a wave of frustration that tempts my ""alt-f4"" impulse (or command-q for the angsty apple user).If you've considered buying this game, please buy it- especially if you derive any joy at all from the legend of zelda series.

76561198015125110,Recommended,241320,29889754,Posted: 12 February,all,DITW,"Preface: Be advised that this is not a ""Zelda clone"", but it does fall into the ""puzzle dungeon"" genre. It leans heavily into complex single-room puzzles with minimal combat. Contrast this with: Zelda's simpler, but multi-room puzzles, with casual-but-competent combat; and Darksiders' more refined combat and more focus on platforming.Novel and fresh take on an abused and neglected genre.Some highlights of particularly strong game design:* Each puzzle feels fresh. Particularly impressive given the amount of them* Comedic elements are light and witty, without trying to steal focus from the experience* Difficulty curve is smooth, with a good pacing of optional mini-puzzles along a parallel difficulty curve* At end of game, meaningful replay value in the form of multiple ""low %"" completion routes are made clear to the player* Optional end-dungeon ""Master Cave"" adds a new level of complexity to the fundamentals* Game intentionally avoids putting rewards in places that can be missed* No meaningful padding or filler, all content is quickly reachable from the center of the world* Death (though an extremely rare occurence as hazards are not the focus of the game) is not punishing, and just throws the player back at the start of the current room with minimal delay* I'll say it: better puzzle and dungeon design than any Zelda game. Puzzle elements are clearly identifiable, and multi-room puzzles are EXTREMELY rare (and when present, are simply that a room transition is one-way, which is always reasonably obvious)Some nitpicks to improve on:* Zelda Link to the Past has a superior melee attack, in that it hits in a wide arc. Ittle Dew's feels clunky in comparison. Thankfully, combat is not a focus for the vast majority of the game. But...* Final boss has a very ""twitch action-game"" phase when compared to the rest of the game, and thus unfairly gates players to completion by requiring a skillset they didn't sign up for, and the game didn't ramp them up to* ""Master Cave"" boss is devoid of puzzle elements entirely, and REALLY feels out of place in the game as a resultI would consider this game to be mandatory reference material for all developers in the ""puzzle dungeon"" genre."
,Recommended,241320,27906334,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Cannonaire,"I whole-heartedly recommend Ittle Dew. I have played it several times and I intend to come back to it more. It is well worth what you pay for it.Ittle Dew is a single-player game which at first glance is very similar to the old NES and SNES Zelda games. That is accurate, but there is a lot more to it.If you play for even a small amount of time, you will notice that Ittle Dew has a great irreverent style of humor which is enhanced by the lovable characters, and the mix of puzzle and combat gameplay suits it perfectly. There is very little fluff - by which I mean you will use the same puzzle elements over again, but in increasingly clever and novel ways. It is clear that the developers (Ludosity) took great care in crafting their game and distilling it down to a small, but densely packed experience that conveys constant quality.There are five boss fights in the game, of which three, including the final boss, are required to beat the main story. A fourth is required to gain all of the items. Each of the three dungeon bosses have specific mechanics which require you to use your new dungeon item as you have learned in the preceding area, creating a diverse experience that never gets tedious. There is also a fifth (tough) boss that is completely optional.Aside from the main story, there is an optional 'Master Cave' with twelve puzzles. They begin slightly more difficult than what you have done to beat the main story, but the difficulty ramps up quickly and some will leave you thinking for a long time before you can beat them. I was amazed at how clever some of the solutions were.If you haven't already, I recommend watching the trailer on the Steam Page - it will show you a good sample of the humor and puzzles you can expect."

The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating like some adventure games. The storyline is generic, but not boring. And the overall feel of Ittle Dew is quirky yet familiar. I enjoy that there is a female protagonist (Ittle Dew) and Tippsy is everything Navi wishes she could be.

My only problem with the game isit is a little short, but with the extra stuff and cards it is a game that pulls through. My final verdict is if you have theMoney, pick this game up and enjoy yourself. (And buy Card City Nights too, because this game is short.)"
,Recommended,241320,11199039,"Posted: 12 July, 2014",all,quaint folksy quicksand,"A very endearing, traditional but fresh action adventure.The gameplay is very Zelda with puzzle-heavy top-down rooms and palace-like dungeons for each tool you acquire. The tools are very different from what you'll find in Zelda games, though, and there's a lot of focus on having them interact with each other - one puzzle may have you freeze a block to let it slide across that spike wall and then freeze and teleport a bomb so its detonation syncs with you lighting a brazier.Be aware that it doesn't take long to finish the game, but its replay value is high because the path through the castle is nonlinear, there's a lot of optional treasure/puzzles, and extra-hard shortcuts encourage challenge and speedruns. The limited game length also means that a lot of effort could go into each individual room - nothing feels rushed, and the puzzles use available game mechanics to their fullest potential.Ittle Dew's strongest point of the game is the irreverent yet cute, self-aware humour. Quirky enemy design, expressive hand-drawn graphics and the music support the atmosphere very well.Combat is rather basic and more about approaching strategically or outsmarting enemies than about the actual process of beating them up, but still a nice diversion between puzzles.If you care about silly dialogue, clever puzzles and exploring different routes through the same dungeon, this is for you. If you like long, linear games with a focus on combat and are a dialogue-skipper or prefer serious storylines, you're looking in the wrong place though."

While it is ""a short game"" compared to games like ""Zelda"" and such, this game has a fun index that isn't quite matched, by not even Nintendo.  While the humor in this game is crude at times, it is still suitable for kids (even as young as 5, the rating says 10 but I can assure you this game is fine for a 5 year old)... while the difficulty level may make even the best gamers, frustrated at times.  This game is heavy on puzzles... there were a couple that left me scratching my head for a while."

It's well worth the cost.It is a puzzle game, so the puzzles and tools to solve them are incredibly important to the games success. The puzzles difficulty progresses pretty well through the game. When I hit a puzzle that took me hours to figure out, when I finally did finish, I usually felt pretty satisfied, as opposed to some puzzle games where you feel cheated (Or that the solution was unfair/obtuse for some reason). It's pretty clear when you can't do a puzzle, so you know to come back to it later. The shortcuts from if you already have other items felt very fair and that they were just a bonus for having already done other dungeons first.The dialog is great. It very often made me laugh, some of those times quite loudly.So yes, I would definitely recommend this game full heartedly."
,Recommended,241320,29995926,Posted: 17 February,all,NyappiCat,"You can tell that this is a game heavily inspired by the original Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past, but this game definitely has its own charm. Whereas the mandatory dungeons are of ranging difficulty levels and generally are neither too easy nor too difficult, the random caves you can collect cards from offer a higher degree of difficulty which is refreshing. I love that instead of being a silent character, Ittle has humorous insights and conversations with her equivalent to Link's Navi: Tippsie. It's also quite nice to see that the main character is female without it being an important feature or something that is overly emphasized to please a feminist audience, it's just a character that happens to be female who slays monsters and goes on adventures. Cool. Also, Tippsie offers advice when you want it rather than nagging you, which is a small but important detail. The music is great and suits the different environments in the game, and the graphics have a fun cartoon feel to them without making the game feel immature. Love it!"

,Not Recommended,241320,31609810,Posted: 7 May,all,EdgeNinja83,"I bought this game during the last Steam Summer Sale, and frankly, the fact that I paid anything at all for this rudimentary 'Zelda' parody makes me feel ripped off.'Ittle Dew' is a 2D overhead adventure game designed as a blatantly-obvious homage to 'A Link to the Past'. Maybe ""homage"" is the wrong word, since many aesthetic elements are lifted straight from 'ALTTP'. A fact evident just by looking at 'Ittle Dew's' protagonist. It's a wonder Nintendo never sued.While 'A Link to the Past' was a classic, fun, robust game that could hook first-time adventurers for dozens of hours, though, the world of 'Ittle Dew' is strangely barren. There's pretty much no story to speak of, zero character development. Combat is uninspired and suffers from hit detection issues when using certain weapons. Add to that, I managed to complete the game with every collectible in 7 hours on my first playthrough (that's IN SPITE of challening the secret extra cave). No multiplayer or DLC to extend the game's replay value either.Funny thing is, 'Ittle Dew' seems to know it's lame, as the title is replete with self-aware, self-deprecating humor. So in summary:Pros:- Handrawn art style beautiful in its simplicity- Ocassionally funny, self-aware dialogueCons:- Obscenely short length- No replay value (beyond a few Achievements)- No plot- Overeliance on block puzzles- Hit detection issuesConclusion: 'Ittle Dew' started out as a free game made using 'Game Maker', and that's how it should've stayed.

Most compare it to The Legend of Zelda (its even in the tags). But don't let that dissuade you from playing; it is anything but a cheap ripoff.This game puts you in place of a female adventurer named Ittle Dew, with her potion-aholic companion appropriately named Tippsie, as you crash land on an island. Your main goal is, of course, to find what secrets the island may hold. The game is humorous and cute in its old fashion, often giving you little quips of dialogue here and there.One unique thing about the game is the way it handles it puzzles; there are several ways to solve them with your different tools. As you progress through the game, you unlock more tools to help you solve previous puzzles. But you don't need all the tools to solve all the puzzles. If you're up for the challenge, that is.The game is quircky and fun. A fair length given its price. If you enjoy puzzle games, you'll enjoy this one. Fans of the Zelda series will fall right in."

The controls are pretty simple but, but still, give some basic explantion or better yet, let me customize them to what I prefer.regarding length: I am ~3 hour in as of this review; and am in the process of earning the last of 3 powerups in the game.based on that and how much of the map I have covered, I am guessing I am around 50+ % of the way thru the main gamethis may be a bit short for some folks, but I personally find it comparble to other puzzle/action games such as VVVVVV, portal      1/2, and escape goat 1/2. it is not the best value, but definatly reasonable for this type of game.it also has a lot of optional/bonus content; including in-game cards for all the NPCs, and a 'master's cave' with more challenging puzzles. so probably extend my estimate by at least another 3 hours or so."

If you don't know what that is, why aren't you off playing that right now?It also has some replay value in the alternative paths you can take to reach the final boss.  At first glance you will think every item is necessary and only obtainable in a fixed order, but with a little creativity taught over the course of playing you will realize any two are sufficient to finish and can be obtained out of order.  Taking these routes also requires solving optional puzzles which are more difficult than the default route.If you're a true sadomasochist (or chive completionist) you can try your hand at the Master Dungeon which is full of all the puzzles the devs had the sense not to put in the main quest.  Sadly the boss of this dungeon is the low point of the game as it requires brute force button mashing and luck instead of skill and ingenuity."

76561198018326356,Recommended,241320,30131758,Posted: 23 February,all,Lowenly,"A masterful parody of the 2D Legend of Zelda games, ittle Dew (lowercase i) takes the well-known item-based puzzle solving of the series and polishes it to a mirror shine, wrapped up in a cheerful and smoothly-animated art style, while layering on enjoyable helpings of wry wit as it pokes fun at traditional video game conventions.  Who keeps putting hearts into rocks, anyways?ittle Dew never wastes time and is built as tight as a drum.  There’s no sprawling overworld, no overly dramatic plot, and no tedious filler; it gets in, delivers the puzzles, and gets out before wearing out its welcome.  The game is comprised of three short item dungeons (which can be completed in any order), a dozen or so optional puzzle rooms, and a central non-linear castle that is revisited multiple times as the player gains more items.  A first run through the game is a casual five hours (more if going for all the secrets), and optional second-run challenges are also available for the minimalist and speedrunning players.The puzzles are a masterwork in this game, relying only on simple tasks (i.e. push a block onto a button) with simple rules (i.e. ice blocks slide until they hit something) that are easy to understand but take careful planning to execute.  Puzzles squeeze every bit of use out of all the items and mechanics presented; rarely will a player encounter the same type of puzzle twice, keeping the game fresh and interesting.  However, a warning:  while the game does give vague hints, some of the more complex item mechanics are never explicitly explained, occasionally leading to seemingly impossible tasks until trial and error leads to a eureka moment.  Fortunately, the worst of these are confined to the Master Dungeon, an optional end-game challenge for people who LIKE impossible tasks.If any nitpick could be made of the game, it would be that the enemies just feel sort of “there”; a necessary construct of the game’s Legend of Zelda roots, but ultimately little more than an annoyance that detract from the puzzle-solving focus of the game.  Common baddies move slowly, deal low damage, and are easily dispatched, while the three item dungeon bosses are largely uninspired, requiring simple puzzles to be solved while dodging their predictable attacks.  The final boss fortunately bucks this trend and is a frantic and satisfying exclamation point to the game."

A lot of the main game puzzles aren't too difficult especially since they're usually designed around 2 of the 3 items you can obtain within the game, and using all 3 items makes most of the puzzles trivial. Where the main game really shines is that you can choose to completely ignore the 3rd item and try to finish the game with 2 items, resulting in different puzzle scenarios and pathways you can take.The only problem that annoys me about this game though, is that some of the hardest puzzles require you to have quick reflexes and some luck in order for you to finish them. Fortunately, most of those puzzles are extra challenges and do not stand between you and the final boss."
