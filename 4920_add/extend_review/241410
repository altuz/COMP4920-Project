,Recommended,241410,811645,"Posted: 15 August, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"CastleStorm took be by surprise. If you ever played Swords & Soldiers, Angry Birds and any other tower defense game - and enjoyed them - CastleStorm is the game for you.What it basically comes down to, if you haven't played any of those games, is this:You're the good guy, you own the castle on the left (or right, depending on the mission). Your opponent owns the other, opposite, castle. You both own a ballista that can shoot about 9 or so different ammo types.The goal is usually to destroy the other castle. This can be done by shooting projectiles at it. Damage it enough and the physics will take over, destroying rooms in the process. These rooms are filled with troops, by the way. Destroy a room with a specific troop and your enemy can't summon those anymore.Troops can be send to help destroy the castle gate, after which they can then steal the flag. Capturing and returning a flag also results in victory. You can also send your troops to just distract your enemy.You also own a hero that can be spawned on the battlefield to slay the troops of your enemy. You can summon them for about 20 seconds; after that they disappear and you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can summon them again.Missions have secondary objectives, keeping the missions fun and varied, while also giving them replayability.Of course, a tower defense game isn't a tower defense game without upgrades. Thankfully, there are plenty of things to upgrade; projectiles, troops, heroes, spells, your castle, you name it.The sounds are funny and the textures are beautifully sharp and detailed. It's a gorgeous looking game, in its own way, of course. You can't compare it to, let's say, Crysis (obviously). That would just be silly... ...Like I said CastleStorm took me by surprise. It's been a long time since I had so much mindless fun with a game ♥[Rating: 85/100]"
,Recommended,241410,8427737,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,Bucchus,"Kind of like Swords & Soldiers (or other 2D lane pushers) but actually good. Pump out troops, cast spells, load the ballista with weird ammo and assume direct control of heroes to wipe the battlefield. The best bit is the artillery, lob stones to smash enemy spires to loose parts which then will hopefully crush the enemy army as they are leaving their castle. There are four factions (with DLC) with different troops/spells/artillery. You can either try to storm the enemy castle with troops, stealing their flag and bringing it home in a tug of war, or you can just simply smash the enemy castle with boulders until there's nothing left. It's just fun and the physics are meaty enough, who wouldn't enjoy breaking things? Lots of opportunity for amazing skillshots or stupid accidents when your ballista hits your own troops. You can also design your own castle, the room choices affect your troop loadout and bonuses.The four singleplayer campaigns were good enough, but when you enter multiplayer the game commits suicide. Local splitscreen can only be done in tiny windows, leaving lots of the screen unused and black. It was probably to preserve the FOV ratio but the end result is completely unappealing. Online multiplayer then is tied to playing ranked matchmaking, if you want to customize and upgrade your loadout playing with just friends doesn't earn you anything. I don't know why they went this way, did they expect to turn this into e-sports? Multiplayer seems quite dead even during sales...All in all a very enjoyable time, for some reason I'd compare it with Orcs Must Die even though it's a different type of defense game. The art, humour and design is somehow similar and very polished. There's a nice pile of content and game modes in the complete pack for singleplayer, however if you're interested only in multiplayer I'd say skip it and get something like King Arthur's Gold instead."
,Not Recommended,241410,9776292,"Posted: 9 April, 2014",all,Arod Snaux,"Thumbs SIDEWAYS... the single player campaign is a fun mashup between a tug-of-war, tower defense, and scroller rpg. You play to ear credits to level up skills and can even build your own castle. Eventually you get all stars on all maps, and all skills, and you are still left with an onsluaght-style game which is chaotic and challenging. Single player? Thumbs Up!Multiplayer however, is a seriously broken, unfun joke. You are given 20k credits. Once you spend them, they are gone - you cannot gain new skills, you cannot reset your 20k to buy different items... EVER.  Playing against friends? You gain no credits, so theres no reason to play with them.The only way to get new credits is to play ""ranked"" matches which pit you randomly against other players (level 1 vs level 100 anyone?)- and in ranked matches you cannot even choose your opponents, so forget about ever playing with friends.Multiplayer is horribly designed and very broken, slow and utterly fail, and unless you get this game at a steep discount, or dont mind playing by yourself, I'd say ""avoid"""

It's sometimes rare for a game that you start it and you don't want to quit it already after 10 minutes, because there is just something taken away your motivation. Actually, I would say that more than half of my library gives me this feeling not to continue playing after some minutes. But CastleStorm just does everything right you would expect from such an angry birds, Ballerburg, etc. mix. You can level up, the design is pretty, a lot of levels, you improve your skills, your tactics, etc... okay, the story part is redundant, but does not bother you further as you can easily skip it. So it is not annoying. I got the game for 5 EUR and I simply say, it has been the best 5 EUR I spent on this winter sale. I give it clearly 8 / 10 points and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys simple games with great ideas."

By keeping the gameplay simple and fun and injecting a good amount of humour, Zen have turned what is a very basic game that plays similarly to Angry Birds into a great title that keeps the player interested throughout. A great game worthy of your money."
,Recommended,241410,3538535,"Posted: 31 July, 2013",all,Kahmu,"My thoughts on Castlestorm:You'll be playing the good guy knight who's charged with the heroic task to defend the king's castle from the evil attackers. To do so, you're given four tools: an army, a ballista, yourself and the castle.Let's start with the castle editor. You'll be given a set of pre-made castles that you can use or edit, but you can also build your own castle from scratch. To do so, you have several rooms, each representing a certain kind of soldier or creature that may only be used in battle if its room has been built into your castle. More rooms are unlocked throughout the campaign, and you'll have some sctructures for visual und defensive purposes.During the campaign (or multiplayer) you can now use all those units whose room you've added to your building to fend off enemy units. The are knights, archers, birds and dragons, rock giants and other cool stuff to throw at your enemies gates. The stronger the unit the more expensive it is, so summoning the right amount of them and the right composition is crucial.Speaking of throwing: Your ballista does not only shoot arrows but can also be equipped with rocks to damage the enemy castle, rainbow farting sheeps, exploding apples and several other things to defend your gates. At some point I felt like the ballista was too strong of a weapon because if used correctly it can kill some of the most expensive units by itself.If things get harsh you can summon one of several heroes onto the battlefield, controlled by yourself, to slash through the enemy troops. After a certain amount time or once your hero dies you'll be back to shooting the ballista and summoning units.The game is won/lost, once an army has managed to either break into the opposing gate and steal the flag, or a castle has been destroyed to the point where no room is left and thus no units can be summoned anymore.Throughout the campaign you'll have some limitations, like you'll only be able to use the ballista, or you may only use soldiers, but that's as far as variety goes. There are some levels with a special boss, and some where you have to fulfill a certain task, but that's it.Each level gives you gold depending on how well you perform, and you'll get some extra gold if you could complete a challence like never miss an arrow, let the flag steal by a certain kind of unit and so on.Most of the time, there is nothing special though. What makes the game so addicting is the joy of hitting a headshot with your arrows, the fun dialogues between the levels and the several unlocks like new rooms or even a new race (is exactly the same but looks different).Graphics are good and so is the music. Okay game for killing some time, not good if you plan on playing it for more than two hours at once because most missions feel the same.Buy it when on sale!"

You get to send your army to capture the flag or even destroy the enemy's castle to win the match or round. Different items, castle layouts (you can even build your own, but it takes a bit of a learning process), and upgrades will be available to better suit strategies towards victory against the Vikings. (Let me axe you something!)The pinball equivalent on FX 2 is really good as well."

Customize your castle.-Most quests can be won either by castle destruction or flag capturing.-Support your troops by firing on the enemy troops instead of the castle, juggling priorities on the fly.-Multiplayer; online, local, vs xbox, and in several different modes.-9 upgradable troop types, spells, rooms, and shots each.-Good music, good graphics.-Funny-as-hell comments from troops in-game.  also, the cutscenes are quite funny as well.-Full-Story plot.  The ending of the main plot is as epic as any viking tale and fits well with the DLC.-Campaign is split; 1st half is knights, 2nd half is vikings, so you get to know and love both sides.-Each DLC provides one additional campaign to add on to the end of the main campaign.  Each campaign giving a upgraded version of either the knight-side or the viking-side.-DLC campaigns have more focus on the hero and add more depth and closure to the main story line.-Moderate replay value.Cons:-Moderate voicing.  Not bad, but it's not full-speech animation.-DLC shot types are overpowered, particularly the Viking Elite.  Makes for rather unbalanced play.-Difficulty is a little low.....  Easy = Let my 5-year old play, Normal = Easy, Hard = Normal.-If you barrel through it, it's rather short.All this said:Good game for the price, even if you dont catch it on sale.I can see this being a ROCKING multiplayer game in VS mode.... if you can find anyone who knows the game exists.  I can see it doing very well on gaming-systems for this reason.Great game and type-combination but it needs an online community.... badly."

You can design your own castles, customize your forces, customize your spell choices and there is a lot of variety in how you approach battles tactically. Do you rely on your Angry Birds skills? Do you make heavy use of the Hero on the battlefield? Do you invest heavily in troop quality? Spells? All of these approaches work, and make the game very enjoyable to play."

I knew nothing about it except that the art style looked nice. After several months I finally decided to install and play it ... and it was LOADS of fun. It clearly looks and feels like a port from a mobile version but for this genre it does not matter at all. The gameplay is sold and consists of level missions, usually knocking the enemy castle down or taking their flag. But there are some other mission too. Right off the bat I can tell you to play on Hard if you want to play the game as it should be played. Because if you want 5 stars for each level you gotta finish it on Hard. I personally really liked the story of the campaigns in both the main game and the DLCs. The problem with this game is that the mulitplayer is dead, the skrimish with AI is lackluster and there is nothing else after you finish the campaigns. So no real replayability. However it is a fantastic game that maybe won't be in your memories for a long time but it is fun to play. Also worth mentioning is that to get the 3 MP achievements you gotta find a friend to help you out.

,Recommended,241410,11352443,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,RockstarCRO,"I absolutely enjoyed playing this game. Although a bit steep in price, it's definitely worth a sale price.Though I found the campaign a bit short, the gameplay makes up for it all. This game is a 2D platform type game in a 3D world. The campaign consists of controlling a hero/ballista to attack another castle to side quests of killing boars to raiding a gold mine before your opponent and his castle get to it. You can design your own castles and edit them which is a cool design to the game. My favorite part though is being able to launch rocks or an apple bomb at the opposing enemy castle. Different bombs or upgrades obviously give you different effects. There are some power ups meant to blast through linearly while others will try to take down everything in proximity. While your throwing things at the castle or the enemies players, you can send your own players from archers to magicians to knights to a freakin' dragon. Throughout the game you can upgrade certain aspects of a castle (bigger army, more food generation, shorter wait time on ballistic objects), units, or your hero player. A hero player can be called into battle when they are charged up and ready to go. You cannot control your ballista while you are fighting with your hero. I do commend the game for doing this as somehow again, RTS can meet with FPS.The art style is nothing short of well done. The graphics aren't next gen, but do provide for a colorful atmosphere. The sounds all seem well tended to and appropriate for their delivery. When a rock hits a castle wall, it sounds like a rock hitting a castle wall.Would recommend buying it on sale for sure!

,Recommended,241410,8667042,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,Ancient,"11/10.  A fat friar asked me to polish his ""ballista"" with dragon excrement.Seriously, the only complaint I have about this game is that you pretty much have to complete the campaign to be viable in multiplayer.  This is because you unlock most of your weapons / troops / etc by playing campaign mode. If you watch TotalBiscuit's review of the game, he agrees that this is one of the main ""aggravations"" of the game.Overall the game is fun, but be prepared to spend 4-5 hours beating the campaign before stepping in to demolish your friends.  The campaign itself is written well, with a load of hillarious cut-scenes, and fun missions that give you a different obstacle to overcome each time (use different weapons, use only troops, etc).The mix of gameplay is something pretty new to me.  At it's heart it is a castle-defense game, but it has parts where you'll be playing a hack-and-slash platformer too.  And during heated battles, it begins to feel more like an RTS than anything else.Here's hoping more people pick this game up, as the multiplayer is sort of under-attended andvery under-ratedat the moment.I look forward to playing vs you in the future.  Now, go buy this hidden gem."
,Recommended,241410,8638574,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,Praxis-[CE],"This game is a total blast to play. I don't even know how to describe it, except that it involves elements of side-scrollers, hack and slash, arcade shooters, tower defense and Angry Birds -- and somehow that all works together in a pretty addictive and playable game. The graphics are really colorful and well-done, and the interface is pretty smooth once you get the hang of all the things that are going on and switching around between the different modes (ballista, hero, troops, etc.). The story is one of those ""so cheesy it's awesome"" sort of things, but it's the gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.Loads of fun, totally recommend it.  Would love to try multiplayer because I bet it's just ridiculously funny to play with friends."
,Recommended,241410,16761858,"Posted: 28 June, 2015",all,Trash Panda,"This game deserves a 9.5/10 in my opinionTLDR; This game took me by surprise, it was so addictive that I spent 2 days straight completing the campaign. This game is a combination of many other games such as angry birds, army of darkness, Age of War and tower defense games. I would highly recommend this game if you have a couple of days to spare and have nothing to do.GameplayThe campaign was satisfyingly long and does not feel draggy at all since most of the mission has a different and unique objective. Coupled with the DLCs, this game will give you a solid entertainment for a couple of days.The storyline was very interesting and the characters are all very lovable. The substantial amount of humour in the dialogue was very entertaining.Besides shooting catapults trying to destroy the enemy's castle, you can spawn heroes which you can control on the battlefield. You can also spawn a variety of soldiers to aid you in the battle.Multiplayer support so you can play with your friends after you have beaten the campaign. However, there are not many online players at the moment. So you have to get a friend to play it with you.MusicWhen I was playing this game, I heard a very familiar music on the background. As I went to research, in turns out that the music was composed by the same artist that created the music for the flash game Age of War. The music was indeed a remastered version of the Age of War theme music. I used to play that game alot during high school and I delighted to hear that music again in this game.The other music was very fitting to the game and its quirky characters. Although it does get repetitive sometimes, but it is not really a problem."

The graphics are very reminsicent of Warcraft III and the soundtrack can only be described as ""whimsical dubstep.""There are plenty of fun weapons to use, including a bomb, three boulders, an exploding apple, a giant flying hammer and a flatulent sheep. It's so satisfying to smash open the gate and just start collapsing the other castle from beneath it.There are upgradeable units, and the upgrades carry on to other games.

Many people compare it to Angry Birds but don't let that turn you off, this game is more interesting, fun, and worth your time. The story is pretty silly and so are the cutscenes and I personally enjoy both. You can skip them if you'd like, however.As you progress through the story you earn all sorts of weapons, troops, and spells. You decide how you want to play by leveling whatever you choose and editing your castle how you see fit.I was surprised to find my laptop run this game so well since it typically cannot run games that look as good as this."
,Recommended,241410,15429661,"Posted: 18 April, 2015",all,Selenography,"This is a very decent little game that looks like it's suited to mobile platforms, but has far more depth than that.Castlestorm is a mix of real-time tower defense and sidescrolling hack'n'slash, but the former is much more prominent when you actually play the game. The gist of it is that you need to prevent enemies from walloping down your castle gates and taking your flag back to their own castle - everything is on a 2D plane, a straight left/right path. You can do this in multiple, often very creative ways - but the three staples are using your castle ballista to shoot enemies manually, sending out your own soldiers to die valiantly in the line of duty, and controlling your own powerful general out on the battlefield. While the latter is fun, the castle projectile system is what you'll be using the majority of the time.You'll be using your array of projectiles to deliver more headshots than Liebovitz, but it isn't just limited to bog-standard ballistas. Yes, you can fire a potion to turn that enemy griffin into a harmless turkey, and yes you can shower that viking brute with a barrage of kitchen utensils. The options are surprisingly varied and most of them have their uses, with different factions having differing projectiles available. You unlock these, the soldier classes and other spells/buffs by accumulating gold throughout the campaign and skirmishes, which are then used to upgrade your wares. These also include castle rooms - ballistas can fire at the opposing castle as well as enemy units, and if a room in the castle is destroyed, then whatever benefit it gave to your forces is immediately gone. This can include your army, of course...The campaign is a good length, and the missions are reasonably varied although it might get slightly wearing towards the end. I would say that the DLC is worth it if you enjoy the game, as it's pretty cheap but opens up two new campaigns and factions to play around with. The story is pretty standard questing fare, although it plays around with tropes in good humour. Multiplayer is almost completely dead, so count on a single player experience only.On the whole, Castlestorm is a good game that defies expectations. It looks like a kiddy iOS game, but actually gets quite difficult at points and utilises its own game mechanics well. I'd recommend it to most people who fancy a somewhat casual 2D tower defense. Also, Freia is awesome.'They've smashed ah rhume in yer cah-sull!'"

This game strives to achieve a hefty goal. I can say it achieve that goal on many levels. Despite the story and what some may consider short campaign mode, this game offers plenty. There are many modes to it, the art style is very eye catching and the humor kept me in. I loved that you could upgrade magic, projectiles, soldier types and the castle itself (It isn't ""CastleStorm"" for nothing). The balancing one has to do to achieve their own gameplay style is unique with the castle building. I won't go into detail, but it is a nice and fresh take on it.*If I could make any improvements, longer campaign, more variety in soldiers or at least a 3rd faction.All in all, I found this game a wonderful time had.

Castlestorm offers a brilliant game that combines strategy, hack ‘n slash, castle design, and action. This brilliant game offers DLC packs which add two additional campaigns.Story:The two Teardrop Gems, blue for the knights and red for the Vikings, offer each army protection and have created peace across the land. Out of nowhere the terms of alliance have shifted as the princess has been kidnapped. It is the job of Sir Gareth, a knight for the Kingskeep, who must fight the forces of evil who kidnapped the kings beautiful daughter. With obvious plot twists and simple but amusing dialogue CastleStorm really offers a beautifully playful story. As you work with Friar Vic, Lord Rufus (who everyone hates), and eventually the heroine Freia you fight your way across the land to defeat the Viking lord and restore peace to the land.Gameplay:CastleStorm is similar to a 2D tower defense game where you control the tower; although, CastleStorm has the added twist where you can jump in as a hero and turn the game into a 2D hack ‘n slash game. With a total of nine weapons, nine spells, nine troops, and nine special rooms you get the option to outfit your army to your own unique play style. You can choose a total of five weapons, five spells, and five troops each battle although you can outfit your castle with as many rooms as you can fit. There are unlockable castle layouts you can get by beating missions. But, in all honesty the unlocked castle designs are completely useless as you will find you can build your own that allow you to better utilize the optimal layout (allowing you to get all the special rooms and troops you desire).Campaign:The original game includes two campaigns: Kingdom Quest and Welcome to Vikingland. Kingdom quest includes ten levels each averaging about four missions. Each mission allows for new unlocks, obtaining gold, and garnishing new information from the story. In Kingdom Quest you play as the Knights army and you fight against the Vikings. Welcome to Vikingland includes four levels each averaging about six missions. In this part of the campaign you switch sides and play as the Vikings, but you also fight against Vikings and occasionally on bonus missions you fight the evil knights. This completes the campaign to CastleStorm, with about 1/3 of the missions being bonus missions gives a great amount of variety and twists to the campaign. Each DLC pack adds an additional campaign with two semi-new teams.From Outcast to Savior:The story picks up where it left off as you play Sir Gavin, son of the traitor Sir Gareth. You take up the job as head of security for the kings’ guard in order to restore your fathers honor. The campaign totals six levels averaging about three missions per level. As you fight your way through the depths of evil you must defeat the evil villain who started this whole crisis. From Outcast to Savior runs hand in hand with The Warrior Queen in that the final mission is essentially the same in both campaigns but rather is how it would play out if Sir Gavin fought instead of Freia.The Warrior Queen:The story picks up where it left off as you play Freia, daughter of the great Viking rebellions leader. It is your job as Freia to free the Vikings and reunite the Viking rebellion to thwart the evil that had claimed the land. As you fight your way through seven fun packed levels averaging three missions per level you unveil to story of how it all began. The Warrior Queen runs hand in hand with From Outcast to Savior in that the final mission is essentially the same in both campaigns but rather is how it would play out if Freia fought instead of Sir Gavin.Results:CastleStorm is a fantastic game, which even at full price is not a bad buy. Although, CastleStorm does go on sale often and if you can get it for over 60% off then I wouldn’t hesitate for a second. If you are a fan of 2D tower defenses, where you control the tower, then this is CastleStorm is the game for you. If you like to 2D hack n’ slash games then this is the game for you. CastleStorm offers many features: designing your own castle, building an army, upgrading fortifications, manning defenses, and running around as a hero slaying the armies ahead. This game has a lot to offer and with two DLC expansions CastleStorm offers a story that doesn’t quit, keeping you laughing and wanting to see what happens next.Pros:+Castle builder, which lets you customize your own castle and test out if it would stand an onslaught.+Simple, non-offensive campaign that offers good laughs and cute story.+Two DLC packs which offer two additional campaigns.+Versus mode (although I never tried it so it may be terrible).+Unit upgrades which make you focus resources and keep you playing.+Summoning hero to battlefield which lets you play as a hero and destroy the enemies ahead.+Decent graphics, not too much detail but enough to make it look clean.+Decent video settings allowing windowed mode with various resolutions.Cons:-To get perfect 5-star ratings you need to grind your castle, there is no way you could do it without spending time grinding up your castle a little bit.-The earned castle layouts seem almost worthless as you will find yourself almost always using custom layouts because you will want an efficient castle rather than a good looking castle."

I spent about 9 hours with the game, and I think that's about as much as most players will get out of it. Those 9 hours were fun, though, and mildly addicting.CastleStorm is a fast paced Castle Defense game with a fun, quirky story line. There are two main campaigns. Each campaign is split up into levels where you need to defeat waves of enemies and destroy the enemy's castle.You have access to multiple types of weapons, spells, and troops. You can also design your own castles to use in the game. The level of strategy in the game is light but pleasing and adds to the feeling of progress as you make your way through the campaigns and build your army.The biggest downside of the game in my view is that it can be a bit of a clickfest where you just need to click your mouse over and over again to fire your main weapon and beat levels. The game is also fairly short, and you probably will only get about as much play time from it as I did. The strategy of the game also isn't so in depth or compelling that you'll want to do a second play through unless you really love castle defense games.As I mentioned, the story line of the game (told through cut screen dialogues every few levels) really is quirky and fun. I usually hate cut screen dialogue, but the story line in CastleStorm is highly entertaining in a silly, tongue-in-cheek sort of way. The story line is the best part of this game. I actually found myself disappointed whenever a level went by without a cut screen scene.All in all, the game is fun. I would recommend that you put this game on your wishlist and grab it when it comes on sale again."
76561198022266051,Recommended,241410,22727557,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,OakenPants,"Fun game using a great mix of castle destruction ala Angry Birds style along with some Tower Defense elements thrown in with a little bit of beat'em up sprinkled in all combined with a great art style.The campaign tells an enjoyable tale where each mission (of which there's even optional side missions) allows you to play a level a couple of different ways.  You can win a level by destroying the enemy castle completely in an Angry Birds style where you lob various types of ""missiles"" from your ballista/catapult.  You can also win by breaking down their castle door and sending troops in to get their flag and deliver it to your castle.  There's a few other missions here and there where you also play the main here ala a hack'n slash, beat'em up, brawler.Each of the styles are entertaining and no level is very long, and there's many many different levels so it remains an entertaining, changing game.  Very well done.In the typical level, you can focus on destroying the enemy castle using your ballista/catapult and it's various artillery it throws from the single spear, to the multi-spear throw, to exploding drums, to large rocks, etc.  You select which types of missiles to equip at the start of each level, and also which to spend earned gold on upgrading them.  So if you favor a particular missile, you can upgrade that one up to 10 times so it does far more damage.  Generally the more damage a missile does, the longer the cool-off period.Another way to win the level is by sending your troops toward the enemy castle -- breaking its door down, and bringing that castle's flag back to your castle.  So instead of upgrading missiles, you can upgrade your wide-variety of soldiers by making them do more damage and have more health, etc.So while you are using your ballista to knock the enemy's castle down and break down the door for your troops and also sending your troops to capture the enemy flag, the enemy is doing both of the same to your castle.   If they destroy the room in your castle that allowed you to send forth your Archers, then you can't send out any more archers, etc.  So each room in your castle has a function.  Lose the room, then you lose that function or bonus.Both styles of defeating the enemy are entertaining, and all done in a comedic story and appropriate artwork.  Every level has a (skippable) video introduction, progressing the story along.All this, and I haven't even mentioned the ability to design and create your own castles, or mentioned the various spells used to defeat the enemy troops, or placing yourself (ala the hero) onto the battlefield and fighting first-hand, or the many types of troops that you and the enemy have.The Good:+ Fun, entertaining game+ Multiple play styles supported-- Angry Birds castle knock down, and Capture the Flag ala Tower Defense+ Variety.Many variety of missiles, troops and enemies+ Nice length.Thecampaign took me 8.3 hoursand while each level is short, there's many of them in a wide-variety of missions and goals.+ Artwork and style.+ Well polished game.Animated intros on every level.  Nice.+ Design your own castle.So you can customize and protect your most valuable rooms the way you wish.+ Castle rooms determine troops available.+ Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade!You can upgrade, missiles, troops, rooms and their abilities, your spells, your ""hero"" character.The OK:~ No narration.The videos, while animated use text boxes for all speech.~ The DLCs.The DLCs seemed to change the balance a bit and use much more of the hero fighting.  Which is okay, but I prefer knocking down and storming castles!  :-)The Bad:- Nothing comes to mind...Overall:  This is a great little family-friendly game where I found it highly entertaining to knock down castles along a lengthy, well-paced and varied campaign .  8 out of 10."

I finished the two campaigns that come with the main game, but I didn't enjoy them all that much. Some levels are extrememly easy, a few are frustratingly hard, and the hard ones aren't always later in the campaign. The missions should be balanced much better. The hero fights, which are pretty much a click fest, don't belong in the game, they are boring. Unfortunately the DLC is suppose to have even more of these than the main game, so although I bought the DLC I didn't bother playing it.Not recommended for single player and I never played the multi-player."

,Recommended,241410,8667997,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,GnomeSlice,"Anyone who has ever played and enjoyed 'Age of War' should take a serious look at CastleStorm.  The basic premise is the same; you and your opponent control castles on either side of the map, and the goal is to send troops across to capture your opponent's flag. Each castle is also equipped with a ballista which can be loaded with all kinds of interesting ammunition, like javelins, stones, potions, and sheep.  The ballista can be used to kill enemy troops, or to destroy rooms in their castle (a la angry birds).There's a host of different units, ammunition, castle rooms, and magic spells to choose from, and lots of stuff to upgrade.  And if you like, you can design your own castle to fit the rooms (and by extension bonuses) that you want.It's all presented very well, with excellent graphics, great sound design, and a fantastic soundtrack from Waterflame (who incidentally created the song used in Age of War as well).  There are a lot of levels to play through, with bonus challenges to keep you coming back, and a scoring system that encourages you to find the most efficient way to complete a level.The gameplay itself is also surprisingly deep.  Building your own castle lets you choose what types of units you want to use in the upcoming battle, and you can also swap out your ballista projectiles and magical spells to find the ones that suit your needs.Definitely recommended, I've been having a lot of fun with this one."

The base mechanics of game do pander out into repetition after a while, and the AI units could be improved to add more to the game, ie have them attack the castles.Being able to summon and control a hero is nice, but ultimately a waste of time as he does very little extra than a normal troop or ballistae could do. Lacklustre in execution.Castle design itself is flawed - there's no incentive to build anything more than a functional place to set down rooms. The towers serve no purpose besides catching shots, and the walls are restrained by the sheer crudeness of the engine (ie packing walls with rubble, strengthening and reinforcing via engineering? Not happening.)A good *casual* game. Worth a few dollars. It'll kill a few hours before you get inevitably bored of it."

I just finished all of the single player content for this game (including DLCs), and it was a lot of fun. A lot of people are ragging on the story. I found it to be cute/funny. It's not serious at all and is quite ridiculous, in a good way. The style of comedy is similar to Swords & Soldiers if you've played that. In this game, you shoot hordes of enemies with a ballista, summon troops to attack the enemy castle and keep enemy troops away from your castle, all while blasting at the enemy's castle to destroy rooms which represent each combat bonus or enemy type the enemy has. Don't like their dragons? Shoot the dragon's nest off the top of the castle; problem solved! The castle-blasting is like Angry Birds, which I actually don't like, but I enjoyed the way it's done in this game. Oh, and you get money when you complete a level and can replay levels for more cash, upgrading everything from heroes you spawn and control zoomed in between the castles, the troops you spawn, your combat bonuses, etc.TL;DR Get the complete pack for this game with all its DLC whenever you see it on sale for just under seven bucks.

This game is awesome for such short gaming bursts.In short, you try to destroy the opponent's castle or capture their flag. You have different kinds of projectiles that you shoot with the ballista mounted on your castle gate, and you have different kinds of soldiers, including infantry, cavalry, siege units and monsters. You can either go for destroying the opposing castle room by room (the game has a very good physics engine, so if you somehow manage to destroy the basement of a castle, all of it comes tumbling down), or you can upgrade your soldiers and go for capturing the flag. There are two steps to capturing the flag, first you must break the castle gates, then you must escort the flag bearer to your castle.You can design your castle in any way you can. You have only two limits while designing you castle; spatial limits and a limit of 5 different barracks at most. Other than that, you can create your castle however you want. If you don't feel like it, there are also ready castles that you can use, but I think they are inferior to what you can achieve yourself if you personalize your castle.I've encountered no bugs or glitches throughout my gameplay. The loading times were also very short.There is almost no voice-over (just some generic sounds used many times) but the game never feels like it lacks it. The music also fits the game like a glove. It can be epic, funny or brooding depending on the mood of the moment.The graphics are very cute and also hugely appropriate for a game of this kind. They are very, very reminiscent of Warcraft III, which I liked a lot. This game clearly proves that the most important thing in a game is gameplay, not the graphics.Don't expect miracles from the story. It's mediocre, and at times it really feels like it was written keeping children in mind. However, it at least manages to make you feel curious about what will happen next. The game also ends in a somewhat cliffhanger, so expect a sequel.The only criticism I can make is not about the gameplay but the story:You beat the Rogue Knight, Sir Brutus, and he pledges to serve you, but where does he or his army go? You just continue using the Barbarians' army-set like it never happened.Also, all throughout the story, it was hinted very, very clearly that Lord Rufus is a traitor and Sir Brutus is actually working with him. What happened to Lord Rufus and Friar Vic when we were separated because of the cave-in? What happened on the other side of the mountain while we were fighting in the Barbarian lands?And what about the ending? What was the monster that we saw at the end? The developers could have at least described where it came from and why it appeared just after Ramhorn's death. And the ending roll says peace ruled the land but (as I've said in the previous paragraph) what happened with Lord Rufus, the traitor? These are not answered and I must say, it really bothered me.Other than these reservations, I think this is a very good game and it definitely deserves your money. Recommended."

The ""Castle Building"" function adds little to the fun, as it doesn't really change anything.I think that's the problem in this game: nothing quite matters. I played most part of the campaign only using the basic things (weapons, troops, etc) which I started with (only upgrading), and they did the work most of the time. I only had a hard time when a level came that I couldn't use somehing I spent almost all of my money upgrading. So, some levels where very easy and other unpleasantly hard, because the way I choose to upgrade my things. But hey, nothing told me I should've balanced the upgrades between everything. I was making my own strategy and was penalized for it. So I believe the levels are kind of unbalanced.

The mouse-based gameplay in the hero-mode is just unnecessarily frustrating, due to some poor design. When you're targeting, you often need to fire and move. That's good. But if you do, the cursor disappears entirely, so when you need to fire again, you have to find it, get it back on target, and then shoot. Also, the cursor disappears when you get hit, or release the button for whatever reason. To top that off, the screen scrolls around, making it difficult to tell where your enemies are. Normal mode ended up being way too easy, and hard mode would've worked, had it not been for the poor mouse control.Maybe I would've eventually gotten used to it. Still, I'd rather have fun with the design, rather than in spite of it."

Nope. After the first couple of hours, you really want to give this a chance. because it's apparent a lot of love went into making it.

Castlestorm falls short as far as reinventing/creating within the genre.Troops seem to either be extremely OP or weak AF, there is little incentive to use most troops at a certain point.Everything revolves around getting kill streaks to get rapid fire to end the level.There just feels like a very lacking element to this game, and I got bored of it and probably won't ever boot it again."

This game could have been great, but instead is merely mediocre, and all because of the poor unit mechanics.The storyline is fun and engaging, but any actual control over your hero is close to imaginary.The response time to shield against attacks is laughable, you can only see 3 feet in front of you, and you give up control over your best weapon (the ballista)Ground based unit fights are done in an unusual style. each unit stops to fight only one other letting all other enemis past.For example, if you have 2 soldiers against 1 enemy one of your soldiers and theirs will engage and your second will walk right past.This might not seem like much until you get larger units with splash attacks. Trolls and the like can kill several of your units will one hit but only one of yours even gets to attack.This combat is even more poorly implemented when you add in the ballista and flying units. The ballista shots damage your own units, and it can easily become impossible to fire without hitting your own unitsThe flying combat is even more disjointed and tacked on. I have never had a single ranged ground unit take out a flyer. You have to shoot them down yourself.Coupled with said flyers ducking and bobbing randomly, as well as dealing splash damage attacks (and one hit killing most units), this is a huge oversight and in many cases ruins and otherwise fun game time.The organization of the game is foolishly repetative. In both kingdom/royal guard, and Viking/viking elites factions the units are almost interchangeable, but upgrades must be bought separately.Separate upgrades must be bought for all of the support buildings as well, even though these are exactly the same across all classes. This is true of some of the Heros/Heroins too.Too long; Didn't readThis game could have been great, but the lack of testing and poorly implemented ideas make this mediocre.

It comes across like a lego-style castle builder in the trailer, and while there is that element, most of your play time exists in the space between the two castles where you are waging war. The whole game feels a bit tedious. The storyline is forgettable, and nothing is really that fun. To be honest, I never came across a tutorial or even did much of the castle building in my whole time playing it. I must have gotten through half of the game, too.Another thing that is hard to describe, but needs to be mentioned, is that this title doesn't feel very 'indie'. I normally wouldn't care about that kind of stuff, but the whole thing feels sterile, or corporate. I don't get the vibe that this was somebody's love project that they tediously crafted and tweaked.Overall, it just wasn't much fun.

,Not Recommended,241410,8812557,"Posted: 22 January, 2014",all,Upsilon,"Let me start by saying: I'm a total sucker for a good indie game. In my opinion, indie games are TRUE video gaming. None of this 50GB, HD, 1,000FPS, DX50, PERFECT GRAPHIX 'N SOOPUR AWSUM CINIMATICZ! The moment I saw CS for sale, I could of sworn it was a steal. I jumped into its wacky, colorful world that left my sides splitting with laughter and the time of my life in gameplay....but something went wrong about half way through; the game lost it's charm almost immediately by a few blantantly bad ideas and campaign design.Plot 10/10I love the idea of the story. 2 kingdoms in seemingly endless war were destroying one another. The goddess of the game's universe was so distrought, she cries, but - intead of tears - 2 gems were crystilized from her eyes and fell to earth. These strange metals seemed to sate the bloodlust of the 2 kings that held them and there was peace. However, someone has tampered with the gems, and war as again surfaced. Quite the creative setting, if you ask me. It has a few twists and is told well. Can't ask for much more out of a story in a simple game as this. You'll also be laughing thoughout at the zany writing and character design. It has a humor that is rarely tapped into nowadays.Graphics 10/10Just by looking at the screenshots, it's easy to tell this game is delightfully beautiful. With a wide palette of colors, Zen Studios truly made a charming world. The visuals remind me of an old Disney movie. Character models, level design, art; across the board, the visuals are at zenith.Sound 10/10The sound is up to par with the best of full budget, AAA titles. Voice cast is also well done. Most notably, the game's soundtrack is legendary! It's made by a young man that goes by the pseudonym WaterFlame89 on Youtube. Don't miss out on tracks like ""Donkey Island"", ""Title Theme"", ""Happy War"", ""Storming Castles"", or ""Long, long ago...""! Remember old songs like the Goof Troop theme? They were so catchy, uplifting, and always made you smile; even during your toughest days. WaterFlame89 has ressurected that long, lost art of music composition. I almost cry when I hear them. ;~;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGoYX1FMq-A&index=2&list=PL5xceeTDjuOPHBIQnD4TdpNljEggDFfsvGameplay 6/10Many will note the influences taken from Angry Birds ( or if you really want to go back, ""Crush the Castle). This is a good example of ""inspired"" not ""ripped off"". You custom build your castle, or take presets to battle, adding rooms that each buff your viability. If a certain room is destroyed, it's contribution ceases i.e. if you have a barracks room destroyed, you can't train your grunts. There is a ballista that you can control to launch a variety of projectiles either at the enemy castle, or at the enemy troops. There's also an option to train troops of your own and smash the front gate of the castle; revealing their flag, or even spawning a hero that you control temporarily. Capture the enemies flag with your troops, or annihilate the castle to win. I was completely hooked by the gameplay and it's bronze/silver/gold ranking, challenge system. With great replayability, visuals, engrossing sound track, and humorous, intriguing story, what could possibly go wrong?CS gains momentum as you fire it up and play, but somewhere near the mid point of the game, it changes which faction you play as. The first mission of this new faction was dreadful! The game starts taking a bunch of cheap shots on you. You're forced to play a hero class and kill a certain number of enemies without dying. However, the controls as a hero in the first place are utterly terrible, clunky, counter-intuitive, and worst of all, you die fairly quickly. I had to change the game to EASY just to barely squeeze my way past this debacle. Worse yet, when you reach this point of the game, it's out of new features. You've already seen all the weapons, all the new troops, and all the new rooms. The rest of the game is playing the same mission against a fairly cheap AI whose troops 100% of the time STOMP on yours, forcing you to use your ballista on enemy troops while the enemy ballista takes free shots on your castle. Another annoying thing is your heros talk EVERYTIME they attack. One girl shouts ""MAXIMUM DAMAGE"" when you use her alternate attack, then shouts ""Oh, no!"" EVERYTIME she's hit. ""MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO!"" Just from that quote, you can see how hero gameplay works; it's almost unplayable entirely.The VerdictCS has a lot of incredible things going for it in terms of music, gameplay, sound, visuals, and story. The issue is that it runs out of fun before it runs out of content with bad level design and cheap AI in later missions. It was even enough to make me quit the game. I'm on the fence of whether I should recommend or not. Final score is 6/10. It's terrific!...until those few missions ruin it. Then Castle Storm becomes nothing but a slightly above-average game. It really pains me to talk about this game that way."

,Recommended,241410,10856858,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,outrider42,"This game is basically a tower defense version of Angry Birds. This game can be surprisingly addictive and it can be challenging at times if you don't level up the right things before battle. You can plan out your entire castle, and how you build it can be very important. Do you build redundant rooms in case they destroy one? Where is the best place for your most prized rooms? Because if you lose certain room, you lose the benefit of their use, and unlike Command and Conquer style games, there is no way to rebuild any part of your castle during the battle. This changes how you strategize for battle, and puts a great importance on protecting the castle while attacking. And the combination of attacking with units and your own catapult weapon is pretty intriguing. There is a pretty good balance between these, you really cannot neglect your units or catapult weapons too much.If I do have a complaint, it is that the game likes giving you a lot of levels that restrict you to just one task, like levels where you cannot use any soldiers, or ""hero"" levels that restrict you to just controlling your hero. The hero levels can be very hard later on if you fail to level that particular hero, it makes a huge difference. But while these hero levels can be a change of pace, the game is still at its best when the levels feature castle vs castle play.The game is colorful, but still a bit gory if you are thinking about getting it for kids. The story is a total after thought, you are not playing this for any story. Even so, it can be mildly entertaining at times and is full of juvenile humor.

Pretty inituitively actually.Just hold down the left mouse button to fire a stream of javelins from your ballista, whilst you click the other mouse buttons and the number buttons to perform your other duties. You can headshot Barbarians, build knights and cast spells all at the same time!But that does sound like a heavy brain toll, aiming can be intense alone, but making troops? Triggering special attacks? Alternating ammo types? With all this variety comes an interesting amount of customisability.When you build your castle, you need to set up protection for the building components that influence your gameplay, theres troop structures that enable your units, upgrade structures that strengthen your defenses and units, and then jusr raw materials that you place to protect those important elements.Exactly which parts you pick will heavily influence your game, if you dont like to maintain troops then you can forego them nearly completely (the campaign does require you to have a little of everything), and spend all of your resources on upgrading your ballista. If youre not too sharp on constant ballista vigil and would rather lead and command an army, you can upgrade the troops and even your own ""hero"" unit, which you can summon to the field to fight on the frontline. Thse elements then click together interestingly, a ballista focused player can develop a few key units to protect his front gate that then when the gate is clear shoot the enemy caste in tandem with your ballista bolts. Alternatively you can go for the other victory option that is ""capture the flag"", where you build frontline units to storm the enemy caste, and then cover them with hero summoning and ballista attacks. Another strategy is to focus on the special munitions available to ballistas, these munitions often have poor rate of fire, but you can make up for that by going into hero mode between cooldowns.Included is a mildly entertaining campaign with a variety of missions that challenge you to use the different elements of the game in concert or seperately. It wont win any prizes for originality story wise but what did you expect from a game with so many unique gameplay mechanics?In other words, this rather simple looking game has a deceptive amount of depth to it, allowing the player to develop his own brand of strategy.If youre a fan of strategic games, and want to play something completely different from the norm for a while, this is a game you will enjoy.Gameplay: 5/5.Surprisingly deep strategy and a large pool of options to pick from. Several interesting mechanics.Art: 4/5.For an underdog company, the game is exceptional. The sprites are easy to read and iconic, there is a lot of animations and a fair amount of agreeable classissism in the designs. its got nothing on the industry titans of videogaming, but for an indie game it is well above the minimal acceptable threshhold.Story 3/5.Average. Lighthearted comedy mixed with a standardised plot of ""Bad things happen, hero saves day, goes on journey to find source of bad things, hero saves the day again."" The plot was just charming enough to get an average score for being ""Classic"".Sound 3/5.The background music is nearly entirely ""light action-symphonies"". The music is constant but not distracting. The very basic soundract and the simple voice-acting was enough to set the mood and setting, mission accomplished.Accessibility 2/5.A found that this problem deserves a notice here. I found myself clicking a lot of unnessesary buttons, especially in menu's and the castle builder. There is no auto save for the castle builder that I know-off.Total score: 68.Pick it up, play it and enjoy it for the mechanics and the strategy. I can even reccomend the DLC's for some extra challenges and charming character interactions, its worth a few days of fun for sure."

This is easily one of those games that will give you 20-30 hours of gameplay or more so at its normal price of $10 its worth it.  Also if you like the game i HIGHLY recommend you to buy the two expansions since Outcast takes place after the first two campaigns and Warrior Queen is the 4th campaign is helps tie up some of the story.Overall its a very well rounded game with good replay value although ive yet to try the multiplayer or the co-op.Two big tips for those who want to get and play this game.....When you play the game make sure to go into castle editor and setup your castle before starting the next mission since they game doesn't inform you that the castle editor is a necessity to using new units and also the way to upgrade the castle walls/gate.If a level is kicking your♥♥♥♥♥like the hero missions where you don't get to use your castle or units just beat it on casual and ignore the bonus requirement. Doing that you can unlock everything later and upgrade all the stuff after beating that campaign you can go back and replay that mission with fully upgraded abilities and units on harder difficulties.

Mainly single player based, though it does have a multiplayer option which you can do on the same console/screen. You'll need a controller for player 2 though and he/she only gets to control the hero. Mostly a aim and fire turret game, when you do spawn in as the hero it's still so much fun and a break from the ballista. Still one of the best games around in my opinion."

,Recommended,241410,8361456,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,snargleplax,"Blending 2D tower defense gameplay with catapult physics, this game feels like a cross between Tower Wars and Angry Birds (there are even some none-too-sly ""angry"" references in the game).  Like Tower Wars, CastleStorm expands the basic tower defense formula by giving each opponent a citadel to defend and troops to send against the other.In addition to sending troops, you can also fire various forms of ammunition, ballista/catapult style, against the opposing troops and their fortress.  By taking out sections of the fortress, you diminish the enemy's capabilities.  The physics involved are absolutely reminiscent of Angry Birds, and there's a great deal of satisfaction when you finally knock out that last section of wall and watch a huge tower come crashing down.This game had a lot of elements I was looking for.  As of this review, I've played just four hours of the campaign (about 2/3 through), and haven't played around with the fortress design mechanics or anything -- they look good, though, as does multiplayer (assuming one can find an opponent).  The cutscenes are hokey in the extreme, but I'm not finding myself annoyed by them -- it's just a bit of popcorn to tie the missions together, and it works fine.Definitely a good buy (especially on sale) for fans of tower defense, physics games, and artillery games (e.g. Scorched Earth, Worms, etc.).  Happy to see more games moving in this direction, moving past the basics of a single genre.  Probably the biggest downside for me is that the pacing tends to be a bit frantic, not leaving much room to contemplate one's strategy."

The game is lovingly wonderful (and isn't that just a bit sappy?)+ Strong gameplay, the game seamlessy combines spells, RTS and catapaulting together, the catapults vast array of weapons (from boulders, to conversion potions and homing exlpopding eagles) are bound to the left mouse button, the spells (summoning your hero for a direct control fight or summoning holy swords to implae your enemies) to the middle mouse button and your troops (catapult launching gluttons, pladins and donkey riders and more) to the right button, each form of combat featuring a hotkey and keyboard select system allowing for seamless combination of the trio)+ Destruction physics, speaks for itself really, nothing more satisfying then watching your ballista strike a javelin through your enemy or rocks smashing into the opponents castle and crumbling it away or even bouncing a battering ram sheep into the gate. It works great, and aside from the occasional glitched miss, its fluid, effective and satisfying, being the core part of the game it should be and certainly is.- Friendly Fire, I don't know who thought this was a good idea, so heres the situation, your troops are weakened by the oncoming plaadin, you fire your ballista straight for his head to give your troops a break, instead it gets sent smacking into your soldiers back and he dies, the enemies gain ground while you sent another squad to retake the ground you lost. Theres the problem, its almost impossible to use the troops and ballistae in tandem, they always get in the way of each other, there is no point using the infantry because despite the infantry being effective the ballistae is more effective and when your troops are LITERALLY BLOCKING shots for you're enemy, whats the point? putting in friendly fire just brickwalls the infantry and stops the fun, in a game like this, the realism of the firendly fire is all the more annoying.- Castle editor is pointless, don't get me wrong, its fun and all, putting your castle into action and creating an unstoppable design, but when the preset ones are already there, made by professionals, completely balanced, and tested for the most efficiency, theres no point in building your own where theres certain to be a gaping hole in your defense or not enough space for a troopers barracks etc. its the same problem as littlebigplanet, the created levels are fun but the ones made by proffessionals are almost certain to be better, less buggy and of a higher quality.Overview: despie its huge flaw of friendly fire, its good to remember it is the only serious flaw, and the editor is still there for those who want to tinker and the architects in us that could make great castles, so its more of a personal gripe but i think others would see the same thing, but that said its still a completely functuntional feature, so for its excellent features, great and realised ideas and wonderfully cheesy story, castlestorm gets a 9 out of 10, its only £7 and thats the price of most dlc for triple A games, which i guarantee you will probably won't be worth it, so give castlestorm a try, Its worth every penny"

It follows the tower defense mechanics where you have a castle that needs to be protected. You are able to spawn units to attack the opponents flag, which is near their castle. You have a ballista that you use to shoot out different projectiles according to your level and current progress. There are heroes you can spawn for 10+ seconds to alter the battlefield a long with spells to control, aid or destroy your opponent.The core gameplay is a mixture of sending troops to the middle of the battlefield, using spells and heroes to control the flow and using your ballista to shoot out rocks or eagles or whatever, to destroy the opponents castle.Extra feature is the ability to upgrade your abilities, units, spells and heroes. You can build and design your own castle and put the rooms you need according to your strategy. If you loose a room in the battle you also loose its ability/feature while your in the match. So if you loose the archer room, you can't spawn archer anymore. So a very strategic aspect right there.In multiplayer you can unlock and play the other factions which opens up new heroes, units and method of play."

Basically there's one of two factions, Kingdom and Norse, each have their own campaign which will take you at least 8 hours if you ignore all the side missions. Obviously each side has their own attacks, minions, spells, etc.The goal changes from level to level but most of the time it's you vs. your enemy, with the victory conditions typically being to either destroy your enemies castle (which is well done I might add) or capture their flag by breaking down their gate and sending a ground troop to snag it. There's a good variety in minions, attacks, and spells so you'll definitely be experimenting with your loadout to see what you like best. You get gold throughout the game and you spend that on upgrades for whatever you want.There's also 3 other gamemodes aside from campaign, Survival, Skirmish, and Hero Survival. Survival is a lot of fun but if you do TOO well it starts to get boring and you'll want to lose on purpose, but that's not exclusive to this game. Skirmish is more like a regular match where you can customize your experience a little bit. Hero Survival sucks dino dong because the ""take control of hero"" combat is incredibly basic.You can also customize your own castles which is pretty cool, although it's clear it was put in as an afterthought at the last minute. Still, it works and the game is better for it to be in the very basic state that it's in rather than not at all. There's two dlcs available for this game, haven't gotten them yet so I can't comment on how good or bad those are.Final, sad fun fact: This game plays more like a worms game than all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ modern worms game Team17 ♥♥♥♥♥ out nowadays."

Upgrades to your arsenal and star ratings for each mission gives it some replay value too.  Plot is as stereotypical as they come but its surprising it even has one.

Brings a whole new outlook on tower defence tbh & i found myself helplessly addicted to it, right through til th end of the campaign.Decent graphics, Good controls and very easy game to pick up.Could probably of done with a bit more difficulty but still very enjoyable.Basically you have your castle on 1 side, the enemies on the other and you send troops whilst also slinging your catapault to both damage the enemies castle or stop their current flow of troops. 1st to lose their castle, loses..pretty simple but also a fun andmost importantly unique take on the TD genre.75/100"

Were it not designed around micro-transactions, it would be a great game. But you know the pay-to-win drill: frustration is in it's design.To make it clear, only the mobile version is based on micro-transactions, but the PC version inherits the scarse balancing and the need to keep farming levels you have already beaten."

Recommend that you start and stay on ""hard"" difficulty as it is too easy otherwise.  There may be a couple optional missions where you have to adjust it down if it gets too tough, but if you are a fan of this style of game, it was really cool."

It includes a mix of projectiles with hack and slashing. The campaign has varied objectives and some challenging tasks for 5 out of 5 star level completion.  It has leaderboards. I like the heroes and there are spells and I have yet to build my castle's defenses.  The upgrade paths are excellent and so is the interface, options and game modes.  Cut-scenes are easily skipped. Its a very polished mix which promises to be difficult to master.  As I approach half way through the campaign I can see some finer strategic play is needed.  8/10"

It reminds me of the modernization of that ancient Flash game where you defend your castle from stick figures by tossing them into the sky, Defend Your Castle. (Which I guess was a precursor to the Clicker genre, though that particular comparison does not hold with this game.) I'm sure others have pointed to more recent antecedents.The video pretty much gives you everything you need to go on. Stuff if running toward your castle, and you need to keep your ballista firing at the enemy while you send wave after wave of your own troops and occasionally enter the fray with your own hero. There are basic RPGesque improvements to be made, troops and spells and projectiles to be unlocked, that sort of thing. You can also modify your castle to maximize bonuses and structural integrity, but that seemed a little clunky. There isn't really deep strategy at work here--it's much more about tempo management and, of course, your aim.The campaigns are very good, with three or four very different mission types interspersed at good intervals. Boss battles are interesting and require different tactics and so forth. I blew through the main ones in one sitting (~7 hours) on Normal difficulty (thanks, staycation!) and may go back and try them at higher levels. I just picked up two more campaigns as DLC, which I'm looking forward to.All of the bells and whistles are there--cutscenes look good, models look good, jaunty music sounds good. It's a very polished, straightforward kind of game!"

(And that's Hard!)it's got great music, Effective graphics, And a great amount of weapons (Projectiles) upgrades for your charector, and, if your feeling like a 'just right' challenge, go for the casual gameplay. Or. Better yet, if you want a challenge, There's also a 'normal' and a 'hard' difficulty to each level.I totally recommend it. If you like tower defense, War and Music. i'd go for it. They really ourdid themselves."
,Recommended,241410,29236043,Posted: 13 January,all,Ezah,"CastleStorm is a solid little game that is a derivative of Castle Crush -- that is, the game that Angry Birds' formula is based off of. Gameplay consists of 2 different castles pitted against each other, with an arsenal of projectiles, soldiers, and spells ready to crush the opponent's castle. It's more of a real time version; instead of trying to destroy everything in 1-2 shots, you continuously wear down the castle walls to eventually destroy rooms while also juggling funneling an army at their gates to steal their flag and shooting down enemy projectiles and soldiers to keep them from doing the same.For $4, I didn't expect much, but the gameplay is solid when playing against the AI, and the story can be humorous, although the missions jump all over the place. If you're looking for something akin to the flash game Castle Crush (or Angry Birds), I recommend giving this a go. It's not quite the same, but will definitely scratch that itch and is worth checking out on sale. I give it a 6.5/10."

You can get the exact same stuff for 2p cheaper if you buy the game and the DLC seperately.Other than that it is a great game, i originally bought this game back on my Xbox 360 and from what I can remember it was a blast playing with friends. You need to defend your castle and destroy the opponent's castle using troops (which can include large trolls and bird things), projectiles and yourself. The projectiles vary from regular arrows to rocks that split into more rocks to exploding apples. If you get bored you can create your own castle with different rooms.The campaign is really good, and can help you get better at the game. It will really help you if you try to do all of the bonus missions as they help you remember to get those headshots that one-hit-kill most low level enemies and get you extra coins. The coins can be used to upgrade your troops, projectiles and other things. However, these upgrades will not be in effect whilst in multiplayer."

Definitely have gotten my money's worth. Difficulty scales up as you go and through DLC if you get those, so if it's easy at the beginning no worries it'll get harder. Building castles is fun. Breaking castles is fun. And there's some mini-game gold gaining levels to mix it up. Surprisingly long game for $10. Multiplayer is dead, so if you want to play someone on-line you'll have to reach out. To me. I'll play you online. 4/5 (because I can't get the last star on the turkey level makin me mad)"
