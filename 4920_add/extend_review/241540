,Recommended,241540,12741510,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Grey,"Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.So here goes:I'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around ""shoot millions of zombies to win"". There is no ""winning"" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering ""How long will they last without my help?""And this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.The game & DLC's in a nutshell:State of Decay:You and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.Breakdown:Same map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.Lifeline:New map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.I'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.When you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.Over the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.Unfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.A few other points of light irritation:- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no ""clean"" way to get rid of them.The pros:Open world game: You go where you want, when you want.Permadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.Stamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.Traits and Skills: The game's way of taking the ""average"" out of ""average Joe""Soundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.Mods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.All in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso.Even grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it."

,Recommended,241540,7743705,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Yo-Landi Visser,"""There are a lot of zombie games, but this one looks old, but feels fresh""Game overall is very good and deep, and has nicely executed gameplay mechanics that make you occupied for long time, just because you come back to it for more. You need to gather supplies in order to survive, but also you need to keep people in top shape by wiping out infestations, killing hordes, gathering supplies and eventually take them outside of base and kill some zombies together with them to make them feel more clever. Base too small? Find another one, and order everybody to move to it. You've been long time outside of base exploring the area? Your character will get tired and eventually run out of stamina (or the stamina bar will be impossible to fill fully). When you'll get hurt too many times, your health lowers and you need to switch to other characters. Lost your character? It's gone. You cannot have it back. This is the main thing I love in this game. When you loose one of characters, it hurts, this character is gone. This is when I realised that dialogs and overall - story - of characters is very good and nicely written. At some point I felt so emotionally connected with Markus (main character you start as first time) that when I died while playing as him, I've started game again from the beggining, because I didn't want to loose him. Did I mention that game is open world? Yes it is, you can do whatever you want untill whole map will eventually run out of resources. That is another unique thing about this game. Nothing respawns. Crashed your car and it exploded? You loose it. Gathered supplies from nearby house? They're gone. They never respawn. This adds so much realism to the game, and fear that you need to take risks in order to survive. You can also get some new freeloaders to your base. Of course it will be possible to switch to them, after you fullfill tasks they give you (going to their base and dropping supplies), or just after bringing them to your base. Generally speaking, there is a lot to do, and this review will not cover all of this stuff, you just need to find out more by yourself.Technically speaking, this game is pretty outdated. Graphics are somewhat old looking, but they're not ugly. Just textures could use better resolution, and animations could use some more fixing. Well, we cannot expect much as Undead Labs ported this game from Xbox 360, where it was successfull as it is now on PC. It runs on CryEngine 3. First I thought it was Unity 3D, but after some readings I've discovered it uses Crytek's engine. I thought that it pretty much wasted it's potential. As mentioned above animations are sometimes jerky, and doesn't fit the situation. Some textures are ugly, low res, but overall, it's not ugly to the point to make you puke. Performance is pretty poor on Ultra Spec. It does run noticably better at High Spec (Graphic options are named like this) with 60FPS, but does have some drops to 40 in towns. My PC is not top notch, I have i3-3.2 GHz, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD7850 2GB, but still it could use some more 'love' to make it run smoothly. Game has very limited graphic options (one slider) but it does job well improving the performance.Controls. Game lacks some stuff that could come in handy for some group of players. I dislike forced Mouse Acceleration. Thank god Undead Labs added rebindable keyboard bindings, so it's easier to configure and play.Game does not have multiplayer and will never have. Developers stated a lot of times that this game won't have any possible coop or multiplayer. It's all reserved for upcoming Class4 (this game is Class3) and honestly? In single player it plays so well that I didn't even noticed lack of multiplayer.Overall, game is worth the money, so is upcoming 'Breakdown' DLC which will only add some more of gameplay. Game has enough content to make you occupied for looooong time. It's best zombie game to date, it looks old, but feels fresh despite it's obvious flaws. Undead Labs - Congratulations.8.5/10"

I waited months for major patches that would fix the numerous bugs. Now I am told I must folk over another $30 for a remastered version. Not cool.
,Not Recommended,241540,33739979,Posted: 23 July,all,Kelthar,"Negative review since the devs stopped providing patches and require you to buy the new version if you want to keep getting patches and bugfixes. Owners of the original game get no discount whatsoever, and have to pay the full price for the new game that is essentially the same but with bugfixes and a tiny bit more content.This was done a year and a half after the game initially released, so it's not like they took an ancient game and made a revamped version."

,Recommended,241540,9784593,"Posted: 10 April, 2014",all,Alexspeed,"State of Decay is a game that fills a niche that many games tried to fill but none did yet.But it does it in its own unique way, and it does it very well.You are managing a group of survivors in a zombie-apocalypse. Its something you need to get used to, there are alot of random characters and some plot centric ones that you can get attached to, and mourn for when you loose them to the zeds. There is permadeath, and its cruel. The game can bring out emotions in alot of ways, which is a strong point for it.There is also base-building in the game on several predetermined locations. The game is a Sandbox, things happen if you are playing or not. As long as you keep morale high and your base secure, you shouldnt have too many suprises whenever you get back to it after you took a break.The story is told over different mission arcs that you have to follow, to eventually get out of the valley the game takes part in. Overall the story is well presented but it could have been longer and the end is unsatisfying in my opinion. The non-story missions are quite repetitive and can get to be a bit of a chore over time.Generaly the game felt too easy once you know how to deal with the zeds and have your survivors trained. Yes, you can level your survivors skills and there is nice progression in the skill system. And even tough you might feel like a zombie-slaying superhero at times, as soon as you pay not attention for a moment you can be in dire troubles. If you get reckless you will loose characters to hordes, and to special infected (which are very similar to those in Left4Dead).The graphics are pretty dissapointing resolutionwise, and the user interface is clumsy and ugly at best. That is because the game was ported from consoles for PC, but generally ist not a bad port. The Devs really tried their best to make the game work for PC. The controls with Keyboard & Mouse where fine (Controllers work too of course). The graphical variety still can overcome the bad texures, so that those only stay a minor annoyance.I didnt run into any plot-stopping bugs or crashes (seems those where fixed), the game gets still patched from the devs and there will be a second DLC coming out at one point. The first DLC adds an endless mode to the game which is a nice addition.Its a bit weird to sum up this game with its many small flaws and at the end still say its a great game, but it really is, even tough it could surely have been better in many aspects. Its the whole experience and atmosphere that makes it worth playing. Its a unique game in many ways, and a very welcome and creative suprise in the many zombie/survival games that all feel pretty similar overall.Everyone should play this, wholly reccommended.And dont lose Maya, like i did."

,Recommended,241540,10815246,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Blackloch°,"I recently bought State of Decay from Steam’s summer sale for around 4€ and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier with a game purchase. I’ve heard/read people saying it’s a good game but didn’t realise it was SO addicting too.Let’s start by explaining what the whole game is about, without spoilers of course. It’s zombie apocalypse time and you are one of the survivors. You aid other survivors, build a community, search for supplies like food, gas, ammunition and weapons to survive.You have the freedom to move around the open world how you like, set up a base (home) in various locations, choose what kind of services your base has (medical room, library to study, mechanics to fix cars & gear etc.)You can build watch tower in your base, order men to practice shooting, extend the safe zone around your map by sniping everyone around your base, train other neighbouring survivors in your camp in exchange of goods.You can take over empty buildings like gas stations, cafeterias etc. and build outposts there. Outpost have a ‘safe zone’ around them, where zombies will not spawn so it’s a good place to have a breather. Outpost also grant you access to your base supplies, so you can quickly switch weapons and other gear there.Your base has a radio that helps you keeping in contact with other survivors and NPCs in the world. This is also how you will get most of your quests, distress calls etc. You can contact your base via radio and ask them to track specific supplies for you - or you can just scavenge around and search houses and buildings for everything usefull.You can load stuff you find in your backbag and in trunk of a car. When you can’t carry more, you can ask base to send runners who will make their way to your location and loot the place. You can wait for the runner and aid him in returning the goods back home, or go your merry way and let them do it without you. They are usually quite handy with their weapons, though it all depends on what gear you are giving to your community.Sometimes they chew more than they can handle and might end up surrounded by zombies, trapped in house etc. If you like your buddies, you go and help ‘em - or let them struggle alone. If you don’t offer any help, that has an impact in your own reputation within the group. So basically, don’t ♥♥♥♥ around and help your own men. Also helping neighbours and other communities has it’s benefits.The more people you have living in your base, the more rations they take up per day. The more people you have, the more security you have. The more people you have, the more inner problems you have. People will occasionally get mad at each other, have sleeping problems, fear the outside world. Quite often you can solve these issues - but there’s bound to happen something nasty eventually.You start the game by controlling one person. After a while you gain more friends and allies and you can then control them too. Once a person is too badly wounded or too tired, you can then switch to another person and keep doing the tasks required to survive, while others rest and keep up the base. (Guard the perimeter, cook food, hunt for supplies, fix broken equipment, manufacture traps, silencers, bullets etc.)The world inside State of Decay goes on, even when you are offline. The event gradually slow down, the more time you are away from game and in three (3) days the time will be almost at stand still. So, if you have a real life too and log in the game next day, be prepared. Something might have happened to your community while you were away.If you are into zombie/post apocalyptic game this game is a must buy. I highly recommend it. Oh and remember, if you ♥♥♥♥ up and someone dies, he/she is dead for good. I was saddened to see my favorite guy die just because I was too cheap with healing kits."

The zombies are a threat in large number but easy to deal with in small numbers. Looting is enjoyable and rewarding at times other frustrating when zombies keep coming from the noise your making. Level up characters can make you think about who you take out on supply runs and how careful you plot your moves when dealing with large groups of zombies or special zombies. Shooting is good but you have to keep in mind that the zombies will start coming to you the longer you stay in one place shooting rounds off. Interactions with other characters is there but with other survior groups things can be improved upon trading mainly. over all I still stick by my first line and I do suggest this game to someone look for a good zombie survival game with a open world. And there is upcoming DLC for a endless how long can you survive that scales the zombies up the longer you live."

,Recommended,241540,10992559,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Senppuu,"After about 17 hours I finished the campaign, and I enjoyed this game very much!Let me give you all some pros and cons from my perspective:Your mission is to survive and make your stand with others like you, gather supplies and look for shelter is the first thing that comes to mind, and also try to kill everything in a specific area to try and create a ""safe zone"", which is actually impossible since the zombies will eventually spawn there again. I saw a horde spawn right next to me right after I got out of the car once, I disliked this aspect of the game to say the truth, it killed the ""sneaking"" feeling of hunting down and intercepting enemies before they reach the area you just cleared.A car is your best friend in this game, they are just ridiculously over powered. Once you unlock the vehicle delivery radio assistance you are pretty much invincible, that makes the game really fun because you can go out playing bowling simulator with zombies in the streets... But it's a huge con in my opinion, the game gets too easy. A fuel system would be a good idea to implement, and also a specialization system to turn the cars on, it feels really weird that every car in the city is open, with infinite gas and the keys just sitting there in the ignition...When you die you die for real, and since there's not a manual save option in the game make sure to press f4 when you see you're not going to make it... When you die you switch to another survivor from your group which is friendly to you, or if you don't have any friends you just get a random guy. I died once and decided to restart the game, learned my lesson the hard way.Once you progress enough in the game you can relocate your base, the best option is the Snyder Trucking Warehouse. You need at least 12 people in your group to move there, and once it's up and running you are going to feel untouchable, since you can have up to 8 outposts, and the consequence of that is a very big safe zone for you to chill during the zombie apocalypse.Regarding the other survivor groups that appears during the game, the only thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is the fact that you lose trust with them, if for example you approach them with a car, you get a penalty for ""reckless driving"" and they also can catch on fire if you throw a molotov near them, don't even think about using guns, unless you are alone, they will get in your way and get hit. But if you swing a machete or a sledgehammer in their head nothing will happen... It would also be really cool if other survivor groups could attack you, trying to steal your supplies or even your base.You lose stamina and even health as time goes on, the only option to get better is to switch characters and let the other one rest. But most people really don't want to go out playing with another survivor, there should be an option to rest and wake up rested the next day.It's also much more difficult to play in the night, you do have a flashlight, but other than that everything else is completely dark, all you can see are the red eyes of the zombies, and that's awesome! I remember one time when I went on a mission to retrieve a watch for one of the survivors, I had to go to the starting area of the game, and I went there after the sunset and managed to explode my car trying to jump a broken bridge, which attracted a lot of zombies, and there wasn't any other vehicle nearby. All I had with me was an axe and some firecrackers, I had to sneak all my way through the woods, and use the firecrackers to get the attention of the nearby hordes so I could get the damn watch and gtfo of there, I felt like I was in the game at that moment, and that's when I thought, this game is awesome!

,Not Recommended,241540,7779144,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Shadeball,"NOTE: This review is months old so the game might be different (and $10 cheaper) now. To those who think you're being original asking how I can 'not recommend' it with 200 hours logged... it's been remarked upon, check the other comments. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I didn't really recommend it- read the whole review, not just the red thumb, you might decide the positives outweigh the negatives for you. Also, I didn't actively play for 200 hours.State of Decay's a good game, and a mediocre 'simulation.' Unfortunately it insists on trying to be a simulator too much and the result is a flawed game that demands respect but does little to respect the player's time.SOD has an impressive open world with most buildings having multiple entry ports. These buildings are part of the world and require no loading as do some games. This is necessary because at any time you might need to escape into or out of a building as zombies attack. There are also multiple sites for 'home bases' which is nice but are not without problems: restrictions on facilities that don't make sense, barbed wire fences that block players but not zombies, etc.The zombies themself are well-done, and most can be outrun or fought without much difficulty... until the complications start. Like running from one pack of them right into another, or having one come around the corner just as you've used up your last bit of strength. There are also special zombies, some of which tend to be pretty annoying because of their quick lethality and insane hitpoints. I find the zombie hordes to be much more enjoyable, as they lead to more tense moments and thrilling fights\escapes\deaths.There are quite a few characters in the game that can be found or not found randomly in most cases. Sometimes you'll only know one was there when you find a corpse. Others can be recruited and, if you earn enough ""trust"" from them, become playable. This brings up a strange mechanic of the game: who are they trusting? The game does not have a 'main' player character (though you always start as the same guy) and affords no opportunity to create one. Instead the player switches between different survivors encountered. While many of the possible characters have interestings traits and appearances, it would be nice to be able to create one, and this would make more sense mechanically than having a pool of survivors share nebulous resources like 'trust' and 'influence'. It would seem such an idea runs afoul of the designers' narrow philosophical approach to the game; more on that later.Unfortunately many of the random characters end up feeling generic, even to the point of sharing the same voices. Because you can't see someone's traits before recruiting them, it's a crapshoot if you get a useless drunk or a warrior doctor. Since it's not easy to kick people out, one strategy\exploit is to constantly recruit survivors and then purposely kill the weak ones by guiding them into a group of zombies. That such a tactic need exist points to a need for improvement in the game.The quest missions are good, though there are not many of them; most of the time will be taken up by a series of ""SOS"" style requests for assistance that get annoying because of their frequency. It would seem that the survivors whom the player is not controlling exist solely to get in trouble and make the player divert from whatever task he or she was doing and rescue them. It gets very tiring to hear the radio operator keep calling out ""Aren't you going to help our friends"" again and again as you're trying to find the supplies to keep the base going. Also annoying is the fact that there are some quest missions you can let linger for as long as you'd like, and others that resolve (i.e. fail) on their own, but the game doesn't differentiate between the two types for you. This feeds into the idea that the devs wanted to force the player to choose between competing tasks, but ends up just overloading the game and stopping the players from doing what they want... unless you're okay with one of your survivors dying because you were across the map.Guns and other weapons are plentiful and varied, the latter perhaps unnecessarily (how many blunt objects do I really need?). Ammunition is so scarce that it makes some guns nearly useless but there are ways when you want to just open up with an M60. And yes, doing so will draw plenty of zombies, so a silenced .22 pistol is much more effective. Weapons are fun to use in general. Survivors can 'level up' with different weapons, making them seem like an investment, a nice feature that could have been used even more: how about experienced survivors stop needing their hands held?There is no save option (but on exit) and the game enforces permadeath. Moreoever there is a rudimentary 'simulation' (more of a calculation upon restarting the game) that bases itself on how long you've gone without playing and the state of decay (see what I did there?) at the time of quitting. It might just take away a bunch of your influence and resources, or it might cause all sorts of other problems if you had to quit while things weren't hunky-dorey (i.e. without clearing infestations, raising morale, etc). This is the biggest problem I have with the game, as it sits there on my steam shelf threatening me, saying ""if you don't play me now, you might as well never come back."" So I tend not to go back. Changing one's system clock can circumvent the process, but that seems like a ridiculous workaround. While the game slows down time progression after a couple days, it's a very poor choice to have such a mandatory 'feature' for people who may only have a couple hours every few days to play. You'll log in hoping to progress your game, but instead be forced to try and make up lost ground. It hurts what could be a great game to pick up and put down occasionally.The developers want the game played a certain way and stress that they are trying to simulate a zombie apocolypse, rather than make another game like ""Dead Rising."" Unfortunately, SOD doesn't do better as a simulation. The player is always having seemingly every task delegated to him or her, but is expected to play as just another NPC. It's clear that if the player weren't around, things would collapse (at least given what happens when the player logs off to attend to real life for a few days), yet you lose 'influence' (i.e. money) by putting a weapon in storage (the store) and taking it back out again. Again, there is an exploit to avoid this, but there shouldn't need to be one. I could get behind the theme of a zombie game that focuses less on individuality, but I'd want it to be done better; maybe an isometric like Jagged Alliance... except with zombies. It would be nice to see other survivors going about their tasks instead of only hearing from them when they need help, for example.Had the developers made the permadeath, save system and 'simulation' into a recommended or 'hardcore' feature, the game would be quite better off, as would players who could make that choice. The open world, while a little small, is quite good and does feel somewhat populated (particularly before various locales get overrun via the storyline). Walking or driving around feels 'right,' even when it is a little annoying to have to drive across the map.I'd recommend this game to someone who really wants to get addicted; it can make you want to do just one more thing before bed, taking up lots of time. It also does 'open world' quite well. But if you don't have that time available, I would be wary. I came down on the side of ""not recommending"" in general largely because the developers are so strident about their 'vision' that they not only don't include some basic gaming conventions (i.e. save slots), but actively disassociate from them. Just because something is popular doesn't always make it bad, and making something harder doesn't necessarily make it good."

,Recommended,241540,7965117,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,Jonesy,"NOTE: This review is for the original version of State of Decay (which sadly is no longer available for purchase), not the Year One Survival edition.State of Decay is a third-person open-world zombie apocalypse game where you build and fortify a base of operations, recruit survivors, and scavenge for useful items and vehicles. It's a highly addictive, frequently tense, and often action-packed game that exceeded all my expectations, and I strongly recommend it.While you initially start by playing one survivor, as more people are saved and given shelter in your community you'll be able to switch back and forth between a dozen or more playable characters. This becomes a necessity, as survivors will get injured (or even permanently killed) or just flat-out exhausted when performing missions, and will need time to recuperate. Characters have a handful of skills such as melee combat, fitness, or shooting that will level up with use, and some survivors you recruit will even turn out to have special talents, such as an expert gardener who can increase the amount of food supplied by the greenhouse you built at your base, or a munitions expert who can use your workshop to create useful items such as pipe bombs or mines. Your community as a whole has a morale level that you need to keep reasonably high by completing missions and scavenging supplies, or risk adverse results such as a survivor abandoning the group, or even deciding to off themselves. Influence is also measured and plays a huge factor. Provide for and assist the community and you'll be able to equip yourself with better gear from the group's communal supply, convince another survivor to tag along and watch your back, or direct the group's radio operator to keep an ear out for the location of especially needed supplies. Slack by letting missions expire or by failing to scavenge enough useful items, and you'll end up poorly equipped and with minimal clout until you can turn things around.While there's a variety of activities and missions to take part in - rescuing newly discovered survivors and getting them back to base safely; hunting down relatively rare boss zombies (or ""weird ones"" as the characters sometimes refer to them); working your way through several threads of primary story missions; or simply trying to return home in one piece with that valuable case of medicine or that fragile high-end sports car you happened across - there's no doubt that Decay is primarily about fighting zombies. And seeing as how they're virtually everywhere, you can't outrun them beyond short distances (zombies don't get winded, but you definitely will, often at the most inopportune times), stealth is only practical on occasion, and vehicles are too fragile to be used as your main zombie-killing method, you'll be engaging zombies quite frequently whenever you're away from your base. There's a reasonable variety of nicely-done fighting animations. Special combat moves can be unlocked as your skills improve, and that weakling survivor who started out by barely being able to swing a pipe and had trouble defeating even a single zombie without getting gnawed on rather extensively can become a real powerhouse in time, rendering an encounter with a few zombies as nothing more than an annoyance, and even becoming capable of wading into the middle of an entire horde of half a dozen zombies or more and coming out alive (although almost certainly not unscathed). While guns are a relatively common find, making noise in Decay generally leads to bad things happening, so you'll likely be doing most of your killing hand to hand. The noise from bashing in a door or a zombie's skull, the engine of a vehicle, or even just searching through an abandoned house can be enough to alert a nearby zombie or two; firing off a few shots from a pistol, shotgun, or rifle, even one with a suppressor attached, seems to bring every zombie for blocks around running, and is best done only as a last resort, or when you're a few steps away from a nearby vehicle or the safety of your base, or in the handful of story missions where you actually have some significant backup. Fortunately, even though you may do it hundreds of times by game's end, sprinting up to a zombie so you can dropkick it to the ground and then finishing it off by driving your knee through its face never really gets old.It's a thoroughly addictive game, building and improving your base and leveling up your various survivors. It's also often a surprisingly tense one. The game has a day/night cycle, so half the time you're in the dark, and getting a request to clear out a nearby infested warehouse or hunt down a dangerous boss zombie when you can barely see ten feet in front of you is unlikely to be something you'll look forward to. Even during the day, some of the structures you'll enter will be shrouded in darkness, with a zombie unseen (but fortunately usually not unheard) ready to pounce from some dark corner. And of course there's the ever-present threat of permadeath. No matter how badass your survivor is, there's always the possibility that a fight will spiral out of control, that beating one zombie to re-death makes enough noise to alert another, and fighting that one draws in two more, and suddenly routine combat has turned dire and potentially deadly. That one time you keep your injured, exhausted, broken-weaponed, out-of-healing-items survivor out extra long because you're low on influence and you've decided to search one more house for supplies may also be the one time they manage to accidentally alert a nearby horde. Which quite possibly will lead to you becoming an unwilling witness to the rather brutal death animation.Decay is not without some issues. There are minor annoyances, such as the lack of variety in the vehicles, or the fact that despite gasoline being a salvageable resource nobody thought to bring a generator along and you're forced to stumble around your base bumping into walls in the dark with an under-powered flashlight. But there are a few more serious issues as well. At least one side mission failed to trigger. One of my survivors clipped into a piece of furniture and became stuck, forcing me to exit mid-mission and lose progress, while on another occasion a favorite survivor became inexplicably glued to a structure's outside wall, making her a nice easy target for a charging boss zombie and getting her killed (on the final story mission, no less). And the game essentially continues to play after you exit, with the continued, unseen scavenging and activities of the community members simulated the next time the game is launched, and while that lends it an interesting twist, it has a tendency to cause overtly negative events, such as illogical, precipitous morale drops, and some players even reporting returning after an absence to find significant items or survivors themselves having disappeared without even a journal entry of explanation.Ultimately though, those issues have little bearing on the overall experience, and the positives far outweigh any negatives. In short, not only is State of Decay the most enjoyable game I've played in recent memory, it's quite probably my favorite game of 2013."

I was about to date one of the most bomb girl you ever saw. And guess what? What I was doing instead of doing what I was suppose to do? Well, I believe you got it right. Since this is review of State of Decay and I mentioned it just now for the first time, your answer is State of Decay.Alright, enough of sentiment, let's get into the game. Story starts out pretty weak, again with lot of questions and as usual you are just ordinary citizen of small US town and after a while zombie-killing machine. The whole story itself is really not that important, at least wasn't for me, it's about enjoying that zombie rampage, enjoying RPG elements and just trying to survive.Really good thing is, that you can die, your friends can die, people in your house can die but you will take the control of somebody else and you'll continue. That's really awesome. Way more better if it was just ""you die, game over"" cliche. AI is really really weak. No matter if it's zombies or survivors, it's both really low. Survivors are absolutely not independent. It's not like I do mind taking care of somebody else, but thing is that they can't take care of themselves and that's it.Getting supplies, scavenging town, building rooms in your house, upgrading your house,, building new spots and making area secure is one of my most favorite elements out of this game. Audio is not really strong side of State of Decay and visuals are not that good either, but there's no reason to turn away from it.Game will last you estimated 12 +- hours and price point is fair. You can extend that time period by buying two DLCs which are basically worth buying. I will make more in-depth reviews on both on their respective Store Page. So now just few sentences.Breakdown- This DLC does not carry any story, it's just basically let you do infinite survival. You're unlocking different heroes and try to survive as long as possible. Hordes are spawning fast, and supplies going away fast too. When you run out of everything you'll use your RV to get out. And to be honest that's it. Get it for 2,49€ in sale.Lifeline- You are in control of Greyhound One unit on your way to rescue scientists. New map, new characters and new weaponry. It'll extend your gaming experience by 3-4 hours. Linear but still fun. Again, get it in sale and you're good.Get both for achievements.To sum it up, pretty nice zombie survival game for good money, pretty enjoyable and you can play it even second time and still enjoy it. Easy achievements and killing hordes is fun. Weak AI and audio but you can live with that. Most definitely worth the shot.Bonus Point: Wheat FieldsRating: 8/10"

,Recommended,241540,8616502,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,Falem,"State of Decay, is a zombie game that focuses on survival. Population size is dwindling along with the resources you can find throughout the city you explore. Time is not on your side, the world will persist even when you are not playing. Finding a fortifiable location to barricade from zombie hordes is critical to winning the game.ProgressionAs you progress through the story you are given certain facilities to use as your headquarters, once you hit a certain point of the game you are allowed to re-allocate your base.SurvivalThe main game focuses on a balance between survival, difficulty and story. Any character you play can be killed off by zombies and stay dead. There is no way to bring them back other than starting over again or attempting to exit the game before it auto-saves. Some characters clearly have better traits than others especially the first guy you play as. If you let them die, you will be disadvantaged. Training multiple characters to be strong and capable of survival is critical.Breakout DLCThe DLC is survival oriented with the story stripped out, which results in a good experience, not interrupted by constantly redoing cinematics or certain missions over and over. Instead, it allows you to play at your own pace and repair the van to proceed to the next difficulty. Every trip reduces the total amount of resources within the city, scales the damage of the enemies up, and reduces the amount of cars available.Persistent WorldA major con to some people but also appealing to others is the persistent world. Alot of people dislike the fact that while you're away from the game the resources are depleting every day. The people who play more hours a day have a much greater benefit than those who play few hours or attempt to play it casually."

Base building is super shallow and relationships between survivors are nonexistent. AI is atrocious for survivors and zombies. If you're in a siege mission, then all your AI companions do is stand still and board up windows while the only thing that zombies do is attack the boarded windows. Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't enter the house, they just ram into it which damages the boards. You literally have to exit the house and kill the zombies outside to progress things.Your survivors constantly go missing/get stuck/need to be rescued, hordes constantly spawn, infestations constantly spawn, special zombies constantly spawn, etc. The game simulates itself when you're not playing it so if you don't want to come back to a game where all your neighbors are dead, all your supplies are drained, and your group is missing, then enjoy babysitting constantly to quit the game on a good note. You can also just keep the game indefinitely paused to prevent this.There are few home sites, and only 2 of them are any good.Scavenging is pointless if you play for long periods of time. Despite having a day/night cycle, days only pass during simulation. Supplies only drain when you're not playing the game and you can easily overstock on everything in about 30-45 minutes.The game is also incredibly easy. After clocking in about 30 hours, I only died once and that's because I was trying to make my experience as hard as possible.Mechanics are easily abusable. Stuck alone with no health and a feral chasing you? Switch to a character in your home base and then switch back to your character. He/she will teleport immediately back to base.Game is very short too. You can easily beat it in 8-10 hours.I guess the best thing I can say is the port is very faithful to the 360 original. They even ported over all the bugs and glitches!Almost nothing has changed in this game from when it was an Early Access title to a full fledged release.

Then you will have a home base where you and other survivors making a stand against the undead. From there, the sandbox play begins. Your home base is where you and your others survivors live, obviously, and it needs supplies to survive. You need to hunt and raid outside to get supplies like foods, medicines, building materials, ammunitions, weapons or fuels. Your home base can also be improved, you can build a workshop, garden, sleeping area and more as long as your home base has the space for them. You can move out from your current home base and find a new bigger or better one too. When you're out there hunting, you may find some neighboring survivors or survivors who may want to join you in your home base. You will also find some driveable civilian vehicles which can also be used as cargo for your scavenged supplies for you to bring home. Your home base will sometimes attacked by approaching zombie hordes. You will need to set up some outpost to defend against these living dead hordes. Outpost will also create a small safe zone outside your home for you to take shelter.In State of Decay, survivors can become tired, injured or sick. When that happen to survivors you currently play, better get home and switch to another survivors. Yes, you can switch characters when you have become friends with them. If a survivor gets tired, his/her max stamina will decrease, same goes when he/she is injured. Survivors will also gain some experience and skill as you play with them, such as cardio, wits (ability to search faster but quiet), fighting, shooting and more. But beware if your survivors is killed, their death is permanent. Survivors can be equipped with melee or firearms, whichever you prefer, but melee weapons will gets damaged over time and will be destroyed if not repaired. Firearms can also gets damaged and if not repaired, will become jammed but not destroyed.Graphics of State of Decay is great, looks good, but not one of those next generation thing. Using CryEngine 3, State of Decay does have good environment view, lightning, good textures, physics and effects. Characters animations are great, when dodging zombies, attacking with melee, it's good. Blood and gore effects are also present in this game, in fact, you can see your survivors getting torn in 2 pieces by the zombies.State of Decay performance is good, but can use more optimization. At maximum setting, the game sometimes but rarely stutters which can ruin your aim when using a gun. Aiming a gun also seems clumsy and quite hard. Otherwise the performance is good and fine.If you're looking for more friendly zombie apocalypse game, then State of Decay is for you, since the game is single player only, you won't find yourself get shot from the back by somebody when you just spawn in the game. With deep gameplay mechanics, State of Decay can entertain you for many hours. I recommend this.Rating 9/10"

,Recommended,241540,12588432,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,cruinne,"I've been playing Undead Labs's State of Decay for the past several weeks after nabbing it on sale. The game is a single-player third-person zombie apocalypse sandbox of sorts: while the main game has a storyline to follow, you certainly don't need to follow it and the story won't advance until you do, giving you a lot of time to just poke around.I have enjoyed the game very much.  It's certainly interesting enough to play and while it starts out reasonably tame, it can get quite difficult.The main game begins with your character and a buddy returning to the more civilization-adjacent parts of a national park after a two-week fishing trip only to find that, while you were gone, civilization kind of had a major meltdown.  From there, the game focuses on steath and survival by building up friendships with others and establishing a base from which to operate and outposts to reinforce that base and provide small ""safe zones"".CriticismsThe criticisms I have are somewhat picky.  To start, the story is very simple and somewhat shallow — it would be easy to play through it relatively quickly and then be just done with the game.  A lot more could have been done, but, as I understand it this was Undead Labs's first game, and it was made for XBox Arcade with all the limitations that requires -- so we will perhaps see more story development in their next full release.Second, there just isn't enough information in the tutorial; you feel bombarded with information (because a lot comes in through your Journal) that you can't make much sense of — and then lost because basic information (such as the benefits of establishing an Outpost, or whether it's wise to leave resources in Outposts or loot them thoroughly before setting one up in a location) can be a little difficult to find.Third, there are too few voice actors, meaning that you end up with the same voice actors' lines being used for several different characters who end up sounding exactly the same while they say (verbatim) the same things; get two of them with the same voice together on a mission and it can get kind of confusing.Finally: the driving physics and UI need some work.  The game was set up for XBox, so maybe this is where PC players like me start to have problems.  But while I can play Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto and drive just fine, I find the driving in State of Decay frustrating — especially because the smallest mistake can send a car sailing through the air as though it suddenly weighs nothing.  And cars that turn over always explode, so there's that.PraiseMeanwhile, though, State of Decay is nice to look at: the colors are just muted enough to evoke the proper autumn at the end-of-the-world feeling, and there has been a lot of attention to detail in filling out the large area (Trumbull Valley) in which your character gets to roam.  There are three small towns to explore, as well as a lot of countryside, with a lot of interesting things to look at if you appreciate the details.The game also makes you take a step back and figure out how to survive.  Your character can go stealth or maniac, or pretty much anything in between.  But don't count on the zombies to cooperate since that's sure to get your favorite character eaten nearly every time.  And since death is final, that really makes a difference.Strategy and sound are important, which I really enjoy, and on top of that there is also resource management to deal with: you've got a base full of survivors who need food, medicine, and ammunition to remain survivors, and construction materials to keep their base up.  Scavenging through the zombie-infested, burnt-out world is a constant necessity.In the end, the game is definitely worth a few bucks (especially if you can catch it on sale), and I look forward to other games from Undead Labs.Breakdown DLCI've played several hours of the Breakdown DLC (at level 5, currently), and it's been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration, but the frustration really seems to be the point of it.  It's primarily the sandbox version of the base game, with a couple simple tasks to do to ""move to the next level"".  Each level, the zombies get more numerous and more difficult to deal with and the scavenge-able resources get harder to find.If you don't mind that sort of challenge — the one where you are pretty sure you'll ultimately fail — it can end up being a lot of fun."

Driving is fairly straightforward, though you can't drive through barriers, making you have to look for the long way around some areas. Honestly, it's a port of an arcade game, so what can you really expect in this regard.There's a permadeath feature in this game, which is an interesting feature, but it serves to highlight State of Decay's biggest problem. There's no reason to care about anyone apart from the intro characters because you'll quickly realize that, past some scripted events at the starting base, dialogue between survivors is generic, and the only real personality you get out of any of them is via their stats sheet.If the people we're supposed to care about in your game/show/movie/whatever don't have unique personalities,we have ZERO reason to care about whether they live or die.If we can't care about the characters, we can't care about the story they're in. And that's what happened to me. I quit just after getting a new base,TL;DR - An open world zombie survival game where the humans have about as much showable personality as the zombies, possibly even less.  Skip it."

The game starts well with you straight in the thick of it, which almost made up for the bad cut scenes where my character's feet are glued to the floor. Nothing is explained: the whole inventory, skills, crafting menus are left for you to faff about with until you get the hang of them. The only skill you really need however is inventory management in order to shuffle around all the semi-useless tat you find and carry: putting them in bags, putting them in backpacks, putting things in car boots, driving somewhere and unloading it all again. It's like a packing-for-holiday simulator without the holiday.Friends help out, but sometimes run back to base for no reason. Others won't let you be their friends but occasionally get sad, even though you're doing all the work. You scavenge the same building four times in one street. The same four lines of dialogue are heard again and again. Enemies spawn endlessly from quest locations. On and on and on.Finally comes the best surprise: the game plays itself when you turn it off. All your tiredness goes away (hurrah!), all your stockpiling runs out and all your barracades are taken down (not so hurrah). So that's SOD: it's like my day job. I work hard while others do nothing but get tired, sad or both, the work mounts up faster than I can deal with it, and if I take a day off, I'm twice as busy when I get back.4/10."

,Not Recommended,241540,31576905,Posted: 6 May,all,Bhard the Tryhard,"While I originally enjoyed my experience with the game, while also getting it at a good price, I find the choice of the developers distasteful. They left the game a bit of a buggy mess, and pretty much dropped all support for it after they released the YOSE version of the game, which also has a few extra bells and whistles that this version of the game does not have. This forces any loyal players to have to buy the game again in order to get those bells and whistles. Anyway, on to the game:You start off on a camping trip to the forest of a small town with a buddy of yours, when suddenly the zombies come. Fighting them off, you decide to find out what happened, as you had been away from the civilized world for some time. You meet others, and find out that whatever this thing was, it was widespread. The whole town had been infected, only leaving small groups of survivors. I will say no more to prevent story spoilers.The main gameplay aspect of this game is probably the base building. You start off with a little base but could move it to a more suitable location, of which there are many. From wherever your base is, your main goal is to pretty much go through the story as you upgrade your base, kill zombies for XP to level up and to gain new abilities, and get supplies to upgrade your base. I know it might sound a bit boring but it can be pretty fun. Especially at night, when it gets even spookier. Not to mention there are special zombies, that can mess you up real good. This makes clearing out buildings full of zombies even more challenging, and if you're easily frightened then you'll be in for a bad time as well.One honorable mention is the cars. They're very fun to drive in my opinion, especially when mowing down a horde of zombies with a truck. Just keep an eye on the cars durability. You don't want to lose the survivor you're playing as (you can choose to switch between survivors - useful for when your main survivor is killed or injured.)No score for this one since you can't buy it anymore. Just felt like it should be reviewed."

But before I get ahead of myself lets break it down.Graphics are fairly good in my opinion. The specular maps aren't really anything to write home about and the texture resolution will not light the world on fire but for the price and from a small developer they did alright.The sound if pretty satisfying. Different guns and bomb have a variety of splody sounds and I'm not really one to care too much about bass or presence...my gaming rig doesn't even have a sound card O_oStoryline is fairly simple. In the campaign you are a survivor with a friend camping in the mountains when you realize the world has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ You meet up with other survivors, find shelter and have quest missions while you try and figure out how to get out of town for good...blah blah blah. To be honest I found the storyline campaign long, and annoying. Far too linear and the fetch quests became really annoying after a while. The rest of this review deals solely with Break Down.Breakdown is the sandbox version of the story campaign with ALL of the storyline elements and quests removed. It lets you set up a base, and ""outposts"" around the town that provide a ""safe area"" where zombies can't spawn into. These outposts can be set up around, food, medical, ammo, or building supplies which can give a bonus to your total supply cache.Scavenging is the major function of this game. Search houses, find anything helpful and take it back to the group. The player is rewarded with ""influence"" points that allow them to set up more outposts, relocate the base, or perform special actions from special characters within their group. A military character will have an ""artillery strike"" option. A priest has ""words of encouragement"" that can remove negative fatigue status from a character. Influence is also needed to remove any supplies a player might take on a scavenging run, guns, ammo, melee weapons, medical supplies or food.Break down's goal is to survive until the ""escape RV"" is located, fixed and supplied. The player then chooses a small group of characters to get on the RV and leave the town. You are then randomly spawned back into the same town and the difficulty increases. More zombies, fewer supplies, harder special zombies.There are a LOT of zombies as well as special zombies. Combat becomes a balance of choosing the right weapon for the right characters. (ie: matching the proper weapons with a characters stats.) Using the right moves in combat that will maximize damage output while minimizing the use of stamina. You will meet randomly generated NPC characters that can join your group. The player is capable of switching between characters and infact HAS to in order for previous characters to rest, or heal from wounds.This is where the tedium comes in. State of Decay is full of crap, awful characters. You will find drunks, slobs, jerks, sleazeballs and s luts. None of whom will aid you in your survival. You have a maximum number of characters that your base can support and the game quickly turns into a macabre ""culling"" of the ""dead weight"" from your group. You can and will take characters out on supply runs and make sure they your ally never returns. Or you may just take direct control of a character and throw them off a cliff to break a leg and be eaten by zombies. You won't do this once, or twice. You will do this as many time as it takes, until the game spawns good characters. The problem is that you don't know the stats of survivors you invite to join you...until they have joined you.This can become mind numbingly boring. The environments are HUGE and mostly empty. You will drive for miles into the country, past farms and fields. There are only two towns in the game. Missions and friendly ""enclaves"" spawn randomly so if you are in the southern most town you can receive a quest on the other end of the freaking map...hope you like driving.Another issue is that the game had ""Early Access"" and I believe it also had a beta and there are still tons of glitches and flaws in this game. There is an active game forum on their website. You can report glitches and the staff is usually quick to respond but I hate small developers turning paying customers into their own game testers. I've been a game tester before and if I'm reproducing a bug for a developer...I'm getting paid for it.State of Decay Vanilla had tons of bugs, many that crashed the game. Before those were fixed, Break Down DLC came out. The bugs still haven't been fixed and they are releasing their second DLC.Inconclusion, I guess I can't recommend State of Decay. If you can get it bundled 75% off or more on a steam sale or humble indie bundle, go for it. But full price...noooooo."

Oh, don't we see them so often? The answer is: Yes, HOWEVER, this game takes a new and interesting approach to the apocolypse. Nevermind finding a cure or trying to leave town to some place nice and quiet; State of Decay forces you into a world where the main focus is to fortify a home/base and to live off the surrounding, sometimes desolate buildings. Find food, feed your community members. Find materials, upgrade your base. Find oil, power your generator. Find ammo, defend yourselves from the shambling remains of what used to be your average Joe. Find and rescue other survivors, convince them to join your community. Survive as long as you could as a community. This game makes it clear you need a hand in the end of the world. Now, let's not get too off-topic - this is a review. This brings the question: So why should I get this game?Well, although this game had a so-so port from Xbox to PC, although it has semi-frequent glitches, and although it has rather repetetive dialogue, the game makes up for this in many other aspects. I can play this for hours on end, but for the sake of my mental health, I keep each session under 4 hours. This game is great fun, and it can seriously get nerve racking at certain points, whether from the plot or from you just scavenging a town alone. There hasn't been one point in this entire game that I didn't enjoy spending time in the destroyed world that remains. After all, you don't choose the world you live in, but you choose what role you will play in said world.All being said, I highly recommend you give this game a go, and if you like it, get the DLC (but we'll leave the DLC for another review or two)."

Not to mention poor collision detection,  poor driving controls but the biggest issues come from Lily herself, she'll literally nag you constantly with mission after mission, to a point you want to shoot her yourself, she literally gives you no peace or personal time to explore with her nagging.Then comes the problems with the actual zombies themselves, frankly - there are too many of them.  Since they use automatic respawning points,  you're never just fighting one zombie so when you kill one,  you can be pretty sure another two or three have respawn behind you.Back in 2013, this game would have definately received positive feedback - it is fairly impressive for that generation.  But for 2017, this game just hasn't aged well at all and shows clearly many many faults -  I hope that State of Decay 2 can improve on this and deliver a great game,  just avoid all the problems that prevented this from being amazing."

The simple fact that normal things like basic replayability was sold to us as DLC was absurd enough, but the hostility of their community managers towards the earlier critics of the game is what caught my interest most of all as I take a keen interest in the use of suppression tactics against gaming media who aren't part of the sycophantic love-bomb crowd. You can tell a lot about developers and companies based on the way they handle criticism. Some people, like Squad, will cyber stalk their critics and try to 'expose' them for past misdeeds (in their eyes), others will wear it and even address it and repair their game improving it's standards. In the case of State of Decay it seemed they would actively delete any criticisms they encountered which left me far more cynical of their game overall. But even with a fanboy attitude when I first discovered the game it was another 'great potential, poor execution' zombie game, sadly. :("

It was a fun zombie beat em up, and a so / so story that kept the game moving at a decent pace.  Some radiant quests to grind and get items from, but mostly get repetative and annoying.  If you play on Steam, use a controller to make your life easier.The base building aspect was more of a UI menu selecting upgrades, and X amount of supplies on hand and Y time later, the upgrades were visible in your fort.  It was mostly a moot point, as you move from base to base with the progression of the story faster than waiting around to build up that fort.  Anyways, I played through the game, which says something, considering most games like this get boring after 10 minutes.  There is about 20 hours of game play.  You can probably finish in a couple if you power through it.  Story and character interaction was alright, but not immersive.  The game is more about beating up those zombies and powering through the short story.  There were a few memorable missions, like the zombie siege at the farm house.  Total experience back in the day?  7/10.So why no recommendation?  Well, the devs promised us localized co-op, and we never got it.  The game would have been amazing if I could play co-op with friends.This title is also the original standard edition.  After support ended, and computers got new hardware and operating systems, the game didn't run well anymore, if at all.  To add insult to injury, the developer re-released this game and the DLC as a ""special edition"".  The bugs were fixed, the textures were up-ressed, all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that were embedded in the original textures by the disgruntled contract artist the developer screwed over were erased, and a $29.99 price tag was slapped on it showing just how much the developer cares about its customers.  Those that bought the game on steam, myself included, were not happy that they had to buy the game on steam a second time in order to have a working game, that is no different than the one previously bought, just up-ressed no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥textures and bug fixes...Now State of Decay 2 is coming out on XBOX, and I hope this review finds more readers and suades them not to trust in a bad company.

,Recommended,241540,1808210,"Posted: 21 September, 2013",all,Spooky Pleb,"State of Decay is the open-world third person apocalyptic survival game that I have waited for this whole generation, Day Z and Dead Island were close for me but they both lacked a few things here and there. While DayZ had survival, Dead Island had the world and mechanics, State of Decay have both of these aspects, and pull them off very successfully.You quickly realize that the game push a lot of information at you the first few hours, like every home base can only have so many structures, do you want more sleeping areas to keep the characters in the camp rested? Or maybe you want a library to research some better medical aid for when someone get hurt? From this point on the game becomes very dark, it will test your moral. And rightfully so.Every now and then you stumble across new survivors, complete strangers in need of help. What are you going to do? Do you help them and risk running out of food? Or do you save them in hope of finding a few food supplies?This also takes us back to the base aspect, you could build a garden instead of a library or sleeping area, as this will give you food daily. Because food each day must be good right? Yes, it is, but if you don't have enough beds for everyone, each character will slow but sure get tired, fatigued. This goes for your playable characters as well as NPCs in the camp.If a player character don't rest after a while of exploring, the stamina will decrease, making you worse in combat and increase the chance of dying. Death is permanent, and there is no save/reload feature to abuse. The game autosaves after each finished mission, and that is it.The less playable characters you have available, the harder the game gets, because you have less to pick from when the others need a few hours in the bed to rest.Keeping a character alive and well will not only serve as a jump option, but they also gain skills and level up depending on what they do. Melee combat? Increase the fighting skill, making you more efficient with melee weapons. Same goes for guns, looting etc.However should you be unlucky and die, the items you got on you can be retrieved with another character, so don't panic!You will meet tough situations where people you know get infected, and we all know how to ""fix"" that problem. It can be a hard call, depending on the connection with each individual character, the NPC can get overrun while on a supply run you called in, and if you don't help them, may they RIP.The game consistently keeps throwing missions/tasks at you, you have to prioritize, which is more important? Save this guy? Or scout this area to call out locations of meds, zeds or maybe you want to find out what the Army is up to.The story is also pretty well put together, i keeps you interested, and makes you feel connected with the characters living in the world, making you feel the need to help (most) of them. Helping other survivor outposts will also benefit resources like ammunition, food, construction material etc. But how you play in the world also affect how everyone in the world watch you, reckless driving is negative and will make everyone look at you in a bad way, same goes for reckless shooting. But in the end, it's all about survival, keeping morale up, food on the table and killing the zeds!"

,Recommended,241540,13225333,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,ownosourus,"State of Decay certainly doesn't waste any time. Mere seconds past the Start screen, it throws you headlong into a zombie apocalypse in full bloom. Tree branch in hand, you clobber the shambling corpses attempting to munch on your screaming camping buddy, and then seek out the few remaining survivors while scrounging for supplies, weapons, and ever-safer home bases. That's just the first 20 minutes, but the core of State of Decay's gameplay never changes as you make your way through its open world and battle an endless cast of zombies. State of Decay finds its soul in the dreary repetition of apocalyptic survival.State of Decay's open world manages a substantial degree of immersion, complete with an expansive and occasionally intimidating map and the ability to drive cars freely across the landscape. The cars handle poorly, but the ability to use them to mow down roving zombie swarms offers a malicious satisfaction. You quickly learn to fight zombies only if you absolutely have to in State of Decay, and therein lies much of its appeal. This is not a game about Bruce Campbell badassing about in Evil Dead; it's a celebration of the normal person and all of his or her associated weaknesses. Some of the characters you come across have no combat experience at all.Death is permanent in State of Decay, which means that even characters with fully voiced storylines and unique dialogue die forever if you let them get overrun. From there, you can only continue through the eyes of another character you've befriended.Few things add more tension to State of Decay than the terrifying noise guns make, because a single foolish shot can bring an unmanageable horde upon you.Permanent death is a smart addition, though, since losing characters with high skills across the board carries with it a real sense of loss, particularly if their voice quests and customized responses in some quests led you to believe they were an essential character. Sometimes they don't even have to die in the field; if a character you've been controlling sustains enough injuries--a few undead chomps don't result in instant zombification in State of Decay--he'll lie bedridden and useless at your home base. The good news is that the need to rest and switch out characters results in you amassing a balanced group of playable characters anyway.It's a bit strange that a game that places such a heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships should have no cooperative mode. You spend your time with State of Decay alone, joining up with other NPCs only for specialized quests and escort missions that bring other survivors back to your current base camp. It's especially odd since State of Decay starts out with a party of two, suggesting that you'll always have a buddy at your side if need be.State of Decay serves up a near constant barrage of suspense and immersion that leaves even the briefest jaunts away from your home base tinged with the threat of death. Its flaws are numerous and impossible to ignore, but in spite of them, State of Decay is a captivating survival adventure set in a bleak and harrowing world."

Takes some getting used to the menus and features, but is well worth taking the time and effort. A few features are annoying, like the frequency of random events and requests bogging down the ability to just explore and enjoy (it seems the developers are more used to creating quest-driven games and aren't too comfortable with open worlds), and there are some bugs that the dev team seems uninterested in addressing. But the game is otherwise so fine I'm willing to put up with these.So why not recommended? Because this is sadly a classic case of a company taking horrid, blatant advantage of their supporters. I bought the game in early access PC port mode, and what do us loyal fans get in return? Refusals to fix bugs, DLC that adds very little and refuses to fix bugs, and then a massive re-release that is just a slight visual upgrade that yet again refuses to address bugs and - big surprise - early access peeps don't get access to.Newsflash, video game developers: Giving someone early access is an implicit contract that (1) you will actually finish the game, and (2) your early supporters are supplied with upgraded versions as the game further develops.Undead Labs has clearly decided to abandon their project and just soak up whatever money they can from the suckers. It is painfully obvious they had no intention to actually finish the game once the money started rolling in. They - and especially founder Jeff Stray - are dead to me. I will henceforth blacklist any game they put out (assuming the unlikely outcome that they produce any more), as well as any Xbox port to PC, and anything Jeff Stray or other leaders of this offensive scam ever attemt to do in the future.

If they sell their update as dlc I'll change my vote but for now screw those greedy sobs"
,Recommended,241540,12387419,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,NakedSpaceMan,"This review is based on playing the game with all DLC:Quite frankly one of the best zombie survival games I've played in an extremely long time. While it suffers from some bizzare design choices, it still as a whole presents a zombie survival simulator that isn't just about bashing zombie's brains in.The base game:The base game with no DLC is a solid experience. It starts you off in a tutorial area to teach you the basics of the game, killing zombies. When it comes to interaction with zombies you have three choices. Fight, run, or sneak by. Fighting is pretty good in the game but it kinda suffers from dependancy on weapons. The game does have abilities for the survivors to use their own physical skills like punching and kicking to take out zombies, but they don't do much damage. You're basically forced to use a weapon, whether it be a melee weapon or a gun. But since finding a weapon is extremely easy, that's not necessarily a bad thing.Using guns also is a great experience. Each weapon feels distinctive and while some are weak like low caliber pistols, others make you feel like Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead. Guns also adhear to a noise system. If you fire a gun, you attract zombies from far and wide. However guns are extremely powerful against the special zombies in the game so the balance of when to and when not to use a gun is a constant concern.As said before, there are special zombies in the game. If you've played Left 4 Dead you probably know what to expect. The tank, the attracter, the predator, and the stunner. There are other special types, but they're basically just regular zombies that can't be killed by guns. And while it's starting to get annoying for zombie games to always have special zombie types, at least in State of Decay they're more rarer than in other games.Next is my most favorite part of the game, base and resource management. In the game, just like in real life, there's a constant need for materials. Whether it be food or construction materials or ammo, your community needs supplies in order to stay alive. If you don't keep up with the demand, your base will fall. There's no work around, you have to scavenge houses and buisnesses to find supplies. When you do find supply crates you have two options, you can carry the crate in a pack on your back and take it back to base for upkeep in your base or you can break it open and put whatever's inside into storage at base. You don't get upkeep on your base but you get what's inside, be it ammo or food or whatever it may have.Finally there's the story. The game takes place at the near beginning of the zombie apocalypse. You and your friends have to work together to survive as long as you can while trying to figure out a way out of the valley you're trapped in. Along the way you meet other survivors. Some you can recruit into your community to help you while others have their own thing going that you can be friends with, or enemies. Doing most of the side missions involving the other communities are optional but if you help them, they'll help you with all sorts of abilites. One for example can drop motars on a group of zombies while another can deliever a car wherever you need. The main storyline is also very well made with an end game challenge that actually made me want to rage quit, something that rarely happens anymore with games getting easier. The ending also is extremely great considering what's on the horizon for the developer that made the game, Undead Labs. I won't spoil it for you but let's just say if you love the game and want more when the sequel comes out, it may be worth it to get an Xbox ONE, assuming of course Microsoft keeps it's word and makes the sequel Xbox exclusive.Now for those bizzare design choices I mentioned. As I said before, base management is my favorite part of the game. But unfortunately the tutorial is a little lack luster and sometimes confusing. It sometimes explains too much in some areas without explaining enough in others. What's the benefit of having construction A in the base over construction B? Also the choice of allowing the safe zone to become so big through the establishment of outposts is kinda weird to me. Don't get me wrong, not having to worry about my base while I'm across the map is great, but it kinda takes away the fear of being overrun in a setting that's absolutely perfect for that kind of fear.All in all, it's still worth buying just for the base game alone. Especially when it's on sale and even more especially if you decide to use some mods for the game.Breakdown DLC:This DLC alone is worth buying the game. It's basically the base game except there's no time constrictons and you're free to do whatever you want. The challenge is unlocking all the playable characters through certain actions. In the first playthrough you have to say, kill 5 special zombies to unlock a character. Overtime you'll unlock all the characters you can in that playthough and be allowed to move up to the next. In level 2, zombies are harder to kill and there's more special infected. But there's more challenges, unlocking better survivors. The constant challenge of an increasingly harder game is alone worth playing while unlocking the better newer characters is just a great cherry on top. While some have criticize the DLC for not doing much in terms of changing the game, I say it's perfect for those that want a long term challenge.Lifeline DLC:This DLC quite frankly will test everything you learned from the other parts of the game. This time it's an entirely new campaign you'll be playing. No old characters are rehashed and you even play in a new map. Quite possibly the worst case scenario map to play in a game like this, an urban city. Zombies are EVERYWHERE! Sneaking is now not just an option, it's a necessity in this densily populated area. The campaign is also surperb in delivery based on what characters you play as and the base building and maintaining is still my most favorite part. But the biggest challenge is, again the population of the map. Firing weapons is just a big no no on this map as every zombie within a mile is gonna hear it, even though ironically you start off with all the guns and ammo you could ask for. If you're looking for the ultimate challenge in urban zombie survival, this is the DLC for you. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling in terror about all the zombies running at you."

,Recommended,241540,14103868,"Posted: 21 January, 2015",all,Gosedre,"This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management. The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak. You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play. I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable. That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me. Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break. There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation. While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone. The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game. The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore. The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner. Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time. Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done. You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done. You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around). In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags). Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made). Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory. If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time. There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more. But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way. The fit the game really well. As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part. Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up. Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable. The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game. You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest. Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point. One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable. There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game. Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me."

76561198000637424,Recommended,241540,8109599,"Posted: 18 December, 2013",all,[FGN] Glory to Arstotska,"If anyone remembers the incomplete indie zombie survival game, Fort Zombie, State of Decay can be said to pretty much be its spiritual successor, and quite a successor it is. Its awesome! Like any game though, it has its ups and downs.- The game captures some incredible survival atmosphere. Scavenging to survive and keeping quiet while doing so is the key to gathering massive tons of precious loot. Such loot is not infinite, even if seemingly abundunt in the beginning, albiet difficult to get to sometimes with so many zombies on the prowl. The game tries to make it difficult but its quite easily beat once you learn the controls and how you manage your play. The minimap also makes it a little easier to spot zombies before they come for you.- Sound is your greatest enemy. The louder the sound, the more zombies you'll attract, and its almost impossible to come out of a running horde's charge unscathed (unless you're willing to waste precious ammo, or are smart enough to lure them into the radius of an outpost). This mechanic makes it that more fun and challenging to play around with, since almost everything you do will produce some kind of sound. That being said, its a good idea to be smart and patient. Sometimes, its better to walk than to drive a car, and better to melee than shooting a gun.- Guns are somehow easily obtainable from midgame onwards, although many dont account to anything unless you make headshots count. Missing or shooting without a silencer is almost a sure fire way of getting yourself swarmed. Two words that describe the ultimate in the late game finale: grenade launcher!- Every survivor is unique. Nobody looks the same as the other. Their initial skills and specialities also vary greatly, with some colourful extra skills to give that survivor their own unique flavour. You can switch to almost ANYBODY you pick up, as long as you take the time to earn their trust through missions and good deeds first. A number of the voiceovers for survivors are recycled, though, unless if its a major NPC with special dialogue. My other gripe is that its impossible to trade between characters. Stuff can only be traded through the stash and character switching.- Death is horrifyingly gruesome. When your health bar depletes, you go into a kind of button mashing recovery mode with all these zombies ripping at you. When you recover, your max health is reduced. Go down again and it will keep decreasing as they keep hitting you. When it reaches zero, your hapless survivor literally gets torn apart. Once you see it (for the achievement), you probably wont want to see it again. Its also a waste of a very precious resource. Your survivors are the ones that get things done, and losing them will make it a lot more difficult to play. Unlike loot, getting survivors to join you can also be quite difficult after a certain point. You'll also have to think about the amount of living space and food supply you have in your base. If you dont have enough, it will cause people to leave.- Missions can be repetitive, but its always fun to work out how to best tackle a situation without using too many meds or foods to boost health or stamina, or whether to stealth it or charge it. When you swing a melee weapon or perform executions on zombies, you use some stamina, which can quickly deplete if you're swarmed. No stamina almost always means a quick death if without food. Seriously. You wont even be able run away.- Although its already in a final build, there are still issues with clipping. Zombies and survivors get stuck in walls and in the ground. They wont be stuck for long, at least from what I have experianced. So far, its mostly tolerable.- After finishing the main storyline, you can purchase the DLC for a kind of endless sandbox game. The objective is to survive as long as possible. Moving bases will increase the difficulty, though Im not sure how. Im on the verge of completing the main campaign at this moment, and will be down for one of these soonish.Overall, I will give this game an 8/10. As far as single player zombie survival games go, I would think that this is what a proper one should look and play like. It would be interesting, however, to see how a game like this could fare as a multiplayer game. I would think that a number of player controlled communities, each competing for scavenged loot in an area, could make things even more interesting."

Has 10 levels which goes insanely hard with the last two levels, where you have pretty much no resources to work with, large strong zombie crowds and special infected everywhere.LifeLine - DLC (8/10)Plays near a infested city with a new story arc and characters.

,Recommended,241540,8569510,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,Cosmic Engine,"Disclaimer - Please note I have played and completed the Xbox 360 version prior to picking the game up on steam. You can also watch the video review here -http://youtu.be/mUuRTqf5j0sState of decay's core strengths lay within it's actual game play, it's clear early on in the game that undead labs wanted to ensure the game had a solid framework rather than just focusing on the cosmetic appeal of the genre. At its core state of decay is a survival game. I'll talk more about the games story later in the video but needless to say, you start the game and find yourself in the middle of a most unpleasant of zombie apocalypses.Stealth is key to survival in state of decay, and the game provides a variety of mechanics for you to utilize to make sure you don't find yourself surrounded by the undead hordes. Your bog standard zombie in SOD isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, their eyesight is very poor, out of sight really is out of mind in the game. The enemies do have an acute sense of hearing however, the game visually feedbacks how much noise your making, whether your searching through cupboards or breaking down locked doors, best to be as quiet as possible or you will literally have the unwashed masses at your front door in no time. Throughout the game it is often easier to kill the standard zombie by stealth kills or building yourself so very fine traps. Though noise is your worst enemy it can be your greatest ally, creating distractions with a variety of tools, can be a great way of getting out of a particularly sticky situation.One of the great things about state of decay is that its not just you versus the world. There are a lot of survivors out there and you'll eventually get to become part of a survivor community. Your community has its own base and number of people and these too things require attention. Lets start with bases, there are a number of locations in the game world that can be used as a base. You can only have one base at a time. Each base location varies in size and that’s important because as your community grows so too will the need for beds and space. Bases can be upgraded in a variety of ways, from self sustaining food gardens to guard towers, choosing what you need is crucial as space is limited. Upgrading your defences and keeping your base well stocked and guarded is important too, bases will get attacked frequently, they can be overrun and people can and will die.The survivors at your base also will need attention too. They need food, medical supplies and ammunition. Each survivor in your community has needs and desires, you wont please everyone, but its somewhat beneficial to at least try. Each survivor has an affection rating towards you, once you become friends with a survivor, that character becomes a player character meaning you can switch between characters at any time, especially useful when one becomes too fatigued to be any good in the field. The survivors in your community can be used to go out on computer controlled scavenging runs as well as used as companions to take out with you. Survivors have their own stories and ongoing lives, occasionally they will ask you to do something for them, whether it be deal with a zombie or a more side quest esc personal mission. Doing these side quests for your survivors improves your relationship with them and this is the way you will eventually be able to control them yourself.Other survivor communities populate the landscape too, you can interact with these in a variety of ways from doing missions for them to trading. Trading in state of decay works off an influence system, every-time you do missions, kill zombies etc etc your earn influence points, these influence points can then be used to purchase ammo, weapons and supplies from the survivor communities. You also need influence points to upgrade your base structures as well as a variety of scavenged resources. Sometimes you may even have the option to add some survivor communities to your own, but beware things might get a bit cramped if you don’t have the space and NPC's can have fall outs with each other, the walking dead style.One thing I really like about the game is in its RPG elements, each player character has four base skills, Cardio, wits, fighting and shooting. On top of that each individual character has a set of personal skills and traits. Take the fighting skill, this skill covers melee fighting and overall hit points. By using melee weapons on a character a lot of the time this skill will start to increase and unlock more stat bonuses. By doing certain actions a lot with a certain character this may also unlock personal traits, that add traits to that individual too, for example if you have a character that you use to scavenge a lot, you may develop a personal trait that adds a reduction to the time it takes to scavenge.The game world itself is pretty extensive for a smaller title, you have around 8 square kilometres of playable area to go explore at your will. The world ranges from very American mid west countryside to more urbanised areas. The game also features dynamic progression, meaning even when your not playing, the world is still changing, after all just because your sleeping doesn't mean those zombies are. Its important to leave your bases well stocked before you leave the game or you may load up to an abandoned base with a lot of bodies.There's a good enemy variety in the game to boot, not all zombies are brain dead walkers. There are a number of special zombies which are more of a challenge to take down. In some cases when facing specials it can be better to run to live to fight another day, especially if your low an ammo, especially if your facing the hulk esc beasts known as juggernauts. An interesting mechanic for the enemies in the game is the horde mechanic, if several average zombies converge on one area, they will start to attract others and a horde will form. These hordes can be very dangerous and are not to be taken on directly, its best to ensure the zombies around your base are as scattered as possible, keep that population down.Graphically while a eye pleasing game in most respects, state of decay does suffer from FPS drops, terrain clipping but even with some cosmetic issues it never loses that immersive feel, and because the core gameplay is so good, you actually end up forgiving its short comings. The game does a great job in the sound department, cracking zombie heads with baseball bats sounds as grim as you would expect it too, its certainly not lacking in aesthetic.Now lets talk story. The game starts you off as Marcus and your friend Ed coming back from a fishing trip in the mountain lakes, once you get back you quickly realize that all those 1980's horror movies have come true and your set off on your journey to find out what exactly is going on and how to get the hell out of there. While I don't want to spoil the games story there are some interesting plot mechanics that I do want to mention, specifically that certain story events can be missed if you ignore them too long. Spend too long wandering the world looking for supplies and some events can be missed and things will change. Not only this but certain story events can change the world around making survival increasingly difficult for you and your new found family.Even more recently the new downloadable content Breakdown has been released. Breakdown is a true sandbox mode, stripping the game of its main story allowing you to embark on a seemingly never ending quest for survival.In all Undead labs have succeeded in creating of the most enjoyable zombie survival games of recent years. The mix of solid mechanics, engaging characters and open world survival is a breath of fresh air in a genre where we seem to get a boat ton of below par games thrown at us non stop. State of decay is a must for any zombie survival fan and while its by no means perfect, you will get value for money."

While the game is very rough around the edges and contains an assortment of glitches, State of Decay's excellent core mechanics remain interesting and incredibly enjoyable throughout the time you'll spend trying to surive in Trumball Valley. This is one of those games that will consume you once you get into the routine of survival, improving your community, and exploring the huge open world in search of survivors that may sometimes prove to be even more evil than the hordes of undead. A truly one-of-a-kind experience, and I can't wait to see what Undead Labs does next, especially if they decide to make a sequel. Highly recommended."

,Recommended,241540,8537959,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Catharsis,"So I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into with this game when I got it. I had watched a couple of people play the first 20 minutes or so when it first turned up. I am really, completely and utterly pleasantly surprised. I loved every minute of playing it.I'm a scaredy cat & I normally coward out of things after a short while. Not so with this. It's not really scary at all even for me (though the noises a couple of the special mobs make gives me the creeps).It's certainly not a difficult game, and while I don't normally use that as a reason for critique it really could stand to be more difficult - though I know some people have said otherwise & I think that comes down to play-style. I lost one survivor but only because I was dumb and in a rush and switched survivors when I thought she was somewhere safe and she mysteriously died in that same spot. That's all. In amidst the pot luck of who will survive when you log back in it was my own lethargy that got her. You become strangely attached to a couple of the members of the group despite them being mostly ambiguous people - you really do feel that it's your responsibility to look after them.The thing with this game is it is a persistent world. Think animal crossing - if you leave for too long things happen. I played it every day over the holidays logging off each time only once everyone was safe & sound and morale was full. I never returned to any nasty surprises other than a couple of enclaves getting over-run but - that's their own fault ;P If you can dedicate the hours in a short enough time frame it's not a deal-breaker but if you want to put it down and pick it up where you left off a couple of weeks later you might just find it burning around your feet. If you still have feet.Using an X-box controller at least it was so smooth and satisfying to fight and running over zombies and hearing them pop when you run over them is just, satisfying. They don't really explain much to you but, I didn't find this off-putting but I did have to google what Fame & Influence really did.For me it really could have stood to be a longer game - to have had the next area open up and be able to move up into a larger home base. But then I was lucky enough to have the time to maintain morale & resources. The OCD in me loves searching buildings & seeing the little X's appear on buildings once you've cleared them.And finally the story - it's nothing ground breaking or complex but just enough to make me feel a little sick. And for a game that's just a little sick, that's not too bad to me."

But it's just frustrating to me. If I die as a character, chances are that it's my favorite character since i like to play as that character. It's annoying how I might get so far through a playthrough and then some bs happens and I die.Like I said I love the idea of a game like this, but it does so many tiny annoying things where I'v just gotten tired of plying it.

,Recommended,241540,8887290,"Posted: 28 January, 2014",all,Farmboy,"With so many Zombie Apocalypse Titles out there, the whole scene is getting boring rather fast, but I must honestly say that State of Decay is a great game.It's the same as most other zombie apocalypse game do everything you can to survive scavenge, fortify your base and so on and so forth but they did it a bit different.You start off with 2 friends Marcus and Ed at a campsite in the mountains where you meet up with a couple of other survivors who ask you to look around a bit to see if you can find any other survivors, the first person you meet is Maya, a soldier who was out by the lake with two of her friend, sadly her friends were overrun and killed by the zombies. Your little group of 3 then make your way back to the ranger station only to find everyone there has also been killed. You get hold of a two way radio and from there the actual fun begins when you head toward your first home base.Once at your new home base you need to make friends, you only have access to certain gear if you do your part and put in the leg work. Now you are going to do a lot of running in this game, a lot of button mashing fighting and you are going to get very upset at yourself for making stupid mistakes that get you killed, because if you die then you’re dead. That’s it that character that dies is gone forever, never to be seen again. SO DON'T DIE... Remember you are not super human.The game is not very hard but at the same time it's not very easy either at first you run up to every zombie you can find to beat up to see all the different cool moves your character has to take down zombies but as you progress you learn one very important thing, being overrun is dangerous, too many zombies in a small space could be fatal and so you find yourself avoiding contact later in the game.So what makes the game great? Well here's a list of why I think it's a great game.1. The story progresses if and when you want it to, though there are plenty missions available you don't have to do them all.2. If you scavenge supplies and you find more than you can carry you can call in for help. Leave the premises and a friend or two will go get the remainder of the supplies.3. Relocating your home base, as your circle grows you need more space, and different home bases give different ""Rewards""4. The Zombies are balanced out, it’s not like most other games where there are little or no zombies, or they are massively over populated and you have almost no chance of survival.5. The vehicle damage is very realistic, you hit a fence or a couple of zombies a few times and you are going to start getting radiator problems.But there are also a few bad things in the game.1. You find yourself doing the same thing over and over again a lot in the game.2. The game has no manual save option, which makes it more realistic ( I actually like this ) but it's bad for when you make a stupid mistake and end up dead then you sit there afterwards and think why the hell did I do that.3. This is probably what bugs me the most, the whole time you are playing the game it feels like you are sitting behind a console, and I am a very big console Hater and I am not afraid to say it. The game feels like a cheap console port to PC and it's close to unplayable with a keyboard and mouse, if you want to enjoy the game you will need a controller.4. The gun mechanics doesn't work too well, due to the fact that the game is third person you often find yourself shooting at strange angles which in reality would be impossible to hit the target but in the game it works.This is by far one of my longest reviews ever, but a lot of words to describe a good game.My Rating - 8/10 - The Console port to PC is a big disappointment and makes the game difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse.Seriously a great game. Buy it..._+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_Breakdown DLC ReviewI played through State of Decay and really enjoyed the game but I did however find the game very short and was a little disappointed when I finished it was almost as if the game just got good and then it was finished. But a little while after I finished I saw that Breakdown was available and I must say If you love State of Decay as much as I do then this DLC is just for you. This DLC basically takes the game as we know and remove the whole story mode and turns it into a full on sandbox mode, your only goal is to survive and eventually when you want fix an old RV randomly located on the map and hop out of town with 5 of your best mates. Once you do that you start from scratch again, less loot, more zombies and stronger zombies. The map gets randomized but the idea stays the same SURVIVE!A lot of people complain saying this DLC wasn't added content but just removed content but I say good work, now the game can be enjoyed for much longer. I will definitely recommend this DLC. It also adds a few new achievements for achievement hunters as State of Decay is one of the very easy games to complete all the achievements but these however aren't as easy as the base game.Get it - Enjoy it - Rate itMy Rating 9/10Only bad thing in breakdown is that there are too many side missions going on at the same time, almost impossible to do them all and keep everyone happy and progress in the game. I find myself almost helping a stranger in trouble every 5 to 10 minutes."

Very fun and Enjoyable. Personally, i'd give it a 8/10 but if it wanted a 10/10. What i'd suggest is..- Since there are already a few main characters you meet at the start of the game you could tell an in-depth story for each character like in GTA 5 you can switch characters and play through different characters story and learn more about them, also some good cut scenes would be quite great, perhaps with some conflict between two or more characters or even other groups.- New Expansion in the near future with a map extention, new weapons, cars, homes that go up to like 50-100 people to manage, go out in groups of 5-10 to do super dangerous missions, everything in big scale too :PLast but not least If this game was Online, Multiplayer, Co-op would be super awesome, simply cause playing with friends makes games even more enjoyable.Anyway those are my Pros, Cons and Suggestions.

Then you should absolutely check out State Of Decay.I enjoyed this game a lot. Searching for supplies never gets old and I think that is because the loot varies, from basic food supplies (coffee, snacks, ect) to medicine or ammo, melee weapons of all sorts and guns. Who doesn't love finding a stash of ammo for that one favourite gun of yours? Searching for supplies feels natural in this game. And it really adds to the survival element.State Of Decay is slow paced compared to a lot of other zombie games and a lot of the time you'll have to take your time to really assess your group of survivors and the base as even when you're not playing, the game itself is still active. I left off with good morale within the group and came back the next day to find one of the survivors had fallen sick and another had died. So the game really keeps you on your toes and is constantly changing.In the game you'll be able to complete a lot of missions, you'll pretty much always have something to do however if you ignore missions for long enough or simply get occupied doing other things within the game certain missions will solve themselves, not always in a good way either. Fail to help a fellow survivor kill a certain zombie, or find a lost survivor and they might die doing the mission on their own. So the game really encourages you to constantly be active. However this doesn't happen for every mission so if you prefer just exploring and doing supply runs, then do your thing.The game is far from perfect and there is honestly a few things that could have been polished further, the driving mechanics feel clunky and occasionally the AI will do a few silly things. However playing the game I found myself looking past those things and instead simply enjoying the world and gameplay and of course fretting over my survivors.

Not only that, but some of the game mechanisms have been adjusted to be downright ridiculous. Original State of Decay was filled with bugs, but I've managed to get to it when most of that was apparently fixed. Unfortunately, as it seems, developers learned nothing and same thing happened here.- Game hands down cheats. Zombie respawn is ridiculous - you clean a room, then you turn your back and few seconds later they're back. I think they've wanted to make this DLC more difficult, but there are better ways to do it without making the player feel cheated.- Also, when you make your game harder, make sure you'll also adjust survavability of the friendly AI. They were equally dumb in original, but there weren't many situations where AI gets surrounded by 10 zombies. AI doesn't know the term running away, they're mindless drones. I've lost several NPCs just because all they understand is to attack and when they get overrun, there is nothing you can do.- In fact, NPCs have problems doing even the simpliest things, like running through doors or getting in cars.- Car physics, if you can even call it that, makes them very easy to flip over, because we're apparently on moon. Two times I've been launched in the air with my car without doing anything else than getting close to some object (pathway, building).- Due to map design, lots of it happens in quite close quarters and corridors, which makes it excellent for your character to get stuck in group of zombies without any chance to get out. You can just watch your character glitch through them as you desperately mash buttons to no awail.- Reloading weapons sometimes doesn't work and works only when you zoom in.- When I say this♥♥♥♥♥♥is utterly broken, I mean it. When siege happens, if you're in middle of saving someone, you magically can't talk to them, which forces you to leave them and come for them again, if they manage to survive. I don't know how long have they tested this DLC, but there are huge issues that anyone has to run into after few minutes of playing...- Last but not least, you would think that soldiers will be a little more competent with firearms than civilians, but no, your teamates can't shoot for their life, and they're more than happy to let their fellow soldiers to die and continue shooting like it's 4th July.The home defence system just doesn't outweight so many problems this DLC has, and it's not so fun as it might seem at first, because sieges usually happen when you least need it.

I came back after some time to find it unsupported and a discussion thread from the developer asking us to buy the game again as a newly remastered one year edition. How about a free upgrade since I already gave you money? I could understand if the game was no longer supported because it was a decade old, but it was only 1 FRICKING YEAR OLD and now unsupported.The current state of the game is BROKEN and will not run properly with NVidia drivers. You literally have to disable your Nvidia card in your device manager and run the Intel card. There is not a patch or support.Just an FYI, Undead Labs has done a great job deflecting this whole debacle by blaming Microsoft Studios saying it was a contact obligation so the new Year One Survial Edition could be playable on XBox 1. However, a little research will show that aside from the DLC and YOSE, all of their games are unsupported and no longer sold, some less than a year old. PURE CASH GRAB!AVOID UNDEAD LABS.

,Recommended,241540,31453027,Posted: 29 April,all,_67alecto_OZ_,"This is a fun game.  I am running it on a 960 GTX and Windows 10.  No compatibility issues - I had 1 crash in the 33 hours I was playing it.On to the review:I completed the game in 33 hours, however, at 15 hours I accidentally deleted my saved game - Start New Game is right next to Continue, and both are activated with the space bar.  So I basically finished it right in line with with the expected ~20 hours.  I had all but two of the original game achievements (the DLC achievements are listed even if you don't have them), and I had two characters fully maxed (Cardio, Fighting, Specialized weapon, etc)  and 2 others that were about 75%.  I spent a lot of time doing side missions, and building up two different settlements.The game starts out right in the middle of the action...black screen fades in to your friend grappling with a zombie.  You bludgeon it and then try to figure out what's going on.  Heading to a ranger station, you find out that while you've been camping and out of cell phone range, the zombie apocalypse has happened.  After checking for survivors and supplies, you end up having to head down the mountain to the town where a woman is broadcasting on a CB.  From here, the game becomes one of resource management - ammo, medicine, fuel, and building supplies.Zombies are pretty slow and uncoordinated, so they aren't much of a threat when there is just one or two.  But they can take a lot of damage until you can destroy the head so if you aren't careful you can find yourself surrounded.  Headshots are one-shot kills on them, but ammo is very scarce until you start tracking down sources or trading for it.  Early on, you'll find that stealth is a better option as you go to houses and other buildings to scavenge for supplies.  As you clear buildings, you have the option to setup outposts where you can resupply and use as a source for medicine, fuel, or whatever is found there.  As the story progresses, you'll come across special zombies that reflect what they were before they died such as a zombie in police swat gear.As you scavenge for supplies to reinforce this first settlement, a few other story lines emerge with their own missions. As you build trust with other survivors, they're willing to share more and better supplies with you from guns to vehicles. Apart from the various mission trees, there is a set of recurring missions to rescue an ally/find a missing person, hunt down a particular zombie that's terrorizing the area, investigate signs of other survivors, clean out an infested building, defend a perimeter while it's scavenged or reinforced, helping a survivor that's gotten too angry or scared, or complete a trade with another group of survivors like ammo for food.In your settlement you can build up facilities like a medical bay, a workshop, library, kitchen, sleeping quarters, a dojo, and so on.  Each of these will serve a specific purpose, plus several of them have special things they can do.  If you have  a kitchen, you can prepare a big meal to boost your people's vitality..  A watchtower can spend time clearing out wandering zombies with a sniper rifle.  A workshop can repair your vehicles or make other useful items such as weapon suppressors, IEDs, and so on.  A library works in combination with these to offer more choices - with a food storage area and a library, you can research and experiment in creating biodiesel as a fuel source.Some interesting things about the game:Helping out the settlement by completing missions and finding supplies raises your influence level.  You spend this for various things - taking things from supply lockers, calling another settlement for construction advice, having an ally follow you as backup, etc.  It resets each day, so early on you'll have to be pretty thrifty on how you use it.As you make friends with the people in your settlement, you can switch over to them and use them for missions. This is handy because the longer you are out scavenging, the more tired and hurt you get.  Your max stamina decreases until you can fully rest which means less time sprinting, and fewer swings with your weapon before you can barely move.Death is permanent.  If you get killed, you switch to another friend in the settlement.  The only thing you can do is go out and recover that person's stuff.Resources are finite. For example, there a a set number of vehicles that are spawned on the map (static locations), and if you blow them all up running down zombies, they're gone. Weapons get worn out and break. Guns stop working.The game continues while you aren't playing.  You'll get a list of things that happened since you last played (they can be good, bad or neutral).In the same vein, the members of your settlement go about their duties whether you are there or not.  Guard duty, sleeping, zombie hunting, scavenging. It's actually not uncommon to see them trotting across fields or down alleys with a rucksack on their back as they head home.  And if they get cornered or overwhelmed, you'll get a call on the CB to go help them. You can call for scavengers to come and get supplies that you found...and a survivor will immediately leave the settlement on foot.  This means it can take a long time for them to reach the location, plus the same time to get back.  Having outposts established along the way increases their chance of survival.Many missions have a hidden time limit, including some story ones.  If you get a call that some survivors need help, if you don't get there in time they'll either survive but be unhappy with you for not helping which causes you to lose influence, or they'll get killed.   If a survivor calls for help going after a special zombie, they'll go by themselves eventually.  With the same possible results.You can't carry very much.  ~20lbs and/or 10 inventory slots.  Regular things take one inventory slot such as a gun or a melee weapon.  Other things can be grouped. 30 bullets takes up one inventory slot.  4 bottles of pain killers, 3 molotovs, and so on.  Since you can only carry 20lbs, that 10lb rifle is often a luxury you can't afford.  You'll need a melee weapon because zombies WILL get close to you, and you'll want some painpills for healing, and maybe a throwable or two.  Pretty soon you're either out of weight allowance and be encumbered which slows you down and burns through your stamina, or not have enough inventory space for more than 1 or 2 magazines.You can store a few things in your vehicle without a weight limit, but are limited to 4-6 inventory slots based on the size of the trunk.Driving physics are not a focus with this being a sandbox zombie game.  You won't be drifting around corners, or careening off alley walls.  You can't damage fences or walls, so that single slat wooden fence in the middle of a field might as well be a 40' concrete barrier.  You might be driving in a field and suddenly act like you hit a brick wall, only to see a rock half the height of your tire is the cause.  Handling and durability varies between vehicle types.Vehicles are pretty fragile.  Running down hordes will quickly damage your car to the point it will explode.  You can offset this by acting like a demolition derby driver and backing into everything to keep it running for a little longer.The map isn't huge, but the lack of fast travel and things like rivers and mountains can have you driving for a few minutes on missions.There is no weather, but there is night and day and each lasts an hour in real time.  Night can be very deadly - it's hard to see, and using a flashlight or headlights attracts zombies.  There isn't any way to skip time, though time passes when you aren't playing.When the game ends, you are returned to the start of the last mission.  From here, that mission will stay active should you want to do it again, but otherwise you can ignore it and continue to play through the random and repeating side quests."

Plus there is RPG like advancement of your main character and the other 'party' members you recruit along the way as each has a variety of skills and each skill advances as it's used unlocking further skills and special attacks/abilities.  It also has a very nice open world which rewards exploration as pretty much any location you find out of the way will have some nice loot to scavenge (better weapons, backpacks, etc.).  You also build yourself a base/community and have to manage various resources and personalities.  Helping out strangers opens up trade options and if you help them enough they'll be friendly and ask to join your community, but it's still up to you whether you want to add them and support them through play or no.  There are also more things to do than you can possibly get done timewise so you have to choose who to help and what to put priority on; but I've found gives me that sense of just one more thing and then I'll quit... awww just one more...If you like the game then the Breakdown DLC adds a new game type where instead of following the story of the main campaign you have a minor story just the framework of survival for the world but gives RPG like goals in accomplishing certain things like using certain weapon types, or other accomplishments which unlock hero characters you can recruit where they don't start with minimal skills but instead have special items and upgraded skills.The one complaint I have is that it's very hard to maintain a clear zombie free area.  Seems like more often than not you only get a few steps away from a building you've cleared and zombies are right back into since the zombies seem to mostly spawn right around where your current character is, and I wish I could just lock some of my party/community members in our home so they'd stop going off on their own and getting in trouble within minutes of my rescuing them from one thing they are back out looking for trouble again.  Also for some missions which have a limited time to respond it would be nice to know what those timeframes are or see some color scheme like green, yellow, red so that you'd better know which ones need to be prioritized without having to keep track of when they showed up relative to the other available missions."

The map is nice, the combat is fun, and the expansion pack adds a TON of replay value.

You aren't just one person, once you've befriended others who you help or save, you can play as them and improve their abilities to further enhance your chances of survival.  Once your community is big enough you can strike out and take over larger bases (there's three base sizes, small medium and large) or keep it small and stay somewhere outside of the towns.It's not without its flaws, some zombies manage to clip through walls & doors either visually or physically, also executing them on stairs has issues and the vehicles are very floaty, it's amazing how high a truck can spin and flip.The end of the world is a dangerous place, mutant zombies and roaming hordes can seriously make a supply run turn into a really bad day.  Running is the best option or a car if you can to get out of there when tables turn badly.There have been two DLCs so far, Breakdown & Lifeline.Breakdown is without story and you play till you're ready and have fixed up an RV to escape the valley.  This causes the game map to randomise & reset and also makes the game harder, you can also unlock heroes who can help turn the tide.Lifeline is a side story told around the same time as the base game, you follow a group of soldiers who have to hold onto their base camp while evacuating high value targets, usually those who have information/expertise with the ""virus"" and some civilians if you can.All in all for a console port of an xbox live arcade game, it's pretty good and fun, the melee combat can be quite fluid and ranged head shots are an instant kill for most zombies.

You are able to switch characters and get them higher in their skills of fighting, running, searching, etc. If you want to play the more sneaking around and avoiding zombies then you can very easily do that. It just really allows you to play the game the way you want to play it without locking you into one way of doing this. Highly recommend this game."

The game never breaks out of the routine of surviving; you'll experience all the game has to offer within the first few hours of the game. The overall style of the game feels very ""realistic"" if you're smart about surviving you'll do just fine, maybe losing the occasional survivor to extreme circumstances. The game isn't some impressive graphical powerhouse but, honestly they are well above average and decent; lighting during the day and night cycles are great and the special zombies easily stand out from the regular ones and overall the details here and there are great, especially for a $20.00 title. Music is the game is subdued but really great; it’s fun to have a successful outing and have some music set the mood. Voice acting is... ok, it’s not laughably horrible but, not some of the greatest and you'll also end up hearing the same actor for multiple characters fairly quickly. The game is an open-world sandbox, once you're past the initial tutorial area you're free to roam about as you wish for the most part, with main story missions pushing you to new areas with a wealth of land to explore and plenty of side activities and main story missions. Beating the main story took me roughly about 15 or more hours not counting the side missions I did. You’re mileage will vary with State of Decay, but there is plenty of content here for a $20.00 purchase.TL/DR; State of Decay is a fun survival game and nails down that aspects really well, but it will soon get repetitive and if you don’t love the game within the first few hours, chances are you won’t change your mind after 15 but, for $20.00 it’s a pretty darn good video game.-Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at:www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork"

Food and items you loot from places wont ever spawn in the same building again. This is how you make a true survival game. Zombies can whoop your butt depending if you know how to handle a group. Get to control your base and say yes or no to people that want to join your group. Only thing you have to watchout for is if you dont talk to the your group members they will dislike you or become depressedTHIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME!!

Initially I had a great time with this game, but after a few hours hours its repetative nature is painfully obvious. You have everything down, the side-quests go in a circle, while you wait for the main-quest to advance. The looping AI voices become an annoyance. Unlike what the description said, you cannot decide what way the story goes. I still managed to sink quite a bit more hours into this because I enjoyed driving around and being in the world but the game kept trying to pull me back into the framework, and I tried a second time to see if I could change anything, but it was the same deal.

Infestation: Survivor Stories, Dead Island, several others. This indie title does what no game has really done, made a great game out of the genre. Made an amazing game out of the genre, in my opinion.In this game, you start out as some random guy in the beginnings of a zombie apocolypse. You find a group of people, then it turns into more of a survival management game. You have to deal with problems in your group, such as anger issues and fear, you have to befriend and keep the morale of your fellow comrades up. And, of course fight zombies. Now while the combat in this game isn't amazing, its actually really fun. Its simplistic, it doesn't try to over complicate things. You wanna smash a zombies head in, right? Of course you do, and you can do that easily. With a gun or with a blunt weapon. I enjoy the combat, but it is still in my opinion the weak point of the game.Managing your community, building new training facilities, sleeping areas and medical stations, and recruiting other survivors are a large part of the fun in this game. Its so satisfying to run through a zombie hoard and save a group of people, then have them befriend you so you can switch to them.I really enjoy that you can't just use the same character forever. They will get injured, sick, and tired. Eventually you'll need to switch to other characters. That's why it is important to do things like anger management missions and afraid missions, to befriend people in your group so you may switch to them.The visuals are fairly impressive, but nothing amazing. It runs perfectly fine on my GTX 660 with everything turned up. it definitely looks better than the xbox version, but it will not visually wow you in any way. Although the zombie design is quite impressive.My one bugbear with this game is the ammount of stuff it throws at you at once, then puts it on a time limit. I can understand why you need to do things quickly, but when i still need to gather food and medicine for my group, and then I recieve 5 other messages about missions I need to complete quickly, it can get frustraiting. Really frustrating, especially when it makes me lose influence with my tribe. I think they should either cut back on the ammount of missions you get at once, or eliminate the timer. The former sounds better in my opinion.Reguardless, this game is amazing. And even when it isn't discounted, its only 20 bucks. So incredibly cheep for a game this fun. This game has raised the bar in the Zombie genre."

You character evolves, will level his fighting if you fight alot of zombies or other traits... Also, there's a community which is actually where the whole game is based.For example, when you're searching for supplies in a house , you can choose to radio home for them back at camp to come there and take the items you selected IF you don't have room for more into your inventory. Also, When you find survivors and save them , they join your camp and grow stronger as a defense to the zombie apocalypse.In the beggining of the game , you're given a piece of wood and your kicking as your sole defense. Although it's enough for you to not die. You can choose to go out with 1 other person to help you.The noise mechanics are adequate. I would not expect anything less-more since it's good. Using cars is not safe because if you rev high, the zombies ( Zeds as they are called in SoD ) will hear it and come after you.Cars have a storage. You can store up to 5 or 6 items into it's trunk which is really useful.Also, you can hit zeds with your door.There can be different types of zeds except your normal-like zombies.Bleeehhh .

""State of Decay"" is one of the rare gems out there which seems to be made by intelligent, thinking gaming enthusiasts for gamers. It's not one of those highly polished productions you play but quickly forget afterwards, but one of the games which will keep you smiling because you just found another great detail you've been longing to see because it simply made sense to put it into such a game.Sate of Decay doesn't bore you with dumb ""game mechanics"", applied because some marketing director wanted it so. No, it delivers you an open world designed with sticking to common sense. Furthermore, the designers weren't shy to incorporate features known from gaming classics like Jagged Alliance i.e.:Every survivor you find will have some unique character traits, which will make her or him someone worth liking - or loathing. You'll quickly single out your favorite protagonists, screaming in dismay when you are ambushed by a juggernaut zombie while you are trying to run the heavy backpack home.Another detail which reminded me of Jagged Alliance is the myriad of different weapons and ammunitions you'll find. From a trusty .375 revolver to a AKMS submachine gun - you'll enjoy outfitting your favorite guy with the best gun available.The story focuses on the way people are trying to deal with the situation - including a powermongering, aims-justify-the-needs judge going slowly rogue. With people somewhere between despertion and hope the story makes the whole setting way more believable than you'd expect. It allows you to blend in, to feel the immersion a good game has to create to make it on my list of games...worth playing!The few cons I experienced are mainly of cosmetic value:The controls are a bit difficult to get into and the lack of a real manual is leaving you to guesswork. Especially moving your home confused me: Yes, you need to do a few story missions before you are allowed to move it. Good to know, better if the game would have explained it further on.At some point of the game you are spammed by a multitude of very, very similar missions: Rescue a survivor, kill a special zombie, clean out an infestation, etc. It can be annoying, but only because you are feverish about accomplishing the next ""home improvement"" and thus having no time to rescue the next jaywalking zombie apocalypse survivor.A few minor bugs are still in the game: Zombie getting stuck in porches, zombies banging their head against thin air, instead of the wall behind them, survivors running against an obstacle instead of going around. Luckily all these are not frequent and  / or easily solvable by giving  a gentle push."

But nor is it a good game.It starts out in a camping resort of some sort. The starting area is of course very easy and helps you out to get the hand on the controls and mechanics. It is much more of a survival zombie game than for example Left 4 Dead or all those other FPS zombie games. It is not as hardcore as DayZ although. But I still liked it and I just finished it after restarting.From my understanding it is a smaller studio backed by Microsoft behind it and I say they made a good job. I did not notice many bugs or glitches. Graphics are decent and controls not bad -IF- you have a controller. It is also nice that you can avoid zombies and try sneaking (Which I didn't do much). As said the focus is more on survival and gathering resources and survivors for your home base instead of wildly shooting cause that will have you dead if you are ill prepared. And a dead character stays dead.The characters you gather all have diffrent traits and ""personalities"". Which is interesting at  first but later on proves to be shallow. Non the less the more you gather the more room you need, the more food you need and so on.  Sadly the game do become a bit of a rince and repeat after a while when every mission is ""Oh no we seen a special zombie out here"" ""Create noise to make the zombies do this while I plunder"" or ""Oh no scavengers in need of help"". Also we got the ""Sadness, anger, fear"" traits where you just tell your friends that you and him/her are going to smack some zombies the old fashion way. This is one of the more annoying missions since they just about killing zombies and put you at risk just to appease some of the idiots in your crew. There is also missions to save or help other survivor groups. These could be so much more if they deepended the social mechanics and maybe added in more of an RPG mindset to the game.The map is pretty damn big too and I did not scavenge much outside of any of the  three settlements. The country side is not that appealing since it is mostly wastes of land you drive through to g et to your next objective. But this adds to the atmosphere since it is supposed to be a small county with a large farming community.This is a clusterf*** of a review but I still think the strong parts is the survival part, the less focus on action. The tiny bit of social interaction and dialogue (even if the voice actors where like 3-4? Least it beats the 2  guys making the voices for Skyrim! Hue hue) The atmosphere can be great at times and some vistas are nice.BUT. The game is bit to much of a repeat, there could been more interaction with your group and the others. The Wilkerson have some interesting missions but not much more than them being a bit of the Merle of State of Decay and then nothing happens. The game also would be much much much better with co-op or multiplayer where each player runs their own group. The special zombies are also kinda a pain the♥♥♥♥♥ This must be some kind of thing from L4D.To end it, yes I do recommend it if you want a open world zombie survivor game and zombie movie lovers will see many references.

It is a good game despite its flaws.To me, this game feels like what Dead Island should have been.  Things like having actual resource needs for your group and the ability to build and upgrade structures in your home base really help the game stand out from your generic zombie slaying fair.  Also the fact that events can happen while you are not playing, while it can be annoying, makes for a fairly unique game.I also really like the fact that you can be overwhelmed by zombies if you are by yourself and you aren't careful.  You can't just run out in the street and start mowing down zombies with an unsurpressed assault rifle.  For one, you'll quickly deplete your ammo supply.  And the other reason is because all the noise will draw out all the zombies in the surrounding area and you'll likely be overrun.  It really helps to add some tension when you are a long ways from home on a supply run and you're low on health and don't have a ride nearby.Unfortunately, the game is not perfect, and there are a few particular areas I feel the game is lacking.  The first of which to me is the camera.  The views for when you are executing zombies can sometimes make it impossible to see whats happening.  Also, the fact that you are encouraged to use foliage to hide from zombies, but the bushes/trees don't dim and go transparent when close to the screen makes for more times when you can't see anything.Another feature I think this game could sorely use is some sort of weapon modding feature.  Coming off of playing Payday 2 with its amazing amount of weapon mods available, this game has none other than applying one of a few types of suppressor to guns.  It would be awesome if you found a weapon expert survivor and you could then mod your stocks, optics, foregrips and such but, alas, its not possible.And finally, perhaps the biggest ommission that could have really made this game a gem is its lack of a multiplayer mode.  While you can ask other survivors to accompany you and help out, you can't get them to pick up supplies or give them any orders when they are with you.  They also have a tendancy to follow you right up your butt and then block doorways behind you.  The AI just isn't a good substitute for a few good buddies.Still, despite lacking in some areas, this game is a fun single-player experience.  To me, it did a decent job of capturing the spirit of zombie apocalypse survival.  I'm hoping the game has a sequel with a bit more polish to put it into GOTY territory."

I agree with some of the other posters that the cars make things far to easy. It would be nice if the cars or other loud noises put the zombies into a sort of 'frezy' mode, where they did more damage or something. Despite the warning not to use cars, I usually drove everywhere in one, because it was not only the fastest way but also the eaisiest way.

I love the fact that alongside the missions, you also need to find and recruit survivors, go scavenging to survive and also just generally look after your community and main base.5. I love the fact that you can set up outposts as well as a main base,6. The NPC survivors that you play alongside with are not stupid. they will go out on missions and scavenge on their own without you doing ANYTHING. Some will fall sick and die. And a lot usually get injured or merely tired. I also like that you can switch survivors to give the other ones a rest. All the survivors also have different abilities.7. It has cars. So it's basically just GTA with zombies in it.8. It's not JUST zombies you are fighting. The army also comes in, sets up outposts, and kills anything that gets in their way, wether it is a survivor or a zombie, they kill it.9. I love the building feature. You can select empty spots in your home base and build different facilities ike guard towers, medical facilities, fighting arenas and even farms. Of course to do this you need to find building resources so again, you need to scavenge a lot.10. The NPCs are really stong. If you're are going out on a missions, you can ask a couple of people to come and help you out. A group of 4 survivors could easily take around 200-300 zombies.11.

In this game you have everything you want your zombie survival game to have: a persistent and open world (that keeps on going even when your computer is turned off!), facilities to build and manage, resources to gather, trust to gain, pep talks, scavenging, gossip, pills, vehicles to drive (and to break down to pieces), people to care for (or to abandon to their fate if you don't trust/like them or if you are that kind of survivor), a lot of zombie head-bashing, a wide array of melee and ranged weapons, skills to improve (including useless and funny ones!), tons (and I meanTONS) of inside jokes, easter eggs and homages to the genre (The Kirkman Residence? McDermott's Tavern?), and a (virtually) never ending experience if you play with the Breakdown DLC (in that case, you skip the main storyline but you go on as long as you have at least one character alive). Co-op is missing. Co-op would have been great but, even as a solo game, State of Decay is a lot of fun, which is reason enough to play it, but you also start to enjoy it a bit more and more as you discover all the little details that are revealed only with an extensive playthrough. You need food, sleep, meds, gas, ammo (and not just generic ammo, but the right ammo type for your gun) and you need to find a good place to call home. A defendable one. To be on the (relative) safe side you will also need at least a doctor or someone trained in medicine, tool experts, carpenters and someone who can cook a good meal once in a while! A workshop where to build homemade sound suppressors for your guns or molotov cocktails is a must! Keep an eye on the morale of your community too. Don't let them fall to their fears and always resolve their anger issues (shouting matches lower community's happyness!). You start with one character only (well, two, in the main storyline) but you can swap to other survivors as you bring them to your community and only if you earn their trust. Bear in mind: dead is dead. If your character dies, it's gone, no matter how much time you invested in him/her. No matter if he/she was the ""hero"". And they can die in a lot of ways, even when you are not controlling them. They can go missing on a supply run (but you are given a chance to go look for them), get sick or be eaten alive while you ask them to watch your back. And when you run out of characters... well... new game, I guess! If you love zombies and everything about zombie survival and thatit's the end of the worldfeeling, thisisthe game for you."

,Recommended,241540,14214267,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,Larexus,"State of Decay is a open world survival game that will please fans of the genre with its own unique ideas and a focus on character permadeath.--------Final Thoughts at the bottom--------GameplayThe gameplay is all about survival, it really makes you feel like you want to live. This is mainly due to the fact that if the character you are playing at the time is somehow killed, then they are dead for the rest of the game. Their is no way to bring them back to life, this makes you think twice about just trying to hack your way through hordes of zombies.Throughout the game their are moments, such as events or story missions that will pop up, about other survivors in trouble, completing these missions brings more survivors to your base. The higher your populations the more well defended you are and the more characters you have to switch out with to play. Each survivor has its owns traits and sets of skills. These skill levels can be raised by performing the activity related to the skill. For example your shooting goes up the more you use weapons, or stamina will increase the more you use the character to run around and loot with that character. However the more survivors you have at your base, the more supplies you will need to take care of them all. This means you need to go out and collect more loot.You collect resources such as medical, building and weapon supplies, by entering abondoned buildings and searching for cuboards, draws, boxes etc.. that are highlighted white. When a supply stash is found you put it into a dufflebag and take it back to base. This however limits how much you can take at a time, if you have a vehicle you can store duffle bags in the back but if you are without a vehicle you may also radio back to base and have another runner come out to get the rest. However doing this will put that runner at risk of attack by zombies and if they run into trouble you may need to go out to save them. You may also loot various other things in buildings such as weapons, medical supplies, and food. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses. The weight of some weapons will also effect how some characters can swing them depending on thier strength.The controls feel very well done and accurate, whether its swinging a weapon, shooting a gun or driving a vehicle, it all feels smooth.GraphicsThe graphics are nice, I wouldn't say they are amazing or anything, although their are some breathtaking areas within the game world. The zombies look well done and their are a decent amount of models that are used so it doesnt feel like your killing the same thing over and over, however their is only one model for each special infected.The animation is good and feels lively. Although sometimes I did feel like, for how fast my character was running I wasnt going very far distance wise. The swinging and shooting looks good and my framerate never dropped even while fighting multipul zombies and Im only on a medium spec PC.AudioThe sound in the game is good. When out in the woods you can hear the birds and crickets around you. When in town the lumbering steps of zombies can be heard all around you. The foot steps sound realistic for the type of platform your character is on at the time. Guns sound good and hitting zombies with melee weapons sounds satisfying.The voice over work is good, nothing fabulous or game changing, but its good. Their are multipul different characters taht are all voiced however some of them sound like they were voiced by the same person and didnt even try to sound different.StoryThier is not much to say story wise. There is a story that will eventually lead you out of the city and end the game. However the story plot is basic and it seems like it was just shoved in their to appease some people who want to complete it, but it is not neccesary.Final thoughtsOverall, State of Decay is a great game that is definetly worth the time for anyone whos a fan of survival or zombie games. It is a large world to explore and loot with many different survivors to save and add to your community. The game has some fresh ideas from other zombie survival games, and these ideas are portrayed very well. The visuals are nice and the animation is good. The permadeath may set some people off from this game, also if you are looking for a story, this may not be the game for you.In my opinion this is one of my favourite PC games and is fully worth the full price, however be aware that their is a remastered HD version coming out soon so you may want to hold onto your money for that one. (EDIT: After the release of the remastered version I would still recommend this version over the newer one. The new one just spruced the visuals up a bit but change very little in terms of gameplay. If you want to save some money, just get this version.)"

The ideas are good but the execution is abysmal.  Potentially heavy moments are ruined by clunky programming that suck you right out of the moment.  When one of the survivors who have been with you from the beginning start to get sick and you have to take them to an isolated area to euthanize them, the stage is set for a gaming moment you'll remember for years.However, when you shoot that person, loot their corpse, and radio back home that you're bringing loot (really, that's the part you want to announce to your group?) and the reponse is, ""Get anything good?""  the moment is so ruined it's hard to forgive the game, particularly when this is how every moment in the game goes.  Nothing has any weight.  Do a Google search for a Would You Rather game because it's essentially the same thing.Tell someone in your current group that you looted her father's corpse, led her to believe her father might still be alive, and used the group's resources in the meantime.  Uh oh, she found out?  Time for a big conversation....or she'll just say she thought something might be wrong with her father, thank you calmly, and walk away.It's baffling to me that the creators of the game went through the trouble of setting up some interesting moments in the game and decided on zero follow through.  The combat is very much a stiff and awkward button-basher and the RPG elements play a minor role.   Every mission and every action feels weightless.  I'm leaving the game unfinished because there's just no substance here and I am truly disappointed in that."

Not to mention completely and horribly broken with poor voice acting, animations, movement, controls and optimisation (I'm looking at you, Dead Island)This, however, is the opposite. It's not only got a bit of uniqueness to it but it's actuallygood. Rather than write a wall of text I guess I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pros:- Well optimised- Nice, balanced combat- Not a zombie game that concentrates on firearms, rather a sensible mix of both melee and ranged- Makes the player use their brain, strategy is important in this game, going scavenging without a plan is a death wish- The AI is actually helpful- Pretty nice graphics and sound- RPG-like elements which're good for levelling each of your combat-able survivors at camp for different roles- Always something going on to keep you busy- There's other survivors in the world that you can get friendly with, the friendlier you are the more likely they are to help- No intrusive HUD, leaves the screen wide open for players to see everything they need- 3rd person games aren't usually terrifying, however this is. If you're stuck alone outside at night with hordes surrounding you, you'll be scared to move just in case they hear you.- The survivor you're playing as gets tired as they explore, or they get injured the more fights they get into, it adds realism to the game- Building on the above pro, character switching is seamless and easy.- It's just an awesome gameCons:- Voice acting isn't fantastic, but it isn't as bad as some. You'll hear everything survivors say after a few lines of dialogue before they start repeating themselves. However, this is an indie game and the gameplay more than makes up for it- An unfortunate lack of co-op play, I'm not sure whether or not the devs are looking into it for the 2nd expansion, I hope so because it would be a lot of fun!- It seems as though you're made to play round the clock, as one survivors goes to rest or heal up, you have to play as another and go out to explore. Whilst it does add more gameplay value, I'd prefer to run around in daytime more often- The addon - Breakdown - removes the storyline element from SoD, allowing you to do whatever you want to. You can do that in the base game, just don't complete the last story mission, however it's still worth getting- Sometimes zombies like to get stuck under things, making it impossible to kill them. It's especially irritating when they're an enemy you need to kill for a mission.I'm sure I've forgotten some things, but overall it's an awesome game, it's worth the £15 I paid for it."

For all the potential this game offers however, it falls a bit short of perfection due in part to limited optimization for PC, minor design flaws and a hundred little moments that will have you doing /facepalm.The primary features like base building & upkeep, character progression and the constant need to scavenge while fending off hordes are highly engaging.  The dynamic mission system, the relationship system for playable and NPC survivors and the decent pacing of the story guarantee that you'll always have more to do than time to do it in.  Decisions like 24/7 near-real time progression and permanent character deaths enhance immersion and tension.Gameplay goes back and forth between pursuit of the main quest line and addressing challenges to your (and others) survival.  Smart choices and hustle are rewarded with a secure base and (relatively speaking) happy community while poor ones are compounded by a variety of repercussions.  Combat is fun once you develop skills enough to unlock handy special abilities and acquire some slightly higher quality weaponry.State of Decay is a PC port, and in short it feels and looks like what it is.  The combination of features here is awesome but I'm left wanting more depth, quality and variety in them.  They should also do a careful pass of the experience from start to finish for convenience and user interface.  I'd also like to see a more robust story, more unique survivors with their own side quests, a vast improvement of zombie AI/pathing and an effort to balance special zombies a bit more.  In other words, bring all of the people and zombies to life more convincingly.This game is destined to divide players into:1) A hardcore group who want a higher level of difficulty and realism and,2) A more general group of zombie and RPG fans who get riled up over that first death and the coming to grips with permanent loss of a useful character (who you're emotionally attached to, to boot).I highly recommend State of Decay to any genre fan.  Temper your expectations reasonably and you will be thrilled with this fun game; I loved it.

You're always on the edge of death and the one stupid mistake you make will be the one that does you in. It's not a hardcore simulation like Day-Z, nor is it at all multiplayer; nevertheless, the primary game is compellingly open-ended and you will make decisions  that allow some characters a chance to live and guarantee others will die. Sometimes, you'll have to make those decisions when your stamina is all gone, there's no cars to escape in, you're at half health because you haven't rested in days, you have 3 bullets, a damaged baseball bat, and a horde of biters moving to your position. Maybe you pop a morphine and hide in a bush until they pass, but you still have a long way to go to get home.While I am positively bullish on this game, temper your expectations. State of Decay is an indie game ported from XBLA. The controls are not tight, especially for mouse and keyboard. They are a little off-putting at first and you'll require time to adjust. The graphic style is fitting, but the graphic quality itself is not above average for 2013. It runs well enough, but you will not see a perfectly smooth framerate throughout; it'll drop at odd moments. Sometimes you hit a zombie with a finishing move and it'll be in slo-mo, but other times you wonder if the game is stuttering or if you're supposed to be seeing something awesome, but you don't know what it is. However, I predict that none of these presentation deficits will stop you from seeing the vision behind the game and getting immersed in it.This is a game that I would like to see a sequel for in about two years. I have not played the Breakdown DLC which removes the guiding storyline of the primary game and lets you just play the map. Though I look forward to trying it out next Steam sale. The developers had initially planned for the game to go multiplayer, but that effort has been canceled. Although, the developers promised that the sequel will focus on that feature. However, there are a lot of ways I could see the multiplayer game not being as compelling for me since I might lose the power to make decisions for my people. The comparison to Tell Tale's The Walking Dead are unavoidable and as with that game, I see this game gaining little from a full on multiplayer experience. Maybe if they made multiple maps and severely limited the number of players on each one so that each player could recruit their fair share of NPC survivors. Bottom line, if you see the game on sale, you might as well pick it up. State of Decay is all about risks and the ""fun"" you have taking them."

And i DO recommend it to anybody specifically intrested in these three setting options of the process of wasting your free time (though i think it's not that much of a time-waster as my record says, i often leave a game paused while being busy).Well, a little doubt on ""horror"", maybe i've just been killing too many undead in games and got used to see and hear and fight them with no proper emotions). But sometimes in tough moments the game  gives a feeling similar to fear, as you really don't wanna die yet know its quite possible or almost about to happen.To quit with the horror part - zombies look nice, especially those partly decomposed ones and the bloater.Maybe the biggest lack of the game is no first person view option available to take a closer look at these ugly bustards before killing them. The same about car driving, wouldn't hurt to have it in first person too.But all done well enough as the third person game.Survival is good to great, though most of it's components eventually get more or less repetitive and boring. But that's just like in any other game. The worst of unpleasant impressions i had was of those situations when you die because while you were killing three, five more came and while you were finishing them off there were seven more coming and so on until you've spent all your means of survival. When you get used to a game and start relying on your own honestly acquired skill more than on the character's abilities and inventory, it makes undesirable deaths inevitable too often, and leaves an irritating feelling of being trapped by developers in some preplanned different from the normal gameplay circumstances. I believe that's just what it is, but ok, it's all my personal impressions and unlike in many other games doesn't affect much the possibility to move on along the game's story and finish it before you feel you've had enough of someone's perverted imagination and can't afford wasting more time on it).Zombiez as i've already said are looking great, the same about the ways they move and act, they are intresting to deal with until you get too tired and there's too many more closing on you. So, fellow players - keep an eye on it in order to lose less characters, and keep in mind all the ways you find out (there are some)) to quit fighting and start saving your♥♥♥♥♥at the right moment.The game currently seems to be well optimised, there was no crushes or any other serious issues during my first playthrough. A few bugs spotted in the second which is not finished yet, but all rare, harmless, insignificant and not affecting the gameplay quality. And often looking funny btw, like a zombi, killed together with a group of others by the rear bumper of the slowly moving car, starting to turn somersaults after several seconds of lying on the road).To developers - thanks for the great game, it was and still is a really interesting experience. Sorry for buying it on sale, it's worth its price, and i'd pay it if the sale wouldn't have occured, as the game's screens, vid and description were looking promising.PS Apologies for my presumably non perfect english.PPS The new dlc Lifeline is finally working. Looking and playing good. And there's plenty of ammo from the very beginning, which was the most pleasant feature to me  for the first hour of playing! Along with the new locality and cars durable enough like in the original SoD (and unlike Breakdown's ones trying to break even before you start breaking them)."

You go places, numbers go up. Don't expect it to be more.- It's really really ugly. I don't care much for graphics but not even ""we're open world"" can brace you for graphics of this. The screenshots look ok, a bit better than the game on max settings, but what really kills it is the abhorent animation quality.- You will die randomly in fights and zombies will teleport and spot you through walls.

Some of the realistic take-downs still make you cringe no matter how long you play (may be a con for some, but it's supposed to keep you cringing, well done here).I enjoyed that the missions weren't all time sensitive, nor were all urgent to your gameplay. But still enough were to keep you on your toes.Vehicles offered to choose from all varied in handling, speed and passenger capacity. Making it necessary for you to find the right vehicle for the right job at times.Large enough map for the time-frame it takes to make this game happen.Cons: I felt there was more that could have been done before ending as quickly as it did, though there wasn't any forced ending really, if you didn't know what was coming, you would just wind up with it ended. I suppose it had to get there some time. State of Decay Breakdown addresses this by giving you a choice as to when you want to boggie out however.UI: needs a search function, or a filter when faced with finding characters in your group to choose from. At 40+ to choose from it's tougher to find who you need relatively quickly.The tutorial could have been a tad more interactive. In-game tuts irritate me, but only if I've seen them already. So in-game tut plus a toggle wouldn't hurt. Though learning hands-on is doable.Game function itself was great. Absolutely nothing mentioned in the ""cons"" was game breaking by any means.

What can be uncool though is when you lose a character and you've invested so much time in them, you begin wondering how to turn off the auto save. Just a heads up before I start I couldn't believe when I was playing that this game isn't multiplayer - and that the idea of working with other people (or friends) would be awesome. I repeat : THIS GAME IS NOT MULTIPLAYER.Does that mean don't play it? Depends...The story goes you are a man who stumbled into town and upon exploring you find a church full of survivors. A bit later into the story, you hear the military has also set up an outpost in the town but on the other side. You go see them, and you find out that they really couldn't care less, and that they recommend you leave immediately.The gameplay itself is pretty good - consisting of a 3rd person view and being capable to control more than 1 character... but you can only control one at a time. You can tell other characters to follow you and assist you or you can tell them to come search a location that you've cleared. There are times though where you are faced against this giant zombie boss and all you have is two bullets and a broken machete hoping to take this guy out (so FYI if you hate a bit of grinding in games you may dislike this). The repairing can become a nuisance, but building repair shops or first aid centers (of a few things that you can do) add a bit of depth to the game and really make it feel like it's yours. Another cool feature is when you clear out zombies you are able to set up another ""home-base"". Cars, weapons, items and so forth are found while you free-roam the map. Look-out points can be discovered and climbed which makes identifying what's in the surrounding environment a little easier.I like this game, I would like it even more if it had multiplayer. I enjoy playing it but some would put it as a time killer. Either way though if your looking for an open world zombie game this may be for you.RATING : 7.25/10GameplayBStory / CampaignB+Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicBReplay-abilityCOverallB-EDIT : Just beat the game... once it's beat it's sort of bland.

I have yet to try the DLC, so my review covers the basic game only. I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum.You and a buddy have gone camping and are on your way back to civilization only to find that the campgrounds have become picnic at the park for zed. Your job is simply to survive and learn to survive more successfully and efficiently. As you make your way in the world, you find yourself essentially trapped within a large valley of small communities and farms with a few souls and a whole lot of folks who’ve no longer any use for theirs. You’ll see a lot of tropes and types that are standard for the genre, but most of them are written in a way that downplays their commonness and gives them the dignity of a measure of individual identity and unique situations. You’ll find that vehicles work pretty much as you’d expect them to—often to your advantage and, now and then, to your sorrow. You’ll learn quickly that the world reacts to your decisions in mostly logical ways and that, among the precious assets that will remain largely too sparse for your tastes, human beings matter greatly to you and your prospects for survival. Influence will become your currency. Interactions will become your keys to more currency, technology, and even more assets. Your chances will depend solely upon your actions and choices, but your outcomes will almost always depend upon how your actions and choices affect others. For a relatively small solo game, I never felt that the world was hollow or empty, or that I was truly playing alone the way you feel if you solo some games.The Good:Options. High degree of player interaction with environment and characters which carries lasting impacts. Ambitious design. Homage to the genre. Moments of pleasant surprise and genuine anxiety. Humor that is often subtle. You will roam a mostly open world with some depth of detail that I think may pleasantly surprise you at times. You choose how you will play, where you will go, and what you will do. If you play smart, the game will reward you. If you take foolish risks, you may find yourself sorely punished—likely, but not a guaranteed always. On a single run through from beginning to end, I found myself still trying to figure out certain triggers for various spawns and events, and that’s a good thing. It promises a level of continued interest for future game sessions. If you tear up a vehicle, it will break down, and even possibly explode. If you toss a flare or firecrackers in the night, you will attract a lot of unwanted attention, but you will also be able, if you’re quick and quiet enough, to take advantage of the diversion to make an escape. There’s a lot more I’d love to share, but some things are more pleasurable discovered on your own. If you’re paying attention as you go, you may notice a good number of locales or situations clearly intended as tributes to the genre greats, both to creators and to the works they created, and it comes off not simply as a checklist but as an honest homage. If you get the game, take time to revel in the sensation of racing down a country road in the night with your headlights off while swerving slightly to the side and opening your driver’s side door to take out an entire horde of zombies and freaks. Take a moment in the twilight to look out over a field of crops to see shambling silhouettes against the outline of a rolling landscape under an open country sky. Savor the tremor in the dark as you explore a quiet shed only to discover that you aren’t alone in there after all. Thrill to the delighted frustration of attempting to run down that creepy thing that moves just too darn fast and vaguely spider-like along the edge of the road. Regret smacking indiscriminately into that just-one-more batch of zed that somehow left such a foul aftertaste.The Bad:First, the downside to being such an ambitious game that aims to honor and do so much is that it has its limitations. I found myself in a few spots just wishing the game would go farther in a certain way to take things further in certain options that just weren’t available sometimes. I wanted more management options for people. I wanted a better explanation at times for certain things, though I think that the hands-off approach to this game actually improved the experience overall for me. I found other limitations, which I won’t share because I don’t want to spoil the fun but you are free to discover them for yourself.  Second, there were some moments when I felt the actions or dialogue of characters in the game were completely transparent as vehicles for forcing my attention in some direction. I didn’t like that at all, but thankfully this did not happen too often. Third, while we’re talking about dialogue and actions of characters and game limitations, I found it strange that a game that places such a high emphasis on influence would present me with so few opportunities for deep interpersonal interactions. Conversations, too often, are limited to, “Hey, what’s the sitch?” and that’s it. Not even an option given to answer that question. Fourth, a few persistent glitches in the game. I noticed a change in the condition of vehicles where you pass by one time and it’s in good shape and the next time it’s dinged up, but then the very next time you pass by it looks perfectly fine. Some people showed up as having run away from my compound, but were actually still living there and were still available as controllable characters. Fifth, companions hit some trigger point where a mission, a conversation, or some other key like stamina tells them it’s time to go home, and they run off. Even if you’re on the opposite side of the map with a perfectly good vehicle and getting ready to get in and drive home, they will run off across the countryside full of wandering hordes and freaks, sometimes creating a hazard where you have to rescue them in the process. I think this is a result of the game’s having been developed to emphasize stealth over combat. However, I played using reserved force and stealth, and all-out Car Wars/Death Race 2000 driving mentality, and found I did quite well.The Ugly:The game is a PC port from console and it shows. It’s not nearly as bad as some games I could mention, but the console history of the game makes certain things awkward for PC players at best. Playing with keyboard and mouse worked just fine, but sometimes I would discover a move that I couldn’t quite easily reproduce and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be triggered by a combo that I just haven’t figured out on K&M control. That being said, mostly, to anyone who didn’t know it was a console port or had familiarity with the differences in play and feel, I don’t think anything more than the autosave function and a few other clues give it away. That’s not too bad a complaint for the ugly. Also, and this is my biggest beef with the game, I found the best compound for my strategies in the game broken or nerfed (I couldn’t tell which) in an incredibly stupid way:The rest of my review (you're getting very near the end of it) appears in the comments section below because I've run out of room again.

Player have to manage the community which includes doing favoures for survivors to gain trust to become friends later; scavenging for vital supplies such as food, medicine, building materials. In the game you have a ""home base"" which can be upgraded with 9 facilities, and also has  space for outpost to build. Outposts extends the safe area and have supply cache to restock your equipment. The game can be played id different ways, someone likes playing stealthy, others prefer brute force to complete missions. Ah, the missions; i found side missions a bit repetitive, but they are okay. Driving cars is useful but makes a lot of noise which attracts zombies. When you are at your base you can change the character you are playing if the other character is your friend. Changing is adviseable to let the used character rest to get their vitality and stamina back to maximum value. SoD is beyond my expectations, i recommended everyone who loves zombie games 9/10."

What is lacking, though, is an innovative approach to the zombie-genre. Something with more depth than your average Resident Evil. State of Decay (SoD) might just be exactly that.SoD starts you off in medias res, with only you and your buddy stranded in the midst of an already ongoing zombie-apocalypse. The gameplay comes along feeling a lot like Dead Rising at first, but quickly shows it tries to take on more than just that. As you hack and slash your way through Northern American forests and farmlands (on a fairly large, open map) you will meet other survivors (not actual people, mind you - this is a singleplayer-title). Some might not be too fond of you and avoid contact, others might be willing to join up. Soon, you will have a quaint little base to call your (temporary) home and you will quickly realise that not everything evolves around YOU and the character YOU play.SoD claims to be a Zombie-Survival-Simulator - and this goes beyond simulating how to best dismember the undead. You will have to keep an eye on all of your ""group"", as all of them have roles to play. There will be relations between characters, tensions, scarcity of resources and so on. Maybe most importantly of all: No one is safe. Every character can die, yet in return you also get to play as anyone who has joined you.Plan your adventures carefully, take only what you need, call for scavengers, answer the calls of your fellow survivors and occasionally plow through a zombie-horde with a car. This should sum up SoD in essence.All this glory does have its shortcomings, though. Missions will start to get repetetive due to their interchangable nature, many houses will look similar and the stuff you find in them is not very interesting. Being an Xbox-title originally, the game also looks a bit outdated and struggles with controls. An Xbox-controller is REQUIRED (quote from the store-page) to play this game, at least until they finish the mouse and keyboard controls in a patch.Speaking about patches, this game still is in early development, so a lot of changes will be made in the future. It certainly is promising, just not quite the Next Big Thing.--UPDATE (Aug 2014): SoD does no longer REQUIRE a controller to be played, it now supports mouse and keyboard controls, HOWEVER I still recommend playing with pad as using your mouse will give you some rather twitchy controls."

,Recommended,241540,11069101,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,Emperor Gandhi,"State of Decay is one of the best zombie games in recent memory. However, I wouldn't call it perfection. In fact, this game has plenty of flaws.In the graphics section, I found it to be pretty nice for the most part. However, in the beginning of the game, the lighting is absolutely terrible and hurt my eyes a bit. Despite that, the visuals were extremely nice and I was itching to take a few nice screenshots. However, I can't call it the #1 best part. It's still very well done.The gameplay is heated, difficult, and in some ways, realistic. The gameplay is probably the best part to the game. When you think of zombie games, I assume that you would imagine some dude with a six-pack running around shirtless with shades on dual wielding sub-machine guns, right? State of Decay is NOT like that. These are just human beings we're talking about, not supersoldiers. In fact, if there's anyone people would consider cheap in this game, it would be the Army. But hey, we're talking about the Army here. Did you really think a soldier would be running around and getting tired quick and having a miserable aim? Anyway, running away from hordes IS NOT a good idea. I've tried to run several times, but I've only gotten out alive once or twice. The people who did survive had severe injuries, were extremely tired, or have no useful items left on them. The vehicles are simple enough to drive, and making them limited just makes the game even harder. Very good gameplay.The story is cliche, no doubt. Survivors are holed up in a certian place (In State of Decay, Trumbull County) and the Army refuses to help. However, it seems rather difficult to actually come up with a decent plot for a zombie survival game without realizing someone else did that already.The audio is above average at most. The voice acting is fine, at times weak. It sometimes sounds sarcastic or the mic is far away. However, some of the actors do provide some emotion. The music is great for a zombie survival game, and I usually rely on the music to tell me if the zeds are nearby. Although again, the music is a bit cliche since several zombie survival games (and even shows) use guitars or things like that for their soundtrack. But, the soundtrack is very good in this game and is better than lots of other games and shows that use the soundtrack like this.The replayability is very strong in this game. If you beat the game, you can play through it again once or twice. There's also the two DLC packs that were very critically acclaimed you can buy, too. I didn't get either one yet, but Breakdown looks extremely fun. It's actually number one on my wishlist right now.State of Decay does have a few other major flaws I'd like to point out: The AI in this game is absolutely HORRIBLE. One of my survivors stood there doing ABSOLUTELY nothing while getting eaten by a horde of zombies. Since my guy was tired, I had to run the zombies over. And because usually the survivors dodge the car, he just stood there, doing absolutely nothing. When I hit him, he stood there and I lost trust with him. It was even one of the trust missions where someone is feeling angry, sad, or whatever. He also took like half an hour to get all of his things while the houses next to him were infested when we rescued him. Still though, BAD AI. The dialogue is repetitive and there's not many stories when you're bringing survivors back home. That's probably about it in terms of major flaws.In the end, State of Decay is quite fun and there's lots to do, but the game has some very major flaws that can ruin your experience. Either way, this is a game I'd recommend for any zombie survival fan.Graphics- 8.0/10Gameplay- 9.0/10Story- 4.0/10Audio- 7.5/10Replayability- 9.0/10.:7.5/10:.+Great gameplay+Large world+Awesome soundtrack+Impressive job by some of the voice actors-Awful AI-Repetitive dialogue-Weak lighting early game"
,Not Recommended,241540,13131264,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,Da Busy World of Richard Scarry,"I dreaded to play this game. I was watching the alpha/beta development of this game for a little while, and while I liked a lot of what I read about it, looking at the content didn't look 'refined' enough.The gameplay is not anywhere as smooth as I had hoped and it's hard for me to get past the pre-rendered animations for literally every action. In the beginning I was watching my npc friend attack a zombie and you could see when each attack animation would create a 'stutter' between the next attack.Right in the beginning I watched a zombie trap it self climbing up a ledge, clipping back down, then repeating over and over again.The controls as a whole feel awkward to command and execute, with a lot of fine mouse sensitivity just to execute bulky, long animation sequences.The camera doesn't zoom out very far at all either. For an open world zombie game, your field of view  feels kind of narrow and your character takes up a good size on the screen.The gameplay is nothing like Left 4 Dead, but more like a more arcade gamestyle of Dead Rising with  a Dead Island feel.You do get vehicles in this game though, and they handle really nice. They drive with a good weight to them, rather than the sometimes glidy feel of running around in the game.My biggest gripe about the game is all the heavily scripted actions, which doesn't work when the combat generally tends to be just button mashing, making your character attack at nothing a few times to catch up with all the times you mashed the attack button.I don't know how much can be improved upon with patches and this first game is rather bumpy in a lot of ways and would only recommend to buy on sale, I could definitely see this turning into a worthwhile series. The gameplay is unique and interesting enough that it can definitely be worth expanding on."
76561198072238576,Not Recommended,241540,15422567,"Posted: 17 April, 2015",all,Skornsoul,"Im going to review this game. Not the fact that I put it away for a while to allow for the many many bugs...including the lack of screen support making the guns fire to the left of the target, be fixed. I come back to find this mess has been abandoned and ""remastered"". More likely they realized what a mess it was and just decided to cash in their chips. Heres the deal. Core gameplay problems is what I will concentrate on. Nothing about the developers screwing the fanbase over because there are a thousand of those rants right now.To start with. This is not a survival game. Its a resource collection game with arcade physics thrown in to give you something to do while youre trying to keep your little base alive. You WILL spend most of your time wondering why you can just carry a damn bag in the trunk of your car. See....the game mechanic is this. Break into house. Random loot is in random places. Lets say food. You pack it up into a bag and carry it on your back.....to the car....that you drove there in. Now. Common sense says ""Hey. Ill throw a bag in the trunk or the passenger seat."", or ""Hey, I got a truck. Ill throw the bag in the bed of the truck and I can bring more stuff so I can play the game a bit and not worry about the food situation."" Now we cant have that can we? 1 bag at a time sir. Regardless if you brought a pickup truck or a muscle car. The method of delivery is 1 bag at a time.While youre collecting those bags youll come across radio traffic in the form of side missions. usually its ""Survivor X located at Y, go save them."" That sounds simple but when youre literally in the middle of a mission and carrying a pack of supplies...its pretty much impossible to get there in time. Innevitabley they die and because of the ""I hate your decisions"" system built into the game, your damned squad gets MAD AT YOU FOR FAILING TO SAVE PEOPLE YOU HAVE NO TIME TO SAVE!!!!So you say forget them. Ill just go back to base and turn these supplies in. All will be forgivien. Just about right. Except now that youre back the base is under seige. Right about the time that you come back. You have very little time to run back and forth, nailing boards to windows while your NPC buddies fire away, destroying the boards and....not really damaging any zombies that are crawling through. Eventually you get a few hits and some damage. Then survive the night. The ""Seige"" is what its called. Oh...but dont forget to kill ALL THE ZOMBIES!!! If you forget just one...anywhere...they will not stop the seige mode and more will come. I had a zombie stuck in a staircase that I couldnt kill and the seige just kept on until...well....I lost all my crew and myself. Lets assume for the sake of brevity that you manage to save the idiots standing around...I mean, your team mates. You have a broken leg. How? Zombie punched you in the arm maybe...who knows. Now we come to....Tired and worn characters. Not only are your resources limited the characters you get to control are also depressive, unskilled, and sometimes just better off holding a grenade and running toward the largest hoard you can find. So here you are. Youve had the black dude with the vest or the military chick the whole time. Theyre the starting characters and quite frankly the best ones Ive found. LOVE the black dude in the vest. He weilds a sledgehammer like an anime warrior swings a mystic too big to hold sword at demons to split them in half! However...here you are. Unable to walk very far and tired. So you have to trade in. Cool...cool. Ill just use someone else. Its here that the game reveals just how hard it can push when it takes a dump all over you. See...the other characters in the game arent really all that useful. There are a few here and there that are ok but theyre all random when you get them. The way you mainly get them? Remember earlier when I said you gotta rescue people? Yeah. So anyways. Youre now forced to use some old lady thats an alcoholic chain smoker and has ""A general knack for cleaning""........great.Well you use the old bag lady who clans house. You kill zombies and raid houses. Every 12 minutes a call comes through to ""Return to base. We have a horde incoming!"" Yay.......another siege. Its only been like....10 minutes and you just got to the actual story mission area. Nope. Head home and battle more zombies. Well now that youre finally here and collecting supplies while playing through a mission....boss fight. Great. Your bag lady just got killed. Now its back to the wounded guy from earlier. You use him and...well....you were too slow and now hes dead. You decide....Ill take a break.You come back from said break, unaware that while youre gone...the game keeps on. So you come back to a game where some survivors took supplies to trade with other survivors, they didnt get back because they were trapped by a zombie horde, theyve lost your supplies, and now youve got to take ""Jim Boscoe"" to save them. Jim is a derelict, chronic alcoholic, that wheezes like an old school bus muffler and coughs up just as much when you rev the engine. Hes armed with a pole that he picked up and smells like a bag of feet. Go get em Jim!Thats the biggest issue, The character ""story"" is generic as all get out. The intricat relation you thought you had between the military chick, black dude in the vest, and white dude in ugly shrt? Yeah...thats all for nothing as the dialogue is written in such a way that not only is it not changed....its CONTINUED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS IF NO ONE EVER DIED!!! The story just chugs along like an Austrailian land train convoy! No impact. No repercussion , except that now instead of having an actual ""hero"" character...youre in control of a useless whino. Yeah...because thats what I want to be in a game. A whino with a length of rebar!Lets just say for the sake of things you decide to run with this....you should consider getting tested at this point...youve had warning and I didnt. By the way...at this point can you tell this is  100 percent MY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME?!?! So youre Jim...the whino savior of the badlands. You climb into your muscle car and you just want to do a mission. You find the location is on the other side of the map and go. Because youve got no skills you decide to just use the car. Doing so destroys the car and when you get out to switch you find the ""stealth"" element to Jim is severly lacking. There is NO DAMNED STEALTH ELEMENT! You are either behind a wall or you are seen. End of. The people who claim there is a stealth element are lying. Period. There is a stealth element attempted but not implemented all the way. So what you get is guess work instead of applied skill. I guess it adds to the ""intensity"" but at this point the ""intensity"" is annoyance. You get to the mission area....youve thus far ignored at least 2 cries for help, a person trapped in a siege building, and a siege at your own base...because screw it you just want to plod on with the mission!Final problem. Joe is underpowered. Yeah. See. Games like Da-Z, Project Zomboid, H1Z1, The Dead linger...theyre all like this game in some ways. Theyre all worse and better so Im not advocating any of them individually, however, they did get one thing right. See. State of Decay has zombies that ar at different difficulty to kill. The Big'uns are FAR harder to kill and the Shrieker is the highest priority to kill. Well. The characters that are capable, the ones you worked on to get to that level, the ones you spent the last 6 hours of gameplay on....theyre all dead. Jim has a lenght of rebar to fight 2 armored zombies, a Big'un, and a shrieker....who are all in front of the mission building. You say ""Screw this. Im running these cats over!"" Then you find out that hitting the Big'un destroys the car. Now your car explodes and Jim is dead.This, unfortunately, is the game."

My first experience with this game was while it was an alpha and I am happy I waited to play for real until it was ""finished"".  For the most part the game is finished there are still some bugs that are silly and gamebrakeing.  (minor)   However what is broken in this game isnt really the game but the concept.  If you want your game to be hard as hell thats fine.  In fact its actually a really good thing as long as you follow a simple rule.  Either you allow the user to adjust the difficulty with silders, or if you still want hardcore to be the only mode you need to make sure that mode doesnt interefere with the fun.  And holy crap does that mode interfere with the fun.   Lets remember you cant really save in this game, you make a bad decision and too bad you now need to start over the WHOLE GAME!!  I could go on attacking this feature but I guess the fan boys would not understand.   If you buy this you will need to download the hack that helps to balance fun.  Even with that the game still kicks your butt with sending you on mandatory missions every minute or two.  Problem is that it can take 30 minutes or so to finish the first mission, so you are guaranteed to get screwed.   This isnt a game, its an attempt to **** with everyone who buys it.   There are good things about SOD, the game makes you care about the survivors and you can get into the game.   There is fun to be had here its just so impossibly hard to find and enjoy.   Graphics and color must be altered to create a look because otherwise it would be a crime.   I REALLY hope some moders get ahold of this one and make it playable.    My Score   30/100  Horrible"

I really look forward to see some other types of environments in bigger size.2. Max stamina or stamina itself is way too limited so you can't really have any fun. Yes, it meant to be a realistic game but it's rediculously SHORT as if the Z-virus in game clogged half lung of every characters in this game.3. The resources are way too short... also even when you found a bag of something, the actual contents in the bag is almost nothing. Hand full stuffs when you break the bag. You are forced to keep on scavenging resources all the time makes you worried about them even when you are on a mission and never have a fun of hitting a jackpot. NEVER.4. No story what so ever. Well, some of you may say the entire purpose of this game is only surviving... I know that but it could've been something more, something even better than TLOU.. who knows?5.

76561197994287202,Not Recommended,241540,10619099,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,GuardianSpooker,"Let me just say this. I really wanted to enjoy this game. But after hours of playing it, I just can't.When it was announced, I was really hyped up and wanted to play it so bad. But once it got released and then I played it for hours, I was filled with nothing but boredom and disappointment.I'll start with the positives since good reviewers should always start with the good and then the bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here. The intense feeling of being chased by zombie hordes, finding supplies to keep yourself alive and fighting zombies. All whilst leveling yourself up so you can take on the hardest of things.Not only that, but there's quests that you get to do as well and some of these quests can repeat themselves too. So you're never short on never having anything to do except just running around.Unfortunately, here's where the bad comes in.The game plays like I'm playing a game on Facebook. If you had a stash of 35 food and then you quit the game to go do something else. Guess what? Once you come back to the game, you find out that your stash of food is only 10 and you'll have to spend all your hard work to go get some more. It ticks me off just to see a game that can play all by itself and then I come back to it, only to find that I'm doing worse than before once I come back on to play it. So it's either play this game after you get done with anything else or just stop playing it forever. Hey Undead Labs. This is Steam. Not freaking Facebook.Also, this is just personal opinion, but I hate the special infected in this. I encountered a big muscular zombie and then once I got too close to him, he grabbed my survivor with his huge hand and ripped him in two. This is an instant kill as well and it doesn't matter if you have full or near full health. I wouldn't have a problem with this if they would only appear AFTER I got a bunch of stuff and survivors. But they seem to appear too early in the game and it's just flat out unfair to the player in my eyes.This game can be unfair at times as well. For example, you'll be in a house with someone and you're trying to fight a few zombies that are attacking you. You are doing so great and you managed to beat them all. But then another zombie comes in and you're already out of stamina like you got freaking asthma. Hence, you can't fight as well if you don't have the stamina in order to swing a weapon. But the stamina drains like you're swinging a freaking sledgehammer when you're not even using one and it regenerates so slow as well if you don't level it up early in the game. The difficulty in this game can either be flat out frustratingly annoying or just total cheapness.Even so, they even promised and announced multiplayer on certain websites on this game too. But boy we're we disappointed when this game got released. This is another big issue to me. I hate developers who don't bring something they promise to their games. Undead Labs, if you needed more time to implement multiplayer into your games, I wouldn't mind. Just re-schedule the release date. I'm a patient man. But no, instead they decided to scrap the idea and just release the game anyway.Listen Undead Labs, you got a good game here. But unless you bring out a good game that doesn't play like a Facebook game, has challenge but, not at the very beginning and has something that you promised like multiplayer, I can't guarentee you're going to succeed as a video game making company. I'm talking to you as a gamer that knows what's best for the video gaming industry.Thank you and good bye. But please don't let this review take you away from buying this game. If you can handle this game playing it by itself when you're not playing it and if you don't mind it being singleplayer, go ahead at buy this. But I recommend buying it when it's on sale like it is now."

I waited impatiently for it to come to the PC after reading about it on the 360 - so I jumped at the chance to play it as soon as it came to Early Access (a perfect use of that system too by the way, the game was perfectly playable and only needed a few months to get keyboard support going and to get it properly optimised)Anyway, the game itself is basic but extremely satisfying for the the cost and the fact that is by no means a AAA title. You start out coming back from some hiking trip, there a zombies everywhere, shizzle goes down and you get contacted by some survivors. From there you are pretty much free to raid the towns, camp sites, farms, trailer parks and just about everything else for resoucres to help maintain moral at your base (which you can move around from a church, to houses, a fairground, a warehouse...), make trades with other groups and upgrade your base and make a few helpful trinkets (molotovs, silencers and whatnot)  A minor irritation to me was everyone will speak to you as if you were the same person no matter which survivor you switch to, but it's not that much of a bother as generally you'll build up a preference for one or two of them you'll end up only using anyway! And that's the other thing - you pour time and effort into survivors, build up imaginary details about their lives (They are relativly bland in the ingame story, but give just enough to get a hint of personality in most cases) only to then slip up and be eaten alive - and it's over. Yep, it's perma-death, you're gonna have to find a new favorite because there's no going back when you loose a survivor. And that's it really, the story is decent, may be a little weak if it was AAA but it's not - it's a cheap zombie survival game that most AAA games could only wish to be (I'm looking at you Dead Island!) For the most part graphics are rather nice here on PC, the animations are pretty basic but completly forgivable. The fighting and sneaking mechanics are solid too. It make you fill in most of the story gaps and lets you create your own attachment to the characters as you wish through the threat of losing time and effort put into each person.If you essentially want the closest possible thing to a real ""The Walking Dead: The Game"" this is it!"

The standard zombies are dangerous in packs, special infected need specific takedown methods (bullet immune, boomer, tank/charger hybrid, stalker), which can encourage you to take the risk and bring a friendly NPC with you (unless its the tank hunt mission in which case it is certain death to the somewhat sluggish NPC character)good map setup where after the campaign intro you can move to and fortify one of several base site options, the dlc provides an endless map escalation scenario (campaign map with an escape to make harder function), and a mode focussed on base defence and deep insertion rescue and harvesting missions.moving around is kept dangerous, campaign map resources are finite so each reload full of (noisy) bullets is important, damaged mele weapons need to be swapped out for fresh ones before they break so they can be repaired overnight, cars though numerous and powerful can start to become limited later on if you crash to many times or get caught offguard while mowing down a horde.the detrimentI had an issue with the storage box where it would force me ot take the 1st item selected whenever I opened the crate, gear is requisitioned by faction/fame points and taking an item out costa more than putting an item in. the bug lead to rare shortages of fame (when it pulled out a ranged weapon)The combat is functional but clunky, the special moves/passives earned by capping player traits help but the basic mele and gun combat lacks depth. distractions, firebombs, grenades, etc help butLack of sneak options. Later on with a capable/levelled survivor I could manage a horde or 2 horde with manageable risk and careful use of a moltov, there were few opportunities where stealth felt like an option. quietly foraging a house in the middle of an infected area is one thing but every new house seemed to have 3-5 zombies you had to take out in the process, being quiet only prevents a roaming herd from getting in on the action (which tends to waste a sizeable portion of resouces to handle safely)core gameplay is similar to dead island, assassins creed (fixed world, unimaginative mele and satisfying stealth kills) and system shock 2 (there's you and an environment and the aggressive hordes out for your blood, resources are limited and you need to get stuff done)"

Blood everywhere.-While driving, you can open your door as a 'door attack'. Hilarity and bloodsplatters.-Stealth kills and sneaking away from hoardes: intense-Loot all the things!-An abundance of missions in a fairly expansive world-Build-A-Base mechanic makes your survival a changeable experience-Don't die! Hardcore lives. You die, you can't come back. Only play as another character. The autosave feature enhances this, as you can't just go and select a save file. Be safe out there.The game, in my opinion, is fantastic. I've had so much fun in the short time I've played it, and it looks like I have a way to go.There are a few problems, though, but not any that ruin anything.-Small glitches in fighting, grounded zombie can suddenly stand up and attack you from behind-Some repitition (though wouldn't surviving like this be repetitive?)-Dialog repeating (can get annoying)-Very easy sometimes. The difficulty should be toggleable, as right now some 'hard'-type missions can be done easily.If you're on edge about getting this game, I nudge you towards buying it. This game is full of moments, which is something I look for.

Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I think it would be nice if the developer would add more of a backstory on the characters, more events and missions, and more safehouses/upgrade/fortification options as that is the best part of the game in my opinion.I kind of burnt myself out on this game for a bit but then started watching AMC's The Walking Dead and got back in the mood for it. It's a good simple game that you can pick up where you left off and play off and on as you wish.All in all I think SoD is worth $20. I just hope to see better expansions in the future.

This is despite I like to really live the character I play, because in State of Decay you play several characters. They get tired, hurt, die, and when that happens you really need to find someone else to switch to – the dyeing part is obvious though!To me this game is a mix of The Last Stand: Dead Zone and Rebuild and then made into a big third person shooter. Roughly.It has been made so you really feel the realism. Cars break down, but also carry things in its trunk. You need to scavenge food, materials, medic, ammo and fuel, so your base continually keeps running. Because yes, there is a base. You are to decide what to build and where. Save strangers and allies from distress. Fight hordes of zombies – and oh the zombies! They are hilarious. Have you ever gamed The Movies? The way they run, this is how some of the zombies run. I love it!The AI, yeah it could differently be better and even though the game screams coop-multiplayer there are non and there will not be. Also I find it frustrating, that sometimes you sit with the feeling, that nobody but you are the one to really pull the plugs. Even though there are opportunities to get support, they really are only there to help you fight. So don't expect them to help more than that – not even at missions, which I missed a little to make it feel more realistic.But I do look forward to a third State of Decay, meanwhile I warmly recommend this one.

You can create outpost in abandoned buildings against zombie hordes and choose your own base which is limited but there are quite a few spots that can be used as base and upgrade it with more buildings. You can let other npc survivors join your base if you earned enough trust.The combat system is solid and fun, depending on the characters you can choose different skills and try new things out so you don't really get bored if you are choosing other survivors to play. The world is big and looks quite good. Some cars lying around in the world are driveable. It feels great! A little like GTA if you drive around :DWhat can I say more.

However, it is not a great game by any means.PROS1.I love the open world sandbox feel, it actually made me care about how I managed resources and people.2.Base customisation is obviously awesome3.Each character has a little difference, and in some cases you actually go out of your way to help certain characters. (My anime loving soldier)4.The deaths, it seems like a weird point, but they're imaginative and funny (In a really morbid way).5.It's singleplayer. This is really strange, but in my opinion it was nice to find a zombie survival game with an indie background that wasn't just a multiplayer deathmatch.6.The loot randomisation is quirky and silly.CONS1.In my opinion lifeline sucked. I thought it was practically the exact same thing but with more escort missions and searching.2.Zombie hordes don't really seem that threatening unless you run into one with no weapons, and even then you can usually run to the nearest car3.I thought it was too easy to find high end weapons such as the M27 IAR or the UMP45. I thought it should have been; pistols, shotguns, hunting rifles, and the occasional ""weak"" SMG, such as the Uzi.4.There isn't much to do after you've secured a town with outposts, it would be nice if the spawn rate increased with the outposts and they launched more attacks on your base with more specilised zombies, such as the Juggernauts. This is stealing a page from Lifeline (Which I explained I did not like) but that was one of the only impressive features about the entire thing."

There isn't much of an introduction upon staring a new game and you are thrown straight into it with a journal to read to gain information on who you are, what you were doing up until the apparant zombie apocalypes.The controls are pretty simple, nothing strenious i've found. No multiplayer which I found surprising at first but thinking about it; what's the point in paying out for servers when the top dogs are going to be the Left for Dead series and now Dayz for the forseeable future. If Microsoft Studios were realistic about this then possibly a wise move; and a little more investment into the game itself. I think the idea of this is more to game play; the graphics and charactor models themselves are not amazing. In fact if I was being over picky one could say the actual graphics and AI are somewhat terrible.I'd class it as the sensible soccer of zombie games,  it'll never beat the top dogs like fifa (or in this case left for dead and dayz) but does offer a fun alternative.Wait for the sale."

The gameplay was just not for me, but the more time I have spent with this game the more I am loving it.Its like that annoying friend that you love yet want to strangle at the same time, What I mean by that is the survial aspect of this game is wonderful. And the gameplay ended up opening up past what I saw in my first play through. While other zombie games focus more on the killing or maybe the looting this game focuses on a group dynamic. It will make you consider putting your character in danger in order to bring back supplies for a sick group member, or maybe searching a market for more food to feed the group, buy doing so putting yourself at risk to being torn apart and having your character being gone for good. Yes there is perma death meaning if you level up a character and make one mistake they are gone forever all that time you invested in them gone in a blink of an eye. It really changes your mentality on how you go about day to day things in this game, Not only are you wanting to put yourself at risk to better your group but by doing so you risk your own character and these struggles really start getting to you.You can of course ease the struggle buy leveling your character, traveling with a partner which will cost influnce or calling in favors like back up from a swat team or you can set up outpost to protect them more allowing them a better chance at survial on supply runs they will make.This game does have some glitches and bugs let me be clear I am by no means gonna say it doesnt this is not a perfect game by the hardware standpoint but for me none of them are game breaking or really upset me annoying yes and that is what I ment by that friend you want to strangle, but by no means are they bad enough for me to rage out and want to never play again. Not once did a bug hinder my ability to play the game or did it effect a mission for me up to this point.This game is a wonderful refreshing take on zombie survial and at the end of the day that is what this game is and survial game where you try your best to hold out as long as possible with what you can scavenge or with the people you meet its not all that spectacular in the terms of story but at the heart of it you have a real to earth hardcore zombie survial game and that is all it claims to be and it delivers with great gameplay and new take on the genre that I really enjoyed."

State of Decay is a game which is all about surviving a zombie apocalypse, but it has much more to it then you think.The game is a lot like the walking dead, meaning When you first start out you find a group within an hour of playing the story. Then to help out the group you can do tasks like fetching supplies, or even helping out neighbours for rewards.You can build utilities in your base, and even move bases later on in the game. If your neighbours trust you enough, they might even ask to join your group. You can also ask one of the main characters, Lilly Ritter to radio out to other survivors so they can join you, or ask if any other survivors know where food/weapons/ammo etc. can be found.Survivors will lose hope in the group's survival, because it's still a zombie apocalyse and they're dead people trying to eat you, so you can talk to them about it and get them to blow off their steam while killing zombies or boost their esteem.The weaponry in this game comes in different varieties, there's guns and melee weapons, but there's different types of them. for meleee weapons, there's blunt types, edged, and heavy weapons. For guns there's shotguns, snipers, handguns, and assault rifles (which are hard to find.)Each survivor has their own pros and cons, for example one could be a good shot, but is an alcoholic, which would determine the survivor's stats. In the game, there are six slots for your character's stats. The four stats which every survivor will have is fighting, cardio, shooting, and wits. The other two can be for anything special about the character. For example, the first survivor you start out with, Marcus is a physical powerhouse, meaning you should have him using heavy weapons like sledgehammers, (my personal favourite combo) and he's also a born leader, making him one of the (best survivors in the game hint hint.) Each of those stats can be leveled up to a maximum of seven, but starting at four you can choose a perk that you can also level up seven times. Starting at level four of fighting/shooting, you can specialize in a type of gun or a type of melee weapon then level up that specialization up to seven as well.The fighting mechanics are pretty straightforward, if you use the rolling mechanic correctly you shouldn't actually have to use guns. There isn't that much of a story, but the game is mainly focused to surviving. The game can get kind of repetitive, but this game isn't actually in a completed state yet. This is one of my favourite games of all time, and I rate this 9/10."

It is an indie game and was first released on the Xbox 360 as an arcade game, which means they had limited size constraints in building the game. This, however, did not stop them from making a very fun zombie apocalypse game where the goal is keeping your group together and alive. This is NOT a 'go kill zombie, atta boy' game, there is so much more to it than that.1. You do not play as one character. Everybody whom you have 'friended' in your base, you can play.2. If your character dies, you automatically switch to another friend in your base and continue play.3. You can level up your active character by doing things that would logically enhance those abilities. Run a lot to build up your stamina. Battle zombies to gain combat skills. Shoot zombies to gain firing skills. Ect...4. There are a lot of guns to choose from in the game, over 100. There are a lot of melee weapons, but not quite the plethoria as the guns.5. Noise. Keep it quiet if you don't want zombies breathing down your neck. Feeling good about yourself, make some noise and take out the incoming zombies!6. Vehicles, take them for a spin. Unlike other games like FarCry, where the vehicles seem to have one center wheel, the vehicles in this game act just like real vehicles should, with 4 tires on the ground. It has been noted, however, that you sometimes get launched into space, or hit invisible obstacles. I only saw this when I had a slow computer, so if thats you, be prepared for it. You can also stash loot in the trunks for your scavanging pleasure! I especially like driving by zombies and take them out with the car door! Ha ha!7. The map is static, but the containers that might have loot, and the loot itself is random, every time you play the game. Its a good sized map. And you can enter 96% of the buildings on the map looking for loot to bring back to base.8. You can bring one follower along with you, from your base. There are other survivors out there looking for a safe place to stay, will you gain their trust enough so that they want to join you? Do those people have useful skills that you could use at your base?9. Your base. There are several locations across the map where you can setup your base. Each one has different requirements and has a different set of built in facilities, as well as open facility slots you can build on. Do you want the medical facility, or perhaps the kitchen. But then, the gym would help increase your stamina. Oh, the watchtower can be used to shoot zombies that get too close. But, a workshop could repair your weapons and your vehicles. Or a machine shop so you can build pipe bombs... So many things to choose from and you only have a limites number of spots.10. Missions? Lots of them from story missions to base moral missions, to helping other survivors in order to gain their trust. The game is frantic at times, with zombie hoards heading to your base that you have to take out before they arrive, to survivors in dire need of immediate aide!And there is so much more in this game. For the price, this game has a great deal going for it and will keep you busy for a long time. Its also very enjoyable and I think anyone who likes an open world, some base building features along with exploration and scavenging will also enjoy this game."

It has a strong focus on the survival aspect of the zombie apocalypse, but also includes plenty of action. I actually felt like I was part of the Walking Dead TV show.You are in charge of a group of survivors, although you don't play as one specific character. When you find and rescue people, they will often join your community, eventually becoming your friend. You can take direct control of any friendly character at any time. This is essentially a ""lives"" system, because if you die, that character is permanently dead, but you can continue playing as someone else. Characters also become tired after performing a few missions, so you need to switch control to a fresh character while the other one rests.Each survivor can endure a lot of damage. I only lost two people to zombie attacks, and only one of those was when I was in direct control. As long as you're sensible with the number of zombies you take on, and keep your inventory well stocked with weapons, ammo and health, the difficulty is reasonable.Combat is quite basic. You can use melee or guns, and there are different types of both, but they don't really feel different to use. Gunshots will draw more zombies from the surrounding area, so you only use them as a last resort. Melee is simply a case of bashing zombies till they fall over, then using a finishing move to destroy the head. There are some special zombies, very similar to Left 4 Dead's hunter and tank, plus Killing Floor's bloat and siren, but only the tank is difficult to kill, due to its high health.As you fight zombies, your melee and gun skills will automatically level up giving you passive buffs, which means its best to focus on playing as a couple of survivors, and getting them levelled up high. But if you lose a high ranked character and have to start again with a newbie, its not as punishing as, for example, Xcom.You also need to manage your community's home base. You start in a church, but have the option to relocate to one of several larger sites. You can upgrade the sleeping area, kitchen, storage, workshop and more, to support a growing population.You then have to scavenge houses and other buildings in the large open world, for supplies such as food, medicine, ammo, fuel, weapons and construction materials. The larger your community, the more supplies you need. You can carry resources back to base yourself, summon friendlies to assist, or set up outposts, which gives you ownership of the building and its contents. Fortunately there are plenty of cars available to help you travel around the map quickly. They're also very useful for running over zombie hordes.There are plenty of missions involving interactions with other groups of survivors. The story is pretty good, although nothing you haven't seen before in the zombie genre. Dialogue is well written and fully voice acted. I finished in just under 12 hours, which is pretty good value for money. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and most commands are fully rebindable. You can save at any time but only have one save file per game, so you can't reload to undo a death.The main reason I waited until now to play was because every time I checked the forum there were lots of bug complaints. It would appear that most of the major problems have been patched now, because my experience was very stable. I didn't crash at all, and although some aspects are a little rough around the edges, there was nothing that spoiled my enjoyment. I didn't have any framerate issues on high settings but I did get the occasional brief stutter while driving, which I assume was loading in the next area. The most common problem I had was I sometimes saw zombies and NPCs clipping through a building's door texture when the door is open. But I can forgive that because the rest of the game is fantastic.I very strongly recommend State of Decay, and a full price purchase is absolutely worth it."

It is also changes that perspective by not only making one protagonist, but if you were to befriend a survivor enough, you could control them as well. So it has the same aspects of L4D but your working with not just your group, but with the world and other survivors as well...In my opinion this is one of the best games in the zombie genre i've ever played"
,Recommended,241540,7960769,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,GRRRR,"Never played DayZ but i guess this is comparable to offline DayZ with base-building and character leveling.Zombies happened so you set up camp, get dudes and stuff and avoid dying. It does an interesting thing in that it sorta separates available resources into items your current character uses - stashed in a locker which dont get touched by npcs at all and ""community resources"" (food, ammo, meds). As long as you play you use the locker items (weapons, ammo, stamina/health items etc), when you log off the game does a simulation spanning a certain amount of time and when you relog stuff will have gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥or not depending on how well stocked you are on those community resources and the general state of the community when you left the game. Kind of an Animal Crossing thing but less mafia badgers and more gore.The currency you use to take stuff out of your own (makes sense kinda) aswell as other survior groups lockers which is also used for stuff like base building - called ""influence"" - is barter based in that putting stuff into lockers will earn you points but the bulk of it comes thru doing side missions. Its also modified by a trust value (e.g how much have you done for someone you wanna trade with), taking stuff from home is the cheapest, taking stuff from neighbors you did some missions for will be so-so and then taking all the bullets off some doomed bozo enclave you just found is most expensive.To find items you scavenge, community resources are again abit different in that you can take them home for a fixed one time amount (might not be that easy since theyre quite heavy) or you can set up an outpost in the building theyre in which generates a smaller quantity daily - in most cases preferable since those also serve as forward bases with their own locker and a safe-ish zone and also have a defensive function in that they blow up the especially large roaming zombie mobs the game generates regulary with traps. The common way to find new dudes is to build trust with an enclave until they wanna join you, hopefully before they inevitably are wiped out the next time you log in.As for home bases, when you eventually get storypushed from the beginner base you select from fixed sites. Once set up depending on the location theres fixed facilities and a varying amount of free space you can choose to build whatever on. Stuff like a watchtower, extra beds, infirmary, garden etc. Not having or having certain ones will impact the simulation aswell as actual gameplay. To label the most important ones, with no beds everybody will be♥♥♥♥♥♥tired reducing max stamina, and next time you log in without an infirmary somebody coulda died from the coughs and ingame healing will take longer.Apart from these technicalities, you level your current dude you run around with (youre not bound to a main character) in a variety of stats ranging from stamina to weapon skills - some have extra plus good ones enabling them to wrestle zombies Frank West style at high levels, some might be relatively useless in the field but have skills like cooking or mechanic which make them invaluable at base.One thing to bear in mind is that in order to give you something to do outside of the story missions the game essentially makes everybody but the character you currently play stupid (or more stupid ohoho). Productivity rests entirely on you, everybody else produces babysitting tasks like ""HALP im sitting in a barn lead me home"" or ""I saw this totally nonthreathening thing i could kill myself easily/extremely dangerous and normally best avoided thing lets kill it"" among others. All sidequests are on a timer but generally all but one will end up lethal for the involved if ignored. You can prioritize based on morale/influence needs aswell as trust gain with the npc which is important if you wanna play as them. Character skills seem to factor in somewhat so its likely that youll have to get the same lowbies out of♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again - tempting to boot the worst offenders sometimes. Opposed to that are the rare calls from the combat veterans which almost autocomplete on arrival because theyre already standing on a pile of corpses. Thanks for calling me to watch, braggart.In conclusion to this huge wall of text, in terms of a zombie apocalypse survival sim this is prolly the best you can get at the moment (that i know of). If youre on the fence or got a backlog of other games i would hold off until the next patch (december 2013) or so since there are avoidable but pretty annoying bugs, otherwise go for it, good stuff."

To put it simply none of the other zombie survival games I have played quite give you the same apocalyptic atmosphere. In state of decay you really are outnumbered and are constantly surrounded by a feeling of impending doom. Survivors are thinly spread out so when you do come across them its a battle to keep everyone together. Death comes swiftly for the unwary and the zombies vary from slow to fast. They also pick up on any noise you make very easily making it truly scary if you accidently smash or hit something near a building full of the things. Rest assured they will waste no time pouring out and homing in on you. Fortunately there are vehicles dotted around which really can be life savers when you are cornered. Its not always possible to outrun a horde once you get spotted. You either have to try and find somewhere they can't reach or literally fight for your life. Also being in a vehicle just buys you time as the hordes in this game are more than capable of trashing your ride including ripping off doors! The map is fairly big with a ton of buildings to explore. Some just contain zombies while other may have useful gear, other survivors or can be turned into a base. The game does have a day / night cycle and believe me when I tell you its not a good idea to be lost in the woods just as darkness falls. You can hear the zombies but you can't see them. Terrifying stuff.Each survivor has their own story and personality. They won't sit around idle either and each day they will do something.The graphics aren't too bad but the controls and interface can be a bit of pain at times. The game does have flaws but they are minor and in no way break the game.I give this game 8/10 but only because of the minor faults. Perfection would have got it a 10."

This is a rare gem among zombie games in terms of its openness, realism, and immerion.  That's not saying much, though.  Most zombie games are either empty bloodbaths or are stiflingly linear rpg or puzzle games.  In this game violence comes in short, ultra-intense bursts and can easily be deadly if you aren't playing the right character for that particular situation.  And though I really wanted a sandbox game, the linearity in this game doesn't seem quite as opressive as in other zombie games, and the level of player choice in problem-solving and resource control technique is impressive.7/10I am dissapointed by the lack of multiplayer.Then again, if the devs took these mechanics and put them into a procedural sandbox mmo, my life would end.Edit: If you don't play for a few days you lose resources.

Now having forty hours logged into this game just after a few days, I can safely say this game is totally worth it at a discounted price. It has a terrific blend of Sims and Day Z. However, after a long period of time it throws in the staleness of Infestation: Survival Stories.Make your way to a safe house, build up defenses, recruit survivors, and monitor meters. That's State of Decay in a nutshell. Once you've done that, you do it all over again after you pack up and move. Difficulty increases as you progress, but it isn't quite enough. The game excels in keeping players interested by looting, meeting new people, and having interesting missions. These do outweight the negatives, but when you run into one of the negatives, it packs one hell of a punch.For those starting off, they may feel overwhelmed by the amount of things that are thrown at them at once. Even after they get the hang of everything, they still may feel overwhelmed. I never really thought I'd complain about a game having TOO much stuff to do, so State of Decay takes the award for that. There would be times that I'd leave my safe house to knock out a mission and immediately gain three or four more after moving fifteen feet. Some missions will take precedence over others, and others are a nuisance simply because it's going to lower a meter on another survivor.AI can be a hassle at times as well. Your fellow survivors LOVE to pick the most infested area to be in. Smashing zombies is fun, but sometimes the odds are against you and your AI companion refuses to assist. They'll stand in the center of a horde, kick a few zombies, and then get knocked prone after a matter of seconds. The entire time you'll be too busy attacking what is in front of you, and end up getting sacked from the backside. Unfortunately, reflexes will not be too handy as the controls are a bit wonky at times. Players can dodge, but sometimes you get cheap-shotted and end up losing your already very valuable health. This leaves you your only option of evacuating the premises.  If you're lucky, you'll resort to using a car to run over the pursuing zombies. Hopefully you don't run into a special zombie.Playing State of Decay will require a lot more caution than other skull bashing game. It stays true to the nature of DayZ in terms of not wanting to die. Players get a bit attached to survivors simply because they invested time im building their skills up. The auto save feature, with no choice of manually saving is a double-edged sword. You're grateful that your progress is always saved, but at the same time you will completely go bonkers when you end up losing a survivor to a completely silly death. For example - while climbing a survey tower I paused to look at my map. In that moment, I accidently tapped my jump button - hurling my survivor through the air and to his death. There was no chance of getting him back, no pity for him, no chance at redemption from an embarassing death.After bashing in thousands of zombie heads, you'll come to realize that this game isn't really going anywhere, anymore. The sandbox novelty is slowly wearing off and the game is now a chore of constantly keeping supplies up and people happy. Once you've got things maxed, you'll move locations in hopes of another difficulty or play style. Then you do it all over again.All in all, State of Decay - for a discount price, has a lot more to offer than many $50 games *cough Ghosts cough*. The game provids enough entertainment for a 40-100 hour play through. You'll restart several times, try different locations, look for different survivors, and play in a different style.  That will definitely be enough for $10.00."

Natural and instinctive, no arbitrary levels and XPEnvironment? No painted on walls and doors. You see structure, you enter structure, you hope you can loot structure.Combat? Melee feels right, aiming feels right, I've never had a bad fight that made me feel the game was to blame.Structure? I've lost three characters on my most recent game and it hurt, badly.  They were different, they had unique skills, voices, clothes, it didn't feel like loosing a grunt in XCOM, it felt like loosing a real character. You know how on game of thrones, you know people are going to die but it still hurts, even though its just a story? Yeah, that's how I feel.  Except its usually my fault in tihs game."

This is what I originally envisioned DayZ(sa) would be like - building outposts, home sites, supporting your community of survivors, meeting other groups of survivors, seemingly never-ending open world.I understand that this is a single-player game, and so the ""supporting your community"" and ""meeting other groups"" is just a bunch of NPCs, but still.Undead Labs has designed something amazing here!

I quit the game after 25 minutes, but after a few days I picked it out of my steam library to give it another shot. I don't regret that in the slightest.There is no main character really. You're going to be swapping through characters very often. There is a story and a plot but it's somehwat minor. It doesn't tell the details from just one characters perspective, and many dynamic set of characters cause the game to focus on the plot of other people around you, such as the various factions you can help or hinder, rather than the set of characters that you can have on your team.You might dislike the same voice acting from several characters, but their lines were voiced very well and it didn't bother me. The cast seems to have a unique design for the set of characters save for the voice acting.If Microsoft invested a bit more money to give it more polish, it could have recieved universal acclaim."
76561198008899722,Recommended,241540,13873894,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,DragonsDeck,"This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management.  The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak.  You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play.  I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable.  That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me.  Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break.  There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation.  While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone.  The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game.  The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore.  The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner.  Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time.  Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these  side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done.  You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done.  You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around).  In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags).  Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made).  Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory.  If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time.  There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more.  But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way.  The fit the game really well.  As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part.  Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up.  Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable.  The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game.  You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest.  Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point.  One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable.  There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game.  Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me."

Once you loot a building, it'll stay empty forever. When your trusty melee weapon wears down, it'll permanently break. And once a member of your group dies, he or she will stay dead. No going back: the game autosaves, and it keeps only the last one. While never being particularly hard, the game very effectively makes you feel that you are in a bad situation that can only get worse in the long run.To me, this game feels like a cross between Mount & Blade and The Walking Dead.

It is a good, fun, if sometimes flawed and frustrating game.  If you want to play something akin Walking Dead in a early Resident Evil/Tombraider console style then get this.However be warned that its far from a polished game.  Some mechanics will have you scratching your head and the graphics are of console quality.  Probably the worst aspect is the story based missions that force you to attempt missions even if you arent ready for them.  Combat is can also be unrewarding and repetitive.Best bits are the party and base management.  Driving cars into hordes and exploration is fun, while searching & finding loot is the most rewarding aspect of the game.  Probably better than killing the zeds.  In addition to searching buildings and loot equipment and weapons, you can establish outposts and setup bases which can be upgraded which adds to the immersion.There is some character customization and they can level in certain perks so that keeps things interesting.  Voice acting and music is also good and the dialogue exchanged between party members is well done.Replayability is fair through the use of randomized minor missions and party/base events that affect key resources such as food, medicine, ammo, materials, fuel and morale and influence which allow you to do things such as take out different equipment and people.  Of which there are loads of.After my initial reservations Id say this could be a fantastic game in time, esp. if the devs tackle the console-y stuff that remains: poor control system (for PC), inferior graphics and resolution and pace the story missions a little better.All in all not my dream game... but not far off."

I was very excited about this game; I don't have a lot of money for games and usually only buy them on offer, sub-£5, but I couldn't wait for this game and all the hype I read sounded great.So I bought it full price and played it through. Whilst I can't deny having some enjoyable times - I was a fan of the way the game seemed to persist when you weren't playing, making a base was enjoyable and some of the missions were fun - I was overall very disappointed and felt kind of cheated by the critic reviews and the game developers. The game was just too easy; it felt as though there were no real challenges and that the game was designed so that everyone could finish it without too much trouble. I don't feel as though I am some elitist gamer; I'm happy that the game can be accessed and enjoyed by players of all skill levels but there really is no reason in the world why a game developer should choose not to include a difficulty setting in the game menu.. unless of course they were selling an expansion pack shortly after release which would advertise 'increased difficulty' as one of its selling points.I haven't bought the expansion pack out of principle and I stopped playing the game shortly after completion, which really does not take very long at all. I delayed finishing the game until I had completed all the side missions but the main story finishes very quickly - another selling point for the expansion. This feels like a rant, but one of the aspects of reviews which made me most interested was the idea of character permadeath. This turned out to be a huge exaggeration and I didn't lose a single character that wasn't scripted (one). To be fair, I was being careful at first, but before long I was wading into hordes with a golf club and coming out unfazed. There really seemed little need for stealth, which took away much of the gravity and tension of the game.Aside from that rant, another criticism of the game was the zombies themselves - it felt as though effort had been made to aim the game at a younger audience with cartoony zombies with glowing green eyes. In all, maybe buy it on offer but don't pay more than a fiver for it. Don't expect much and you might have a bit of fun.Tl;dr: can be fun but purposely designed way too short and way too easy, with no option to adjust difficulty. Also cartoon zombies."

,Recommended,241540,8351381,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,KDStudios (Dan),"Another Zombie game? Yes, one of the BEST zombie games that has ever been crafted.State of Decay kind of reminds me of what Fort Zombie was aiming to be... but didn't quite get there.This game will have you playing for so many hours, you'll be wondering where the daylight went every single time you wake up and go on your computer to play this.This game has base management, character development, skills, levelling up, driving, shooting, melee fighting, zombies, special zombies, walking zombies, running zombies, fat zombies, exploding zombies, different bases to live in, item management, resource management and MORE.When you first start the game up you'll find yourself wondering what is going on, but after a very brief tutorial you'll understand what happened to the land and you can now play however you wish to play.You'll start in your first (or only if you want) base where you'll need to scavenge supplies such as food, medicine, materials, fuel and ammo from nearby locations such as houses, businesses, farms, factories, ruins etc. The game has permanent death, so if your character dies, he's gone forever, no reloading of saves will bring him back. But you can play as other NPC's in your base, so all is not lost, you can continue playing, just you'll have lost a character you may have put a lot of time into training.All bases consume resources, you'll find that in the menu how much it uses a day and it's up to you to make sure you have enough. If you don't have enough resources or the right facilities in your base then people will start to get sick, die or leave.You can upgrade bases by adding facilities to them such as a shooting platform to keep the place safe, more beds to invite more people to join you and all sorts of other facilties. Certain facilities offer a variety of services, such as storage for more resources to be stored there, Munitions shops to build better and more fun weapons, Farms to grow food and machine shops to repair your cars.Because cars can be damaged and they do explode when they catch fire. You need to correct facilities to repair them and cars don't grow on trees, if you blow them all up, you'll have no cars to use and will have to go on foot everywhere.There's a stealth system in the game too, you can sneak around and kill zombies without being detected, it's a very handy skill to master. Noise is VERY important in this game, be too loud and you'll attract every zombie in the area, fire a gun without a surpressor and you'll also attract them all to you.Sometimes hordes appear and if you attract the attention of just one zombie in the horde, all of them will come after you, so always approach them with caution or avoid them completely.The combat system in this game is very fleshed out, a variety of weapons can also be mastered such as blunt (bats, hammers etc), edged (knives, swords etc) and heavy (microphone stands! sledgehammers etc) and even guns such as rifles, pistols, revolvers, smg's and more. You can do so much in this game.There's also an awesome DLC called Breakdown which expands greatly on the original game and instead of the game just ending when you get across the final bridge to escape like it does in the main game, you can play sandbox mode, where the resources are randomly generated and you can play as long as you like, however you like, no main quest missions or anything like that.I really recommend this game because this is how a zombie survival game SHOULD BE!Zombie game developers take note from this game, you could learn a thing or two about making a fantastic zombie game that people want.The only downsides to this game is that it's single player only, it's designed in a way that makes it look like it should be co-op or multiplayer, but it never came and will never be added. So get the sequel when it comes out if you want to play online. Another downside would be that the options aren't very fleshed out, mostly because this is a port from an xbox 360 game, so your favourite video resolution may not be supported or if the game runs bad on medium but plays fine but looks bad on low graphics then you'll have to look online for workarounds to that.Anyway, I recommend the game, I give it 9/10 because it really is a fantastic zombie survival game, even if it can make you angry when your favourite character is ""unfairly"" killed by a zombie (mostly because you weren't prepared for that one horde or big fat zombie).Get it, get it now and have fun! You'll enjoy it!"

I went to check if any updates have been made, and they've completely removed this game from the Steam store, and replaced it with a ""Remastered"" version. And of course Steam won't give me a refund for this THEFT because it's more than two weeks old.I will never touch another game from this developer, EVER.(Previous review below.)The game is promising, but was nothing like I was expecting when I bought it.  The biggest issues I have are related to game mechanics that waste the player's time:If you have to quit the game in the middle of a mission, when you reload your save you will end up back at your base.  For missions with a time limit, this likely means you will fail because A) you can't get back out to the location and finish it before time is up, and B) something else will come up to prevent you from getting back out there, like another damn horde attack as soon as you load your game.Good luck taking care of a horde attack early in the game.  Gunfire just attracts MORE zombies, and melee weapons break too fast to do much good.  Zombies scale walls instantly even if barbed wire is on top, and barriers on doors and windows DISAPPEAR after an attack.  This makes reinforcement useless and stupid."

It lacks many features I would expect, and has many small annoyances, such as the lack of team-features. The only time a character is worth anything to anyone is when you control them. Virtually all of the cars are the same. Maybe 2 skins each on 5 types of cars. Leaving about 10 total different vehicles. The driving also seems incomplete, like some of the physics are just a little wacky.

,Recommended,241540,11939467,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,Quarex,"I played through the single-player campaign and found the game to be a pretty enjoyable experience overall, even if whoever decided to not make constant zombie spawns toggleable (or to make ""persistent world continues even when you are not playing"" toggleable) obviously did not realize how much more versatile a game it could have been for less-skilled action gamers if those were included.  The fighting is usually pretty fun, the base management is simple enough to be enjoyable without overly hindering the rest of the game, scavenging runs feel useful, the vehicles are lots of fun to use--overall, lots of little fun elements working together as a cohesive whole.Interestingly, while I played and LOVED ""Lifeline"" (possibly because I am apparently so much better with guns than with melee that I found it surprisingly easy), I think ""Breakdown"" is about the least compelling possible version of this game, as there is no longer an actual end goal.  With ""Breakdown"" the game feels more like you are playing a 1980s arcade game to get the highest score, and, well, I think we have moved beyond that as a gaming goal by now, surely?  Ha.  But obviously plenty of people love it, as it sounds like the most fun version of the game for many.  But ""run around the base game map and do all the same stuff as the base game, and your reward in the end is to do it all over again on a harder map until you die and lose your save"" does not exactly sound appealing to me.BUT!  This is still a -spectacular- zombie game, and a pretty great game by any standards."

When I first started up the game, I instantly thought ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ did I just buy Dead Island again?"". The answer was no, I didn't. The first few missions and maybe first hour are pretty directed in terms of gameplay and missions but after that, it's a free universe. Gather survivors, supplies, weapons, cars, and influence through a series of life-threatening missions. Wipe out entire hordes of zombies so they don't attack home. Build medical tents, workshops, sleeping quarters, sniper towers, and much more! Drive around the graphically appeasing world but be careful! It might be tempting to run through hordes of Zeds but your car will take alot of damage! Here are some of the highest points of SoD:-Realism: melee weapons and cars all take damage after overuse. Nothing lasts forever!-Challenge: Zombies are actually dangerous and it is always better to avoid them. Don't rush into a fight, bullets are few and so is your energy-Immersive Environment: Witness the world fall apart around you. The military is not your best friend, niether is the established government in Marshal. Have the opprotunity to help total strangers or leave them for dead. It's the closest thing to a Walking Dead experience you'll get if you're looking for something like that.-Defensive Battles: Home is never perfect or completely safe. Zed hordes can rush in any moment if you don't control the population of them yourself. When they come, they come. They climb over walls from all directions and it becomes an Alamo-esque atomosphere. Hold or die, it's simple.-Death is a new begining: Since you can play as multiple characters, your death is not the end of the game. My first character, Marcus, I used to go out and look for survivors in the woods. I was surrounded by Zeds and torn apart. After one character's death, another one will give a quick eulogy and the whole camp's morale will go down.-Home: Make it your own and get involved in that well known zombie apocalypse drama. Keep the morale of your camp up by scavenging and defending against zed hordes. If one character in particular is saddened or angry, do a mission with them to boost their morale and keep them going. Random events will generate (gun misfire, arguments, etc) that all effect the morale of the camp.The Bad:-Not fully optimized for PC: This is obviously a Xbox game, using a mouse can give you sometimes a more glitchy feeling. It does not fully hold back gameplay though, it can make it harder to get the full scope of your surroundings though.-Invisible walls: In houses or other structures, it is common for invisible walls to pop out of nowhere and you will have to shake your mouse vigorously to be free.All in all, the game is great besides for those few bugs. 8.9/10!"

It has a great amount of potential but executes it mechanics horribly. The in game tutorial focuses on combat and does not tell you how to build up your camp. I only found out how to build stations by pure accident because I dropped my controller and it hit the d-pad. In addition events occur while your are NOT playing the game. This normally wouldn't be a problem and might have been an interesting mechanic if it weren't for the fact that the events are randomized and will occur despite how much time has passed. for example the game crashed on me and I went to restart it only to find out that my survivor population had dropped by three and half my morale was gone. What's worse is that the infestations I had previously cleared out had respawned around my camp.In the course of two minutes about an hours worth of work up and vanished. This offline event mechanic needs serious rebalancing as it discourages me from even trying to build up a camp or make progress.  Wait for the finished product.

,Not Recommended,241540,10648392,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Mojyo,"State of Decay is a SINGLEPLAYER zombie survival game set in the Midwest United States. It involves rounding up smaller bands of human survivors and incorporating them into your 'influencial area', AKA your zombie survival society. While this mechanic is thought out in amazing detail, down to emotions and job distribution, a lot is to be desired for the entire game.The first problem I encountered starting gameplay was the somewhat steep learning curve. As the de facto 'leader' of your party, a massive amount of responsibilites are shoved into your arms. And I appreciate that for its realism, of course as a leader of a surviving band of humans in a zombie apocalypse a lot of responsibilites are going to be picked up by you, but in State of Decay the concept is blown out of proportion. Your fellow survivors are utterly inept at taking care of themselves, falling off roofs and demanding to be rescued. Rather than an NPC taking care of the problem while you're out trying to aquire medical supplies, YOU have to go out of the way to save him or else he'll die and everybody will be angry at YOU for not saving him.Another concept that was annoying was the fact you were STUCK with a group of man-children for your survival party. In essence, you had no option to go it alone or become a nomadic survivor. How hard is it to ask for a quiet life in the middle of the woods eating peas and corn out of a can while making the occasional excursion into zombie territory? The main reason why much of my map goes unexplored is because I have to deal with party issues that crop up every twenty seconds or so. I don't want to stop my search for fellow survivors because some idiot back at base slipped and dropped his ice cream.This is another nitpick I had to deal with- the survivor-survivor interaction in the game was DISMAL. While other (NPC) bands of survivors eke a living out in the zombie territory, they never come off as hostile to the point where they start targeting you. While this may seem like a good thing, it's actually an extremely narrow-minded concept. Example: ""oh, all survivors are good, let's all be friends."" More than likely in a disaster scenario everyone would be thinking for themselves, take Hurricane Katrina for example. Gangs of looters were prevalent in the suburbs, and murder was commonplace before the National Guard locked the place down. While some NPCs may express hatred towards you or your group, they will never take an action against you short of refusing to come on an expedition with you.Some other parts of the game greatly affected my enjoyment of gameplay, such as the fact that a solid steel crowbar can break if you hit soft flesh enough times. Close-up mechanics are about as robust as Space Station 13. Gunplay is almost depressing, repeated hits to the forehead from a .44 Magnum revolver to an eight-foot tall inbred zombie monstrosity wasn't enough to put it down, let alone shots from a Remington 750. This was during an early mission, and somehow the thing bugs through the window and tears me in half. Driving cars is fun until you run over enough zombies and your car inexplicably EXPLODES, or you hit a pebble in the road and you go flying. Zombies are also able to latch onto your car even as you're driving past them at 50 mph.However the game still had some redeeming qualities. Guns are correctly named for the most part, only the ones with copyright licenses in place had to be changed and some others were just renamed for easier naming. (But really, 'Monag' is the new Mosin Nagant!? Since when is a 100 year old pre-soviet era rifle licensed?)Visuals are great, especially when walking down the highway. Just ignore that constantly updating survivor-♥♥♥♥up-o-meter in the top right and relax. Dialogue between survivors is frequent and expressive.In the end, this game had a lot going for it, and possibly more in the future, although unlikely. The absence of multiplayer makes playing the game almost a sort of chore. Two heads are better than one, they say. And as of now, there's only one head. This game seemed good, but now it just reeks of wasted potential. The large screen at the start that says ""BUY DLC HURR HURR"" is really a big sign that shows that the developers really don't care about their players. It's quite sad, really.I rate State of Decay a 4 out of 10, because there were so many things that could have gone so right that in the end went so wrong. I want my five dollars back."

Which means keeping everyone fed and housed, stocked up with ammo and medication, and building materials to expand. It’s your choice how you go about it, and what kind of leader you become: though you’ll need to switch characters when one is too tired or hurt (or dead) to continue, you’ll generally have a small core group under your control, and a handful of AI allies to join you on missions. Not that two heads are always better than one on stealth missions, though it pays off when you’re unexpectedly ambushed.It’s a game that affords you a rare degree of freedom, and as such you’ll sometimes find yourself paralyzed by choice. Do you lure zombies out of a house you’re planning to ransack, or smash the window and lob a Molotov through? And when you find a rucksack, do you risk the long trek back to base while encumbered, or break it open for less valuable rewards?It can be tough going at times, and any misjudgments are harshly punished.

The main story of SoD is decent but nothing amazing. Don't buy this game if you're only in it for the storyline. You'll only be left very dissapointed as there isn't much meat on the story. The gameplay on the other hand is what makes this game so addicting and entertaining.The graphics are quite well and there is alot to explore. Ever wanted a zombie game with Sims elements? SoD is what you want. You and your community must survive and gather resources, with small events randomly being triggered around the community and game world. Each new community member that joins you is another someone you can play as. If your character dies you will reappear back at your base as one of your current members. The game itself is only in thirdperson, not that it's an issue, the characters are very detailed and interesting to play as and you almost never feel like playing the same one.As for DLC, Breakdown offers alot of new content such as weapons and unlockable hero's, characters from the main storyline and a few bonuses. Breakdown also makes the game less storydriven and more focused on sandbox style. Surviving or doing whatever it is you wish. Breakdown also has a level stage system. You can fix a RV and eventually, if you desire, leave Trumbull Valley only to reappear somewhere randomly in the game again, just on a new, reset game world with your previous survivors. Going an level up, surviving becomes harder in alot of factors.

76561198052051437,Not Recommended,241540,15455849,"Posted: 19 April, 2015",all,PaulGR,"Note: I deleted my initial popular review (March 30, 2014), in order re-write it and make sure the EDITED one (this one) re-appears again in the review section page.Original Review (Short Version)If you are obsessed with open-world zombie survival horror games, 'State of Decay' will give you an erection.New Review based on the fiasco with the Year-One EditionI've become sick with the gaming industry, and this is perhaps one of the games that I'd never expect would go 'stealing' mode for a couple of extra bucks from people who ALREADY own their game.With their new edition of the game, they've added a 1080p quality with an extra car(no fix for the ridiculous car physics though)and an air-drop mission that sounds like a simplegrab-and-return-the supplies-homefeature and ask for customers who already own the original game and both DLC's to pay an extra 20 euro (with the -33% discount included) for this 'upgrade'. An 'upgrade' thatSHOULD BE FREE for ownersof the game, as is the case with all games out there (and especially the Indie titles). THIS IS A PATCH at best. It should be a PATCH. NOT A FREAKIN' FULL PRICE RE-RELEASE OF THE GAME.Moreover, the endless bugs of the original game were left unfixed, to be partly fixed in this new version, completely abandoning the ORIGINAL version... Funny enough, new bugs emerged so although some were fixed, the game STILL remains as buggy as it was, if not even more...Microsoft StudiosandUndead Labsare literally asking customers: ""You want some of  the bugs we abandoned fixing in the original game fixed? Pay 20 euro for them!""My answer to that is clear:'NO'.I've paid around 30 euro for the base game along with the two DLCs. I am not paying an extra 20 euro for a 'remake'. And anunecessary remake, to be precise, since the game was released no more than 1,5 years ago.Certainly, I'd understand such a visual upgrade if the game was a 2000's title, but doing so for a game released in 2013 is preposterous - clearly a quick cash-grab from the owners of the original game if you ask me. WhyMicrosoft Studios? Why?To me, unless owners of the game with BOTH DLC's have AT LEAST a -70% discount for this minor upgrade of the game, there is no way I am recommending this, and I'd advise you withhold purchasing(especially if you already own the game)because by supporting such moves from developers will only make things worst forusgamers...Just imagine every title, every game out there, after one year of the initial release, coming up with a hypothetical 'remastered' version of the game with slightly better visual quality and an extra 'car' or 'mission' that should be there in the first place and asking for almost the full price of the game AGAIN, from people who ALREADY own the full game. And above all, you are FORCED to buy it since the company no longer cares about the original (older) version, but rather ""focuses"" on the new one. Trust me, that would be a disaster...People are upset and this shows from the huge drop on the game's ratings (from 94% positive to 89% positive in two days), and the numbers keep dropping...Honestly, it pains me, because I used to like State of Decay. Unfortunately it's yet another game that fell in the pitfall of 'greed'.EDIT: As it turns out, YOSE is out and it is a complete disaster. People claim that they can barely tell the visual quality difference between the ""new"" and the ""old"" version and the new 'additions' are MODS at best and some of them already exist on the NEXUS!!I do NOT recommend it any longer"

Keep looking for a good game and don't trust good reviews, not even totalbiscuit.pc optimization and graphics: Can't max the game at 1080p 60 fps on an overclocked r9 290. Turning the settings down I still see dips below 60 fps. The game also seems to want to lock itself to 50fps at certain points for no reason. The menu screens still have xbox buttons on them. This is the worst console port I have ever played. The worst. They didn't even add anti aliasing, just a quality slider and shadows options and that's it. I had to force AA with radeon pro because catalyst control center doesn't work for this game. The graphics are awful. I'm no professional artist, but I could make a better looking game than this. I would never have the audacity to sell a  product that looks like this. The graphics could have been for the original xbox. Actually, halo 2 looked better. The shadows/shading had to be fixed with mods so I could see during daylight. Tried other mods but held off because I read mods like the sweet Fx ones made the game even more buggy than it already is. The screen shots you see on the store page are BULL SHOTS, and even from the bull shots you can tell the game looks a bit dated. The game doesn't look as good as the store page screen shots  at all. It looks like they downsampled and added better shading or something. Sad how bad steam's quality control on games is.soundtrack: Forgettable is all I can say. I can't even hum one song off the top of my head. Once looking up some music on youtube, it was alright and set a decent tone.story: Hardly there, and not worth paying attention to any real progression. More of a survival game I guess. ♥♥♥♥ that, I want  a good story driven, open world zombie game. Instead I got this garbage.gameplay: A little better on this front but still nothing special. The pros include open world with some missions that pop up along side the ""main missions"" to keep things interesting. However, that's where it ends. The cons are plentiful and make the game worthless even if you are someone who can look past the bad graphics. The management is no fun. The resources are limited with unlimited zombies. Haven't run into the problem of people getting killed off while not even playing the game like some have reported, but I have had to deal with the infuriating save system. The saves are auto save only with no loading previous saves. The inventory system is dumb, with the largest backpack barely holding anything. Looked for a fast travel mod so I could atleast drop stuff off at base and couldn't find one. Half the time I can't even switch to another character or get another character to follow me, and there seems to be no reason.(glitch/bug not a matter of team liking me) As soon as the fact that  its open world wears off, which will be within an hour or two considering how small the world is, you'll just see the game as repetitive: go here, clear area/loot house/ hold off incoming zombies mission over and over. The world sucks to explore. Like really sucks. More shallow than an ubisoft open world game. If you're someone who thought skyrim was shallow, stop reading this review, cancel all thoughts about this game, and do something else. Guns are unsatisfying (probably due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse support) and all feel about the same except for maybe the shotguns having spread and less range. Silencers were poorly implemented and break for no reason after a set number of shots. The decision to include no human enemies with guns was a terrible idea. Look at a game like dead island, which I also thought was pretty bad, but atleast had decent gameplay pacing with the mix between zombie and human enemies. The AI of your team and zombies is horrible and makes the game even more horrible to play.Overall, this game is bad, even for an indie game. It won't hold your interest if you have some sort of standards for games, even if you are a zombie fanatic.Edit: Developers dropped support for a new version... Told you so"

The idea of being thrown in a zombie infested city and building your own fort/gathering resources is pretty awesome. After about ~7 hours or so the game begins to show its flaws. Missions are repetitive/annoying, resources are abundant, game combat is questionable. And although there's permadeath, an eager supply of victims are always ready to join your cause. This game is great for a short tryst; but for those who look for a longer, more immersive world should look elsewhere."

,Not Recommended,241540,7989524,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Warr,"I admit that I am coming in as a disatisfied customer in this review, but ultimately I feel it has to be said. From a larger developer, I would be just as angry- but the game's store page has no reference to any incompatibilities it might have had or anything like that. After buying it, and being super psyched to play it after seeing a few let's plays; I downloaded it and waited until everything was done; only to find that when I finally booted the game I was greeted iwht a message 'This game is incompatible with your graphics card, the game was not built to support onboard graphics cards' referencing the model my computer uses. All the while, I can play Skyrim or Xcom on medium settings just fine; but I got to see the menu of the game and if I tried to start a game was greeted with a black screen.I wouldn't have ended up upset or irritated at the game at all, which now just taunts me in my library view; if I hadn't picked it up and spent 15$ (Thankfully it was on sale) only to end up finding that it's paying that much for a game that functionally works; less than even a coaster. I'm glad the game is successful, but one thing I can only hope of indie developers, especially those who have went past the 'bug-testing stage' of their games; is that they follow the method of Paradox Interactive, and actually give support on these matters. While I want to believe in this game, I've basically been shanked for the belief."

It's like Grand Theft Auto with zombies. Sure it could've had better graphics, dialogue, combat, shooting, but the elements that it DOES possess come together extremely well in my eyes and for the discount price I really can't complain. The game is fantastic.  It's like how I imagined a Walking Dead game would be, and while I'm not knocking Telltale, because their story telling is far more superb than what is presented here, this is more of a game in the traditional sense.

It was a good start though, and I hope it inspires a successor.   Pick it up if it's on sale, and you like the genre.In the first 20 or so hours of play, I enjoyed the drama and challenge of trying to find survivors and keep them alive.  I also enjoyed relocating my home site, and playing the various storyline missions.    The map is realistic, immersive and desolately beautiful  in it's zombie soaked way.However, after arriving at my final home site, i found that the games mechanics started to become more and more tedious.   I would need to spend lots of time running out to find building materials, which for some reason, I couldn't pile up in the back of my huge pickup truck.   Also, bringing people with you tended to be a waste of time, since they were both too lazy to carry anything, and would often book it home at random.(there is a way to trick the game into letting you stack multiple rucksacks in the back of a truck, but it's a kluge)The random, and highly repetitive task of trying to keep your survivors happy gets old fast too.It can also be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to find the survivor you want to play, why aren't they on the mini map!?Finally, I think, like may console ports, the control just isn't up to snuff.

Having said that, there are a few ideas to be add to this awesome game that would make it, in my personal opinion, just that much better. Such as being able to place two extra ruck sacks of supplies you find into the trunk of a car for transport or four in the bed of a truck so that it isn't such a mind numbing task to drive half way across the map back and forth three or four times just to get all the supplies out of one house and back to your area of opereations. Also, maybe have the vehicles run out of fuel and have to be filled up by the use of gas cans you find around the world, so you can fill up on the go or use your fuel reserves you have stored up at your base. Maybe even have it so some of the gas stations still have a good amount of gas that you could take but say the power is out and you need to start up a generator to start the pumps but will also attract any nearby zombies, making the game more challenging so you don't just drive a car around the world just searching for supplies making you strategize how you use your precious fuel. But all and all this is one of the best zombie games I have ever played and I love it. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME if you love zombie survival games as much as I do."

This isn't a DayZ ripoff at all, but rather a whole new entity taking little more than inspiration from Dean Hall's critically acclaimed zombie survival game, among heaping elements of Dead Rising and a whole open world to explore that is unparalleled in the genre; fully explorable buildings and the only true zombie game apart from Project Zomboid to feature URBAN AREAS. ALL of which are fully realized and designed. It's not as deep in individual character survival as Project Zomboid or DayZ, but it is unrivalled in community management in the genre.Highly recommended, preferably purchased together with the (ridiculously overpriced) Breakdown DLC for a cheaper price due to Sandbox mode being pretty much a necessity with this genre and the DLC adding little more than removing the story mode and adding ""tiers"" for replay value."

SOD provides the quintisential zombie experience mainly due to the open world enviornment. There is no build up or long boring tutorial, you are dropped inot a zombie debacle and the whole world is your bloody oyster.  The ""Home Base"" feature provides a lot of dynamic elements to the game including building constructrion and upgrades, group members realistically roaming around the grounds, protecting, sleeping reading, w/e always ready to take up the adventuring (if they arent out getting themselves killed already on a mission you sent them or otherwise...).  Time is always running and you have to delagate your duties between scavenging , side missions and story line mission very carefully if you want to maximize your materials and population.  You lose someone.....they are dead, get over it, they arent coming back and with the auotsave feature it is tough to cheeze your way out with alt-ctrl-del.  If you manage to keep them alive however, the level progression is surprisingly deep and rewarding allowing you to really customize the kind of zombie killing machine your survivors will be.  The engine and physics arent revolutionary but they are definitly fun (think Sleeping Dogs with the graphics and GTAIV with the moving , driving and shooting).  This game combines elements from some of the most fun and successful games I have ever played and uses them to truly simulate what it might be like to survive the Zombie Apocolypse."

There are no such thing as electrified machetes or goofy weapons. The game has a good mixture of realism without forgetting it is a game. Another aspect is that you dont just play as one character.

All buildings are explorable as well as most vehicles you can see so they are stuff to do. The gameplay is about handling your survival in this hostile environment by managing your homebase and your crew, getting differents ressources to improve the basement, feed your people and heal them.. You can perform tasks for other groups of survivors (sidequests) and follow the main quest.This game is easy to learn, it's not hardcore as Day-z (e.g: no personal hunger/thirst management) and you get things done pretty fast. The survival feeling is really there and enjoyable. I played it for around 25 hours before getting bored by doing the same stuff over and over, something i would have come over if there was a multiplayer mode!You got to consider State of Decay as the first step of a concept that is supposed to evolve to a multiplayer game in an upcoming title. It's buggy and does not have a high end graphic engine, but from early access to now things evolved in the right way and that does not influence the gameplay.So yeah, if you can overcome those elements, get it!"

There are some nice ideas being tried out and for the most part they pay off and result in a fun game. Some more options for difficulty would have been nice but I believe the DLC has that covered.The graphics are not amazing but they are good enough that it does not detract from the game, there is room for more optimization but it ran fine on my machine which is mid range. I have not yet had a crash which is nice.Considering this is the first game from this developer I am actually suprised how good it is, I know I picked it up rather late in the update list so many issues have been fixed. I recommend picking up the DLC if you see it at a good price purely because I believe that a true sandbox mode is needed once the campaign has been finished. I also think needing to purchase this DLC is a let down in terms of value as the mode should be in the main game from the start!There is a small list of annoyances in regards to gameplay but nothing game breaking, the primary being the inability to set survivors with special skills roles (and not go out and risk their lives). Other than that one though nothing else jumps out at me enough that it detracted from the game. So far I have not had any gameplay bugs which is suprising.There is a really good foundation here to build upon and I am sure if they release a sequal it will be amazing.7/10"
,Recommended,241540,7941938,"Posted: 6 December, 2013",all,RageMonkey,"Yes I recommended it, but only if purchased on a sale price. Why?The game is simply  fun and addictive. However, it doesn't last long, especially if you're like me where you play to win and then toss the game to the side when you're done. After completing the story in about 12 or so hours, I haven't logged back into the game. A large chunk of my weekend was dedicated to this because it had me hooked and I find that hard to come by these days.The gameplay and mechanics are great. Everything runs fairly smooth and keeps you busy with randomized side quests while trying to follow the story. The story itself is a little weak and as mentioned before, short. It's nothing fancy, just basic cut scenes. There times where the story pauses in the game where you seem to be doing side quests for a while until randomly the story picks up again. It's not a bad thing however since you can use that time to gather supplies. There also is apparently a simulated timed feature for when you log out of the game. When you log back in, you may notice your stronghold needs supplies or new random jobs appeared. I didn't really experience this as I played most my hours consecutively. I do think this feature stinks though if you are a casual player since you'd be spending the first half an hour of your game time just doing supply runs and keeping your stronghold hoard free.In conclusion, the game is fun and it feels complete, but I do wish the story had A LOT more to it. Not only in length, but production value. I do recommend, but wait for a deal!PS: I think the DLC ""Breakdown"" they released should really be part of the main game itself. A little annoying you'd have to spend another 7 bucks to play a repetitive game mode. Currently when you complete the story you are bounced back to your game where the final mission is reset. You can continue to ""survive"" off resources, but personally I find no replay value in this since there's really nothing to work for.This game was a great teaser to what Class 4 could be like. Class 4 is Undead Labs MMO version of this game in the works right now."

You stop fearing mobs of zombies and just mow them down. I've never lost a survivor to the zombies. (Except one I didn't want and committed suicide-by-zombie)The RPG elements, while unneeded, doesn't shine through and when a home event, mostly negative, happens, it happens, whether you prepared or not. Also a sandbox/unlimited mode would be nice. (Can't wait for Breakdown)Overall I think the game somewhat lives up to its potential. You will gather supplies and live through a zombie apocalypse, yes, though it tends to become a walk in the park.Also more urban areas and generally fewer vehicles (which are supposed to be rare but aren't) would be really welcome.Also, superzombies... Sigh... All right, most of these can be excused because an armoured zombie is just a zombie in a flak jacket or SWAT equipment, but the juggernaut is ridiculous. The Screamer is all right because, well... It's kind of fair game as well. The bloated zombie is just... Hardly ever meet it anyway.All in all, you'll want to play this game.

There's a big difference in how you play.There's also Perma-death. As in ""I made the wrong decision, now that survivor is dead for good."" So don't spend all your time with one survivor. Because if they die your group will be left considereably weakened overall. That's right. Group. Think in terms of ""Group survival"" not run-n-gun and you'll be fine.Don't worry though, as the game's not that hard once you figure the mechanics out. Deaths usually involve people running around overconfident in their ""skill"" at the game, only to aggro several passing Hoards and getting torn to shreds. It's about sneaking. It's about survival. It's not about running about like an idiot, thinking you can take on the entire world alone. I finished the Story mode without a single non-plot related death, after thirty-odd hours.Change the way you play zombie games and you'll find endless enjoyment, especially with the latest Breakdown DLC. That adds a fully story-free Sandbox mode, with lots of Story mode ""Hero"" character challenges to unlock.Watch a few youtube Let's Play clips like I did.

It does have replay value when it comes to the main story, Lifeline, and Breakdown. Now I do have a few complaints, however, but my overall view on the game is still good.The first and foremost complaint would be that there is no co-op. Of course what they did do for it as a substitute is use the in-game AI characters as your partners (the player can ask another member from the home base/community to come watch your back). I do like that idea, but they could have had the option to also have 2-4 player co-op.My second reason would be that there's not really any sort of dynamic weather system in the game. It would of course add to the atmosphere a little and make it seem slightly more like a realistic world, but the overall game is, of course, not a simulator. I just think that, in my opinion, dynamic weather would make the game a little more interesting in a way. Like the rain could affect the zombies somehow or the rain could cause some flooding down in Marshall. Or perhaps some snowy, cold weather that affects everyone. And fog which affects how far you see, so you can't see your enemies (zombies) coming as soon as you want.And the final reason would be a gas system. You know, for the vehicles. And I know in Lifeline there is a gas system for the generator, but that's only until you upgrade it into a solar powered generator. You, as the player, probably will use cars a lot throughout the game, so why not add in a gas system? Because how I see it, gas looks like the last resource you'll have left over that you'll have the most of.Now that's all I have to say about this game. And those reasons above don't really ruin the game for me and make me hate it, I just think it'll add to the experience and make it better. (Well, perhaps not the co-op for some because some people might have some troll-ish friends that'll like.... bring hordes to you, or leave you to battle with the mutated zombies, or even make sure you have to go a long distance just to get a car.)"

It's like someone made a single player version of Dayz with less bugginess, and added in a healthy dash of base building and management.   Others say it's like a zombie themed Grand Theft Auto.

Although, the original and the DLC Lifeline have a general storyline, the game is fairly open world. You can choose who you want to recruit and how you want to train them. You can design your own home base, or select from different locations around the map.The bugs at time can be a little frustrating, most irritating is how the AI will stand around and do nothing while you get pulled apart by zombies. Sometimes AI quests won't trigger, or when they do, the AI will run off into oblivion. This is where I get frustrated with the no-save aspect of this game. I don't mind losing a crew member if I honestly did something stupid, however, I hate losing a crew member due to the lack of AI intelligence."

The game puts you into a familiar zombie apocalypse. Only this time, you not only work with your team to kill zombies... but together to survive for the long haul. Killing zombies may be a necessity at times but it is no way a major goal of this game. If you can collect food, fuel, materials, medicine and/or ammo without combat, more power to you. Build your base. Place strategic outposts. Then Outlast.The game has a fresh experience to a very familiar genre. I actually felt anxiety at the prospect of losing a favored character. (damn ferals!) For when they die, the are G.O.N.E. to great beyond. It's the ""one more turn"" sort of action that makes 4 hrs go by in a blink.The only major drawbacks is that to some the action may be to similiar sometimes. However, different characters can be affected by your decisions and the challenges you choose. Secondly, there is a big lack of a in game guide/help screen. This is the real short coming of the developer as this would be simple enough to fix.Overall, worth it's full price in my mind.

It's not just about death and carnage, it's about living.As for Compatibility, port, graphics, and etc, it is honestly not the best. The game is aesthetically beautiful and the lighting is fantastic, but don't go in expecting Crysis or Metro because remember, this was originally exclusive to Xbox 360. It runs pretty smoothly, but has noticable framerate issue when driving occaisionally and seems to have processing issues when you are fighting inordinate amounts of zombies towards the end.After playing so many Zombie games in my lifetime, I can honestly say that State Of Decay is the most unique. What I mean by that is that it's not simply a zombie killing simulator. This game allows you to build a community however you want, and spend your time making the community a better place and gathering resources for survival, all while a zombie apocalypse threatens to take everything you have. It's cheap, will give you a good 20 hours of satisfying gameplay during the main story, and has magnificent replay value. You won't regret buying this game."

There was just a snippet of an announcement back in like 2010 or 2011.I was extremely glad the game to PC. Anways on to the review. I'll keep it short and sweet.The game is very, very fun. It offers something you really can't find in other Zombie games. The open world and the ability to do what you want, when you want, is fantastic. Graphics are alright, nothing spectacular but are still good. Story is pretty decent, as this iteration of the game is mainly story. The DLC Breakdown, will allow full sandbox, and it will get progressively harder. Gameplay mechanics are not bad. The game can be arcadey with driving which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it can be very entertaining to mow hordes of zombies down.Probably one of the most important aspects of the game is saving survivors and building a community. You'll have preset locations where you can set up your base. You'll be able to build building modules into for example: Kitchen, Watchtower, Storage, Infirmary, Bunks, Workshop. They modules will you give you bonuses for various things.You'll need to go out and collect supplies to get the community running, and the game keeps track of time, so if you come back the next day, there might have been some developments. However, if that's a turn off, there are ways to shunt it so you don't have to worry about losing everything you worked for.I've spent nearly a hundred hours in the game even though my review won't reflect it, but I can say there is a lot of replay value in the game!

Base building, character development, finding surviors and resource gathering. It's definately worth a play - but it's a one time play through. If this game comes out with some expansions and DLC then it would make a great game.In this game you start as a survior who came back to small town life to find the world in ruins and zombies everywhere. Your saved by the kindness of a small survival group that sets you on your way. The goal is to build a base camp, gather supplies to run your base and find other survivors then escape the militarized zone.PROSThe 3rd person shooter stand point makes it a fun action game while keeping in mind your need to keep finding materials to build. Keeps the game exciting. Backpack weightlimits and sizes are adequete as well. You'll have to pick and choose what you want to carry out and back and the game keeps this pretty accurate with stamina penalties for carrying more than you should.Character developments are ok as everyone you find has a different history, background and can benefit, or take away from, the work that needs to be done. For instance, you may find someone who was a chef and he can be your cook. Or you may find an alcoholic prick that is lazy and makes morale lower. It's easy enough to kill these people if you dont like them though. This small addition makes you feel a bit of a connection to the characters you find - and yes - anyone you find you can play as and take on missions.The game is wide enough to explore and can keep you on your toes as zombies chase you from one side of the map to the next. Nightfall makes things interesting and there is definately a spook factor. There are many different factions that you can help keep alive, or vice versa, but their role in the game is slim.Zombie base building is always exciting. There are many options to choose from depending on the size of your group and base size. Build your base depending on how you choose to play. Its always fun to come back from zombie killing to see the fruits of your labor flurishing behind a barbed wire fence. Definte plus.CONS:The game lacks story line and substance. The game itself is actually pretty short and the story doesn't leave you in awe. Plus, you find yourself running the same missions over and over again ultimately praying a person from the main quest line shows up so you can move on. The regurgitation of the same missions seems non-stop and frankly gets annoying.Along the lines of substance - you only fight one enemy! What happened to raiders or rival survivors groups! What about fighting the military? This makes it a bit less attractive and in my opinion much easier to win.You also do not get the ability to choose who stays at base camp to defend and work and who runs willy nilly through town. Its frustrating to come back from a mission to see half your people have run off into the city and are unavailble to you - then you have to go off to save them. You dont get to assign duties as the game automatically chooses. It'd be nice to have more control over assignments.Lots of glitches that need to be worked out. You'll run into invisible rocks, walk through closed doors or jump through windows that don't shatter. Zombies will get stuck in walls then suddenly appear. The driving is a tad glitchy and frames can skip causing unintended collisions. Overall its not too bad but little things like that can make the game much more enjoyable.Resources!! There are three main types - Food, Ammo and Fuel? Yes Fuel. I never once used it. That seems more like a commodity especially since the game doesn't give you any reason to have it. Water would seem more appropriate. That seems like an unforgivable oversight in a zombie survival game.OVERALL:Its definately worth one play through - maybe buy it when its on sale. If the creators worked 3 more months on the game it could have been turned into a great game. With some DLCS and patches this game could become great."

While that does not change the game itself, it does limit what you are able to do later in the game if you have not been working on all the available characters' skills. I consider this a bonus, as it prevents the game from getting boring.Vehicle stability is reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto.

I found starting from scratch to be more entertaining than late endgame-The other survivors' AI can be stupid quite often, getting themselves chewed on with easeMinor stuff I complain about and might not be so important for you:-Unrealistic/cartoonish looks for some of you out there (they're ok, but...)-Lack of easily visible explanations for advanced controls (ie combos)-Almost half of the mechanics aren't explained anywhere (ie outpost resources and their costs)-Zombies sometimes spawn right behind you following the sound mechanics, but the place was just clear...-Cars can make things all too easy sometimes, killing bunch of zombies in one go-Lack of hard-to-reach places, special points of interest, ""secrets"", etc-Unsatisfying main storyline ending, at least in my opinionIf you've read this far, why not give you some more text...This game feels like bunch of good ideas but with just a decent execution. It could have been much, much better with more work, yet I guess the original console constraints took that away. However, IT WORKS. It's a cool zombie experience, it has many classic stuff like hordes of zeds assaulting a position that you need to barricade and fight for, hit n' run rescue missions and the (not so classical) special zeds, that actually reminded me a lot of Dead Island.You get a really good game for the 20 bucks price tag, that is very fun to play and despite being easy at times, it can also be very punishing. Sometimes you're Rambo, sometimes you're Deadmeat. Watch yourself out there.There is another small Pro, and that is the Mod community. It's still small, but it will grow and that will only extend the game's life. If you're handy with that stuff, check the Nexus Mods.I'd say it's a solid 8/10. Absolutely recommended for zombie lovers out there."

The charector leveling is one of my favorite things. Improve ablities and unlock special skills, zombies never see pro wrestling coming until they get slammed. Guns guns guns, also melee weapons and explosives, nothing is more satisfying than throwing a pipe bomb in a group of 8-12 zombies and watching them fly.The base management is satisfying, choosing what facilities to have in the amount of space you can fit them. Resources keep your community going, get out there and start scavenging."
,Recommended,241540,11073116,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,ConorTay,"State of decay. Where to begin? It's such a fantastic game. You start off as a guy called ""Marcus Campbell"" who is with his friend ""Ed"" Then you basically run into some survivors, do some exploring and establish a base in the local town. This is a true zombie freeroamer (Maybe not as extravagent as DayZ) but it is indeed a unique experience. The thing I love about this game is that there is always something to be doing, you don't have to drive around meaninglessly waiting for a mission to pop-up etc, because they just continuosly appear. I admit, I find it quite irritating when i've done a lot of side quests and want to continue with the main questline, only to have the radio operator contact me about a ""Missing survivor"" or a ""Friendly community in trouble"" This is because of the fact that most side quests only appear for a limited time and to not complete them can have negative effects such as a loss of survivors, loss in morale etc. At the end of the day, you just have to ask yourself, do you really care about that one survivor in your group who always seems to get into trouble? After all, if they seem to be on the edge of death, there's nothing wrong with giving them a little push...However, aside from that, i've had no real problem with this game. I think that the difficulty is just what it should be, for example on my first day playing, I was in control of one of the female characters in my group (For your information, yes I was driving while playing as her and no, she wasn't crashing into everything... just some things) and was making a trip down to the local gun store (Typical American setting) to stock up on ammunition and weapons to then bring back to my community to store it. It could be said that I didn't go about it as delicately as I had hoped and thus, I was engaged in a battle with 10-15 zombies and I had no melee weapon. I just kicked at the zombies and it wasn't going to plan, eventually they tore me apart. It sounds bad, but I got an achievement for being killed by a zombie... so everybody wins. Except for poor what's-her-face.As for the map size. It could be seen as a little disappointing if you're used to the magnificent maps that feature in games such as the Elder scrolls and fallout series. However, it isn't tiny and it's good that it's quite an average map size. You have a good understanding of shortcuts to missions that require you to make haste. On the other hand, the map isn't so bad as I've played around 18 hours and I haven't truly explored all the houses etc, there are still many more supplies to obtain, many more survivors to join my community and many more missions to be completed.I am more of a perfectionist type, so I don't want to complete the game with many stones unturned. I would recommend getting the dlc ""Breakdown"" as it provides you with an unlimited free roam experience that increases in difficulty as you begin to master it. If I had to compare this game to any other zombie free roamer i'd probably say it was like a 3rd person dead island except it's much more polished in comparison. Another thing that makes this game stand out from the crowd is that you are not limited to playing as merely one or two characters. You can have a whole community of survivors in which you manage and work with in order to give them the experience to really smash some zombie heads in on their own. Basically, you will go about your free roaming and potential survivor rescue missions etc will start to show up on your map. You go to the location, fight off some zombies or whatever and then lead the survivor to safety. After that, the survivor may become a part of your community and you will likely have the option to play as him/her as long as they are listed as a ""Friend"" Some of the key story characters are unplayable. However, like I said, if you purchase ""Breakdown"" you have the option to play as some of these iconic characters such as ""Sgt Erik Tan"" of the military.Now onto the story, as I said earlier, you start off at this ranger station in a remote little camping area, do some missions and eventually move onto the wider area. Basically, you and your team of survivors are trying to stay alive as long as possible (It's no groundbreaking plot, but what zombie game ever has one?) Some of the military are present however, there seems to be some sort of difference in the opinions of the Sgt and the Captain. For example, the Sgt tries his best to help the locals when they're in danger. But the captain is your typical ""We can't afford to risk the resources and the manpower"" BS. You also have 2 gunrunning redneck brothers (They wear checkered shirts. The stereotype is strong in this one) who are quite hostile to other survivors, however you do work with them and in return, they sell you high military grade guns that will be enough to fend off the hordes of the dead. As with Dead Island, as you progress through the storyline, ""Special"" zombies begin to appear. You have your ferals (Extremely fast, but not tough) Your screamers (Oh look, we have no hands, we just scream at you)  Your Gas zombies (Fat, explode into a cloud of harmful gas) Your Big B*stards (You can try running these things over, but you're going to be left with an absolutely wrecked vehicle afterwards) Basically, the cliche of ""You gotta shoot them in the head"" is the best method of dealing with these monsters.My favourite part of the game is definitely, customizing your base of operations. Basically, there are many potential locations that you can choose to setup a base in. There are quite a few within the centre of the towns etc and a few remote locations such as a ranch and a theme park. Each home site has its drawbacks and limitations so it's good for you to get an idea of where you want to position yourselves. Do you want to be right in the middle of the town where all the action is (Your base doesn't get attacked constantly and if it does, your survivors should be pretty self sufficient so you can just go on exploring, looking for extra supplies and more survivors. The base aspect is quite strategic, in the sense that you have to choose which facilities you need and which ones won't be beneficial to your playthrough. For example, if like me, you find that you constantly keep finding food supplies everywhere (To the point where, you can't store anymore or else it'll go bad) there will be no need for you to make a farm. You could construct an infirmary instead for example, if you plan on getting into tricky situations where your survivors need expert medical attention. Other facilities include the library (I'm being serious, extremely important structure as you can carry out useful research to make your supplies more worthwhile etc) Bedrooms for the survivors (Your community can grow to like 15+ people, you need to ensure that all your people are well rested, otherwise they may lose morale and won't be as effective in the field) Cooking area, dining room, workshop (Another really important one, responsible for the repair of damaged cars etc) On the whole, the base aspect is a very useful tool that just adds a heightened sense of strategy to an already well thought out game.Outposts are also a key part of State Of Decay, for example, different home sites have a different number of ""Outposts"" that they are allowed. You basically can make any marked location an outpost (A place where you can resupply etc) Outposts serve as sort of a safe zone for the player character. Outposts are really useful as they give the player character a place to feel safe (For once)Overall, I love State Of Decay, I got it on the steam sale for £3.49. However, I would definitely have paid more if I knew what the game was like. It truly is a gaming masterpiece for zombie enthusiasts!"

It seemed like the ultimate zombie survivor game as anything that could be scavenged could be and was useful and the zombies were actually scary and threatening.That was until I bought State of Decay WITH Breakdown dlc.With the addition of the dlc, State of Decay becomes a truely open-world zombie survival game. If you ever wanted to have your own Walking Dead adventure, this is what you need.Where PZ dropped the ball was in the sense of isolation. Granted, that was a feeling they were going for and it works well, this same loniless would make the game at times boring to play. This was due in large part to the lack of npc's. State of Decay works with the group of survivors trope and charges you with scavenging food, medicine and weapons on a cosistent basis to keep them alive. Decay also incorporates the use of vehicles and 3d space, so when driving or simply walking through an abandoned and infensted town, you truely feel like you are living out this adventure. I know that PZ is still in beta and if it every does fulfill all of it's promises then it may truely rival or beat State of Decay.Until till, this is the game you want if you want to live the Walking Dead fantasy, but NOT if you want to simply slaughter zombies. This game requires more strategy than L4D or Dead Rising."

76561198015089986,Recommended,241540,8967885,"Posted: 3 February, 2014",all,IllCaesar,"One of very few games that capture ""survival"" within its gameplay, State of Decay is an ambitious take on building and maintaining a community in a world with danger around every corner. Starvation, sickness, and death due to failure to recover from injuries are all present. Additionally, among the survivors, they may run away from home, or go missing (sometimes permanently), all while the resource pool you have is drained every (real world) day. There are a lot of scary moments in the game that come about in a completely organic fashion. Stealth works as intended, and the enemy AI acts as it should when you're sneaking around. Action in the game is very competent and exciting. It seems like the ideal survival game.Of course, there is a ""but"" that follows. The game is buggy. Not just a little buggy, either - the game is very buggy. You can't go five whole minutes without seeing a zombie clip through a fence or get stuck on a piece of the landscape. However, most of the bugs have little effect on gameplay, and thankfully, stealth is in no way negatively effected by said bugs, and combat rarely is either. However, if you do come across a bug that nips you in the butt, there is no way to undo it, which leads me to my next point, which is saving. Saving your progress in this game sucks. It just does. There's four files you can use, but you can only save one playthrough to each, and the game autosaves, with no hard saving at all. As a result, you can be screwed over for the entire playthrough if you make a simple mistake, such as falling from a height, which leads me to my next point - controls. Controls aren't necessarily bad, but they're definitely in need of improvement, especially for when you're in melee combat. The controls do a servicable job otherwise though. Another problem is the quest system. You receive quests through somebody at home communicating with you over a radio. Its a good system, or at least, it would be if she wasn't contacting you every single minute about one quest or another. Its so bad that there are mods that do away with it that are actually called ""Nag be gone!"" and ""The 'Stop Harassing Me Lily!' Mod"", both of which work by the way. The game lacks any multiplayer, which is both a good thing (nobody destroying your community overnight) and a bad thing (game experience feels very lonely, and most players would benefit from cooperating), and there is not going to be any multiplayer added to the game. The game also persists while you're not playing, which can severely damage the experience of some people. There are mods that address this too, and even allow you to shut it off, so those with little time to play the game on a regular basis can still play (although the game requires such a large time investment that I would honestly recommend another type of game instead). There's no conflict against humans in the games - its entirely cooperation with fellow survivors, which will probably be disappointing for some, but I feel that the game is better for such an exclusion. State of Decay can also get quite dull and repetitive over time, which, again, can be solved, if only temporarily, with mods, which I suppose should bring me to my next point.For many of the faults of the game, there's mod support out there that addresses a lot of it, and some mods overhaul the game with drastic changes that alter the dynamic. Mod support won't keep the game alive forever, but the current ones out there can definitely extend the life of the game and rectify many major problems with the game.All in all, State of Decay is one of three survival games I've played that seem to actually capture the essence of what ""survival"" really means, and doesn't simply slap on ""survival"" because there are zombies in the game like some people actually do with games like Dead Rising and Left 4 Dead. If you have a survival itch that won't go away, or have any interest in the genre, I highly recommend getting State of Decay, and its DLC ""Breakdown"", on a Steam sale. Otherwise, honestly, you might be better off playing something else.tl;dr 6/10, buy this game if you're interested in or enjoy the survival genre, and check out mod support for the game as well."

,Recommended,241540,8851714,"Posted: 25 January, 2014",all,Tater_Salad,"State of decay is an amazing zombie survival game. It doesn't rely heavily on the ""jumpscare"" which I love. The game isn't soley built on fighting zombies. It's about surviving the long game. In order to succeed you need to scavange, set up outposts, upgrade your home base. You need to look for weapons for yourself, but also buidling, medical, food, and ammo supplies for your group to survive.You need to manage relationships with other groups of survivors by rescuing them, or ignoring the pleas for help so you can run another mission that you need for supplies.You need to manage your folks as well, playing as one character can hurt you in the long run, you need to play multiple folks and level them up as well. If your singlely played character dies you're in for a long tough road ahead.  The game does a great job reminding you of this as each player will fatigue when they've been outside the safe zone for too long, so you are reminded that you need to swap characters.The best part is for a zombie survival game you dont' need to kill zombies. There are no drops, no added bonus to offing them, other than keeping you and your home safe, so hiding in bushes, or staying quiet to save ammo and mele weapons isn't peanized one bit.I'm 10 hours in and only feel like I""ve started. but I can't stop playing, everything else in my library sits idle while I contine to fight for the living."

The game has some bugs and glitches here and there but from my experience ive had nothing game-breaking. If you are to get the game just to kill zombies and just explore I recomend getting the Breakdown DLC. I spent most of my time on that. The story is alright but nothing too great.A small list of some pros and cons.Pro- Some what classic zombie, they run but can only be killed by damaging the brain.Pro- Great mechanics such as building up a base with survivors and gear to survive the hordes, a rouge like system that has you play as multiable characters but if he/she dies you can no longer play as him/her, cars will never respawn after you destroy them.Pro. Different types of zombie found all over the map.Pro- A large map that has many places to settle in and explore.Pro- Many different types of weapons from melee to guns.Con- Zombies will glitch that causes them to not load in correctly so its just their head and arms.Con- (personal con) I dislike the survivor walking animation.Con- Survivor AI can glitch causes them to just stand still and die.Con- Sadly no co-op or multiplayer. I deeply wish they added that in.State of Decay is a pretty fun game, when your done with the base game you can always get the Breakdown DLC that makes the game harder and it ends when you die or the Lifeline DLC that ands a new map and a new story. :D"

Fun melee mechanics, the shooting mechanics feel alittle awkward, in any case, using firearms is limited due to ammo and the noise. Awkward indoor camera angles make it tricky to enter a building.Main story plot is short and easily played if you are not distracted with exploring the town in your first playthrough. Various playable characters that has some depth and different skillsets. Decent graphics with good lighting, especially with a day/night cycle in game.DLC tries to introduce a game world without story plot and challenges the player to survive as long as possible.

The game has strong emphasis on survival, guiding you to gather various types of materials (building, weapon, food, medication, etc).  However, you take the role of different characters (between which you can, and many times must, switch).  The game is semi-realistic, in that, people fatigue, weapons break, ammo and guns aren't everywhere, and morale is actually a mechanic (and yes, your NPCs can be eaten by zombies and be gone forever).An interesting and, in my opinion, awesome mechanic is its rogue-like feature that will save your game up until you die.  At which point, you must start over.  This only adds to the suspense of the game once you've built and expanded your survivor community.The game play itself is very well thought out.  The mechanics work upon each other to create a more realistic rendition of survival during a zombie outbreak.  There are a few mechanics that are wonky and can be exploited (about to die?  Exit the game to be teleported alive back to base).  But all in all, well balanced.  The only serious gripe with this game is the outdated graphics.  I've seen better graphics from games put out in the early 2000s.  If the developers would put a little time into developing HDR textures, the game would look as good as it plays.  I would definitely recommend this to any gamer who wants a zombie survival game."

,Recommended,241540,13954600,"Posted: 12 January, 2015",all,Husky & Sushi,"I played this game a lot more than I thought I would but I thought it would be more worth it. This game provides an illusion of depth and replayability. It had potential to be way more dynamic and varied but fell short in the aspects it wanted to show off most. It's still worth the amount it asks for and is fun for a short while. However it definitely isn't as replayable as it would like to boast as most of what you do will start to feel like the filler content it is.State of Decay is a game with a lot of depth to characters and an interesting take on surviving an apocalypse for the ""Long-Term"". In my eyes it is a game where the goals were about building a strong, large community to rebuild civilization. Most zombie games I have played focused on escaping a threat or surviving relatively short terms of time without safety. State of Decay answers some of the questions of what might happenafter that.The Basics of the GameThe tutorial gets you through a typical zombie panic scenario so it can focus on the main aspects of the game. The game really places focus on settling down in a base and holding your ground which is somewhat conflicting with the large map. You will quickly find strength in numbers by teaming up with a community of survivors. The character you play as cannot protect themselves alone and you'll need to take shifts with other characters so that they can heal or sleep. With the community caring for each other you are able to thrive in the apocalypse by maintaining a good base. A good base is maintained and upgraded with obvious essentials like food, fuel, ammo, medicine, and building materials. You can get these essentials by scavenging or trading. By making a strong and safe community you'll gain attention from competing communities and even the military. The military has more power and resources than anyone so gaining their attention and trust allows you to escape and ends the game's story.Conflicts and Negative PointsI felt like this game had an unclear focus for player objectives. State of Decay places a lot of focus on both exploring a huge map and settling down in a single, small base. I will say that the map for this game is absolutely huge and I was initially very impressed with how much content it had. However, exploration is encouraged but it doesn't really provide any unique incentive to do so.No incentive to explore the huge mapYou could complete the entire game by staying in one base. The benefits from moving to a different base are not very noticeable and the places you can set a base at are very limited (I think 6 or so places). Getting the largest base possible is important to have more people and facilities but the benefits for having a large base is too small. Having a different base might let you have 13 people instead of 10 but having more than 8 people is probably more than enough to easily survive. Some bases allow more facilities but it doesn't really matter as long as you have a few basic ones. Packing up your base and moving is pretty much only dependant on finding a base that can hold as much people as possible and what scenery you like to look at.There are no areas that offer unique resources. Living in one area is pretty much just as resourceful as living anywhere else. There is no reason to go somewhere far to get something valuable making less of a reason to explore the huge map.Materials for scavenging are seemingly infinite. I thrived way too easily, I had too much food and medication than I could ever need just by staying around my base. You might scavenge the area around you dry but I never reached that point. Additionally resources are randomly generated so that might be impossible.Story and Missions are lackingAt the same time the game places focus on being story driven and infinite playability. Perhaps the only part of the game that actually encourages you to explore unvisited locations is the story. However the story is extremely short and will only show you a tiny percentage of the entire map. The story will easily skip large chunks of the map which shows how useless it was to actually make the map as large as it is. The impact of the story with the rest of the game world is minimal because it struggles with trying to be infinite with filler content.The events of the story don't matter to the world. The game uses cutscenes sometimes but doesn't give them any cinematic impact. The supposed ending of the game felt as important as tying my shoe. The lack of music made story events all the less unique from the rest of the game. It was very clear that none of the story mattered after the intro which is insanely deceiving when the first moments of the game are very heavy on letting the story drive the player. After that first tutorial ""chapter"" it quickly feels like nothing matters.The infinite playability is advertised because of the endless respawning of 10 kinds of very simple missions. It actually felt like the game placed less emphasis on the story as an excuse to say the story doesn't matter and you are meant to endlessly play the game. State of Decay says it's dynamic by randomly generating things like events, missions, resources, and characters which would be interesting if the randomizations had more variables. The random things in this game are basic templates. You will quickly find a character who has the same voice actor as someone standing right next to you. Most characters will literally say the exact same script as someone else. Every random mission plays out the same way. A rescue mission is always a ""rescue"" mission and nothing unique ever changes with a mission besides the location and people involved. These missions don't even really get harder as you progress through the game. In the end, the ""Dynamic"" events become annoying, unoriginal filler content way too fast.I mean you can pay extra to get the DLC which adds a gradual increase in difficulty and more variety but these seem like things that should have been in the game anyways. DLC shouldn't charge to fix a game's flaws or even worse, intentionally reduce a game's core aspects for a quick buck."

I don't think its worth me providing you with a ""good"" & ""bad"" list because a lot of that will down to personal taste. The game to me is delicious and is best played via the Breakdown DLC. The storyline is ok, but it's merely a filler. The game is all about survival and you don't need a plot for that. The Graphics are decent enough and while I'm sure someone with attention to detail may be able to point out some issues with them, they do the job well and you feel immersed.Unlike a lot of Zombie games I've played, this isn't all about melee. There are tons of weapons too but like everything in this game you have to find them, and the ammo too. By far one of my favourite things about this game is that more or less every building can be entered and the loot from each is completely random every play through. Sure there are hotspots fo some of the loot in the game, but it doesnt detract from the fact that you have to hunt them down, carry them home and do it with zombies crawling all over you.I've had the chance to play with mods too and found one which gave me the ability to disable the ""special"" zombies. While these present a decent challenge and are great additions, they can at times be a bit overkill with 2 out of the 4 able to kill even your highest level character in just a few hits.I could go on and on about this game... I'm still playing it and expect I'll be close to 1000 hours before I tire of it, if not beyond. There is a new DLC on the way too with a new map (sweet) so this will just refresh the game for me. The forums are also alive with both friendly players and staff so you are never far from help.If like me you want a survival challenge, want it with Zombies and on a reasonably large map (we always want bigger and better Undead Labs :P) then don't look anywhere else. I've searched long and hard for a game of this type, and this ticks most of the boxes for me. I'd be really surprised if you were disappointed.Hope this review was useful and if you buy the game... enjoy!"

Get this game!This game is a survival game kind of like DayZ but it is single player.  Because of this, it seems to be more polished.  It's a finished game so the graphics look a lot better than early access.  You don't have food and stamina bars, instead you have to find enough food, meds, water, and other stuff for your settlement of survivors.  It's really cool to play this game because you aren't just thinking about your survival, you are thinking of all of the people in your group.  You can also get supplies and build up your base.  Even in a single player game, you feel like you are part of a group because you are always getting supplies for other people.Since this is single player, you get all of the loot!  It's awesome that you don't have to play for 2 hours just to find a can of beans like in other survival games.  The game has perma death, so each time you die with a character he never comes back.  You don't have to start over, you just have to play as another person in your group.  Even though this game doesn't have a great story, what's there is okay, and I felt a lot of tension becasue I didn't want these characters to die.  It also means that if you play this game you will have a different outcome on every playthrough.  It won't really change the story much, but you can level up each survivor differently to add variety to your gameplay.There are some technical issues here.  I have a pretty powerful laptop that is about equal to the recommended system requirements, but I still had to mod the game to get a respectable framrate.  You will have to mess around with the game to get it to run.  Luckily, the nexus now supports mod for this (and apparantly for any) game.  You can get a mod that disables shadows that will double your framerate easily.  The game is poorly optimised, and keep that in mind if your machine is closer to the minimum requirements.I have to recommend this game.  I really like survival games, but was getting tired of all the mmo titles because people are jerks.  If you want to change up your survival experience, this is the perfect game for that."

There are some unpolished elements, some AI and glitch and design issues that could use some work. But with that disclaimer out of the way, it is essentially a hugely ambitious game that actuall pulls off so much of its goals that it makes up for its own flaws.Sewing together so many gameplay elements isn't easy - there's combat, character development, base building, resource collection, resource management, territory control, missions, more missions, side missions, auto-generated missions, plot missions, and all sorts of things you can do that will eventually become a mission if you just happen to keep busy long enough that they become important.So what, some of these many elements kind of get lost in the shuffle. I realized that if I just did my own thing, I never had to worry about resources. In fact, the biggest complaint over the radio was that I was always out of stockpile space. So, I ignored resources. And that's kind of the biggest problem with the game as well as its greatest success - it packs so much gameplay in, you simply don't have the time or the consciousness to DO everything. So I finished it in 24 hours, and it felt way to soon... after struggling for that many hours to reach the end, you relized that thtere as still so much left to do. So many things left to build, so many homes to try out, so many infestations left to clear... and I was left, in the end, wanting more.Is it a perfect game? No. But its flaws are compensated, the acting is solid, the gameplay is balanced, and it all works together to keep you having fun. I'll be looking at the DLC very soon, because I WANT MORE State of Decay."

76561198006600775,Recommended,241540,14787800,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,Mythos,"This game is fairly straight forward, you switch between a number of survivors in the zombie apocalypse where you must seek out resources and fight off zombies to preserve and expand your base. Your resources dwindle day by day and you must be strategic in prioritizing which resources you pursue. This game excels because of its simplicity but that simplicity unfortunately leads to the game becoming repetative later on with no clear goals and no further progression. The underlying mechanics of the game remind me of mobile games but with much stronger graphics and interface. The game feels repetitive once you have an established base and full group of survivors, which can happen pretty quickly if you want it to. At this point you're really just playing to keep the game going because while there is a story mode there is no clear objective besides just surviving. The game would really benefit from a more comprehensive base building element or something that maybe gives you a sense of rebuilding society or fighting back a gainst the zombies in a meaningful way, but then I guess it deviate from the norms of the zombie-sirvival genre. Zombies just keep spawning and after a point you'll feel like you've killed more zombies than the population of the little country towns of the setting.Combat leans more in favor of melee as noises will draw the hordes. I like the combat mechanics that give you the right level of contectual animation, when you swing at a hoard of zombies the way you swing takes into consideration how you're moving and how the zombies are moving around you.Driving takes a little getting used to but reminds me of how the driving feels in the GTA games. Vehicles are as much a resources as ammunition, food, medical, and building supplies with a finite number of them that dwindle as you wreck them. People are also as much a resource that you must weigh whether to allow them into your group and if and when you prioritize aid over your own resource gathering.I bought the game for $7 and its worth a bit more than that, but not too much."

This really hurts when you have spent a lot of time leveling a survivor only to lose it due to stupidity or poor decisions. This can and will happen - usually unexpectedly. This is what makes the game so compelling.This is a port and it runs fine for me on a standard rig.

It's that game that makes you a part of the world you wanted to play in after watching a good zombie flick.State of Decay is... just that zombie survival game I have been looking for. I was surprised that more people are not talking about it. Where some games get a little too caught up in humans fighting each other over resources in a post zombie-apocalypse world (like DayZ) or zombie slaughter simulation (like Dead Island and Dead Rising), State of Decay perfectly scratches that 'build a community of survivors and scavenge for resources' itch.You get to choose a location for your group to set up in, manage your resources by scavenging, building base upgrades, and helping people out in the world. Even though the game has a story - and that story is interesting to play - I found myself just exploring, scavenging, and killing some zombies.This is exactly the kind of zombie games I want to see in the future. Let's face it, the zombie genre is hot right now, and I am tired of the endless DayZ clones where you are in a zombie-themed minecraft world with the greatest danger being the other players. State of Decay gives you an open world that is exciting to explore. There are many buildings, and they are full of resources, and sometimes also full of zombies. The zombies themselves are trivial on their own, but in groups are quite deadly, and you have to take them into account when trying to figure out whether a place is worth raiding, or a route worth traveling down.Overall, I love this game, and I hope we can see a bigger, multiplayer version of it in the future."

I tried so hard to love this game and there are quite a few things that it does right but the few things it does wrong kills it. The RPG like leveling system is awful with the player given the ability to gain things like special attacks and other ""skills"" which turns a survival horror game into a hack and slash. The way zombies act is perfect and the head shot only kill is great to see, as it is something hardly ever implemented into a zombie game, but zombies are laughably easy to kill and their only real issue is being irritating and slightly delaying you to your next objective. I have never once in my near 100 hours of play come close to dying from a common zombie. Which brings me to another gripe, there are special infected in this, practically all of them pulled from Left 4 Dead. You have the Juggernaut/Tank, the Feral/Hunter, the Bloater/Boomer and the screamer. These types of zombies worked well in Left 4 Dead's fast-paced setting, added tension to a game that averages 1 hour a game. But in a game that literally spans over months, it is unbelievably stupid. Where in L4D you had to go through them in order to progress in this game you can usually see them and think ""oh no, my way is blocked, let me wait for 4 minutes until it leaves. It is just a cheap way to add danger into a game that is lacking any real danger from zombies/survivors. The survivor could have made the game. If the ""enclaves"" (survivor groups other then you that randomly generate in different structures) were dynamic in behavior it would have been great. Such as sometimes they want you to trade or they try and shoot you to take your stuff or tell you to get lost it would have added so much tension and strategic interest in this game. Hell, if they did anything it would be great but you will rarely if ever seem them outside their base. all they do is ask you to do two or three things, which isn't annoying but when there are 5 or 6 communities that are giving you time sensitive missions and start ♥♥♥♥♥ when you don’t get all of them done it is terribly frustrating. This is the apocalypse. I should be trying to survive, not some adult babysitter/slave who gets attacked by mentally handicapped people who are easily dispatched."

""The Game"" I had been searching for but could never find. ""The Game"" that doesn't force you to restart missions if they fail, where failed missions effect the storyline. ""The Game"" that requires you to battle waves of zombies for resources needed for your own survival. ""The Game"" where you aren't just one linear character, but where instead at any instant your favorite character can die and death is permanent. In State of Decay, it is necessary to scavenge for resources and every single character has their own needs. Every character in State of Decay has their own unique personality and (not including the main story's characters and Lily) have randomly generated names. Every step you take could be your last, one mistake and you become zombie-chow, never to be seen again. But don't worry, that isn't the end of your game! You can earn the friendship of other survivors and recruit them to join your community, and they will become playable if you earn enough trust with them. Nobody is safe and at any minute, any second, the zombies could breach your defenses and you can be left with nothing. Unless you're well prepared. It's fairly easy to prevent total devestation of your community. All you have to do is stay well supplied, and keep your community healthy. Sometimes you'll have to make life-or-death choices. If your favorite character gets infected, will you kill them to protect the community, or will you take the chance of them turning and let them live?

If you want this review summed up in one sentence: The developers of State of Decay have made a wonderful basket of a game, but have then proceeded to fill it with too many eggs, some of which are of questionable quality.The game feels good, the controls certainly aren't sloppy - just wondering around the world feels quite enjoyable, the graphics aren't bad (they aren't brilliant either, but it falls far above acceptable), gunplay (from what I've done with it) has been well implimented, the stealth aspect is fairly nice too, but then we dig slightly further into this apple of a game and find the rotted meat of the game.The stealth of the game requires you to have near constant attention on everything around you to avoid alerting zombies - which on paper, seems fine, except you get no help with this. Some might claim this is to help with 'immersion', but I feel that this is the exact opposite. In the real world you have all five senses to notice danger, in this game you're limited to two (and even then, sound isn't all too helpful unless you have five speakers), but this is forgivable. I've not actually run into any problems as of yet that weren't brought about by my own hubris, but it does lead me neatly on to the camera. Third person perspective; good for glancing around corners before you've reached it, not good for getting caught in bushes when hiding from zombies, where the bush then obscures your vision. Given that a bit of the game is done indoors, first person perspective may have been much appreciated, but it wasn't. Again, not a big thing, it's usable as it is, but I'd have to give the stealth a 6/10.You're able to climb specific objects/buildings and take stock of your surroundings, examining a couple of shops from a vantage point and they're added to your map, spot a hoard of zombies and they get added too. A nice touch to the game - not required, but nice.You decide to go and loot a house and creep to it. After a sweep of the house to make sure there are no zombies - killing them if there are - you're given the option to set up an outpost. Don't know what an outpost is? As far as I can see, the game doesn't give much information on the subject either. You decide to loot the building, and make your way back home with some small loot. Your character is tired. How do you get them to sleep? Change to another character if you're friends with them. You want to give your items to them? Put them in the communal safe box (which gives you community points), change the character to a new one, and retrieve the items from the communal safe box (costing the same community points to remove - so you don't just go in and steal everything). When I heard that this game had the ability to swap between characters, I assumed it would mean inventory management and swapping whenever you wish on missions, but no. What this game allows for is a required change of characters to one of a different skillset, along with a needless method of inventory switching.Once you've switched your character, you decide to go out on another looting spree, however this time a side-mission pops up to go and rescue someone. If you don't do it, they die, and moralle drops. I can see why this was included - it fits the theme very well, but a fun game thematics alone does not make.I've seen a lot of people mention that this game is fairly 'realistic' and not like the Left 4 Dead style zombie-killing-spree, and for the most part, they're right to an extent. Like with all games it seems, the characters are so unfit they can't run any longer than thirty seconds (even the military woman), and weapons dont stick around forever. I can't say I've had enough epxerience with the game to see better tiered weapons, but the weapons I've had have been destroyed quicker than I would have liked. But now we get to the crux of this paragraph.While your characters are bound by the curse of real-life (or as much as the game can simulate it), the zombies are not. This isn't going to be a 'zombies-aren't-real-hurr-durr', but there are the occasional nine/ten foot zombies that can rip you in half.  When a game is trying to be realistic (or focus on the planning / building elements) and includes boss like zombies? This is what I meant about the too-many-eggs in one basket. Which then also leads onto the game continuing after you've stopped playing;I would LOVE this game if I could play it for a couple of hours, do a mission or two, upgrade my base, and then go, but no. The game insists on altering itself when you return - this could be just a drop in resources that the characters needed to stay alive, or a completed building - and again, this might be absolutly loved by some, but for me, it's just not something that I enjoy in this kind of game.Ok, I'm getting a bit bored of writing this now, I'm going to stop with a summary.For me, the game feels as if it's not finished yet. It may very well not be.Would I recommend the game at full price? No. Would I recommend this game at half-price or less? Yes, easily."

It's single player, which may be why it works so well, but there's undoubtedly some missed opportunity there. Maybe in a sequel. Regardless, if you're interested in a smallish open world zombie survival game where you round up survivors, gather supplies and construct bases, etc. - this is worth picking up. A definite buy if it's on sale."

,Recommended,241540,8655707,"Posted: 10 January, 2014",all,theromulans,"In many ways this is the beginnings of the zombie game I have been waiting for. A zombie survival game with an ""end game"" - survivor communities.As it stands I enjoyed what State of Decay offers, but perhaps I have enjoyed it more as a proof of concept than anything else. The world of State of Decay is well realised, and the scale is spot on - the map is full of various points of interest without being too cluttered. The story elements are decent enough as you are guided through the game world - although you do have to fill in a lot of the blanks yourself.There is a lot missing, most notably human enemies / survivor wars - one group in particular I swear was leading up to this... nope. Why am I watching a zombie climb over a barbed wire fence? Hmm. There are some oddities found throughout the game like this.Beyond the survivor communities mechanic, vehicles add a joyous experience to the ""zombie murdering"" genre (if I can call it that). State of Decay's animations are mostly great (if jerky at times) and the graphics, while dated, are charming. The way zombies move and you combat them is much better realised here than in other zombie survival games. Melee combat is nicely played too.All in all I recommend this game, if only to support Undead Labs' future work. If State of Decay is any indication, we're in good hands.UPDATE: Lifeline DLC was quite fun - great to get a new map to explore, and a few new characters. Definitely worth a few dollars if you'd like to journey back into the world of State of Decay. Some welcome enhancements, too: vehicle storage and automatic unloading of supplies are awesome."

It lacks the basic functions such as a hunger and a food bar. However it makes up in the fact that it requires you to gather neccasary resources, and has fatigue and sickness ( as well as a few others). Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on saleSo if you have $ free:$20+: Grab this, you will enjoy it$10-20: Nothing to run out for, only grab this if you have already played the major surivivals such asdayz, dont starve etc.$0- 5 If you are getting more game money soon then grab it, but dont go out of your way for just thisIF YOU ENJOY BOTH SURVIVAL AND AND ZOMBIE GAMES:Chuck what you were playing out the window and grab this!IF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SHOOTERSThis is not a shooting game! Dont think that for one second. It has guns however you wont be using them much and they have a very slow progression. If you want to try out the other 2 listed genres then grab this but not if your looking for a shooting game!IF YOU PLAY NONE OF THESE GENRES:This is a good taste test for a zombie and survival game. It includes solid but not everwhelming gameplay, and should give you a good idea of wheather or not you like the genre.

The strategy elements are really well incorporated, and set this game apart from the other mass of point-shoot / find-blugeon / hit-run zombie games. I feel like while this game isn't perfect, it's pretty realistic as far as how I'd envision response to a real-world infection like this. In the end, it' s fun and definitely worth the $20. I think I'll drop the extra $7 for Breakdown when I come back to this again.I'd sorta like to see an *eventual* sequel to State of Decay, somewhere down the road.Well, if you've got $20 and you're looking for a good third-person, open-world, strategic action game, this is a pretty hard-to-beat value.

Where Lily may be in charge of dispatch, it is MY role to insure execution.As overseer, I became tasked one day to fulfill a request for assistance by a neighboring scavenger up in the northern section of the valley. I was a bit suspicious that they may be based in the campgrounds just beyond the warehouse meeting place, a ""Forbidden Zone""  to my tastes as I hate sending my people on foot in potentially hostile territory. But recent public relations being tenuous at best, I decided to send one of my new recruits.Omar was his name, a reasonably strapping young lad though limited in skill and outfitted with the most humble of gear. I had him swipe a nearby hatchback rather than dedicate one of our new pickups to this likely hazardous mission and he was off. Omar performed admirably as protector, sustaining but one bite, quickly recovering using one of his four aspirin, but as feared, his delivery destination was indeed the dreaded campground. He didn't even attempt to jump the fallen access bridge, opting instead for the treacherous ledges to the river below.Within seconds of his cresting the rise on the other side, the two were beset upon by a pair of the ravenous undead, swiftly followed by three more, alerted by the commotion. It was here that Omar received the first of his grievous wounds, breaking free just in time to rescue his charge and dispatch the vile company. He was now down to two of his relatively ineffective painkillers and reduced in vitality by a substantial 25%!They continued on, encountering a seemingly endless supply of decaying former nature enthusiasts. Understandably frustrated, Omar opted to make a slight deviation to the supply building in hopes of acquiring a vehicle to plow down the remainder while ""in park"" but alas, there was no truck spawn in this level.Undaunted, they made their way to the picnic gazebo, the final approach to the lakeside cabins below. It was completely dark by this point, making it difficult to spot the retched wandering gypsies so it came as no surprise that the pair was again swarmed by a possible passing horde! Down he went, and up he rose...surviving on mere adrenaline alone. With a mad dash, the true survivors made their way down the hill and through the courtyard, pursued by at least three. A couple of cracks in the skull took down the closest, who managed to reach them at the top of the steps, but exhausted Omar had to leave the rest to the now threatened defenders of the little log cabin. They were more than willing it seems, to offer a helping hand when a breach was imminent but their blaise' attitude toward Omar's obvious distress was disconcerting to say the least.Once THEIR danger had passed, they resumed a posture of eating fruit or lamenting their own sad state of affairs while leaning against one of the walls of the tiny shelter. Having downed the last of his remaining aspirin, Omar turned to the trio's supply locker for any sign of sustenance. "" A pack of firecrackers, a bag of chips and a talking dolly...SERIOUSLY!?!?!"" he shouted.Omar knew that death could await him in scant yards from the cabin steps as the muffled sound of zombie agro pierced his painwracked ears from just beyond the weathered door. Exhausted, sick and severely injured, our valiant comrade opened said door to meet his fate, come what may.Right at the open doorway, one greeted him with a snarl as Omar laboriously swung then kneed the fallen Z in the face but too late...another had climbed up from behind and latched his death grip on the back of our hero's neck. In an instant, he was belly up, resigned to his fate. By some act of incredible providence, the rescued scavenger was apparently close enough to Omar's writhing body when he fell that he chose to act and soundly defeat the remaining attacker!Disoriented but alive, Omar set out to tempt the fates and continue his quest for survival in the cool, crisp night air. Staying close to the rocks, he darted from hedge to bush, patiently waiting for his carnivorous quarry to pass. Through some miracle bestowed upon him by the digital deities, Omar had actually managed to navigate his way to the very banks of the river, not far from the derelict wreck, rusting in it's flow.As expected, three ambling corpses meandered their way past while Omar caught his breath in a bush, readying himself for the final dash. Once he crested that final ledge, he'd be home free since the hatchback was scant yards beyond. As we waited for what seemed like an eternity, I reflected on how far he'd come.Omar had sustained numerous injuries, yet continued the good fight. As a matter of fact, his fighting skill had increased three levels since this journey began, a noble accomplishment. I'd found myself rooting for him at each encounter, cheering him on with each setback. I must admit that I'd begun praising his every triumph, promising him the best of gear, the finest big boy backpack not to mention a personal good word to be conveyed to the curvaceous Amelia C, obviously the object of his eye since she first saved him outside that remote barn to the south. All these things awaited him and more if only he could make it to the yellow Honda above.The three had finally managed to move up river but were they far enough past for him to safely dart across? Omar knew he had little time to waste as hordes frequently descended the river valley to slog it's course, the time was now and he MUST do it...for the love of Amelia not to mention a sweet leather storage bag!Being down to a quarter vitality and a matching stamina, he had to employ a calculated sprint then jog technique to avoid staggering at an inopportune moment. Three quarters of the way to his goal, he heard it, the sickening sound of alert, he had been made! They pursued but he had reached the first step, they sloshed through the running water but he rose up on the second, as long as he kept this pace, they would never catch him in time. The two dead men bellowed below but they had yet to ascend from the icy waters as Omar pulled himself up on the third step. With one more hoist, the taste of victory would be on his lips... but it was not to be.As Omar turned to rise, another screeching cackle greeted him from above, two other undead trolls were waiting anxiously for the their next meal and they were certain that the robust Omar would NOT disappoint. One fell to the ledge    and Omar swiftly swung, catching it offguard as it reeled to recover but it's partner was swift and uninjured, falling behind then seizing our striken friend by the shoulders. By this time, the other two had arrived to join in the fray just as Omar lay back in resignation to view the starry sky one last time before he passed into the night.I was accustomed to responding to the death of my associates with a considerably less rational approach, preferring to go on a geek rampage, clearing the streets with a fiery automotive display. However with Omar, I felt only sadness...at least at first.As the sun rose high, I decided to assign one of my veterans to pick up a group of ""Friendly Survivors"" eager to join our enclave. Normally I would put them through a baptism of fire, using the group as minions to clear infestations or guard as my soldier looted high risk locations. Today would would be different...today would be a day of purging!Apparently, the cover of darkness had hidden a literal hive of zombiehood, no less than seven festering infestations plagued the region as well as scores of loner Zs. It was ""KILLIN' TIME"" in the northland and only the livin' would bear witness.God...I LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!:) Nebo"

You play as a community that needs food, medicine, guns, doctors, builders, fighters and more to survive in a place of your choice (which you can change at anytime, why not move into that old warehouse? it has nice strategic position. move up!). It can become slightly monotonic, but not quite like the 1st AC, because there are always some new quests, world events or things to strive for. Highly recommended."

Endure the night time, where hope is drained almost as fast as the bullets leave your rifle. Run from hordes, or if you are brave enough, and stupid enough, then take them on. Encounter dangerous special infected, ones so dangerous they can literally rip you in two. Set up outposts and make your area zed-free. Your fellow survivors will go on dangerous scavenging runs for you, fight for you, and die for you. Learn their stories, get to know them, and fight with them. You are a survivor. You are a KILLER.

There is a spooky 'walking dead-season 1' feel about it. The game has some great mechanics. Perma-death is really cool and gives the player a sense of urgency when they, or other survivors are being attacked. You think different. You sneak up and crouch because spraying and praying will get you killed. There has never been a zombie game this good before.  Much like in The Last of Us, when you are in menu, perhaps searching through supplies,looking at your map,what have you..you are always vunerable. You can never turn your back too long. I have never felt the adrenaline I get ,like when I play this game.It was the middle of the night and my group and I needed food...or we would starve.Literally. So Being the hero I thought I was, I went to this diner. I found the food and I was in a bit of a hurry and made too much noise and attracted a few biters and while I was gathering the supplies they ambushed me in the small room. I thought there was no way out, but I hacked and slashed my way out with a machete. But it broke. All I had left was a shotgun. I blasted a few rounds cleared a path and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to the house we were holed up in for the night. I attracted a small horde by firing the gun. And it goes on from there...This is the perfect combo of strategy and action. It delivers well and makes you feel like there are actual consenquences for your actions. You have to think a plan out..or sometimes just be able to run fast or jump in a car and drive off. Don't stay away from the game too long or you and your group might die off from starvation because of a real time element that takes place behind the scenes when you are not playing.My biggest complaints so far is the walking inside of buildings is a bit clunky and there is NO ONLINE CO-OP OPTION. I can not stress how awesome this would be, even as a whole new game.Go buy it now!(side note for Undead labs...We(pc gamers) have money and are VERY willing to spend it on your product.

State of Decay is one of those rare gems that started out on the Xbox Arcade and was developed under that whole 2GB limit. I honestly would love to have seen what Undead Labs would have been able to do with this if they were not working under such restraints.The base game itself can play out in a number of ways. You have several bases to choose from, various weapons, vehicles that have their own set of stats (fast and flimsy or slow and durable). The main game has a storyline that can take a while to complete, an advancement system that lets you choose a set of skills to specialize for each person as you level them up (easy to miss if you're new, second tab in the character screen), and a colorful set of characters.The Breakdown DLC is the survival mode you want to play. This does have some drawbacks though; luckily it's not that expensive. Breakdown removes the story mode and puts you in the Trumbull map. After a while you'll find an RV, repair it, and move on to the next map. The next map is the same map but with harder zombies, more spawns, and a higher chance of being torn to pieces.Where my grievances come in with this DLC is the character parts were done a bit lazy. Most don't have their regular voices from the original game. Pastor Will has Ed's voice in mine and was once telling me how he got laid behind a park bench or something. So while minor, it's noticeable.(Edit: Adding in some new info now that I've had a chance to play Lifeline and the updates to fix things are likely finished) There are still some lingering glitches even after several updates, one of the most notable being that some zombies can at times run through the house and get stuck in the floor, Big'un zombies can sometimes glitch through doors and lead to mission failures or the death of a playable character if you're really unlucky.The Lifeline DLC is it's own map and introduces several new characters, weapons, and vehicles. While it's a fun little game with its own unique story to the SoD world, it offers less freedom than the original. In Lifeline you will have access to many new techs to help fight off the zombie hoards while you evacuate survivors. But as time goes on, you'll lose some of these advantages. Luckily you can get them back later, but the tradeoff is you'll have to sacrifice your outposts to certain areas to maintain them. You also work on a bit of a timer throughout the game. Hoards will periodically atack your base and you'll need to be back there to help fight them off or bad things will happen.All in all, Lifeline is a pretty decent story on its own, but I think the original game still stands as the better of the two.Overall, I can't recommend this one enough for fans of zombie survival and building games. With any luck Undead Labs will have a chance to expand on this one in the future and make something truly unique."

Although my experience with the game has been solely with a controller, the performance aspect of the game is phenomenal. SoD looks good and has not crashed a single time in my ~40 hours of play. The level of repetition in side quests is high and the plot line is lackluster, but its open world nature leaves the player with plenty of options in the way of entertainment. If scavenging and the management of a semi-autonomous community in a zombie infested world is something you want, please give this game a try."

Many gamers were complaining about the lack of such games and State of Decay came for our rescue. This game is very well designed and quite fun. However, the came could be an unforgettable game if their flaws were to be less.Good Sides:+Open world and zombies. Together.+Being able to use different characters and their physical states and traits affect your gaming experience with them.+Our characters are not godlike beings. Can die easily -especially in Breakdown-.+Limited space that we have on us and even on cars bring a good challenge to the game.+Fairly good optimization for older gaming systems.+Atmosphere that it creates on the player is magnificent.+The music is quite fine and tuneful. Thus they really boost the atmosphere that is created by the game.+The world keeps on living.+Door slams.Bad Sides-The side missions are a bit dull after a while and it doesn't mean whether you do it or not which I find it quite bad because some are rescue missions and usually the characters who are in trouble come back home safe and sound.-Interactions in your community or outside of your community are almost none.-Animations are very limited, especially on executing zombies. Since you're going use that button a lot, it could get a bit boring to see same animations over and over again.-Being bitten is easy which I don't like in this game. It could be harder with more drastic results. ""Get bitten, take an aspirin"", looks weird after a while. I must have been bitten hundreds of times in the game with only one character, yet I finished the game with the same character.-Different weapons could have different outcomes and reactions from the zombies.In the end, I must say, despite all its flaws I liked and played the game for long hours. And I had fun, I didn't regret my time that was spent on the game and don't count them as waste. So I recommend all the people that are thinking to buy and play this game. Have fun folks!"

You need to gather and store supplies in order to keep everything running correctly. Strength is in numbers, but the more people you recruit, the more supplies you have to dish out to everyone. If you don't meet your daily quota of supplies, then your camp can fall ill, or your defences can be weakened, etc. However, supplies are not in such a high demand that you'll find it a chore to go and find them, they balanced the feature very well.All in all, this is one of the most perfect zombie games that I've ever seen, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a survival game, and not just a mindless hack & slash."

In this game at any time you can be overpowered by a horde of zombies and taken down as you can run out of energy and get winded.. Ammo can sometimes be sparse as well as you are limited to carrying space.The downside is the game can start to get repetitive after awhile which is when I was hoping they had a multiplayer option which would make it a lot more fun."

It plays a bit like GTA, but in a zombie apocalypse based world.It totally nails the feeling of holding back a never ending tide of undead, and slow looming desperation. The gameplay is simple, yet fun. Managing your base and survivors is cool, and you end up becoming attached to your favorites. (I actually restarted once because my ""main"" character got overrun by zombies.) Building up your base, and upgrading facilities was rewarding while not being overly in depth to the point it was annoying.The combat is easy to pick up, the weapons have variety, and the enemies have a decent amount of difference between them. I like how sound attracted enemies while scavenging for survival tools, and made it seem threatening to be out there, especially when alone. Gunshots attract anything in range of the noise as well (until you get a supressor), which made gunplay a double edged sword.The cons are: Random bugs with Zombie placement/walking through walls. Lack of quest variety, and being unable to do multiple quests at the same time.Overall, I was very pleased. While the game does get bogged down a bit in the late game due to lack of mission variety, it's a very enjoyable experience overall. It's the most realized apocalyptic world I've played in a game. No rails, you can go anywhere, and it's fascinating to see the world they've created. I'd totally recommend this to any Zombie game fan, or anyone wanting a solid gaming experience.

While it doesn't come without some glitches they are all in all rather minor and wont affect the gameplay much.The game is basically about survival - surviving in a Zombie infested country side while trying to find more survivors out there and scavenging usuable goods such as ammunition, weapons, construction materials etc.Below a small list of things the game did good and did bad:Good:-Many eastereggs and references to other Zombie movies and games.-Probably the best and most convincing Zombies I've seen thus far in a pc game. They truly attack and eat you unlike in other games where they play heardless looking arm attack animations.-Day cycle (Day and Night)-Dynamic spawning of npcs & items (replay value)-Many npcs to encounter-A decent story that reminded me in some ways on ""The walking dead""-Plenty of weapons to choose from-Preset Base building, but several base sites to choose from.-Even your main character can die.-Playing on numerous characters.-Several Zombie npc classes to encounter (Some similar to the Left for dead series such as boomer, tank, hunter etc.)Bad:-No real weather conditions besides fog (no rain - no snow)-Awkward car physics certainly not the best but also not the worst.-On some points there are strange FPS spikes probably when something spawns-After 12 to 16 hours you probably have seen and heard everything then it gets slightly repetitive.-No real modding tools so no possibility to create new maps to play on. Very bad decision by the game devs.-Limited amount of cars. There are no trucks or motorcycles to drive.-Only 1 npc can accompany you at any given time, besides in story missions, very sad.-No own customizable base building where you can decide on your own how things look or where to place em.-Pure Singleplayer no coop or mp support but they gonna work on a new title that will have just that.-A large map but only few smaller villages to explore most consits of corn fields and hills. No skyscraper cities are to explore.All in all it's a very nice game although it has it's flaws. Still it's probably one of the better titles out there regarding survival. So if you want some off time of Day-Z or never even liked that game in the first place you can gladly try this game here. I didn't regret paying the few bucks for it as they were totally worth it.

The game starts with you returning from a fishing trip with your buddy Ed to find the main land over run with zombies. The game combines third person melee and ranged combat with a scavenging resource and community management system.The starting area is fairly easy with sparsely positioned zombies in a camp ground area. You quickly find the rangers station and begin exploring the area and looting for supplies.The combat system is fairly competent as is the driving system, however controls for this game currently are restricted to controller but the developer is working on full keyboard and mouse control so keep this in mind before buying this title.The graphics are decent enough but nothing spectacular, however this is not a AAA title so this is understandable. Music, ambient sound and voice acting are pretty good considering this is not a AAA title.What makes this game really shine is the community management system. You don't play one main character as you need to manage fatigue and people need to rest, so this has you swapping out for other community members as need be, but you will quickly find your favourites and tend to cycle between them.The inventory management system is decent but transfering items between characters is frustrating making you return to base and stash it before switching characters and retrieving the items.All in all this is a great game and definitely a refreshing approach to the zombie survival genre and for $20 or equivalent it is worth your time to pick this up.

,Recommended,241540,14518601,"Posted: 17 February, 2015",all,Damien Crow,"Great game overall. It also has the makings of something even greater. The base game can be fun and interesting, has replay value since most survivors and all loot is intelligently randomized, so one time you may find a good medic and a bunch of drunks along with an abundance of heavy firearms. Another you might find mechanics, cooks, and farmers, but nothing but .22 pistols and a random assortment of melee weapons. You might decide to live at different locations or utilize different strategies for survival. Kind of fun to see how different things pan out.Breakdown DLC takes the normal game but makes it far more challenging. Survive in the same map, then when you've exhausted your resources, move on to a newly repopulated version of the same map taking only supplies and a hand full of survivors, only every time you move on, things get harder. More zombies, more specials, less cars, less resources, less to find all together. Go for as long as you can, or as long as you want.Lifeline DLC was a bit lacking. Fairly short storyline. You can extend it out but you'd just be doing the same things for longer; surviving sieges on your base as you manage to rescue and evacuate civilians here and there. Map is interesting but small in terms of areas to explore.Can't wait for the Year One Survival Edition."

The DLC basicly ignores any kind of story (although it might b wise to play the story first to understand everything and get a bit training in the field of ""how to kick undead butts"") and is just about the basics of the genre: kill zombies, survive, loot.The trick why this is actually interesting is the fact, that the game gets harder by every stage with more zombies, new challanges that lead to new playable heroes , random elements (""how the ♥♥♥♥ am i supposed to start from HERE?!"") and !SPOILERALERT! some very nasty surprise like zombies not appearing on the minimap, no more cars, cars and weapons breaking like paper and resources as rare as kryptonite.To wrap it up:If u like challanging zombie-survival-rpg-games then go ahead and get this one BUT buy it WITH dlc!"

I like the unlockable starting characters, though its not gonna matter too much, you can only do so much with just Marcus/Guy You Start With before they get tired and/or ate.Lifeline is neat too, the new map is kinda meh (not bad but not anywhere near as interesting as the first) but the access to military hardware and artillery is useful, as is the new ability to put stuff in the trunks of cars."
,Recommended,241540,11692457,"Posted: 13 August, 2014",all,Vivisector,"State of Decay is so far my favorite Zombie Survival Game.  I will admit, the graphics suck.  And there are quite a few graphical glitches and annoyances in the game (Textures not quite lining up, Zombies glitching and having their bodies half on one side of a door/wall and half on the other, and Zombies spawning right in front of you).  Once you get past the graphical issues with the game, (and the annoying characters), the rest is great.The game starts with you walking to your campsite, after a fishing trip with your buddy.  Only to be attacked by Zombies.  After the initial shock to the characters, they make their way to the ranger station, do a bit of looking around, and the story takes them to a small village.  This is where the game actually begins.  The main part of the game revolves around building up your base, going around scavenging for food, fuel, weapons, ammo, building materials ect.  The game isn't quite open world, as there are only a number of buildings you can create your base in.  You get to choose if you would like to build a sleeping area, infirmary, library, kitchen, garden, workshop, ect.  Then you have to get the materials to build it.Waves upon waves of zombies will be coming to attack your base, as well as find you no matter where you are in the game.  There are alot of missions where you need to take out zombies in infestation sites, or the number of zombies in the area will increase dramatically.The storyline of the Vanilla game is livable.  Alot of the characters in it are totally annoying though.   In the game, you aren't a particular ""person"", you are the community.  Each person in your community is like an extra life in the game.   And each character needs to be leveled up, and needs to feel important.  In order to ensure you don't play/level up your favorite character, and leave the rest in the base, they brought the most annoying aspect I have ever come across in a game before.  The longer your players sit in the base, the more agitated they become.  They will start fighting amongst themselves, and start becoming whiny brats, and you will need to do endless ""hand holding"" missions to get them to improve their moods.  If you leave them unchecked, they will start to take your base out from the inside out.  Losing Community Morale with the fighting, smashing things in your base, firing ammo into the air to blow off steam, I have even had one of my characters kill another of my community.   (And all deaths in the game are perma-deaths for that character.)Nothing I dislike more when I am out risking my life to search through zombie filled buildings for food to keep my community alive, then hearing your radio go off that you need to come home quick and take someone out for a walk, to talk about their feelings.I won't try to give away too much of the storyline.  There are 2 DLC's for the game currently as well.  The first DLC is called Breakdown.  It happens in the same community as the original Vanilla game.  The difference is there is no real storyline, and your goal instead of making it through the storyline is to find a Motorhome, fix it up so you can take 6 of your favorite characters with you and leave the area.  The only problem.  When you try leaving your Motorhome dies, leaving you again stranded in a random part of the map, having to build another base, and start from scratch finding a new motorhome and getting it street ready.  Each time you do this, the game gets harder, there are more zombies (And more dangerous ones), and you have less supplies, weapons ect.The second DLC  is called Lifeline.  This DLC happens on a different map (A city map), and this time instead of playing as the civilians, you play as the military.  So you have more weapons at your disposal, but since you're no longer in a rural countryside or small village, the number of zombies is multiplied.Aside from the many downfalls I have mentioned, the game still is my favorite Zombie type game, and I recommend it to anyone."
,Recommended,241540,9306478,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Draetor,"This game is like putting Farcry 3 and The Sims together in a zombie infested world.  For those who haven't played either of those games, Farcry 3 had the notion of an open world with missions that string you along, but also with side missions that became repetitive later on.  The Sims was all about taking care of your people's needs and ultimately having them survive the real world.In State of Decay, you have an open world that you can explore at your leisure, but with missions that string you along a primary path and secondary missions to enhance gameplay, but also become repetitive.  The latter half is all about maintain your home base and securing survivors within your base, and then to maintain their basic needs and emotional outbursts while trying to survive zombie onslaughts.The game is very interesting and simulated.  You don't get big guns and gold from killing zombies, in fact, it's probably best to avoid zombies in most situations, because you gain nothing beyond some skill improvement, but also risk your character for permanent death!  That's right, if you die, it's permanent for that character (as far as I've witnessed thus far), but you can swap between any survivor character in your base once you friended them.  This is nice to break from boredom using just 1 character all the time, and everyone has their own strengths.  Also, other real life simulated aspects come into play, like noise attracting zombies, tension between characters, basic human needs, running out of breath when tired, etc.Great game for a zombie simulation; however, I feel like a lot of it will become repetitive after so many hours of play, just like most open world sandboxes (except Skyrim! lol)."

How did I let you die?Okay, the thing you should know about State of Decay is that once your player character dies, they're dead for good within the game. There are no reloading previous saves. You can't revive a player character. I didn't know that before doing a mission where numerous zombies and a tank looking one attack a house. My Marcus, he died.The reason this upset me was Marcus is the starting character. So that makes him important in various ways. He has a great skillset. Great leadership skills. Is able to maintain trust. If I had known about this feature before diving into State of Decay, my gameplay style would have been more cautious. Unfortanately, I hadn't known about it.For that reason, I will hold off playing State of Decay any further. Well, that and the fact that the game lags like every f***ing thirty seconds. No, really. You could be playing along at 60 fps and bam! it'll drop down to like 8 fps. What's the first thing you do? Check drivers are up to date. Okay. Lower resolution. Okay. Lower graphics settings. Okay. Same problem. This game has serious lagging. Which is why I'm going to hold off until I'm able to have a better PC.A bit about the game's story and gameplay before I set off: You start as Marcus (who died in my game, god darnit) a young man on a fishing trip with his buddy Ed. The game gets right into the action. Ed is being attacked by zombies and you have to help him. Right off the bat, you meet others at a ranger station. Some stuff happens. And you decide to escape the mountain and head into town. This is where the bulk of the game will be centered. Your home base is a church occupied by some townfolk trying to help survivors.Your role, as any of the player characters that you meet, is to gather supplies, reinforce the churches defense, help others, dive into multiple storylines involving the army, judge, some locals, and stuff. You scavenge homes, radio in for supply runs. Fight zombies. Scavenge warehouses, radio in for supply runs. Fight hordes. Scavenge....okay, you get the point, there's a bit of scavenging involved which is great as it reinforces that this game is an ARPG, not a horror game.So far, I'd give SoD a 7.9/10. (I detracted points because Marcus died and it's laggy as fu.) Otherwise, good game. Good graphics too. I realize I hadn't mentioned that. It runs on one of the Crytek engines, so it has an over abundance of lighting and high res textures."

The only thing some may not like about the game is it isn't a multiplayer, and while I actually prefer non multiplayer games, it would have been cool if other communities and neighbors were other actual players.But maybe they'll do that in the sequel?Another big plus in my opinion is the size of the game.

Which sucks cause I really did love this game, and was actually willing to throw down money for furture titles by Undead Labs. Now, I won't be. Ever. You guys lost a customer here pulling this.

I've been waiting for a survival game like this for a long time. It's not perfect by any means, but it's the closest game I've played that fit my zombie survival needs.PROS:-Base building is cool-Going on runs for supplies is fun-The zombies can be a ♥♥♥♥♥, but they can also be easy-Each character has a pretty good back story, and most of them get told(unless you kill them)-If you die, you're dead. Your character is gone and you gain a new one at base, and you lose any story lines that they could produce-special zombies-House movingCONS:-Wish it had personal needs(food and water) that I had to keep up with-So far the games been a tad easy, but I've not done much of the ""main"" missions, and the DLC will fix that too-I'd like better control over a party member if I have one(tellling them to pick up reasores or dropped packs)-And more squad based controls would be fun-You can't send your friends out on the slower/easier missions(like scouting out or getting building marterials) in the same way it works with Assassins creed, that would add more risk/reward to the gameAll in all though the game is still fun and it's so far the best survival game I've found that lets you do all the stuff you can."

I'm not sure if someone who isn't into The Walking Dead/Left 4 Dead/zombies writ large would be into this at all, because the excitement of the game comes from being in a zombie outbreak.  The game mimics the feeling one would probably have during a zombie apocalypse, even.  From the feeling I'd get looking over my base from the guard tower when there was nothing to do (such as when my base ISN'T facing an existential crisis in the form of supply shortfalls or zombie hordes knocking on the gates) to the sense of panic you get when you wreck your car in the middle of a suburb and there are no other usable cars in the area (THANKS OBAM- I MEAN BREAKDOWN DLC AND YOUR SCARCE CARS).  In short, it's an amazing game for zombie lovers...for non-zombiites, I'd say probably not but there is some compelling gameplay in the base building and survival-esque aspects of the game in their own right that might entice people who aren't into the subject matter.A brief description of the game and the DLCs:The base game is the base experience, obviously.  You assume the role(s) of a survivor and his friend who proceed to accrete the other survivors they encounter in a rural town, moving from area to area as the crew grows larger, if you choose.  It is a sandbox experience with a campaign built in (similar to how Grand Theft Auto works).  You scavenge your immediate area for supplies and, again, if you choose, scout out bigger/better sites to house the group. The campaign ""missions"" range from eliminating zombie hot spots to relieve pressure on the town as a whole, linking up with other survivor groups and there are also optional tasks in the form of dealing with problems in the camp and taking out special infected that have consequences if they go undone.The Breakdown DLC is essentially the base game in New Game Plus mode.  You play it just like you would the story campaign mode, but this time when you complete the ultimate objective, it starts all over again.  Essentially, you choose your character (which has to be random on the first playthrough), and you unlock special ""hero"" characters (which you'll recognize as the characters of the campaign) with better than your average randomly generated character's skills.  You can have them in your crew (after achieving certain milestones in the playthrough), and you can play as them as the main character.  The generic people for your party are completely randomly generated in the Breakdown playthroughs.  Each playthrough gets progressively harder (supplies harder to come by, generic zombies are faster and tougher, more special infected, etc.) and your final score is based on various factors such as on what level is playthrough, resource acquisition, zombie kills, etc.  If you enjoy the base game and are looking for a bigger challenge, this is a good DLC.The Lifeline DLC is a more drastic change than Breakdown.  This time, the setting is not the rural town from the base game and Breakdown.  It is an extremely urban setting and takes place just as the whole thing is going down.  And, this time, you aren't the rag tag crew of survivors.  You're the military trying to salvage this whole cluster bomb of a situation.  Attempting to extract high value civilians (scientists, etc.) from besieged locations, thinning growing infestations to prevent the spread, all while holding off periodic pulses of heavy zombie attacks on the forward operating base the military has set up as your home.  While this DLC lacks some of the more sandboxey elements present in the base game and Breakdown, it is still just as fun.  You get a huge base to work with and, damn, YOU'RE THE MILITARY! You get to have a pretty sizable posse of hardened military guys with big guns among various other things that make the Lifeline DLC my favorite!"

After the zombie survival genre has been saturated to hell by unintuitive and redundant games such as ""7 Days to Die"", ""The Walking Dead:Survival Instinct"", ""Dead Island"", ""No More Room In Hell"", ""Infestation:Survivor Stories"", and many other games of the sort, it was extremely refreshing to experience a game like State of Decay.At it's heart, yes, it is a zombie game. However, it has been one of the most refreshing entries in the genre in a long time. You are doing more than just killing zombies and scavenging aimlessly. You are managing a whole community, where each and every person has a say, and an effect on your survival. Should you go to get the medicine or the food? Should you kill this infected citizen to end his misery, or let him experience his last days peacefully? These are the kinds of descisions that you will have to make to maintain the integrity of your community.Instead of running around and mindlessly killing zombies, you will be managing your resource stockpiles, constructing upgrades to sustain life at home, and gearing up, training, and delegating activities to your community members. And if they die, they are dead permanently.I would reccomend this game to anyone who has grown tired with the recent ""zombie survival"" games that have been released. It is a game which I overlooked at first, but when I gave it a shot, I understood the hype behind it. The PC port is competent, but suffers from some minor framerate issues and graphical bugs. However, they are small enough to ignore for the most part. If you enjoy micromanagement, roleplaying games, and zombies, there is no doubt that you will enjoy this game."

If they get deathly sick, you have the option of giving them a mercy shot, where you kill them before they turn into a zombie. A survivor that has gone missing may either be dead or still alive hiding in a building where you have to bring them home safely. The random events tell a story of their own in this sandbox game, though the base game does have a main story that you can complete.The survivors also have moods which can improve or worsen depending on random events and whether you successfully solve problems. Ignore the problems and some people may leave due to low confidence.There is base building where you can build facilities such as a medical area to house your sick people or else they may spread it to other people, a garden to grow food, a watch tower to snipe incoming zombies, and cooking area to prevent food contamination. There are not enough space to build everything so you have to choose carefully.In addition to scavenging for personal items, you also need to scavenge enough things for your home, like food, medicine and ammo, for home consumption and to keep home morale up.This game has no multiplayer, so it is a single player game.The nice sandbox features, community building and random events of this game ironically make it closer to the Walking Dead TV Series than the Walking Dead game itself. The community building is a breath of fresh air for this genre, and this game is strongly recommended."

You need to stock up on resources, find a safe place, earn the trust of others before bringing them home, and sleep after hours of searching. Dont get too attached to one person because you play as many, each with their own strengths and abilities and you have to use several of them to keep progressing.The original story mode introduces gameplay elements gradually as you progress and after about 6 hours you'll have a good grasp of the game. Where it really shines for me is in the dlc each being a different game mode. Break down is open world with unlockable players, and a escalating scale of difficulty. Lifeline is like a second story mode, where you are working towards a cure.There are some bugs and issues but this is a one of kind zombie game that I really enjoy and would love to see where it goes in the future.

The game could barely run at 30fps on console so I was really excited when I got State of Decay on PC and of course the game runs like butter on my rig. The game is a ton of fun and I have put about 40 hours into it and I plan on putting 40 more into it. My one gripe that I will get out of the way is that we had to pay for the Breakdown DLC (the sandbox mode) which was supposed to be apart of the intial release, but I got it on sale so I brushed that off. The story mode is a nice experience that you really don't have to follow, but if you want to progress, you might as well do it. It has a sense of urgency to it like the original Dead Rising (one of my favorite games) on the Xbox 360. You build a community, gather resources and help out other survivors while engaging in the main quest. However, do yourself a favor and buy the Breakdown DLC. This is where I put and will be putting the majority of my time in. This mode is fantastic and takes away the linear aspect of a main quest. You can play it for as long as you want or until you run out of the finite resources on the map. I love how you can play as a ton of survivors with their own traits and even have one tag along to help you. The permadeath feature is terrifying and getting attacked by more than 2 zombies makes you♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself. Every encounter is a white knuckle ordeal because you do not want your survivor to die. The survivors can be leveled up and specialized with adds some depth and personality to them. Minus a few glitches here and there, you can get passed them very easily. Plus, there is a decent amount of mods to help your State of Decay experience. For $20, you will get your money out of this game or $27 with the DLC. Must buy!"

The difference comes from not simply dealing with stockpile numbers as part of the survival horror experience, but needing to manage and prioritize an entire community of human resources, where and how to build a base, what facilities to maintain, how many and which survivors to recruit, then bother to support and protect. It succeeds in creating a ""Sim Community"" experience within a survival horror apocalypse, meanwhile still predominantly being a tight action game."

The game without the DLC is a basic campaign/story mode where you control a group of survivors.   The point is escaping the town you are in, but to do that you have to recruit more surivors, scavange for supplies, and survive long enough.   You setup a home base in one of the many locations throughout the city (Warehouse is the best South/West of map in town) and build things in your base like medical labs, sleeping bunks for extra people, storage, machine shops, etc.     The game also has RPG elements, each person has skills they can level up on a scale of 1-8, and you can pick a offensive and sometimes a defensive skill to specialize in.Breakdown (DLC)While some people think this is a dumb idea, it's actually very entertaining.  The problem with the regular game is that after you get to the end of the campaign the zombies don't really get harder.   Breakdown is like the Walking dead, it goes on endlessly until you die.   Rather than escaping the town, you get to the RV and leave and restart the town with the difficulty level increased.   Each difficulty level provides new challengers/achievements you'll want to get, which unlock survivors from the story line.Lineline (DLC)This steps up the action significantly as you control the military after the events of the campaign inside the actual big city.  Sometimes this DLC frustraits people.   You  have a threat level of 1 - 3, when it goes to 3 zombies will attack your military base and you have to fend them off like any defense/wave type game.   What gets people mad is that they feel you don't have enough time to scavange / loot / complete quests before the threat level gets to 3.   The solution so this is to assign your men to ""thin the herd"" which will delay the increase in threat levels and give you enough time.   You can do this through the base overview section in your options.This game does have bugs and glitches, none that I found were game breaking, they actually make me laugh so hard I usually end up dying from it.   You can be driving a car with a flat tire and just get lauched staight up into the air for example :)  Always funny.   The glitches are few and far between and definitely don't ruin the game.If you like zombie survival games and you haven't played this one you should already be buying it!Oh, and on bugs/glitches.

The game is has horrible colors, and by horrible i mean so bad its like they used crayon to color the green grass with brown collor, but the game is only made by 22 or 21 developers so I wouldnt blame them on such colors and the game is worth more than $20. zombies are great and so many zombie types.As much as the game updates I still see some bugs and crashes and sometimes it starts losing framerate from 60 to 30 and I have better than the recommended specs thats probably because the game has the same port as the Xbox 360 version which is really bad since we will have to put us with console power, I mean we are The PC Gaming Master Race, for God's sake give us more framerate on 1080p!!!  So about the story isnt much of a deal and has no sense in it, well its because its not important at all i mean its only first couple of missions and the rest of the game is about you finding a way to survive.

,Recommended,241540,8554090,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,Del Mingus,"Yet another zombie game in an already really crowded genre and yet this still manages to feel a bit fresh. The real focus in this game is survival. You'll need to set up a base, find supplies, recruit survivors all while defending yourself from zombies.The game has a great open and persistant world. If you see a house or building you can more than likely enter it and search for supplies. When you gather those supplies they won't respawn. So the more you scavenge the less there is and this will make you need to plan things a bit. Will you stay in an area where you have a safe base but you scvenged most of the supplies, or will you uproot and move to a new area which is less safe but has loads of unexplored buildings which may be packed with loot?You also have to manage your survivors carefully. The great thing is that each survivor has their own strengths and weaknessess and their own personality and since you'll be switching between survivors as they get tired or injured as you'll get attached to some and end up disliking others. Once a survivor dies in the game thats it they're gone, which will really make you think about whether to take risks or not.There are a few things that let the game down however. Firstly the graphics look outdated. Also i started playing this game with a m+k and just found it too awkward so switched to a controller which was a massive improvement.. I'd strongly recommend using a controller for this game. Even with the controller i found the combat a bit clunky at times.Also once you've established your base and are living comfortabl enough it starts to get boring. Not helped by the annoying side quests that pop up far too often. Also the near constant stream of reminders you get over the radio about a side quest when your doing something else is irritating to say the least.Unlike the main quests which can be left for as long as you want not doing a side quest will lead to consequences as they seem to have a time limit in which to be completed. Sometimes these consequences can mean you losing a survivor so didn't like this either.The worst side quest is the Besieged ones. It basically has you under siege from zombies in a house with other survivors where you'll board up the windows and fight off the zombies which sounds fun but is anything but. As to beat the mission you have to kill all attacking zombies and as zombies can wander into the area you can end up with a constant stream coming at the house which can make this mission drag out for a good 15-20 minutes.Overall, though this game is still good despite it's flaws. I would recommend giving it a go as for the first 10 or so hours i was hooked on it. It's a 7.5/10 for me."

I enjoyed every moment of it and would recommend it to those that are looking for a game in the zombie apocalypse survival genre.The basic premise is that the end of the world has come in the form of a zombie plague. There are a few survivors out there and you have to guide your community through the hostile environment. This is done through a combination of scavenging, base improvement / defence and missions. You have to play more than one character and build them up in different ways so they all contribute differently to the community as a whole.Positives:Easy to pick up and put down.Breakdown DLC provides endless hours of additonal 'surviving'.Easy to use and balanced experience system that is not too deep for this style of game.Permadeath suits this game perfectly.The sandbox environments have been carefully considered.Achievements that are enjoyable to work towards and do not feel like a pointless grind.Good fun!Negtives:Very short main story thread.Occaisional collision glitches that can be frustrating.Very low difficulty.Other Notes:Would have personally liked to have seen some form of crafting system in it, but understand why it isn't there.Contains nothing 'big'. For example, a hospital. Instead, a lot of small buldings placed together. Again, I understand why, but have a preference otherwise.It is not multiplayer enabled, which a lot of the community would like to see. It would be one of the finest co-op games around if it was, though it would need to be made a lot more difficult first.Conclusion:I won't go into the game mechanics too much.

Its like someone took the GTA engine and made a zombie game. For some reason, it seems very resource heavy for what it is. Especially since it doesnt look that great. (my opinion) Foliage, faces, and other thigns that shouldnt be too blurry, seem to be blurry and colored incorrectly.And when I say its resource-heavy I am basing that on the fact that I can run Crysis 3 maxed out (as well as other resource heavy games). This game seems to be slower and working very hard to process an environment that isnt very complex, detailed, anti-aliased properly, et al. However, graphics dont always make a game. Outside of the visuals in the game the gameply itself is very solid. The controls and variety of actions (and environment reactions) are well thought out and work well in the environment. Plus, you have to take care to manage your camp well along with exploration and battles. So its a nice even balance between everything the game needs you to do to make your survival successful.If this game looked better I think I would play it a little more. That, and the controls are a little quirky for KB+M. I havent tried a controller yet but just by the way the latter performs I can tell a controller would work better. I would give this game a 6/10...but a very strong 6 on the core game only subtracting for controls, visuals, and impact on system resources. I got the game on sale and Im NOT sorry I bought it. With that said, there are other games that kick its♥♥♥♥♥thoroughly."

(You have been warned)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------State of Decay is a very fun game it is a 3rd person view. Very easy to access and use weapons.There are also ""missions"" you can do. Its a story/freeroam game which is nice. You don't have to do the missions if you want expansions/dlc are amazing not going to spoil those for you but back to the game good combat I think the graphics are pretty nice and if you complain about those well GRAHPICS ARE NOT LIFE PEOPLE.There also base building but be advised you CAN NOT build a base anywhere only houses/buildings with wall or fences can only build stuff inside base where there are ""Squares"".Spoilage begins.....You can also build outposts to kill incomeing hordes. Hordes are a pack of zombies between 7-9 can easily kill hordes with cars ferals are kind of an instant kill with a car/truck/vans. Ferals, Ferals are a mutant zombie that are greenish/pale and are dangerous 1v1.There are also other mutants like. Bloaters, Bloaters are zombies that explode when near humans there ""acid"" brings down the Stamina and Vitality (Health) Note You can increase your Vitality by makeing a infirmary in your base.Juggernauts, Juggernauts are massive zombies that have alot of strength and takes 4-6 hits with a truck to kill them note Juggernauts are VERY DANGEROUS  in hand to hand combat. Screams I think they are called are every where (not that much). Screams have no arms and can not attack the only thing they do is call to other zombies to come and kill you (Must be close to one for it to scream) Screamers are also in ""Infestions"". Infestations are a lot of zombies with (1-3 screamers) usually in abuilding.Swat/armyzombies have armor that protect them against bullets must kill with weapon or car.

With so few survivors and little supplies and with the game changing in real time, I was scared that I would lose all of my survivors!But then, you get explore more and build your community and you will do just great!It is great that you can play as multiple characters, basically as many survivors you ofter shelter to.You can also customize your character by specializations. For example, you can make your character a bad@$$ gunslinger, specializing in either pistols, revolvers, assault rifles, rifle, or shotguns; or you can specialize with certain melee weapons (blunt, edged or heavy weapons). The best part is, you can only choose 1 weapon specialization, whether it is in guns or melee.There are also other types of specializations you can choose depnding on certain character attribute levels.SOUNDS LIKE A LOT, but it really isnt.The main story is pretty good, killing tons of zombies with weapons or vehicles is very fun.The DLCs do offer a bit of game changing elements, but nothing too crazy.The overall gameplay can get a tiny bit repetitive, but having different characters with different specializations can change that. With the base game, It look around 25 hours to complete. The DLC packs do offer more fun!Basically, if you enjoy a pretty good story with pretty fun gameplay, then State of Decay turns into a pretty fun Single Player adventure.This is easily one of my favorite games.When it goes on sale again, it will be worth grabbing."

That being said, I felt like the emphasis on managing all your people really got in the way of my enjoyment. I turned the game off with the morale of my home being pretty high and came back a few days later with people missing, morale low, and someone dead. This game feels more like a management game which leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I feel like i'm being forced to please the home area rather than do stuff I want to do.The core game is solid though. While fairly basic, the combat is pretty sastifying. Everything has a crunchy sound which makes hits feel impactful. The stealth is so-so. It boils down to crouching behind zombies in the end. Searching for materials, finding survivors, finding new homes (that you can upgrade), and exploring are all really interesting. I wish the game focused more on that rather than morale and managing people.The voice-acting at times feels really lame. Some moments that should have left you caring a little more missed their mark.I would recommend this game to anyone interested because for the price it's very good."

,Recommended,241540,12102880,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,Captain MooMoos,"Undead Labs comes out with a fantastic twist on the Zombie genre. State of Decay introduces high level survival involving base establishment, building, resource management, questing, and zombie apocalypse all mixed together.Story:A simple fishing trip in Mt. Tanner goes completely wrong for our starting hero Marcus Campbell and his friend Ed Jones. It doesn’t take long for Trumbell Valley to go down the toilet as the zombie virus spreads throughout the land. With an abundance of cast it is up to whomever you decide to bring the remaining survivors together and figure out what the military is up to in this forsaken valley.Campaign:State of Decay is not like any other game you’ll play. Your characters are completely dynamic in that anyone who dies is lost forever, but the campaign continues as if the person lost never existed to begin with. The campaign is delivered through missions that are randomly assigned based on events on the map and total missions currently in progress. The missions vary from side-missions with a story, the main campaign, and then random filler missions. Although, be careful because the missions can also glitch if you develop too quickly resulting in the campaign never fully deploying. In my person campaign I was unable to actually beat it despite playing 30+ hours because my final missions never deployed as I had too many filler missions blocking the deployment of the final campaign missions.Gameplay:Each person you find has independent experience sets which can be raised to make each character as strong as the last. Selecting from a list of customized traits combined with unique character traits you can fully develop unique characters. I found myself playing different characters just to level them so they would be more competent when running scavenger missions or hunt missions. The stronger you make each of your survivors the more competent they are in battle; sadly they do not level unless you play them. Some traits like wits and cardio are only applicable if you are using the survivor. On the other hand some traits like fighting and special unique traits transfer making them much more useful in combat.  The zombies you fight have various speeds which allow them to be each unique in how you much approach them, but not only are the regulars different they’ve also provided special zombies which include: SWAT, Bloater, Juggernaut, Screamer, and Feral. The SWAT is essentially a regular zombie with armor making them invulnerable to bullets; the bloater is a zombie that upon death releases toxic gas; the juggernaut is a very strong zombie that although in vulnerable to all attacks is not able to be knocked back; the screamer is a zombie that releases you guessed it a mighty scream that attracts other zombies and stuns survivors; finally the feral which the scariest of the lot uses its high speed to pin survivors (similar to a hunter), but with enough work you can get them off.DLC:Breakdown:I haven’t played Breakdown truly, but from the little I did it seems like just the regular game with less base management and more free-roam. The little objectives are made null and instead you focus on character development. I will update this once I figure out more about the game.Lifeline:This is probably one of the best DLC expansions I have ever seen. Lifeline offers a whole new city with new features that make a brilliant campaign. The city although not fully unlocked provides a campaign that can be finished in two ways with a score-card based on your progress through the campaign. For every thirty-forty minutes a siege occurs on your home base where you must hold up against an even greater foe. Each level there are more zombies, hordes, and even infestations. This progressively makes the campaign more difficult to play – of course at the same time each of the survivors becomes more powerful as you train them up. This campaign offers an interesting story with new dynamics and features.Results:State of Decay and its DLC’s are a brilliant set to add to the zombie genre. The permanent death feature is a great addition to the game by making each character the protagonist. This adds a huge amount of depth to the gameplay as well as the story. In fact the Lifeline DLC reminds me of how expansions traditionally used to be, a whole new game that built off the old one rather than just a single unlock. This is a fantastic zombie game with amazing combat, character dynamics, and story. Despite some glitches that may make the campaign unbeatable the game is still definitely a lot of fun. I would recommend this game and its DLCs especially if you can grab it on a sale.Pros:+Permanent death, which means every survivor is the protagonist.+Base building; depending on your gameplay you can either go big or small. You get to play how you want the campaign to flow.+Other survivor camps, they are spread throughout the game and appear randomly to make the world seem more alive.+Character customization, each character although has the same attributes is unique based on how you play them.+Fun combat system, lots of weapons and different play styles that combine with abilities.Cons:-The game may glitch causing you to be unable to complete the campaign.-Lifeline has a spawn glitch, possibly due to the smaller playable area, where zombies spawn randomly even right within range as you are fighting. If you turn the camera and then immediately turn it back around the area will usually be full of zombies again.-The filler missions can be incredibly annoying and repetitive, especially if you have a big camp. Sometimes if you don’t complete them your survivors die."
76561198029532081,Recommended,241540,11985265,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,ARNUD SWAZZANEGGER,"You may be looking at how many hours i have played State of Decay and think 'wow looks like he really enjoyed the game'... well, you'd have thought wrong.... kind of.I only played that many hours because i thought that i had to, i thought that game was actually deep enough and that all this survival business was the core of the game that keeps it going. Unfortunately though the survival aspect of the game is nothing but a set of chores which only serve to annoy you in the end. I enjoyed the game up until i realized just how shallow it was.As for the graphics... 'Ultra spec' looks a little better than xbox360? They should have just called ultra spec 'little better than xbox 360 spec' instead of insulting us like that. It looked well enough though, but it was more the gameplay and plot and survival i was interested in to be honest so graphics wise wasn't a factor in whether i liked the game or not.However, when i select ultra setting on a game i do so because i want that 'wow look at that' feeling.I'm guessing here, but all one would need to do to complete the game is simply collect all the materials away from your usual beaten paths around your base (and even around the bases you may choose later) and send out the message that you are willing to accept survivors to you camp then once you have enough people and materials to move and set things up you can move to the trucking warehouse and set up shop there.From the trucking warehouse I'd say most of the game is done with and the chore side of the game kicks in big time. I wasted so much time (without knowing it) at the Church when i was still under the belief that i had to play this game to survive and help others to survive.For me the kicker was when i was trying to build a watchtower and progress was halted due to not having HEAVY GLOVES!That was when i realized the game wasn't as 'deep' as i thought it was, then when i started using the 'cook a meal for the camp' option i was notified progress was halted because we needed WOODEN SPOONS!!!Without mumbling on to much, this game is not really forcing you to 'survive' and play that survival role, it instead relies on you role playing (pretending).Then again, what more should we have expected fro a game which was made for the xbox 360? I didn't even know this game existed until the Steam sale.If undead labs want to try this one again but purely for the PC and go all out with the survival aspect hinted at in this version then I'll certainly take a look at that one. However, I'm done with this after i test my theory about how shallow the game is. I'll play this once more and see how little it takes to actually complete the game.UPDATE:I started a new game on a new profile to see how quickly i could beat the game, however i have come to realize the level and depths of 'bugs' this game has, so I'm back to note what i remember:Radio Operater changing gender and race:The radio operator is someone who isn;t a selectable character, yet i returned from a mission with an ally who needed saving (again for 1millionth time) i went into the building to restock at the inventor and noticed someone different sitting at the radio. I opened up the menu to check the 'team page' and sure enough, Lilly Ritter (supposed to be white female) had now been replaced by a black male, her voice still came over the radio, but she was now gone, but i could select the black male called Lilly Ritter... though i didn't just in case it broke the game any more.Inventory being locked:After one of the many repeatable missions like go resuce your friend, or go help kill one of the special zombies or go cause a distraction so one of your firends can escape in the other direction... i came back to the base and tried to restock and no matter which angle of the inventory (which is a refridgerator) it would not let me access the inventory. I tried to change character and still no luck, i tried changing a few characters and it still woudln't let me in.So i quit the game and restarted and finally it let me access it, however, coming back from another mission it happened again and of course it meant that i had to quit them game. I gave it one more chance (3rd time lucky sort of thing) and thankfully it didn't happen again and hasn't happened after several hours gameplay.Friends just stand there:This has happened a lot to me so far and even on my very first playthrough of the game, but it happened in different ways for example, it owuld happen at the end of a mission to help them kill a special zombie so i thought nothing of it and simply move onto something else. However, it finally happened when i was trying to start a mission with someone, they just stood there, i couldn't talk to them at all. I simply left the area and returned and they were still standing there, they would even fight zombies but wouldn't talk or move unless a zombie provoked them into fighting.You can just leave them and allow that mission to fail and eal ith the losses that result such as moral and perhaps that character being hurt... or dead.Side Quests failing even though you completed them:I had this happen a few times and it is very annoying to say the least.Main Story Missions not progressing:Need i say any more about that.... i think we all know that sort of thing sucks.After recognizing all those 'bugs' i went in search of an update, instead of an update  i found MODS!!!The mods i installed were were all from Nexus:MtTannerBridgeREPAIRED-76-1-0(This fixes the bridge at the start so you can simply drive over and not be bothered with time wasting nonsense)TowTruckV10-60-1-0(Removes all the very annoying car wrecks which are of course placed right in the middle of the roads and at turns, these were simply annoying and pointless and their placement wouldn't have made sense in reality, this mod rids you of their annoy presence)QMJS Extended Functions Mod-V1.4-87-1-4(This mod makes a number of changes, to numerous to list but the changes make more sense than what the developers were able to muster collectively, perhaps the guy who created this mod should be invited to work on a sequel or a full on PC version of this game)Those are the only three mods i installed and wow did they make things MUCH better, some of the bugs i had previously experienced were gone as well. Sadly the inventory being locked persisted and Lilly Ritter still went and had a sex change operation.So in closing... for the last time, i guess we shouldn't expect much from a game that was made for xbox 360, i man, they have to fit everything onto the dvd and that hardware has limitations which our master race PC's don't.I'm hoping this development team does something exclusively for the PC and listens to the community feedback they will no doubt have been getting, i can see why the game is liked and i myself want to like it more than i do, but the limitations are right there whispering your name and driving you crazy!!!We all know that a development team/publisher like Rockstar would do this and do it right first time around.. GTA 5 with zombies done in this sort of survival style? C'mon, you KNOW we want that!... that is all,"

SoD is a framework of interlocking systems that determines the fate of a handful of survivors that you control. You choose a place to build your base, scavenge for supplies to keep it going, run over zombies with cars and trade with and help other surviving communities.Everything is finite; from resources and vehicles to ammo and indeed the survivors themselves; the AI is intelligent and reacts to events believably; treat someone badly or overwork them, and they may leave your roof, losing a well loved survivor to the zombies demoralizes the rest (and you too). Vehicles are powerful tools to kill massive hordes of zombies with, but if they get destroyed, you may soon find yourself at the mercy of the hordes.Sound also plays an important role in your affairs in zombieville; running is more dangerous than walking, sneaking is the safest and slowest; speeding along the road in a car brings out all the zombies from their hidey holes, cruising slowly is safer, but not ideal when you are enroute to save someone.Weapons break in the middle of fights; ammo runs out all too soon and dodging and shoving away the undead is as important as slicing their arms off and bashing their brainless heads against the closest wall.While the main game does have a story that explains the mechanics; its the DLC Breakdown that is the 'Real' SoD for me; in Breakdown; once you start finding the game too easy (or run out of resources on the map); you can choose to refresh the map, this comes at a cost though; each time the map is refreshed, the game becomes harder, throwing more zombies at you, more hordes and more specials.An important fact to note is that the game has a small but dedicated modding community with quite a few mods that enhance the gameplay and visuals. Its no Skyrim, but its something.State of Decay is not a storytelling benchmark, its not a polished title from a well known studio, neither is it a graphical beast that will bring your computer to its knees; its much more than those trivial things."

Base and player management is not something that you always expect to work well within a 3rd Person Shooter, but it definitely adds a level of personal investment into the game.Overall, the game handles every portion of zombie fighting/survival management right: Sounds attract hordes, team mates can generally hold their own, supplies are low but managable, and death is handled excellently. When your player character dies, your group returns to the base and you automatically assume the role of another playable survivor, if one is living. Death means you lose that person FOREVER, but the game continues on (and saves automatically). It makes dying a SERIOUS deal - most modern games make death feel trivial. It is so impactful in this game, you might find yourself actually making consious decisions not to take risks you might take in other games because you don't want to lose all of the skills/items/time you've invested into developing a character."

The game is also excellent in that it punishes you for being stupid---don't make too much noise, firing your gun willy nilly will get you swarmed, if you use crappy weapons like a 2x4 it could break, etc etc. Don't charge headfirst into a horde---unless you're in a nice pikup truck, in which case you should slam the pedal and gun it right for em! The atmosphere of the game, the feeling of constant danger and impending doom, and the fact that all choices you make lead to a permament outcome do to the autosave only function....its an incredible experience. I highly reccomend this game to just about anyone, its tons of fun and scares the crap out of me yet I can's stop playing!"

Nice cars, nice weapons, and nice zeds. And thats it :)The Bad:Hoewever after a while you'll realize there is nothing fun to this despite loot runs, character and voice consistancy, and no real story line. You have the option of saving people and allowing them into your group as well as playing as them, but no matter who you play with, it seems like your the main person to get anything done. you could save a grandma and they will expect you to drive through military check points gun blazing ready to start some♥♥♥♥♥♥ That independence is really boring... espewcially if you take too long it causes consequences to your camp. you refused to help someone find a can of corns, so now your camp is arguing and using more food to make up for the damn corn.. Not to mention it will always be an issue no matter who you please or turn down. Someone will always be displeased. It's like TELLTALE The walking dead. No matter what choice you make or what you do, it will displease someone and make another happy. At the end of the day you are literally looting every house and store you come across until its empty then you move on. The loot doesnt respawn so once you loot one city, you have to move onto another one. God forbid you are behind in missions so you cannot relocate. I've relocated once, and I've done it so fast i can still loot the original placing of my camp.All the characters dress and sound the same. I have at least 2 females in my camp, who are a mixture of someone else. One dresses like Maya-- the first female charcter who also seems like 1 out of 3 main characters. and the other sounds like another girl in my camp. It's like Maya has a twin with the voice of another girl in my camp. It's annoying. The dialloug is♥♥♥♥♥♥ you better hope and pray your♥♥♥♥♥can run because if you solo a Zed, you better be full on HP with a lot of bullets. About the only thing that respawns is the cars, once you loot somewhere it wont respawn. So you have 3-4 cities. Once you loot them all, thats it. You will starve out. The game was made so you could beat it before that  happens but still, not worth it.Over all this game isn't worth it for a full playthough. Get your monyes worth berfore the 1st 20hrs cause ugh.

76561197989072565,Not Recommended,241540,8685748,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,MarketGardenGaming,"To begin, I DO reccomend this game, if you want to spend 20 bucks for a game that you could have done in a couple of few hour play sessions after work or something. If you love Grand Theft Auto and also love Zombies, this game is awesome.I really wanted to reccomend this game. I had loads of fun playing it, but I will explain why I downvoted it. The game claims to be an open world exploration type sandbox title, which it is in a way. BUT. There are too many situations where you are out running around at night (I chose to do that so the zeds couldn't see me as well) trying to gather supplies for my home, and you get a call on the radio: ""OMG OMG OMG this is urgent get there quick or they are going to die"" so you have to drop everything you are doing and rescue some moron that ran away from your base for no reason. It's usually the hot chick that you like looking at her yoga pants wearing posterior, or your guy that's best with guns, or your doctor/mechanic/person with useful skill. The useless mouthes to feed will always be at home willing to lend a helping hand with their useless skills such as TV trivia or Women's Studies degree. There is no actual free roaming because all kinds of stuff is happening. I know some might think that that's more of the style of ""time is against us"" zombie scenarios, but I felt that the game was rushing me through it to hurry up and win, and not enjoy it.There are some bugs here and there, like when I'm having fun plowing over zombies in a car, I hit one the wrong way and it makes my car do a 720 in the air, land on it's top, and explode into flames, leaving me in the middle of nowhere between two zombie hordes, thus I lose my favorite character to play with. The game has an auto-save only feature so if you exit the game to try and restart the mission, nope. Character is still dead. If you really want that character back, you have to start the game all over.  There is no way to see someone's skills before you let them join up with your survivor outpost, so the only way to get rid of a useless person is to play as them and get them killed, thus bringing your outposts moral down.The DLC. Want to pay 7 more dollars for the exact same game? Buy it. The second game uses the same map, and everything from the original game. It's just more of a see how long your can survive thing. The only difference is that you get to play as some of the unplayable NPCs from the original title, which don't even use the same voice actors. You still scavenge, kill hordes, establish outposts, find ammo, except this time you have to fix up and RV for you and some survivors to escape. When you do, you just start a new game, on a harder difficulty setting, rinse and repeat until you get to a difficultly setting that you can't beat. That's all. Do not pay for the DLC unless you wanted to play as that NPC you saw from the original game.Oh, one more thing. The real time event mechanic. If you stop playing tonight, go to bed, wake up and go to school/work the next day, and then play again? You will find more zombie infestations, your people have used up some food/ammo, and another person has ran off. The game still goes on even after you exit out of it.As stated I did have fun with this game, if 20 dollars for a couple of days is worth it to you, by all means, buy it. it's fun. My downvote just comes from the flaws I mentioned, and the fact that I prefer time sink games where you can play for months and still not beat it.With State of Decay, it's either rush through the game and beat it too fast, or take your time, enjoy yourself, try to explore everything, but eventually lose."
,Recommended,241540,11054335,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,harv,"STATE OF DECAYA clumsy and awkward 3rd person open-world zombie survival game.Rating 6/10You've seen it all before, the dead are walking the earth, people are banding together and the military is acting suspiciously. It's all rather familiar and sadly a bit bland as it doesn't add anything to the zombie genre and only plays out a well worn theme. That's not to say it's bad and it does some interesting things but more often than not you'll have a feeling that you’ve seen it all before.The main objective is survival and the best way to do this is gather other survivors into your group. You are able to play any character in your group but more often than not I found myself returning to the same starting character as he had levelled the most and was the strongest. The various characters in your group aren't interesting enough or different enough to warrant playing each one and there's no great penalty to playing the same character. Characters will become tired or hurt and will require that you let them sleep occasionally but it's not much of a hindrance and characters heal quickly.Once you've set up camp you are able to work on improvements, from a kitchen to feed your group to watch towers for defense it's a fine balance of knowing what supplies are needed and when they are needed in order to keep your group morale high and to keep them healthy. Of course improving your base isn't free and it requires different resources and new survivors with required skills. You're able to loot and forage for these supplies in each house, shop and warehouse you come across. Once you've looted a location it's marked on the map and the loot doesn't re-spawn. This means certain areas will dry up prompting you to move your group to a new home base and start the whole thing again.Ransacking houses at night looking for much needed supplies whilst trying not to make too much noise as to attract unwanted attention is probably the games biggest strength and there's a balance of accepting missions and collecting supplies. Ignore one or the other at your own peril as problems will start to affect your group, from hunger to anger and fear. It's a game of mini-management as you're bombarded with missions and requests and you have to decide which to do first. There's rarely time to stop and think or to explore as time is an expensive commodity and side missions are time restricted, if you ignore them they are removed.The plot itself comes second to the survival and there's not much meat to the main story. The military aren't helping people and need to be investigated whilst there's also a new society being founded by 'The Judge'. However both these branches of the main story only last for a handful of missions with most of the core game play coming from side missions and foraging for supplies.In order to complete the game you'll occasionally need to rely on your allies. Although they are more of a hindrance than a help as they often block doorways, struggle to get into vehicles or they run off into trouble. Its infuriating and I often left base alone unless I needed to tackle a zombie infestation or harder mission. Which leads me to the next problem; it's just not difficult enough. I had no problems completing the game solo, with almost no help from my group. My main character was a tank towards the endgame that could smash his way through multiple hordes with just a small axe. There are of course 'freak' zombies such as a Juggernaut zombie who raise the difficulty a little but to counter this are vehicles. Vehicles offer instant safety as well as being almost unstoppable killing machines. To balance this vehicles can take damage and break down if you run down too many zombies but there are so many vehicles in the game you are never in danger of running out as well as being able to repair vehicles at your home base.So why would I recommend this? Mainly because even with the clumsy controls, terrible A.I, bland plot and dated graphics there's just enough to recommend if only for the survival aspect. Exploring new locations, collecting supplies and maintaining a harmonious group works well it's a shame the rest of the game lacks polish."
,Recommended,241540,10878518,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,Jargs,"This is actually a really fun game once you get into it. It's a little confusing at first because they don't do a very good job of teaching you what you're supposed to do next, or even how to do it sometimes, but once you get the hang of the game, it's actually a lot of fun. The only thing missing is co-op play.UPDATE: I have now finished the game, so here's an updated review...I only have 2 main complaints about the game. First, as I said above, it does a pretty bad job of telling you how to do stuff. You have to figure out a lot of things on your own (which I guess could be considered ""realistic"" in a zombie apocalypse).The second is that it's really light on storyline missions. The side missions are pretty much constantly becoming available (kill this, deliver that, save this guy, clear that infestation, etc.), but they get a little repetitive toward the end of the game since the storyline missions are so sparse.As for gameplay, you don't play as a single survivor. You play as all of them, and level up their skills separately. When one gets tired or injured, you can switch to another one. Your survivors can also die, get infected, or freak out and kill themselves (or others), but you can also find new survivors take in around the world.Your home base (which can be moved to other locations if you want) has slots for building various structures like a med center, guard tower, crafting area, kitchen, etc. Each home location has different numbers of building slots, and require a different number of survivors to maintain.Depending on the number of survivors and outposts, your base consumes resources each day (food, meds, ammo, building materials, fuel), so you always have to be on the lookout for more. On top of that you need to keep your survivors stocked with weapons, food, meds and ammo that they use while they're out killing zombies.Overall, it's a really fun game that has a ton of potential. They just didn't quite live up to it with this one. Hopefully State of Decay 2 will be amazing.If you can find it on sale, I do recommend trying this game out.I paid $4.99."

It has some nice features, albeit unpolished and half-thought. Easily the worst feature of the game is the horrendous graphics, and low resolution. I can forgive a game not having next-gen graphics, but this is so bad you literally seem to be viewing the game with tunnel vision. It is a third person viewpoint that has about the peripherals you would expect in a first person viewpoint. The colors bleed into each other so badly it makes you want to cringe.Combat is the next worst feature. It's clunky, it's unrefined, and it's annoying. Zombies laying on the ground will do some sort of disco dance trying to get up at you. They will spin around, perform whatever was supposed to pass for animation, and is now biting your neck. Attacking is simply a LMB mashfest, and everything feels so unrealistic and fake, that you simply don't feel like you're even involved in the fighting.There seems to be no way to toggle crouching or running. Nope, they make you hold the button. Because that's fun. Hurray for console ports.... Weapon durability on the game is hilariously low. You'll be breaking things as soon as you find them. And with such a limited inventory for items, you'll just love using it up for multiple weapons to switch to, because somehow that metal wrench keeps breaking in half. Item durability to this degree is a cheap means of implying resource scarcity, because the devs didn't have the creativity to think of something less annoying to convey that thought.The world is small. I mean, it's small. Small town? More like a studio backdrop. You can stand on a roof and pretty much see everything you're working with. And it's all a block or two away.All in all, for a cheap indie game I give them a thumbs up for trying. But this isn't the survivor sandbox they make it out to be. Items do not respawn because it's not realistic....oh, but those zombies respawning in the same locations doing the same things they were doing the last 10 times you killed them, that's realistic!The survivor missions are tedious and boring, and it feels like you're playing The Sims, trying to get all of their little need bars filled up, rather than a zombie survival game.Pass on it.

It's still enjoyable but feels less urgent than the story line. Another gripe I have with the DLC is the lack of player creation. If I'm going to forge my own story, why can't I forge my own survivor based on what I'd like? Before you unlock other more useful survivors, the chances of getting a useful survivor to play as are slim, a fair portion of recruited survivors, and NPCs in a home base you select will be drunken losers.SoD definately made me enjoy it, I had fun with it, and I still pick it up from time to time, but I don't end up investing nearly as much time into it as when I first bought it."

Recently, steam put it up on sale and I picked it up just because I was bored, and OH WOW do I ever wish I'd picked it up sooner. This game is wonderful, in a way I've seen very few games be wonderful in the past.Initially I was unimpressed, as the number of zombie games out there is getting pretty saturating, and when I first started I was getting precisely what I expected. Very basic fare in a game that wasn't doing anything well... And then I finished the tutorial and made it to the church....This game is a HUGE world where you have to fight zombies, gather supplies, go stealth, get along with neighbors, investigate things, actually use survival skills and even build up a home base. There have been few GOOD zombie games out there, and this is one of the EXCELLENT ones. Once the tutorial was done, as I mentioned above, s**t got real, as they say, and I found myself pouring through corpse infested houses for food, building materials and medical supplies.I'll admit, the graphics aren't perfect, but there are very few graphical ERRORS in the game, and once you get used to them, they're rather immersive. There's a couple of minor issues with the game, like bridge jumps, but don't think about it in terms of success and failure. This is a role playing game in that you can fail at something, but not have a true failure state. ""OH, you messed up that run? No worries, man. We're not going to tell you that you've failed and make sure that you do it over again until you get it the way we want it... Though... There is a herd coming. You -might- want to book it, bro."" I haven't felt this immersed in the ROLE of a game in a LONG time.A fantastic atmosphere, fear inducing, there's a learning curve, and once you get used it, you're solid.I hear there's already a sequel in the works, and as far as that goes, well.. Shut up and take my money.My only real gripe at this point is that there's no Co-op of any kind.

This is the most enjoyable replay-able video game I have ever played in over 40 years of personal video gaming. The main mechanic of the game is 'group survivor management'. It's you the player, controlling and taking part in the life and story of initially two friends who find themselves in the midst of a 'plague driven' apocalypse. The story progresses and you inevitably meet up with other survivors. Though you can choose to not follow the storyline to it's culmination, days or weeks of playtime later, it's well worth immersing oneself into the apocalypse and the story that unfolds.You cannot lose in this game, on many levels it's about learning and having mostly mature fun. In this game you will learn to adapt and overcome in challenging gameplay. You will see some horror that may make you jump or avert your eyes and you will possibly unearth some pop culture references which should make you smile. There's plenty of humor though when interacting with survivors.If a survivor dies, which is generally the fault of the player making a bad strategic or tactical or 'controller skill-based' decision, you still do not lose.This game is enriching on so many levels, but primarily it will pose a question to you when you first experience a significant 'loss to the community'.State of Decay is simply a  brilliant concept that many fans have desired to experience in a game, and thankfully we have a game company that listens to it's fans and gives them what they asked for and more of what they didn't, but are better off for experiencing.The DLC's are some of the coolest game additions I have seen from any game developer, almost like complete separate games with more of what you didnt know you wanted. You really get your money's worth and replay-ability from Undead Labs."

,Recommended,241540,9606764,"Posted: 23 March, 2014",all,[AAO] Deadmano,"AudioThe audio content in State of Decay is somewhat lacking. Combat and general music is generally the same, looping over and over at times with brief pauses of silence which from a survival perspective the sometimes quiet and eerie really goes hand-in-hand with the world around you, its mood and feel.Verdict:6/10.ContentWhen I first got into the world of State of Decay I thought, wow, this is going to be a MASSIVE romp around the map. Sadly, I was let down, just a tad bit. What would seem like a massive open-world map is really just an illusion, the world itself is quite small and the content offered equally so. Half if not three quarters of the map is simply open ground with no content whatsoever, which really makes the entire worldspace feel quiet empty, and owing to the fact that zombies spawn in tiny groups here and there (minus the hordes) adds on to the “lifeless” feel, not in a good way though.Verdict:8/10.ControlsThe first thing I have to bring up is that this was a direct port from the Xbox, that being said without a controller you may feel the controls are a bit clunky compared to actual PC games. Though things have gotten substantially better through all the patches from the developers I still can’t help but feel that movement isn’t quite fluid yet, jumping around and onto objects feel awkward, camera movement and aiming also feels a bit off, but nothing truly gamebreaking. But hook up an Xbox controller and these problems cease to appear. If you do have one, I would thoroughly recommend making use of it as it just plays much better than on a keyboard and mouse.The controls DO work however; they are responsive and do what you need them to do. From opening doors to getting into vehicles to busting a zombies jaw wide open they get the job done and that is all that matters here.Verdict:8/10.EnvironmentTrumbull Valley is the region that the player is thrust into, a region typical of a western settlement in the USA. Canyons here and there, rivers flowing through, industrial areas and residential ones, all dotted across the map. It’s got a great feel for the type of game it is and just makes it that much more believable.You can really tell that a lot of time went into creating all the areas that the player can explore since it feels natural. Groups of houses together in an urban environment, you have the local store down the road, the bar which opposite it is the post office and of course you have the garage down the road. It just feels well thought out and not just randomly placed.Verdict:9/10.FunGive a person an assortment of weapons to take on a never-ending amount of zombies and a great time will be had given all the variety in weaponry but too much of a good thing doesn’t last, though luckily there’s always something to be done in State of Decay and our beloved Lily makes sure of that!The biggest downfall of State of Decay is its grind factor. In the beginning “materials” is your highest priority resource which is used for constructing and upgrading your various buildings. To acquire materials one needs to scout out possible locations and search them. Usually a simple task can be the downfall of your survivor if you’re not prepared (especially in the beginning of the game) to take on zombies who lurk most of these places. Once you’ve cleared up the location (and hope more zombies aren’t attracted to the noise you’ve made) the task of searching the place for “containers” by holding “E” can begin! In the beginning this was quite exhilarating but when you need several hundred materials for your various tasks amidst all the other things that crop up (like saving other survivors) it becomes a boring choir which I would have at least thought one could construct a building that would provide income for ALL resources and not just food which funnily enough is the most abundant resource out there. There’s a ton of environment objects, furniture, fridges, cars etc yet one cannot break them down into materials?!Verdict:4/10.GameplayGameplay revolves around scavenging enough supplies to survive the random zombie outbreaks that will directly affect your survivor community. You’ll find that unless you have a silencer attached to your guns you’re better off fighting hand-to-hand or with melee weapons so as not to attract the zombies in the area that will come running (if they’re not spawned in first that is).In a traditional third person perspective you will hack and slash through zombies to complete objectives and make supply runs. Later on you should have an abundance of ammo and silencers to make full use of your ranged arsenal which makes a big difference and where the game really shines.Verdict:6/10.GraphicsSurprisingly for a port the graphics are actually quite attractive and crisp, and given the fact that you can further tweak them as per CryEngine specs make it all the more enjoyable.Verdict:7/10.ImmersionFor the first couple of hours I really felt like I was a survivor just trying to survive this outbreak. I took to the shadows, sneaked past countless zombies just to scavenge from the nearby house some food and medical supplies along with my first melee weapon; an axe! But as the grind slowly reared its ugly head I got thrown out of the immersion completely and just treated the game as a shoot-em up as by then I was already over-powered with all the weapons I had.Verdict:5/10.QualityI personally waited over 6 months AFTER the game was released from its early access state just because of the fact of how broken the game was back then. Since then countless patches were released that pretty much re-shaped the entire game into completely playable.Verdict:8/10.StoryYou start out with one of your buddies being attacked by a group of zombies at a fishing camp. After making swift work of them you spot a ranger station and decide to head towards it. From there the game eases into explaining its various combat and gameplay mechanics and before you know it you’re off to your very first community of survivors which will introduce quite a few ups and downs before you’re fully ready to take charge of getting everyone and everything organized.Verdict:6/10.Pro’s*Large variety of weaponry, both melee and ranged.*Satisfying exploration feeling.*Detailed environments.*Great sounding weapons.*Easy to get into.Con’s*Can be quite a grind.*Very short story.*Breaks immersion too often.*Poor voice acting.*Largely empty/unused worldspace.SummaryState of Decay had a lot of potential but tried too hard to be a fighter-type action game and didn’t quite finish polishing up the survival aspect of the game, coupled with the fact that it was a direct port from the Xbox and they were limited to a 2GB filesize imposed by XBLA. Taking that into consideration, the gameplay and variety of weaponry is outstanding and with a beautiful and believable environment and graphics one could easily have a great time in Trumbull Valley.Deadmano Inc.-23/03/2014.Rating:67/100Full Review Link"

But this is something else.  I so wanted this to be good, and it had an excellent rep from people who played it on the 360 when it came out, but it's just not the zombie game you've been waiting for.Other than the basic technical issues - which other than the frame rate include things like pop-in so serious that entire buildings pop inon top of youwhile you're walking around - there's a one-two punch to the setup and gameplay that really kills this game's hopes.Firstly, they impose all sorts of weird ""hardcore"" gameplay systems.  That person you spent half an hour rescuing last time you played? Oh, uh, they died while you weren't playing the game - this is not a joke, difficulty is imposed by a system that makes ""poochie died on his way to his home planet"" look BAFTA-worthy.Secondly, the dark and serious narrative vibe is undermined by just about every other design element.  None of it is ever acknowledged in the game, either.  Enemies teleport around and ignore level geometry - just about nothing you do fortification wise makes the slightest actual difference, which, given that this fortification is what you spend a huge amount of time in the game doing, is ever so slightly silly.  Cars are the zombies worst nightmare, ""balanced"" by various bugs to do with the game's collision meshes and driving physics.  Hand to hand combat looks like the world's worst dance party, and friendly AIs will happily ignore pitched battles going on in front of their face.  There has never been a game that took itself so seriously that looked so totally ridiculous in action."

I was waiting for a respawn, but little did I know, I killed the character disallowing him to continue with zombie infected society. The game switched me to an alternate character that I saved just a while earlier, and I continued back out on my journey.

,Not Recommended,241540,13726546,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Some Guy,"Mediocre at best, State of Decay is beset by a number of problems. Combat is pretty bare bones, with one button for attacking, one for dodging, and one for finishers or shoves. The map is rather unevenly spaced out, with a lot of nothing in between points of interest. Sometimes the zombies bunch up into a horde. Sometimes you'll run into special zombies that mix up combat a bit. Feels like everything you would expect from an open world zombie game, played completely straight.But then the little annoying things start showing up. Like how when you search a container it loses its ""searchable"" indicator, making it hard to re-find it in case your inventory is full. Or how you can't swap items with objects in a container. Or that items can't be dropped, only destroyed. How about the fact that you can't cancel any mission or task that you are on, even if it's one that's hoisted on you just by being around a certain area? Then there's your fellow survivors, which basically act as a glorified distraction while you actually kill the zombies. Despite its simplicity, combat itself is clunky at times. I found myself smacking a zombie on the ground instead of attacking the threats in front of me. There's also design decisions like how it's only possible to have one watchtower in your base despite the possiblity that it might be large and warrant having more since all the sides can't be covered. The little things just keep piling up.But that's not even the worst of it. There's numerous glitches too. Like stopping a car next to the sidewalk will cause you to not be able to walk from the road onto the sidewalk unless you jump. Or movement keys suddenly becoming unresponsive. Or improvements to your base not actually functioning as they say, such as vehicle repair. Or how about times when your watchtower has no sentry, despite having the numbers and guns to have one? Combined with the shortcomings of the game in the previous paragraph, these things really drag the game down from being okay to being kind of a stinker.The first DLC, Breakdown, is basically the base game minus the (remarkably short) story. This pretty much means that you'll be doing the same tasks over and over again, as the missions feel designed to fill time between doing the story. There are multiple difficulty levels that you have to unlock by completing the same objective for each level. Even at level one, the game is more difficult than the base game, which is welcome as State of Decay is rather easy. One fo the major downsides of this DLC is that base-making feels repetitive, since there are so few possible base locations, which is limited by your community size. It was tolerable in the base game since the story was so short, but advancing in this mode means starting over from almost nothing, it gets boring fast. Incidentally, I don't believe there's anything stopping a player from just ignoring the story missions and treating the game like a sandbox.Finally, there's the Lifeline DLC, which takes place on a different map with a different story, involving the military finding and extracting certain people from the city. The map at first looks huge but most of it is completely inaccessible. The player is limited to a highway circling the city and small areas off of it. The missions can be frustrating given the ai's inclination towards stupidity, resulting in their deaths. I also encountered several terrible glitches, such as rescuable survivors and other objective indicators appearing in areas that are inaccessible. On one occassion a story-related survivor indicator simply vanished a few minutes after appearing, no explanation, and the game treated it as an objective failure much later. After one mandatory cutscene a character I was supposed to escort spawned underneath the road, with no way to come back up.Overall, this game and its dlc seems like it had some good ideas, but feels rushed, incomplete, and buggy.  I understand that this is the first game released by the developers, but perhaps a less ambitious project than an open world zombie survival game would have felt like less of a let-down. I would not go so far as to say it's a bad game, but even if the bugs were worked out, the best I could say for it is that it's average"

,Recommended,241540,7743813,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,The Precursor,"State of Decay is a pretty solid and fun zombie game from Undead Labs. The game has a very smooth and nice feeling combat system for fighting the zombies, and sets up the apocalyptic world very nicely. Creating a home base with your survivor group, and managing it and the other survivors is easy enough to do, but at the same time very satisfying. Going on scavenging runs, saving survivors or hunting mutated zombies are things that you'll find yourself doing to help the group.As far a realism goes, the game sits somewhere between Dead Rising and DayZ. The words ""Realistic"" and ""Zombie"" don't really go together, but as far as survival goes, your character becomes fatigued and injured over time, and will have to spend time at home to recover. Swapping between characters is essential to keep things running smoothly, and things such as ammo, food, medicine, fuel and materials can be gathered.The game also allows the player to drive vehicles for faster movement, and has a large map to explore, along with many different home base points. There isn't a very forgiving atmosphere in the game, so if you die out there, the character is gone, just like real life. New survivors can be foud to replace them, but stats such as stamina, fighting and more will have to be built up to make them more effective.Graphically the game looks good. As an Xbox port, it isn't extremely high end, but at the same time isn't very dated either. It runs nicely, but hasn't got any advanced settings, instead just ""Low"" ""Medium"" ""High"" etc. The lack of choosable features such as Anti Aliasing is noticable, and a lack of options such as texture quality, shadow quality and more are missed. I should also note that this game is far more enjoyable with a controller than a Keyboard and MouseOverall though, the game is very fun and has lots of content. If you like zombie games, I'm confident you'd like this one. 8/10"

76561197991758752,Not Recommended,241540,8001559,"Posted: 10 December, 2013",all,Duwap,"Here's what I'll say about State of Decay (I played Breakdown, which adds more weapons and stuff): it needs a LOT to make it nice and shiny, but its heart is in the right place.I started off playing this game because I wanted a Fallout-like game. It seemed like a good buy too, as it was around $15 when I picked it up. I'd read good reviews on Metacritic, and I felt it would suffice as an open-world, RPG-styled game with guns.I should've realized right away when the game started off (in the middle of nowhere with no tutorial, cutscene, or any kind of explanation) that I was probably not going to like what followed. What followed was me running around and around and around, looking for a ""place to call home.""Rage and frustration set in as I jogged around the landscape, killing dozens of zombies with a candlestick, radioing my ♥♥♥♥♥y girlfriend or whatever to come set up a home at this spot only to have her tell me it was indefensible and that I should keep looking. Ugggg...It wouldn't have been such a problem except that the game was very unforgiving. The mechanics dictate you monitor two gauges: HP and Stamina. Simple enough; I've been doing that since HL2. They would refill after a certain time and little things like aspirin and snacks could bring them up a bit as well.What I didn't like was that I was being asked to also monitor my sound level, as indicated by a circle on your radar that pops up in accordance with the level of activity you're doing, such as sprinting, searching a cabinet at a faster pace, driving, etc. There are zombies all over the goddamn place, and they all require a good bit of bashing to kill--I'd say 6-10 blows before they die. That's all well and good versus a couple or even three zombies, but any more than that and I was pretty much doomed unless I could make it back home where others would help me.Too often I would come upon a house and try to search it, only to be beset upon by more than I could handle. My character would go in ""Second Chance"" mode where I'd have to frantically press ""C"" over and over until he or she burst from the dog pile like Neo, and then find I had a drastically drained stamina/HP bar and was basically prolonging the inevitable. Apparently, this game expects you to be A-Okay with investing time and effort into developing a character who will be torn to shreds at any given moment. Therfore, realism trumps fun. Fail.Guns attract too much attention and have far too little ammunition to be useful. Fail. Melee weapons are therefore your standard approach to combat, but they have a breaking point and will shatter in the middle of a fight, leaving you to your fists and feet to deal with the zombies. Fail.The interface for managing your home base was a gigantic cluster♥♥♥♥. You're supposed to go around establishing outposts, but those require that you have enough Respect points amongst your group. Respect is also the currency used to give yourself weapons, ammo, and powerups (morphine, snacks, etc.), and when you start over at your base camp after your previous character dies, he or she is of course a nobody and therefore gets♥♥♥♥♥♥in terms of Respect, limiting your ability to suit up and go establish outposts and stuff.Want to take someone along with you to go grab supplies? You need Respect. Want someone to come pick up a supply drop that you don't have space for? You need Respect. Trying to defuse the situation between two warring members of your community? You need Respect. Want a straggler to join your group? You need Trust. It's too much to try and micromanage and quickly becomes an enormous pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Fail.Of course, there are some good aspects of SOD. For the time that I played it, there were no loading screens aside from the startup menu leading into the actual game. The act of driving was pretty atrocious, as the cars would go from fast to full stop in less than a second, were very weak to damage, and just had terrible physics altogether--nevertheless, they were fun to take and plow through a horde of the undead from time to time.The world was vast and varied. It's too bad there so many zombies ruining the fun of exploration.Also, I did like that I had some control over my group; I just wish that it had been better developed. It would have been nice if I could tell members to go out and do tasks, or even if they just did them independently of my command.This game could have been fantastic, and that's what sucks. Crummy AI (quit fixing the window and just let them come in so we can complete this mission, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake!), bad sound design and graphics, frustrating combat mechanics, and a severe lack of help from the game, in terms of instructions and forgiveness, made the experience extremely unenjoyable and disappointing. Can I get a refund...TL;DR--This game sucks. Don't buy it unless it drops below $5.00 on a Steam sale."

But if you are considering buying this game, buy YOSE edition, it will have better graphics and a few fixes.  I will be giving a review for State of decay itself and its DLCs.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392774484So lets move on to where is the fun of this game in general.  It is 3D zombie survival simulator with elements of RPG. You get yourself and your team, who have random characteristics and skills. You get to do almost everything you can imagine you would actually do in the situation of being a human in zombie apocalypse.  Scavenging, saving people, exploring and so on. The fun comes with all of it combined together in a single game.Controls. This game was ported from xbox I believe, so the controls are a bit weird, but its totally cool. You just need to remember what to push when things happen. It gets weird thou when you have to use special skills or combos.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308525923While playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city.I bought the game in 2013 and sadly my PC couldnt run it on the good settings. Sadly as I find out now, the graphics difference is very small. So playing on min settings wont bother you that much. Graphics themselves are pretty good. They deliver what you need to experience very good. I would encourage more fog though just so that you cant see that clearly. Also there is only fine weather, meaning you wont get any rain. Even though the game has a day and night cycle so its not too bad.And the bads, lets see, there are plenty of bugs, I only got to see a few of them, but they are moldy annoying. There are no fixes, so you get what you get. There is also not enough interaction with other members of your group. Missions are very limited by the script. Glitchy as it is,  the game is still good and worth playing and paying for.The story is not the only thing you can do in this game even if you dont purchase the DLCs. But I do encourage you that you buy them nonetheless. The story itself is kinda crap. It pretty much just lets you know what is going on in the world.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396058871The second DLC Breakdown is an infinite survival game (unless you die) with every level of it much harder. This is what I am mostly playing. Once you level up you start from the scratch ( but you get a team and resources) . Very fun and challenging, which I like a lot. The game will make you think if you want to do a loud move because in doing so you may actually get absolutely destroyed. And the last DLC Lifeline tells you a story of the Army in the city. It has special missions, new characters and other stuff, but I didnt find it as entertaining.Re-playability is very high in my opinion, because you can do so many things in a different ways that you just want to keep trying until you figure out the perfect combo for everything.So in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game even though it has a couple of DLCs and a remade version of it. I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody. If you spend 6 hours into the game then you have used the money in the right way."

Of course the game can get tedious and fairly boring from time to time as you...carry♥♥♥♥♥♥from point A to point B, but if you can get past that it's a good game to waste time on.I won't say it's downright mind-blowing, and I won't say it's terrible but I will say for 20$ you can do much worse then this. The original game is actually quite dull and I got bored of it within a few hours. Breakdown however is where the fun begins. Nothing is more fun then listening to Lily spout out the same four lines eight hundred times over as you try and get your super stupid survivor to put the damn supplies in the damn truck bed. No really...some of the fun points is just how freaking moronic your character is.So...you've got your character who can't run for more then 10 seconds before passing out and dying. Who has no idea that regardless of his/her sides aching when the zombie gets hold of them they're going to rip their lungs out anyways, and can't even swing a bloody baton more then three times before his/her readies itself for explodation. Then you've got the awesome driving where your car will suddenly hit a hard pocket of air (which is my only guess) and flip about a hundred times in midair. Can't run over more then two DECAYED bodies before blowing the ♥♥♥♥ up to where you're constantly trying to smash their heads in with your car door. Then finally the AI who seems to purposefully find and bring the largest horde possible your way. All of that strangely adds to the charms. Also don't forget zombies abilities to teleport through the doors and walls.You also have the ever wonderful breakable crowbar, pipe wrench, industrial wrench, prybar, pipe bender...because you know...decayed flesh and all. I will remember when the zombie apocolypse happens, the thing that I use on a daily basis to beat on metal, or rip metal from wood, or bash against surfaces many times harder then bone and flesh will break after a few swings onto the flesh of a decayed...rotting...carcass. Now I know that's maybe nitpicking because some weapons would break, but some should just downright be invulnerable to it. I have watched someone break up concrete with a crowbar and it not even chip. Still, it's always fun to say screw that, and go and take the worst weapon possible just so you can kick the dead.All in all...it's a fun experience if not a bit low-brow. Gather stuff, kill zombies, gather stuff, break weapons, gather stuff, listen to Lily repeat lines, gather stuff, don't play the game for two days to return to see that EVERYONE has died because they're all incompetent as hell. Which I didn't get into...but that's cool.Yeah, if you don't play like, every day, your survivors will just up and die. You run out of supplies, and instead of maybe refilling that over time, they just decide it's best to drop over and die. Super great.Over all, it's worth 20$, but I'd really wait for a sale. It's not something that really deserves that 20$ but it's good enough to warrent it if you really want a time consumer. If not, wait for it to be on sale, and don't get it without getting Breakdown. The base game is boring as far as I'm concerned.Carried♥♥♥♥♥♥from point A to point B. Would do again. 7.5/10"

So I did the most sensible thing. I left him behind. I never did find him again. Probably because I forgot where he was on the map. Then I proceeded to the shelter. I somehow came across a spawned group of 5 zombies not long after reaching the shelter. I remembered the hiding mechanics and hid in a bush. But apparently this bush was diffrent from the rest and decided to reject me everytime I tried to stay hidden. I then ran for a while ( 10 minutes ) slowly killing them. It was annoying. I then rescued my first survivor, Maya. I had 2 large backpacks, and planned to transfer one to her....but then realized I just cant drop things. That ruined a great portion of my plans. So after, I returned, somehow the guy I had left behind spawned in, ok, and then was proceeded to be EATEN again. I was told to leave the area, and so I ran to a truck, got in, and then I drove off the bridge into a creek where I then exploded into a fiery death.Overall? 9/10. I hate that I cant just drop things, or like trade them between the characters. It would be much easier then switching people to pick something up.

The zombies actually pose a threat, and you'll find yourself sneaking in and out of buildings much more than using firearms. The DLC is the same map and characters as the base game, but allows you to move freely as you wish at the very beginning and score points until you die to try and beat others on the leaderboard. The gameplay is solid and being able to level up characters the way you want is great, as you can make sure every survivor has a designated role to play.My only real complaint is that the base building feels a bit lacking, and I wish that you could choose any building as your base instead of preset locations. Things can get a bit repetitive too when survivors continuously decide to give you missions while you're trying to advance the main story, but dont want negative concequences to happen from ignoring it."

Whilst there are technical hitches, personally these are mostly AI based, the concept and atmosphere of the game itself is solid.  Indeed, it could be said that the world itself, a large valley in small-town America, is the real star of the show:  The world feels authentic and lived-in, with Marie-Celeste-like scenes playing out in the myriad houses, shops and industrial sites that can be scavenged.  The levelling mechanics, whilst simple, help to make each character distinct, and the loss of a highly skilled marksman or doctor can seriously impact the group's survivability.  Character death is permanent:  There are no essential characters, even those with story-relevant content are fair-game, adding to the general tension when leaving your home base.  Whilst the home base mechanics are simple, there is enough variety to aim for a variety of builds with a range of different abilities (why a dining area costs the same amount of resources as a munitions lab, however, eludes me).Overall an extremely fun game, I recommend that you also pick up the Breakdown and Lifeline dlcs for sandbox mode and an alternate storyline from an ""Antagonistic"" perspective."

In a nutshell this a Free-roam rpg zombie game with tons to do, tons to find and load of extras. As the player you get to choose between different survivors to play as, each with their own inventories. Money is instead a reputation amount and is based on what you have contributed to the group of survivors you have gathered. You can make outposts, move your home base and even choose what facilities you want in your home base. YOU have all the choices available to you and in the beginning, the amount of things you have to do can be a bit overwhelming. You can choose to keep morale up or search for more survivors to add to your already limited amount of space. Some facilities require specialists like doctors or scientist so if you dont go out their and horde survivors you wont be able ot utilize your facilities 100%. But if you ignore issues, morale goes down and problems arise. Lets just say it keeps you busy and if this ever goes on sale, GET IT!"

,Not Recommended,241540,9656935,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,"Magic ways, my friends!","I'll be quite frank with you, and explain plain and simple why I won't recommend this to you.Before I start, I made this a negative review because theres too many unfair (Yes) recommendations out there, and I want to give you a balanced view.Button layout - Its pretty much undefined what button is what, it was a WAY to early release and I was stoked, but the button layout can cause major issues, and you'll basically have to keep things in mind (Space = A for instance) while sometimes in the game you only have a mere 3 seconds before your character will die. F^^^ up = F^^^ed up. (Also causing you not to be able to switch games much since god forbid you forget the buttons and play on your character.)The assignments - Oh god, how tremendously terrible this is, your teammates will constantly find themselves into trouble they can't handle, making it ""Big UN's"" to any other special infected (Also a lot of swat soldiers that are VERY EASY to take down) and in reality, you'll find yourself more actually running around trying to ""Be superman for everyone"" than actually making progress in the game.Its a real shame, because it shows how much content is missing. How all of the missing contents, and the ""what could be's"" just become a grinding of saving people, and a punishment if you don't (You can't even ask them to stay put and to just let you do all the work) since it'd cap the games content by 60% and allow you to finish it within a small 2-3 hours.The breakdown - Now really, this sounds and feels like DLC that should've been in this game, sold back to you.The game is already empty, as I wrote above, and even the content being added (I thought they'd give free enhancements given the price) but apperantly for tweaks, and a few very minor additions like replayability, you are charged these days.Without the breakdown this game is kind of worthless, and to be quite fair I bought it hoping there'd be multiplayer in the future, to be dissapointed later on (and really I can't blame them, there's way to less to actually do for multiplayer), and the game wouldnt last longer than 1 hour if you both could do seperate missions.In any case, the breakdown takes away cars, makes infected stronger etc, which is basically the only fun part left in the game.Further the choices you make are poorly designed, don't want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and betray people for instance? Then no special perk for you, Don't want to lie to a guy about his situation? No achievement + no more missions from them.Its just really poorly worked out in every each way, and the only imaginable way I see this able to play is just for a zombie-grind fest, which is pretty fun I guess.Loot - Now here's a fun one. Loot, the loot thats plentiful when you get there, but apperantly after one trip for the large majority dissapears into thin air, literally dissapearing in a way that you'll wonder ""How in the.."" and will cease to exist.Apperantly cars can't be used to transport either (I understand if theres survivors in it, that you can't and that will happen a lot but when theres no one in it theres plenty of space, but apperantly not for loot).Now lastly, the AI is really stupid, and you can easily aim and save a teammate, but I've lost teammates AT A CAMP. Getting grabbed by a big un, and he was unable to shoot and free me, so I guess my character died. Oh and the guy, who tried to kill him died too (Interesting) not even 6 meters away from camp, while you could see the rest of them just sitting inside on benches (I could literally see them not giving a crap about what was going on), making me feel as if the group demands I care for all of the stupid situations they get themselves into, but never to actually HELP YOU when you're a few feet away from camp, in sight and obviously in need of a second gunsman. But then again, who sits without a gun in a zombie apocalypse?Sorry but I'm adding a P.S in this one, about the situations like looting they get themselves into? Even if they loot it'll be shallow like +2 ammunition, never a nice gun, or some rare rounds or anything (which in my opinion is just stupid) and rarely they'll even come home with loot, as I mentioned, why not a ""Stop going out of base and having me pick you up"" button?Just a waste of money, unless you like the grindfest, mixed with buggy controls, maps, AI etc.Buy this low budget when it comes out for 2-3$ and you'll get a few bangs for your bucks I guess, if not; don't bother. Plenty better games to wrap your hands around."

Hope that the developer will continue support and optimize the game to bring a better experience.Another thing is the lack of depth of the game mechanic, too few room choices and available spots for them (especially when you walk into empty rooms in the base when every slots were filled), having injured and tired status is good addition of the game but the lack of human resource management is kind of a downside for the game, like commanding who cook, who maintain weapons in the workshop, who be the doctor and who keep watch. This lower the incentive for player the keep or increase the number of the survivor in his/her base (the base requirement did help a bit but not much). The resources management is acceptable but can use much more work, cars that don't use gas, ammo box only count as trading parts and upgrade resources but not useable for individual character, building facilities were over simply (only gather ""building materials"" rather that collecting planks, wooden beams, tires, tents, 2x4, hammers, drills, saws and all type of furniture.Also, the existing human resource management is not so great, you can switch to any characters within your camp if you make friend with them (by helping them), although it is useful in times how the odd is to leave your character in the middle of no where or the town flooded with zombie and switch to another person expecting he/she will auto come back safely? The game allow small group to form up and gather resources but for some reason only one person can carry the base resources even I got a 2-4 man team. More control of the group is also needed, such as choosing a leader for the survivors or overthrowing one, sending groups out to doing scavenger run or setting activities for people in base.Well the game still has it's upside, the ability to switch to different characters are awesome and the possibility to let a survivor dying on your hand (with all the powers and traits lost) are the good points of this game. Also, the list of weapons melee and firearms are amazing (ammo type also). Although I mentioned a lot of points that the game can improved but State of Decay is a right step (probably the first right step) toward an open world zombie management game that not flooding you with ammo and supplies, or focusing on killing zombie or escaping them, but rather learning to survive with them, how to get through the post apocalyptic condition.For those who like managing base and supplies, fighting zombie and building a survivor group and base, this is the game for you- get it now (if you make it to this line and still not quitted already, GET IT NOW, this is the game for you)P.S the difficulty is too easy (at least for base defend), the lack of combination and ""re-invention"" (like electricity) and the story is so boring (no tension within survivor groups should put this one off a bit to 7-7.5/10."

This universe could be a lot better if it were more like The Walking Dead.Nevertheless, it is a must for any lover of the zombie genre. Entertaining, challenging and interesting, what else could you ask for in a sandbox game?"

Its really fun gathering resources for your dependants back at base, and focuses more on co-operation (albeit with AI) rather than solo ""every-man-for-himself"" type gameplay that other zombie apocalypse games tend to offer. Whilst driving around in your pickup plowing through hordes and hordes of zombies make the zombies a little trivial at times, on foot fighting and navigation makes for a decent challenge. I recommend getting the DLC to get the most out of this game. Once you think you've nailed how the mechanics work and have a solid strategy, Breakdown chews it up, smudges the ink, and hands you back a wet mess, and tells you to try again.The zombies are easy enough to fend off, but can be severly overwhelming if the fight is drawn out too long, and can even give veteran  zombie slayers a run for thier money. Permanent death of a character you have put lots of effort into provides a real sense of loss. Once resources are used they're gone forever, no daily respawning. The game carries on playing while you aren't, and community members can gather supplies, get sick or even die while you aren't at your PC. Even though this is a console port, its not a bang up job like many out there. Sure, there are bugs where zombies that hop over walls sometimes fall through the earth, but what game doesnt have those kind of bugs? The team of Undead Labs seem to have a good head on thier shoulders and are constantly improving this game. Besides, havent you always wanted to hit a zombie in the face with a 2x4?"

,Recommended,241540,13603005,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,GeriatricSix,"Let me just start off by saying that I play console and PC, meaning I've actually had this game on console long before I had it on PC, and that I've also played it vigorously on console, so when you see I have under 20 hours of this on my profile, I've only recently got it on PC, but I've got at least a good 50 -7ish hours on console. Anyways here we go.State of Decay is a true survival-horror zombie game done right. Resources really are limited, once you've cleared out a house and taken all the supplies from it, it stays empty. There are quite a few vehicles to find out in the game world which are also limited. Sure, you could spend the next hour or two running over hordes (I'll be using the horde example a lot since they're one of your greatest threats in the game) in a truck, but once that thing explodes, you can't fix it. This means that you can't exactly go on a good killing rampage (which is kinda good since that's not the point of the game anyways).You really do have to manage your resources, including ammunition, medicine, building supplies, fuel, and food. As I stated earlier, things won't respawn, so you have to choose when moving down a horde with a shotgun is a good time or not, givin that you won't be the only survivor needing those shells. You mmust also manage all those resources when your upgrading your base as well. Say you're running low on building supplies and only have enough for one upgrade/new building... do you want to upgrade the infimiry to help prevent your people from getting the Black Plague and other illnesses, or do you want to make a workshop which not only lets your repair weapons and vehicles, but will later allow you to create suppressors for your weapons and other things as well? You'll have to make many choices with these things in mind as you go through the game.Gameplay is also quite good as well. To put it bluntly, you survive. Sounds exciting, da? Nyet? Fine, here comes your essay you entitled little fuc-Gameplay is pretty fun. As I'll talk about later int the game, you're no super-hero, you're just a person. A person however, with stats and perks. These stats and perks will benefit that character of course. You have stats such as Cardio, Wits, Shooting, and a few other stats I can't recall currently. With cardio, your stamina increases, allowing you dodge more attacks, sprint longer, perform more actions like jumping and climbing longer without getting tired, and most importantly, you can fight with your melee weapons and attacks longer in combat. Stamina is especially useful in combat since it's tied to so many things. If your still fighting a horde with low stamina, your attacks and reflexes  become slower and weaker, making you much more vulnerable. Wits allows you to search areas faster. This is very important when you're out scavenging, that way you can grab what you can and get out faster. And shooting is exactly what it sounds like. But not only will you become more accurate, you'll also reload guns faster too.Now for the perks. ""Perks"" aren't things like ""RAMIREZ, KILL 7 ZOMBIES FOR AN AC-130!"", they're small little positives or negatives. Positives like the ""sharpshooter"" perk, which allows your shooting skills to level up faster or ""swift-hands"" that let's your melee level up faster are small little things that'll have that character slightly in some what. Negavies would be things like ""bum knee"" makes you lose stamina while sneaking or ""a-pack-a-day"" which has your cardio level up slower.Melee combat is what you want ALL of your characters to excel at. Melee is the attack you'll be using most often in this game to help conserve ammo, and not attract the attention of every zombie in a 70 meter radius like a gun would. Basically, you take your melee weapon, and you go crack/slice some heads open. You can also do a normal attack like a kick and push to stun zombies and give you some room. There are also ""executions"" you can do to a zombie by standing over one on the ground and using the execute key to smash their head open with your weapon, knee, or even your boots. Using this same key while sneaking up behind a zombie in stealth mode will allow you to do a sneak attack, instantly and quietly killing them.Stealth is also a large part of the game. At times, running out in the open isn't always the best idea. So I hope your character doesn't have the ""bum knee"" penalty, because you're likely to spend a lot of time crouching around. Not only will you have to stay out of sight, but you also have to be careful about the noise you make too.  Things like crashing through a window will bring you a lot of new ""friends""This game also features permanent death as well, meaning you can't play the super-hero that ""dies"", then respawns at your base. If you take a character out and get ambushed and die, that character stays dead. Thanks to this, you also have to choose your battles more wisely and fallback more on stealth than other zombie games.One word. IMMURSION(probably spelled wrong). You truely do feel like you're out in the country surviving in the apocslypse. Zombies everywhere, town feels like your ""down souf"", weapons feel like they belong there, and the lighting truley does help too. The soundtrack also helps too. The appropriate music always seems to play for whatever you're doing. Nice, comfy music plays when your at the base during daytime upgrading things or just hanging around, a nice ambience plays while you're out exploring, grim, ""darker"" music plays when your in the middle of battle against overwhelming odds. And did I mention the lighting? When the crack of dawn comes forth and you can finally see things clearly without a flashlight, you truely do learn to love daylight. And then there's night. It's dark. I mean dark dark. Not just any kind of dark, I mean, DARK. You don't want to confront groups of zombies in the dark either, since you can barely even see with your flashlight. This makes raiding houses at night seem much cooler, but you'll barely be able to see anything, even with your light on (almost like real life).Now for some cons.1. Zombies enjoy clipping through things such as fences and sometimes the floor of buildings your currently in. While this isn't that bad most of the time, it can become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when fighting special infected like ferals who are very quick and lethal.2. Your AI survivors can be quite lazy, resulting in you having to go out and do most of the work. The other characters do leave to go scavenging as well once in a while, but usually they end up getting into trouble and you have to go save them.3. Your AI survivors are too emotional. Morale is a big part of the game, should it get too low, people start leaving and mutinies can arise. While this might add to the whole ""realistic immursion"" or however it's spelt/said, these kinds of things happen a little to often for my liking. A character will start becoming depressed and start bringing everyone down, you gotta go back to base, take em out for a quick jog somewhere, kill a few zombies, and return home after a brief warning/talking too. While that doesn't sound bad, it becomes annoying quick when only an hour or two after cheering them up, someone at home is mad and making everyone else mad. Then you go through the jog n kill routine again. While not really a game-killing thing, I just found it annoying after a while when there are more important tasks to attend to.4. Vehcles control like your driving on a road of cheap gravy. It's mainly just turning in some of the vehicles I have a problem with.And that's pretty much it for State of Decay.I'd honestly give it a 8/10.Nice, great zombie game with actual resource management, a great, big map to play around in, a ton of weapons with limited ammo that can break, and lotz of zombies to kill and sneak around. Probably one of the best zombie games I've ever played, and I've played a lot of em too."

,Recommended,241540,14704950,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Backy,"So I just recently finally got to playing State of Decay after I really got into the zombie survival style of games, and I really love that this game has me focusing more on getting my entire group the food and supplies it needs, rather than on me finding a new sniper or assault rifle.It falls really short however, in my opinion, on how a lot of the gameplay mechanics work.In the first 10 minutes or so of the game, it has you sneaking around and avoiding contact with the zombies, as your character attempts to figure out what is going on and why they are trying to kill you.This leads the player to the belief that the game is going to be pretty serious, and that contact with zombies spells almost certain death. That's not how the game ends up playing out, and this leads me to believe that they really wanted this game to be taken seriously, as there are a lot more aspects of the game that reflect that idea.Here are some of themSneaking- As it stands, sneaking in the game is very half-baked, even though it's the first mechanic the game actively teaches you. Sneaking is painfully slow and almost never worth the advantage of using the mechanic. Had they made the sneaking mechanic more fleshed out, with a slow crouch and a fast crouch, and made it a more viable option to avoid zombies against just swinging away at them, it would have added a new level of play to the game.Weapon Degrading- It almost feels very out of place in this game, as it doesn't really seem to affect how you go at a group of zombies. There's always a new weapon waiting around a corner somewhere, in a dresser, pretty much anything you can loot will have a blunt object in it to swing at zombies heads, so weapons degrading feels pointless, but seems like it was meant to instill the idea of ""Okay, so there are 10 zeds over there, but my weapon is weak, so i need to find another way around them"" But it just doesn't.Character Debuffs- One of my favorite aspects of the game is the character debuffs. Basically, after you have been out with one character for awhile, that character begins to get tired faster, and has less maximum health, which is fixed by taking that character back to home base and swapping them with another playable character. It adds a cool level of the game where you have one character who is super high level, but you have to switch them out with another survivor because they are too tired to be as effective, so it pays to keep all your survivors trained and leveled up so you're never at a disadvantage.Zombie Hordes- Seeing a zombie horde on the map for the first time is terrifying. You are concerned about the number and what getting spotted will do. Until you get a car and find out that running all of them over is safe, easy, and takes about 10 seconds to kill all of them. One easy fix would be making it so that an entire zombie horde hitting your car always disabled it, and made it unusable, but driving around them is still just as good an option as any. This is really just an issue with the cars in the game, but zombie hordes are a cool idea, that not many games take advantage of, that are just not scary in this game.These things and many other smaller factors lead me to believe that this game wanted to be more realistic, or at least more tense than it ended up being. I still enjoy this game, and it is very good in it's own right, but what it really has done is made me want a game like it, but one that takes itself more seriously. I have few real issues with this game, and most of them are really ""I would rather the did this"" than they are problems, as the game clearly isn't meant to be taken seriously, but I'll list them here real fast anyways.Cars- Cars are not hard to find, there are like 20 in each town in the game, and they are all perfectly fit to drive. Lowering the number of cars, or making it so that you had to make a car work before you could drive it, and adding car maintenance to the game would have helped big time in making this game feel more serious than it is. Cars are the ultimate tool in this game, for running over hordes of zombies, carrying all your♥♥♥♥♥♥ and getting you everywhere (they're way to fast) i'd say half my time spent in this game has been spent in a car.Combat- Combat consists of hitting one button over and over until a zombie falls, then using a finisher. It's very rinse repeat style combat that get's stale extremely fast, and I'd say it's the only issue I have with the game that I think is just bad mechanically. There's no diversity, all zombies are taken down the same way, even the special infected, they could have done better to flesh this out a lot more, and made alternate approaches to combat more viable. It's too easy to kill zombies, so sneaking past them is never a concern.Sneaking- It's in the game. It's slow. It's pointless. The advantage to sneaking in the game isn't worth it when the zombies aren't scary. It makes so much more sense just to mash a single button at them and take them down, than to take the extra 5 minutes or more to sneak past. Not only does the mechanic not make sense, it's also just not well done at all, there is one stance for sneaking, that being crouch, and it's so painfully slow that even if it was viable it would be way to boring to consider. Adding a dynamic cover system, along with sprint-sneaking and regular sneaking. And fleshing out the enemy detection system would make sneaking past hordes of zombies much more tense and viable.Third-Person- Not so much a flaw, as it is an opinion that I disagree with, but I think third-person is the bane of all survival games existence. It's removes the idea of immersion almost entirely, and it takes any level of seriousness this game had away.  Not only can I see over any wall and instantly know whether or not it's safe, but I also don't feel like i'm stepping into the characters shoes so much as I am watching them do things. However this one is entirely just my opinion and certainly not a make or break deal for me.Speed of Gameplay- This game plays way to fast. Battles against hordes last no longer than 30 seconds and getting from one city to another takes maybe a minute. Now I am not saying I want a game that takes half an hour to get from one place to the next, but 3 - 5 minutes travel time from one place to another with landmarks and such on the way and mini-loot spots would be much better for pacing and making the game feel less arcadey.These are all my main issues, and as you can tell by reading them, I don't think hardly any of them are ""bad"" by any means, and I don't think the game is bad, but it would serve future development of Zombies survival games great benefit to make a game similar to this, but tweaking those game mechanics in such a way as to create a realistic, tense, and scary zombie survival game that actually gives you something to care about like State of Decay does so well (that being the community you end up building and the characters.)"
,Recommended,241540,17317560,"Posted: 31 July, 2015",all,Brysk,"Excellent zombie game, and one of the few that actually scares me at times. You really need to assess your situation before you do anything as you can't walk into a group of 10 zombies and massacre them as you can in some other games. You'll often find yourself out of ammo, with 1/4 health and low stamina trying to outrun a horde, and I love that. Scouting for supplies to bring back to your base is rewarding as you never know what you might find, and you can also bring along a few other survivors to help out with carrying them back. Any survivors you find you can play as, so you can experiment with different playstyles easily as each survivor is unique and have different traits. You can also set up new bases at different points around the map, each one with advantages and disadvantages. You can also upgrade your base to include things like greenhouses and hospitals which is quite fun.The graphics are a little dated, but there are a few easy to install mods on the State of Decay Nexus page to make it look real pretty. If you want a more down to earth, realistic zombie experience then I would highly recommend this game."

I loved several things about this game, but also hated some parts of it. Review below!THINGS I LOVE:1. The Open World. There is a linear storyline but you aren't forced into playing it. Almost every building you encounter is explorable and has cabinets and such that have to be searched in order to obtain supplies.2. Bases. Your home base is where you'll return supplies you've scavenged. You can build your base to include commodities such as more sleeping space, a garden for more food upkeep, a library, a workshop, etc. Certain combinations of things you build in your base will be beneficial to you ingame. For example, you can upgrade your garden to a greenhouse and if you have a survivor who is good at farming, you will have more rations of food per day. This concept is probably one of my most favorite of the game because you can clearly see how much thought was put into it. You can also move home bases, which you will end up doing as you progress through the story.3. Weapons. There are a variety of melee weapons and guns in the game that can be obtained and used by your survivors. You'll see early on that melee weapons are the best way to go because guns make noise even if there is a silencer on them, and noise will attract zombies. Weapons, if overused, will break, which I think was a pretty cool mechanic that the Devs put in to encourage players to play other survivors. Also, to add to that, if you play a survivor for too long, he/she will get tired and will receive penalties to their max stamina. Again, a way to encourage players to play other survivors.4. Outposts. Outposts are essentially a small safe zone where you can resupply if needed. They save A LOT of time and are a life saver if you're in need of supplies such as meds to keep your health and stamina alive and well. They also are equipped with traps that destroy passing hordes of zombies. If you use your outposts wisely, you can create a shield of protection from zombie hordes that will make your life much easier.5. Zombies. In my honest opinion, the game is at perfect difficulty for me, although that will differ depending on how you like to play your games. Normal zombies are easy to defeat with melee weapons or guns. However, it is easy to get overwhelmed by them if you are by yourself. There are other types of zombies, called ""freaks"", similar to special zombies in the L4D series. They are much harder to defeat and require a certain degree of strategy in order to defeat them. I learned early on not to mess with juggernaut zombies in melee combat... Besides types of zombies, a cool mechanic that I enjoyed in the game was the fact that zombies get attracted to noise. This means that it's difficult to really go anywhere in a car without having to fight zombies. Whenever you break through a door, a window, fire a gun, etc. zombies will show up.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:1. Glitches. Although this game was a lot of fun, it is quite glitchy at times. Don't expect it to be a highly polished game if that's what you're in to.2. AI. I really hope AI gets improved with this game eventually. It is terrible. Both zombies and survivors. Just horrendous.3. Repetitive buildings. Despite almost every building being explorable, it does get repetitive after a while. Searchable cabinets, cupboards, desks, etc. become predictable. The items you recover also become predictable. Kinda wish they would switch things up a bit somehow.4. Car handling. This is more of a personal preference. The car handling in this game is really arcade-like, which I don't really like. But like I said, it's preference. When I first started playing, I could barely handle a car without veering off the road and hitting something.5. Repetitive events. After a while, random events that Lily brings up over the radio get boring because you know exactly how to complete them. Sure, the first time you play these random events will be loads of fun and a new experience, but again, they just get boring.And there you have it. My pros and cons list of State of Decay. Overall, I think it's a great game with LOADS of potential. Undead Labs has announced that they see a bright future for the game, so I'm not too worried about Devs not improving it. In conclusion, It's definitely a fun game with loads of features, but will unfortunately get repetitive at times."

Setting up a base, dealing with group dynamics, scavenging for ammo, dealing with hordes, and having your characters die permanently is all great stuff. It's great until you realize how easily handed hordes are, how little effort it takes to deal with a group (none, really), how abundant ammo and other resources are, and how easy it is to keep characters alive (eventually you'll have so many skilled characters it doesn't matter if you lose one once in awhile, anyway).And you'll realize all of this within a couple of hours.Which means there's not much to the game except the story missions. Which is bad news, because the story missions suck and the story sucks. Nor are the core game mechanics anything interesting. The promise of the game comes from all the aforementioned stuff, which amounts to a big pile of fluffy zombie flavored nothing.I didn't hate the time I spent with State of Decay, but I didn't love it, aside from a couple of hours at the start. It was a decent way to waste 15 hours when I didn't have anything better to play.

A big variety of melee and ranged weapons [ my own favorites, the sledgehammer and the M-14 ].Also, a unique map-finding of your immediate region using a high point, tower, or big hill, in order to expose both enemies, as well as potential looting sites. Vehicles, a must to get around the world when missions taken you well out of town. They run from a '64-looking Chevy pickup, to a souped-Mustang version[ as always, speed is linked to manourability].A solid thumbs up.."

There is also an issue were I personaly get huge framerate drops and i shouldnt be doing the issue of crash to do with Save dumps and a full PC nukeing framerate drop that dosent allow me to alt tab freaks my pc out for about a munute and bluescreens.  Yet i found no reason why this is happening my pc is capable of running the gameThough the good points ya get a fantastic gameplay experience when the game is working to par both challenging and fun for those who enjoy maneging a safezone so definetly buy it its worth it dispite its many bugs the game is updated regulary and they seem to fix bugs to do with AI and some minor crash causers.  So overall the game is great and the crashes have decreased over time but they still happen gameplay is fun but i do feel the overall lack of options is a little disapointing though im not expecting much from an Xbox cross over game hopefuly they will add more in the future

And it even does a nice offline simulation thing, telling you what happened while you were away from the game!Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.Some great voice acting from an unknown cast as well.

After reading some reviews on it, I decided to buy it - and haven't regretted that decision.The game itself features a step into a genre of gaming not commonly seen these days. You start off as Marcus Campbell, with his friend Ed, and gradually grow into a thriving community of survivors. With a lovely perma-death system put into place, you can see how characters react in a zombie infestation to the death of friends and family.I personally love the ability to do supply runs into towns, farms and derelict buildings. It gives the game a sense of urgency. Eventually, it'll all run out, but my survivors will do their best to keep on surviving.

,Recommended,241540,16222415,"Posted: 6 June, 2015",all,Steph,"To be honest, ont of the best zombie survival games I've played. I've played Project Zomboid, 7 Days to Die, How to Survive, and many more, but from a personal preference, this game captures most, if not all, aspects that I think a decent zombie survival needs to have.Pros:- Scavenging. Quite realistic, with noise, carry weight, and placing loot rucksacks in your vehicle. The car inventories can best be tweaked with a mod since a sports sedan has the same inventory as a pickup, but hey, nothing is perfect.- Base building. Enough options to choose from, enough research if you choose the library. This eventually gets mitigated by the sheer size of one of the bases since you can build one of almost all buildings, but keeps the fun flowing nonetheless.- Stamina and health. Not too much but also not too little of both, and after either exploring too much with one character, or taking too much damage, it temporarily decreases until he/she is either healed or rested.- Character switching. Building from the stamina/health system, this mechanic makes you want to switch out, explore with someone else, and build someone else's skills. The survivor permadeath is also nice, as much as I hate permadeath in other games. Makes you want to be careful with your best people.- Searching for things other than loot. Survivors, other types of zombies to kill, vehicles. Asking in your base to radio for survivors, then saving them and taking them in (thus also making them playable shortly after) is quite nice.- Item durability. As much as unbreakable items are fun, the durability for most if not all items in this game is balanced. And if you want something repaired, you just leave in the stash for a day.- Almost forgot, controller support. Seeing the fact I played this on my 360 as well sometime, the controller support is exactly the same and I actually recommend using one. Keyboard/mouse is well-done, but controller feels a little better due to this 'technically' being a 3rd person hack-n-slash of sorts. Very well suited for a controller in any case.Cons:- Vehicle damage. 2-3 hordes of zombies will wreck your vehicle. In real life, I think you could hit quite some more people/zombies before your vehicle will start to take a hint that breaking down is nigh. This does make searching for new vehicles necessary while your own ones get repaired at base (if you have a workshop)- Rather short story, to be honest. I did scavenge quite a lot in between missions, but if you consider all the 'arcs' in this game, it may take you only 10-15 hours to finish it. It's not really necessary to scavenge too much or look for awesome weapons, the whole game is finishable with just some melee weapons and skills. I haven't played any DLC's yet, but the base game is rather short. The ending is also quite... short-lived.- Continuous survivor complaints. Sometimes it really feels like you have to babysit everyone because they're feeling sad, depressed, lonely, angry, whatever. And you always do exactly the same thing: kill some zombies a couple blocks out. Doesn't matter what the individual in question is feeling, you always go to kill zombies to dumb that feeling down.- No co-op. This would really give this game a lot more bang for it's buck, because nothing is more fun than killing hordes of undead with friends. Or at least one friend. I heard plans for co-op once existed, but they sadly got cancelled.Overal: still one of the best I've played in this genre. I really hope someone out there can make a multiplayer/co-op mod tho, it would really give me dozens of extra hours in this."

Those being:-Building and managing your base (you can change between several different locations ,attract survivors,build stuff,create outposts...)-scavenging for supplies while avoiding to get overrun by too many zeds or tiring out your characters-keeping your ""crew"" in check (essentially the people who live in your base,different personalities which can often clash and require you to take actions...)-dealing with all sorts of  problems and randomly generated missions and infestations-Permadeath. (no,this doesn't mean you'll have to restart if one of your survivors dies,stop whining! :3) Wounds may take ages to heal and if your survivors get some,it's because you screwed up. This is essential for zombie survival games and has nothing to do with ""roguelike"". You can recover from mistakes and find more survivors,but if you screw up too often and charge into too difficult situations you will probably have to restart. This is good. Also,playthroughs won't be the same,because:-Random generation of all sorts of things: quests,survivors,personalities,locations of loot,loot tables,zombie hordes,infestations...-Visceral,brutal combat: It's satisfying to smack the brains out of zeds,and that's what you'll be doing. Finishing moves that are absolutely devastating, each blow has a weight to it that can knock zeds around and down and stagger them or blow their bodyparts to pieces (detachable bodyparts similar to Dead Island). you can ""combo"" up different swings,grapple,kick and shove zeds around and unlock moves like legsweeps.-RPG elements that don't feel too ""magical"". You'll improve cardio,weapon skills with different weapon types,leadership skills and so on as you play and unlock moves and ""traits"" that don't feel out of place. (you won't be getting fireballs and lmgs that don't use up ammo every 3rd shot or something stupid like that,but moves and traits that actually make sense)-Different breakable,non-respawning vehicles. If you waste too many cars you won't have any more cars. Driving over zeds also feels as satisfying as the melee combat,they can grapple on to your car and will try to get in and eat your brains out,so a car isn't a safezone or tank.There's so much more that I could talk about here,but what it boils down to is: this is an amazing zombie survival game for a ridiculously low price for the amount of content and quality you'll be getting.

(free of spoilers)1) Storyline interference from regular gameplay.2) No local saves make choices TOO permanent.3) Story seems to go from slow to over.4) It definitely has upsides if you enjoy killing zombies like Raid kills roaches...1) One big problem with this game is that they keep sending you on missions to find/help/bail out people from your survivor group while you should be doing storyline missions. This causes a problem in certain parts because people can be killed if you don't bail them out, but your storyline could be affected as well. I get that this is what adds a bit of realism and difficulty to the game, but on my first time through, I didn't know this, and had to start over after about 8 hours of gameplay!!!2) Oh, and the reason I had to start over is due to cloud-based game saves. There is very little experimentation you can do with your characters and story unless you plan to play through at least a second time. If your main character dies, oh well. They stick you with one of the other survivors. If you want to try guns for awhile and think that a specialization might help, but find out you hate it, oh well! It just makes the game a bit more frustrating, because you can get overrun in a heartbeat if you aren't 100% focused on every detail when you play. Oh, and don't stay away for too long or your group can all get sick and die!3) There is a chance it was the way I played through it. I just know that you have to meet up with a group of survivors. You have to nurture them, because you become their leader in a matter of, well you just are. When you first start, you only have a couple people, so at some point you might have to stop if everyone is tired or hurt. Later. if you're good at swapping back and forth when they do get hurt or tired and use them all to round characters out, you take them from being a rag-tag bunch of malcontents to a well oiled machine in nothing flat. Now the problem with this is that you start getting to the point of efficiency. This means you can run around and collects supplies WHILE doing story mission. So when you get to this point you start blowing through missions like they didn't even affect you. And next thing you know, you're doing 4 story missions in an hour and well... Done. Sure, that's where DLC comes in, but I told myself ""oh, lets do one more mission."" And the game said ""here's your final mission."" At least I was right.4) However, they have roaming zombie hoards wandering the streets. Hotwire the nearest car and run them down! Need to take out frustrations? Baseball bat to the zombieskull works wonders! Oh, and when you finally get far enough to get an assault rifle? DONE. Sure you can break weapons and cars, and run out of ammo for guns... But then you just go wander and raid for some more and start the zombiecide all over again!"

Gets swarmed, diesDriving? Going 20 mph seems to make your car hop after hitting every decline on hills, couple this with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ airborne jet physics (get airborne and turn either left or right in air and you will see) and cars become a massive hinderance.  If you hit a bump while turning, may god have mercy on your players virtual soul because this game wont. It seems to forcefully eject you from the spinning car (because you know, hitting pavement at terminal velocity is a far better choice to the AI then waiting and carefully crawling out of the wreck. If you manage not to fall a large distance (either from flnging you off a bridge or in my case a highway) or somehow make it out alive, good luck getting all those things roger mcfirsttodie collected, because anytime, no matter what the circumstance, the car detonates with the fury of a thousand latinos.Speaking of roger mcfirsttodie, this game makes it hard as all hell to actually go off on your own, which is cool, it is hard, it should be hard. so you grab an AI guy. now, this AI does all of the following.Gets stuck on invisible wallsmoves sometimesswings a toothpickdies horribly.they cant carry rucksacks, they cant drive (dear god that would be a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyway). they cant seem to do anything on their own (in base they would be as skilled as the offspring of rambo, mcgyver and james bond) but as soon as they need to step five feet outside to pick something up. They die, so anytime you get the ability to call in for a pick up, dont, just make it easier on yourself and your AI brethren and put a bullet in them.Also, I know this was a big thing when I first played (I could only put up with an hour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the main game and only played lifeline, although everything except for one problem still exsisted) was that stuff would happen while your offline.Meaning you could build this amazing base with the best people, and the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥hat of a sherif could execute every. single. person. just because he sneezed. Or in my case, send out eight people on a scavanger run and have them all die, then send more out to collect the stuff from the dead allies just to have them die more.Now, with the combat, the worst thing about this game, is that whenever you seem to be attacked. the camera decides that you need to see what nostril is stuffed up the most and not the zombie that made slight contact with you and now has teleported behind you, putting you in a master lock chokehold.  Melee and meh, its only good if its just 1v1, which will never happen, so guns, guns and ammo, and how you procure comes to ANOTHER PROBLEMinfluence, because ♥♥♥♥ you and your hard work.whats that? you found a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of weapons and ammo for the base, too bad you will never use it because influence is a spending thing (sort of like currency but harder to get, harder to maintain, and worth less) whats that? you saved that guys life and now need him for a mission? too bad son that will cost you about 200 influence.  Whats that? need ammo because guns are really the only thing that can save you (besides stealth but just wait, there is stuff on that_) thats going to be about 5 influence per bullet. Doesnt sound too bad, untill you realize how much you get for missions. or general supply drop offs, because after doing 10 or 15, you have the choice of refilling your ammo, or getting a follower. The twist? you need both to live.But why use bullets when there is stealth?because all the missions require boots on the ground zombie asskicking.as for the free roam stealth it up,unless you need to enter a buildingmove mass quantities of stuffmove far distances.really move at all.now, lifeline, I like it, it puts the ""military is at its end we are only people but goddamn are we not giving up"" feel.the good? it made influence more managable. granted the air supplies you order is ♥♥♥♥ing redundant because you need to pay influence to get it, then even more to use the items, but eh, its cheaper then the main game and it actually gives you chances to get good amounts of influence.the cons of lifeline.every. ♥♥♥♥ing. thing. and more.the reasons listed are the reasons why I cant play this game, because I cant actually play it, When the game is so flawed to where you cannot do the basic things needed for simple objectives (ie. move to this spot, but wait, your character got stuck in a five foot space between cars) Its not a game, its just a POS that takes money.I still hope that eventually they will fix these listed flaws and if we are all lucky, like extremely lucky, like jesus came down to earth and defended all of the christains, christain lucky, all the other non listed flaws, this game would be a gem."

,Recommended,241540,16244391,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,Ulysses,"(NO SPOILERS LISTED)A very fun game, with glaring issues, but still a lot of fun. First off before we say anything else, don't buy Lifeline, please don't.So the base game starts off pretty bad putting you into a world without explanation and not teaching you the actual drive of the game. The game succeeds in a lot of departments.Tower Defense like fun: You are in charge of your own base, you provide supplies for it along with your other survivors and defend it. The Sieges in Lifeline would have been great fun in the base game, too bad Lifeline sucked.Borderlands style character upgrades and guns: You start off the game finding very primitive arms like wood planks or basic .357 revolvers and pistols. By the end of the game who knows what you'll have? I ended up with a stash of Military equitment including Submachine guns like the Suppressed Uzi and assualt rifles like the AK-47 and M4. Aquiring character upgrades involves using the same character for a while and eventually you really form a bond with said character.One time I was playing as my favourite character Maya as I was playing as her (Completely maxed out everything with special abilities and the best gear around) got jumped by a hoard of zombies. I ran and ran as fast as I could and used up all my medicine then I got pushed into a revene by a zombie and barely survived with a sliver of health. It was pitch black with zombies coming and scaling down the cliff on both sides of me. I held them off for a while and killed around 15 if I remember correctly before I finally escaped through the other end of the revene. She survived and I'm still playing as her as I write this.Combat is great: The combat is just a ton of fun in a game like Assassins Creed where you just mash buttons you can actually do some really cool stuff like jumping over one enemy then doing a roundhouse kick and executing them both with a mine or something like that.Story keeps you going: As you explore the sandbox of the world there is constantly things going on back home with people becoming ill, getting angry (Although this starts to feel like filler after a while) and arguments being sparked. Very fun engaging story also with characters that you really will get involved in.Gripes with the games: Infestations are pretty annoying and randomly pop up (Bunch of zombies taking over an area). There is also a major gripe that kinda put me off the game at times. The zombies don't stop spawning, you will spend a few minutes clearing out an area killing all of these zombies using up magazines of ammunition while you already know they will be there again within around 30 seconds of not being in the same area. Also Lifeline has some massive game breaking bugs, Sieges which I mentioned earlier are always unfair while half of your squad is sitting around with there thumbs up there collective asses, Danger Zones (Never ending zombie hell holes) lock out half of the map becuase the devs were to lazy to complete it. Zero locations to loot really and even when you can loot it's usually useless because you'll be killed on the way back by a bloater jumping in front of your car (lol). The DLC is worth the price I payed for it during the Steam Sale (Got the full game with DLC for $8 damn fine deal) so If you can find it for around that then maybe its worth the price It's up to you.Verdict: 8.8/10+Fun Combat+Awesome characters+Unique weapons+Sandbox+Tower Defense-Zombies are always coming back-Pop ins occasionally-FPS drops"

First off the melee weapons are ridiculously fragile, after a few zomibes they are damanged and it takes hours of real time to get them repaired. the guns feel anemic and they attract more zombies making them useless even with the suppresors.Zombies spawn in weird places, I was once attacked by like 6 coming from a cleared room with only one door and no windows. This makes the mission really random in difficulty as hordes can and do spawn in mission areas. The difficulty is increased by the stupid auto save feature which makes the death of a favorite character either permanent or a complete restart. Also a bad decission can cripple your group and you have to restart the entire game from the begining, which means redoing the turtorial in the begining which is not skippable. Also a minor nitpick, but you cant skip the intro animations.The game forces you to play other survirors, and you cant make your own. I actually liked the main character Marcus, but I rarely got to play him because he was always tired and/or injured or stuck doing some random mission on his own. I was left with scubs who sucked and I could care less about. The player inventory is also super small and you can't carry very much, which makes scavanging tedious as you have to return numerous times to get the items you want.The controls were designed for I'm guessing a 360 controler, but they are sloppy and strange on the keyboard. Its hard to judge the distance for a steath kill, more than half the time I just eneded up pushing the zombies. I really disliked the thrown weapons. They seem to go out a set distance regardless of the throwing angle and I guess with practice I could get it down but I am already done with this game. Also I threw a molotov through a juggernaught and it exploded behind him, setting an ally on fire who was behind a wall."
,Recommended,241540,11936665,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,Memebot,"Arguably the most complete zombie survival game yet in existence - with an emphasis on actual survival. Like a swarm of vermin aboard a sinking ship, one's party hopes to get while the going is good. Only problem is that this requires a bunch of steps along the way - shambles, if you'll allow me - which invite death. That first statement is something of a pickle though, because my understanding is that this is the first module of a series of modules that scale complexity and sheer size of this apocalyptic world toward the end of a large or massively multiplayer zombie survival game.This isn't the most lethal game, but when characters do die, they're done for. No spells of resurrection or other deus ex machina linger at the fringes of this virtual world to allow characters another shot at hacking it out in a world gone awry. Of course, the player always has another shot, because characters also suffer from exhaustion and medical ailments which can hinder their performance substantially. The player is therefore allowed the substantial ability of hopping between characters in one's group. The game is optimized for the current level of lethality if one wants a moderately difficult rather than ball-crushing and punishingly difficult experience. There are mods which make characters die easier, and while these add some realism, player be warned: it will likely suck the player into a sort of quasi-stealth tedium where one spends most of their time crouched and scurrying from brush to obstacle to hide from the sight of intermittent random hordes and stragglers and running for dear life or immediately resorting to expending all on-hand ammunition if one's cover is blown. Melee combat is slow and sloppy, which means that more lethal zombies which retain the same pace as the default zombies are impossible to engage in groups larger than two. In the default game, as a seasoned player it's likely that one takes occasional damage while dispatching small groups of zombies by means of melee weapons. Imagine the horror if those zombies can now effectively kill your character in three swipes.Generally decent graphics and animations with some collision detection issues. Some of the textures are relatively good while others are essentially garbage, but they're generally handled well, where the garbage textures are those the player is least likely to see. Keep in mind that this is a slightly enhanced version of the XBox Live Arcade version of the game as well, so its limitations are that of the console it was designed for. The particle effects, blood, and gore are all handled well without bogging down resources or approaching a cartoonish level.Managing one's group of virtual survivors is a relatively simply if repetitive affair, as one might expect. It involves copious amounts of resource scavenging and occasional errands for the sake of plot or characters. Random events cause illness or low morale to spread. As of the last time I played this, AI characters go out on random missions to deal with troublesome zombies but you cannot remotely order them around on scavenging runs. They did add carrying capacity to some (most?) vehicles, allowing a player on a long scavenging run to offload gear and supplies into the vehicle and then return to base, vastly improving amount a player can do on a single run. The AI are not completely useless, however, and serve some utility as companions recruited for influence (the 'currency' one uses) or as stalwart defenders of the homestead. Item variety is pretty damned good in terms of accessories, firearms, and melee weapons. Ammunition types are understandably simplified and it would be best if going forward they keep the complexity along the current lines rather than expanding it a terrible lot. This is not, after all, a simulation-style game, and it should not try to uphold the pretenses thereof.The soundtrack seems somewhat short, but that's an afterthought to me. I prefer actual music to video game music. Otherwise, the sounds are generally satisfactory but not particularly memorable or amazing (their budgetary priorities probably lie elsewhere, considering the sums one can dump in high quality audio). At the least, heads are smashed with decent squishiness and gunshots do not suffer pop gun syndrome so common in games and other media developed by people unaccustomed to the real phenomenon of gun fire which involves loud percussive waves.If one wants a zombie survival game, for now look no further than this. As of 2014, this is the pinnacle of survival qua survival."

The core of State of Decay is that death isn't the end. Your character can die, and when he or she does, you'll just take over the next character in your group. No game overs, except for the character you were controlling.State of Decay isn't about spectacular action sequences, or big explosions with realistic lighting, it's about getting to know your characters, building a relationship with them, developing their skills and abilities, and then sending them out to scavenge, knowing they might not come back. Every scavenging run, every mission you undertake, becomes a careful choice you have to make, because save scumming won't save you. The game immediately and constantly saves, so you can't just quickload when someone dies - you are playing for keeps.Add a fun base building aspect to it, with characters in the group having their own needs and problems, and you have a zombie sandbox game that'll keep you chained to the screen for many hours. If you want fast-and-furious zombie shooting action, then this game isn't for you.

Why's that?State of Decay reminds me of a zombie mod (or rather, a combination of mods) during my days of Fallout 3. I'd be an adventurer in the wastelands, going on patrols to search for people to rescue to expand my party. We'll end the days hunt back at base where I would sit back, relax and let my NPCs do the work of defending the base from zombie attacks.State of Decay works like that. You start off with a bunch of survivors, find a safe house or join a community in which you can call your ""home base"", walk around the area and start looting for stuff. It's like a Single Player verison of DayZ. Once you've joined a community or establish some friends, you'll have to work to make the area a safer / better place.The story for this game is really lienar and doesn't have much of an impact. It's just your typical zombie nightmare come true scenario which half a billion zombie games have came up with.What's interesting about the game would be it's resource management. Apart from food, ammo, medication, supplies and fuel resources to manage, you'll also need to manage the people in your community as well. Someone in your community is sick? You'll have to build a Medical Lab or mercy kill the person (if you don't want her / him to turn into a zombie and turn on you). You'll occasionally find yourself going out into zombie-land to search for people that have gone missing in your community. Allies can be gained through several side quests which build up a level of ""trust"" between your community and theirs. Once you've reached the max level of trust (in Breakdown DLC anyway), you'll be able to recruit the other community into yours--thus expanding the amount of people you can use to build facilities / send out on missions for your own community.The stamina / health system this game implements forces you to switch between your heroes frequently. Say you like this certain army girl that has perfect rifle skills and can kick♥♥♥♥♥at the same time--you won't be able to use her all the time. Upon exploration, your character will get fatigued or injured giving him or her one of several status conditions (such as tired, injured, sick etc). These status conditions won't go away till you go back home, switch out the character for another one in your community and let the latter rest for a while.The music in the game isn't THAT memorable, but it has a certain homely atmosphere especially when your character is back at home base. Certain weapons give off a satisfying ""TWACK"" sound when engaging Zeds (the game's term for Zombies) while others feel as if your character just hit a Zed with a wet piece of toilet paper.The game uses both in game timing and real world timing. Every hour in the real world gives the game a Day/Night cycle per hour. Night time is a completely different ball game compared with the day since it encourages more stealth and the usage of the torchlight to look about. The game also changes when you're NOT playing, meaning you can boot it up after a week of not playing to discover that your community's moral has sunk to rock bottom due to lack of food.I haven't seen any major game killing glitches so far (10 hours sunk into the game), but you'll see a few visual glitches here and there. None of them affect the gameplay very much (if not, at all).All in all, State of Decay is a fun open world zombie adventure game in which Zombie fans would love to pick up. And for a base price of $19.99 (As of 6/22/14), it can crave your thirst for zombie games till you've saved up enough money for DayZ, or for DayZ to have a price drop."

[spoiler free]Once upon a time, in a forest far far away. There were two redshirts, who magically plopped into a campsite with no reason to be there.Generic redshirt one was very good at leadership!Generic redshirt two was very good at...well...nothing.Generic redshirt one and two both stumbled upon a small campsite, however the campsite had been designed and developed by the Call of Duty school of object interaction. And therefore redshirt one could only take items fromBRIGHT AND PULSING ILLUMINATED PILES OR OBJECTS, redshirt one and two blissfully walked past the obvious packets of food around the barbecue as well as the backpacks laying around.Later they stumbled upon a park ranger station where they met many other redshirts, all who were as clueless and redshirted as them. They were then guided to a gunshot in the distance, where they recruited redshirt three. They all joyfully hopped back to the ranger station and found their fellow redshirts had lived up to their names and died.They all decided to leave on a suspiciously empty road that covered a good quarter of the map. Entering an American sedan with wood exterior. There was enough of them to turn on the radio to ""what is love"" and nod their heads in unison. But they didn't.After a while Redshirt one, two and three found another group, full of more redshirts. They were all sent on varying missions, taking it in turns to go out into the towns nearby and eventually as their kill count increased they began to become less redshirt-ish.I finally had a Picard, a Data and a Seven-of-nine.**The rest I never bothered with, my 3 main character choices were enough to keep me going for the whole gameThe rest of the group just sat about, complaining and taking resources while each of my characters in turn broke their backs bringing back mountains of supplies in their trucks each run.Aside from each character starting out a redshirt, there is no customization. So you are dumped with what are basically blank slates with a smiley face drawn on. Hell, where can I make my own face with a smiley face on?Maybe I would become more attached to my character and actually care if they got seriously wounded or sick?Soon after my band of redshirts moved to a bigger location, where was like the old location but I kept getting harassed to move by a fellow redshirt****State of Decay tries to make this atmosphere of ""you are doomed, panic!"". But it never fully achieves this. One example was when my group had one day of food left, everyone was panicking and harassing me about it. I casually walked across the street, found a rucksack of food from a store and walked back...Crisis averted in less than 2 hours in game, about 30 minutes in real time.Speaking of which, the majority of work you do in this game is simply busywork. It is ""go here"" ""help this guy"" ""look here"" etc. If you don't pull time out of the important stuff you are doing and go help this one guy in a group you never talk to then they will be angry when they return.I had to refuse a quest from a fellow redshirt because I was too busy to follow up on hunting a mutated zombie, since I was more concerned about starving to death. Naturally did the logical thing and decided we were no longer friends, simply telling me to ""get lost"" every time I went near them.******It is a lose-lose scenario where you grip and control slowly slips away and you can't do anything to stop it. It quickly becomes frustrating.Eventually all my redshirts survived, with only a few scripted deaths along the wayHooray and suchConclusionIn essence State of Decay isn't a game I would call ""bad"" or ""poor"", but more ""rough"". It has plenty of problems such as the logic behind the world it shows you. One NPC was talking about rioting in the streets and looting, yet in this town I could only count 4 looted buildings out of around 50. Many of them were untouched.Great attention to detail has been made for this game, if you are sprinting towards a window and press the action button ""E"", you will throw yourself out of the window to safety. Also the scavenging system is quite unique because you can ""rush"" a scavenge and make more noise, or maybe create a lot of noise that will draw zombies from everywhere to your location, a good risk-reward system in my opinion.There is no casual dialogue with anyone unless they have a mission, which combined with the lack of character customization makes the game quite shallow.However characters do comment on things such as zombies flanking you or meeting some NPCS.The skills are done D&D style. The more you use them, the better they get.After a while you can pick additional perks to enhance your combat ability. However many of these special moves require the use of the left shift/left control + another key, which you can imagine is very difficult on a keyboard. I strongly advise using a controller.As I said. Rough. But not bad. Get it on sale"

76561197966631960,Recommended,241540,8282111,"Posted: 25 December, 2013",all,TrollerCon,"A 3rd person game that scratches the itch of playing a more action intensive ""The Walking Dead"" (the current TellTale games for TWD are incredible though).  Whereas the TellTale games focus on telling a story and mixing in moments of action, State of Decay focuses on action and mixes in enough story to keep things moving.  The story in State of Decay is pretty darn good!The game starts off with you controlling a specific character.  It doesn't take long before you can toggle between characters and head off into the Zed filled abyss.  You do have to earn the trust of any character before you can play as that character.  There's enough story to keep a game like this moving with purpose, yet the game is built to allow you choose not to pursue the storyline.  Randomly generated missions can keep you entertained, while you move your nomadic tribe around to different temporary homes (main base).  Only a limited number of buildings can be converted to be your main base.  Very briefly let me say - this is not a lone wolf style game.  You may go off and handle certain things ""on your own"", but this game is intended for you play as part of a surviving, nomadic group.You can upgrade your main base to increase your defensive posture against incoming Zed hordes.  Maybe you want to increase your storage capacity so you can hold more food, medicine, ammo, or construction materials.  Perhaps you want to integrate a workshop to build home made weapon attachments...and even allow for repairs to the limited number of vehicles that exist in game.  There are enough options to warrant multiple playthroughs, and there are enough NPCs with special skills that you can recruit along the way to help you towards whatever goal you have in mind for your base.You may have limited options when choosing to move your main base, but those options broaden when you start considering which buildings you wish to use for an outpost.  Outposts add a powerful advantage to your surviving group (no...you don't get Daryl).  Outposts allow you to build mines\traps.  You don't actually physically walk around and setup the traps.  Instead you spend some Influence and hit a button.  And...WHAMO!  The next time a horde is tracking through the nearby area.  BOOM.  A very nice feature to have.Influence is a type of in game currency that is earned through actions that positively benefit your group.  It can degrade over time if left unused.  The Influence system works for the game very well.  It is very fun to break into homes, clear out Zeds, and take all the supplies back to base.  And when you deposit the extra supplies into your base's stash you gain Influence.  The developers did well to make sure earning Influence feels fun!Fighting Zeds is fun, particularly melee.  Gunplay can be effective, but aim for the head and use a suppressor to reduce the chances of attracting more Zeds due to the noise.  Targeting can be a challenge.  Just because you've lined up the targeting reticule does not mean you are going to hit that exact spot.  Through the building of your character, unlocking special moves & improving gun play accuracy can make encounters very satisfying.  Fighting can quickly drain your stamina.  Without stamina you cannot run and you cannot effectively fight.  You can increase your stamina cap over time.  You can also increase your proficiency with melee combat, which will assist by making your stamina decrease at a slower rate when in combat.  Still...I find it mildly annoying at the small amount of fighting that can generally be handled at any given time.  The developers would tend to agree, as they have worked in a system where you can spend Influence and ask a fellow survivor (who trusts you) to accompany you on missions.  THIS IS VERY USEFUL!I have many hours playing this game on the Xbox 360 before it was very handily ported over to the PC.  Button mapping is available, as is full controller support.  I have not yet played the Breakdown DLC.  I have not completed the game's storyline.  I recommend this game to those who can handle mature dialog, blood, and violence.  Parents, make sure you check out some YouTube footage before letting your child play this game.Review also atwww.blog.trollercon.com"

I'd say the most exciting moments in it are not as good as the best moments in Dead Island or Left 4 Dead 2, but the whole base building and team management thing is a great spin on this genre that makes it different from either of those two games.  I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.

When i came back to the game I was slaughtered instantly by a zombie I had no idea existed. I restarted the game and funnily enough when i left the church without quitting I had only basic zombies and I was able to make some progress.The gameplay is nothing amazing and thats the reason why I went off it. It's hit a zombie till he falls then smash his head off with your special. Looting is based more on if you can be bothered to wait or fight a horde of zombies with the chance of making a loud noise by doing it faster. And the AI... Well it's not the worst but don't expect anything outstanding.I'll give it to them that the Dev's are great but I could not get on with this. Only thing that could have made this game is Online Co-op. But Microsoft screwed them over for that.

I actually remembered there was a rumour that SoD was gonna get a multiplayer but it got cancelled.

I would like the closets/containers to continue flashing even after you explore them, just so that I know where they are when I come back to them later.  The playtime for one game can be anywhere from a few hours to forty plus, depending on whether or not you ignore the missions (much like “Fallout 3″).  The passing of time while offline can be annoying as some resources are used heavily and automatically from day to day, but the game won’t penalize you too much for being away for long periods of time.

Simply play State of Decay and then a decent FPS/TPS and you'll feel a tangible difference that's difficult to describe. Next up is the combat, which fulfills a barrier to the game's mission progression. Very quickly you'll realize zombies aren't fun or enjoyable to fight, as they waste time. Swinging with an axe or blunt weapon feels insubstantital and worthless, and you're better off getting in your car and running over any mob that way. Driving is an issue if only because THERE IS TOO MUCH DRIVING. The developers saw fit to place each sequential mission at disparate sections of the game's map, creating a stunted campaign progression that I personally tired of. The game feels the need to give you hint pop ups incessantly...in the middle of action, it will once again proclaim ""You are encumbered!"" Yes, I realize that - do you notice the horde of ♥♥♥♥wads I'm currently engaged with?

I have always BADLY wanted to see a game set in some dire circumstance, scrounging to survive, supply and build up your ""Fort"" and the people within.   Finding survivors, finding supplies, openly exploring, etc.   Zombies or not, the concept is what I wanted.  Unfortunately, there's too much here that misses the mark.  The controls/menus are really not great (PC port being a huge contributer to that).Permanent Character Death being mandatory, not optional was also a pretty big turn off for me.   Inability to save and reload from a save if you mess up.  Yes, I understand that that is part of the game by design; that you can't save and reload on a whim, that actions have consequences, but I bet I am not the only one who doesn't find that enjoyable.  I would much prefer to see that as an option, a ""hardcore"" mode maybe.Another annoyance, I can't let my character sleep?  I have to have one in play at all times?  THAT is a bad idea.  I first picked up the game and quickly learned that you can wear out your group.  So, I had a bunch of ""tired"" people, no one was rested and able.   Could I just sleep it off? NOPE.... seems like a logical part of the game is just not there.  Again, its that survival aspect, but this isn't fun, it is just tedious.But the real nail in the coffin was the persistent world.   If you don't play the game often, the game progresses without you.  Walk away from the game for a week and your team falls apart, uses up supplies, and become lost.  WHO THOUGHT OF THAT IDEA?!  Good God! What a terrifically bad idea!  There's many other shortcomings here and there that just make the game enjoyable to try, but not worth sticking with.  I appreciate what Undead Labs tried to do with this game, and I hope they release State of Decay 2, with a little more options and less punishments.I suppose there are gamers out there that enjoy the unforgiving aspects of the game, but I also think it turns off many players as well.   This game was SO CLOSE, but it had to have that sadism/masochism unforgiving component to it.  SURVIVAL Horror indeed, but in being so punishing, it makes it less fun and enjoyable.I was hesitant to Not recommend this game, as most of my dislikes are simply personal taste, and has nothing to do with overall game quality, which overall is decent (clipping aside).  But the choices in this game, to make it a true grind and punishing.... its just a bit too much to keep my interest."

,Recommended,241540,7773766,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Ser Ramza,"Where most zombie videogames focus on a badass or a handful of badasses wandering around splattering undead brain matter all over the place, State of Decay instead chooses to focus on community simulation. I realize that sounds like the exact opposite of what gamers want from their zombie games, but let me assure you that community simulation makes zombie killing all the more satisfying.In State of Decay, the main character is the valley the game is set in. Your success or failure has little to do with whether the character you are currently playing survives. And, believe me, characters WILL die, and once they're gone, there's no getting them back. I found myself more than once limping back to camp in a stupor, trying to come to terms with the fact that there was nothing I could have done to save my teammate from that horde of zombies. THAT'S the sort of game this is. As it should be in any zombie apocalypse, no one person is guaranteed survival and all that matters is whether your community can figure out a way to keep going despite the loss of one of its members. If your group's only auto mechanic gets eaten, you're soon going to find that gathering supplies and getting from place to place is a lot harder without a way to repair vehicles.Every aspect of survival in State of Decay's valley is tracked and simulated, from the morale of your community, to the availability of supplies, to how much neighboring groups of survivors trust you. And every action the player takes affects the simulation-- if you want to grab that sweet shotgun out of the community's stash, you will have to prove that you've earned it first through contributing to the wellbeing of the community. This ends up being a very addictive game mechanic, as it isn't long before you find yourself overwhelmed with tasks the local community needs accomplished. For instance, if you focus too much on keeping morale up, you'll soon find that supplies are dwindling. And when you do go out on that supply run for desperately needed medicine, you'll often have to choose whether to ignore the frantic calls for help on the radio from the friendly group of survivors in the next town over.Throughout all this decision-making and emergent drama, I hardly even noticed State of Decay's unpolished animation and clunky interface. They were there and I knew they could be better, but I was having so much fun that it didn't matter. What Undead Labs has got here is an incredibly addictive foundation to build upon and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. This is one developer that realizes when it comes to apocalyptic settings, the monsters are only a catalyst for revealing the true nature of man."

Here are a few things I liked and disliked.Things I liked:+The combat is atypical, but fun. -- Mostly, you melee the zombies. The combat is fluid and there's a good bit of mechanics that make the combat satisfying. NPC's are also incredibly useful fighters, so you really think twice about not going out with someone.+The zombies are less of a monster and more of an obstacle. -- There is zero benefit to killing a zombie in this game, aside from the fact that now you won't die from zombies. This was a more enjoyable approach because it allowed you to focus on other elements of the game, rather than about mindlessly mashing zombies.+The management of your home-base and crew members is pleasing simulation element. --  The game gives you a home base full of people in which you have to manage and ""take care"" of. It's really actually quite fun although the occasional ""Marko is depressed"" moments can get a little annoying.+The story is reasonably short and fun -- I'm always glad when developers don't stress having a long story to make a fun game. It's a good length and almost all of it is quite fun.What I didn't like-You can send people on raids, but they often get stuck -- At first this was an issue as I thought I was forced to rescue them, but you don't even have to. If you ignore someone in trouble they make it back just fine. It was frustrating not knowing this when It happens so frequently. Overall it's an annoying mechanic that caused more stress than fun.I played this game for 12 hours straight after purchasing, so I have to recommend it if you like zombie games or simulation games."

I can't stop playing this. It's fantastic.The combat is pretty basic, nothing new, but works very well. Due to the noise, backpack size, and limited resources, you may end up using melee more frequently than guns. If you die, the character you are playing is permanently dead. Keep in mind that this can even happen to the characters you begin the game with.The survival and limited resources aspect has been what keeps dragging me back. There's buildings to check for supplies, resources to gather, infections and hordes to clear... the map isn't big, but, so far, it doesn't seem to end. Some things on your home base can happen while you are not playing the game, too. None of the characters can die while you're not playing, though!There are some quirks that are probably related to being a pc port and perhaps will end up being fixed. The big one that gets me is random lag spikes, most often while driving. It's not game-ruining, though it has brought me into a couple close calls."

It tries to blend 3rd-person action with survival elements to create a Hybrid style zombie game that is enjoyable to play and in some respects it succeeds. Pros:  #1 Budget title,U get quite a bit of gameplay for 20$.#2: Good variety of weapons and Vehicles in which to play around with#3:Open world to explore and roam thru#4: Several Zombie types each with their own  style and tactics to defeating.#5:Survival elements such as Scavenging for supplies(food ammo etc)CONS: SOD cannot seem to decide what it wants to be.  The blend is confusing at times with you not knowing how to view the situation you find yourself in(Pure survival mindset or action""balls-to-the- walls"" attack. etc)  ...it tries to do so much yet doesn't really nail any of them with any great effect.#1:Glitches Abound in SOD pulling the experience down several notches. Zombies will frequently glitch thru doors and floors or fly up into the air when hit. Items routinely Vanish from your safe drop box in your homebase Forcing you to carry the best gear to prevent that Assault weapon you worked so hard for to vanish when next you load your game.#2:Graphics are simply nothing to praise.The world never draws your eye with any memorable visuals to speak of.#3: Fast zombies!!! No Zombie in the game moves slower than a very fast Shuffle.Making ranged Combat a nightmare,There simply isnt enough engagement time with most firearms to make them worth using for the most part.unless you bottleneck the zeds in a doorway.You will find yourself in MELEE 90% of the time if not more.#4:Story sadly does little to pull you in.There is a few moments where you almost buy the World you find yourself in, but they are sadly to few to make a dent in the Bland worldConclusion:If you are able to look past its flaws there is a enjoyable game to be had here.Open world survival gameplay is what i personally have dreamed about in a Zombie game. With serious Patching and a bit of refinement in gameplay SOD could have been and still be a Great Zombie game. If you can't get enough Zombies give it a try.

However, I found just a general level of frustration after each play session rather than a sense of accomplishment or interest.  At first glance there appears to be this wide open world to explore, but the game mechanics felt like they were designed to circumscribe that world to a small repetitive grind nearby your base: search one building, counsel one companion, destroy one horde, run one nearby mission, return home to rest/resupply, change to new character, repeat."

,Not Recommended,241540,9746862,"Posted: 6 April, 2014",all,Cyran Atlas,"UPDATE: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ is what they did even legal? Denying service to something that we paid for?At first, the game feels great. A brand new survival game that actually does what it intends to do; survive. You have your open world, vehicles, large amounts of weapons, scavenging, etc. But if you are looking for a survival game that gives you independence, this is NOT the game for you, and here's why;This game forces you to be in a group with people as part of some 'campaign' mode, and there is no way out of it if you wish to progress through the game. Now, when you hear it, the group that you join has apparently been surviving for a long time (and doing well). You think that the group can be of help to get your survival going. This, however, is not the case. As soon as you join the group, the group relies on you to do everything that they need. First, you have to scavenge supplies to make the base either better, or to maintain it. Secondly, you have to save the people in your group that are CONSTANTLY getting into messes like being attacked by zombies. Thirdly, you have zombies that you need to take care of yourself (i.e infestations, special zombies, zombie hordes) and the whole game just ends up becoming tedious. Since you are spending all your time on your group staying alive, you don't have much time to actually progress through the game. The resources are also a problem, there aren't enough. Resources that you will find the most of is food, medicine, and gas (which you honestly don't need a lot of). Resources that you actually need though is weapons, ammo, and supplies for building (there are small amounts of these throughout the game).My experiences throughout the game are based on those, I had no other problem with it, but when I found out that I have scavenged every single building (only having a few upgrades and a low ammount of needed supplies), I was only through the middle of the game, I couldn't progress from there. The game demands too much out of you in a few hours of play.I only reccomend this game if you enjoy having to do quests every 5 minutes and not being able to progress, because that is how it seems.EDIT: I also have played +20-30 hours even though steams says only 5 since I usually am in offline mode when playing singleplayer games"

It would have been nice if this was like a GTA map but with zombies. All kinds of buildings, cities and neighborhoods, beaches, you know. Instead you're stuck with a boring map with small towns too far away from eachother making traveling annoying. The driving is okay though.Annoying side missions. It seems the developers tried to make this an "" SOS style out of no where side missions make a choice"" type of game, they just killed it. They pop up way too much and you often find yourself having to save someones♥♥♥♥♥all the time and its a wonder when you can finally get to do what you wanted to do.Guns are uselss. You'd think the best time to resort to guns is when you've got a horde coming at ya, but nope, that'll just make things worse. Why can't they make it where guns actually do damage without having to shoot them in the head, which would basically instantly kill them. So far only use is when I'm at a height shooting zombies from above.All in all it is a good game, the mechanics are wonderful, the gameplay is amazing, but there is so much thats lacking and wrong it just ruins the game."

I bought this game thinking ""Running around collecting supplies, shotgunning zombies heads off?!  Hell yeah!"".  Turns out it's alot more realistic, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on your tastes.Personally, this game felt like a looting sim.  You run from house to house, grab everything of importance, slowly walk it back to your base, repeat.  Eventually you can call in your fellow survivors to grab the important supplies, or set up a base, but when you do zombies come out of nowhere, for some reason, so there's a good chance they'll die if you don't stay to help them out, and walk them back.There's also a system in place where the game world continues while you're logged off.  This sounds pretty cool, right?  Well, when you can only play for an hour or two each day, and there's no option to turn it off, you're basically fighting a losing battle.  The NPCs are apparently totally incompetent without your leadership, and everything goes to hell while you're gone.While I enjoyed the game, and found the open world, as well as some of the mechanics, amazing, the inability to turn off the ""simulation"", so you can save and the world doesn't continue without you, makes me unable to recommend this unless you are a big fan of simulators, and have a lot of time to play."

Often you'll be searching a building at night when a horde is making its way along an adjacent road, but you're not sure if the building you're in is empty. As well as trying to keep noise & light discipline whilst searching, you need to be on guard for something sneaking up on you or cutting off your escape routes.The clipping is a bit of an issue, but everything else in the game comes together really well, and being on Steam and XBLA it's easily patched, so it should only get better.Definitely worth a look, with more open world DLC on the way and a multiplayer being spoken about.

There is a storyline which is ok, but the best shall come from the incoming DLC which will feature a true sandbox survival expericence by implementing new weapons and a <survive as long as you can> kind of mode."
,Recommended,241540,7836957,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Hola Uriberto,"I was first introduced to this game in my trusty XBOX 360 when it was first released some months ago. The gameplay during that time was amazing; the zombies were a threat but could be manageable if you used your wits and administered your resources well, the story was simple but it was gradually introducing more features and more difficulty. It was more than okay for an XBOX Live Arcade game, certainly more than I expected from it.However, after logging over 50 hours on it, I grew tired of it. I needed it refreshed. The game graphics on the console were bad; the framerate was terrible; and I thought to myself: this game has been designed for the wrong platform. It should have been designed for PC.And then, out of the blue, Undead Labs said: ""Hey! We know you wanted the game to have better graphics, and an increasing difficulty mode without the story lowering it for you. So here's the Steam release. And have yourself the Sandbox mode DLC too. We know you want it.""And I certainly did. And the graphics were really, REALLY better than their console counterparts. And the implemented keyboard and mouse controls felt so comfortable I really couldn't believe this game had been designed for controllers.So, my fellow survivor, if you're into the whole zombie apocalypse thing and want a game about surviving at its finest, then this is the game for you. No more gathering useless stuff to be killed by a camper in The War Z or Day Z. No more linear story zombie massacre from Left 4 Dead and Contagion. No more top-down objective scenarios from Shadowgrounds: Survivors. No more sidescrolling platform action from Deadlight.THIS is the ultimate zombie survival game you've been waiting for. Building your own base. Managing your own community. Playing with several characters. Permanent death for each character, thus bringing more realism. No more useless looting; everything you get is a resource you can develop into something useful in your base. No more passive gaming; your characters may and will get sick, or get hurt, or suffer from starvation. And finally, no more cash-milking developers: Undead Labs brings patches on a regular basis, and actually listens to the community.All in all, and considering this is their first attempt into this, they did a pretty damn right job. All I'm doing right now is playing this on the refurbished PC version and asking myself: WHERE IS CLASS 4!? WHERE IS STATE OF DECAY 2!?I hope it's here soon and it brings a new engine, more realistic and better looking. Because State of Decay is one of the few games out there that deserves that."

Graphics are pretty good for the time it was made. There are some really annoying and noticable bugs. There is also alot of repitition like going out, scavenging, coming back to base, switching characters and repeat. Getting past all of that something about this game is so addicting and fun. When you finally finish the story you want more. Some choices will matter depending on what survivors you want to help or ignore. Finding weapons in homes is the most exciting part of this game imo. Just being able to stockpile weapons, food, ammo, etc. You need resources in order to susatin a settlement. Sometimes i found myself in sticky near death situations, where as I was scavenging a horde or 2 runs at me, and i exhaust all my ammo and stamina trying to kill them all. Leaving me extremely vulnerable. Overall it is a very fun game with at least 20 hours of good gameplay if you take your time and enjoy it.

The same is true for survivors you find.  If they die, they are gone never to return.  But there's so many items and survivors you're never really going to be short of anyting so it's not really relevant.  The story line is OK.  Not awesome but not terrible either.  The mechanics of fortifying your home base to surive is nice.  It made home really feel like home.  Once you get the hang of fighting the zombies it's not difficult in anyway to fight off large numbers of them.There's an emote system where you can cheer, agree, disagree with people in your group but it's next to useless.  There's literally no benefit from having it.There are some huge bugs in this game.  One of which bit me in the♥♥♥♥♥hard.  Google ""State of Decay Main Mission Stuck"" and you'll find tons of people have experienced this.  Some of the proposed solutions work some do not.  Basically there's a bug where the main story line stops trigging and you no longer get new missions effectively sticking you in  a rather boring sandbox.  I had that specific bug hit me twice.  I had to restart the whole game twice just to try to get around it.So ignoring that huge bug the game is still just OK.  Would I tell my friends to buy it?  No.  It's not worth the time.  It's ok but there are better games that are indeed worth the time.I rate this game a solid ""meh""."

76561198031244622,Recommended,241540,21114872,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,Snipekill2445,"State of Decay is a zombie survival style game from Undead Labs, currently released for Xbox 360 and PC. The core game mechanics are very interesting, choices you make will ultimately effect you, and your group of survivors in either a good, or poor way at some point. The game takes a relatively realistic approach to survival in the sense if you or someone in your group perishes, they're gone indefinitely. The game also progresses even if you're not playing it, giving you initiative to keep an eye on things and to keep the home base running smoothly.Starting the story, you're thrown right into the deep end. The opening screen sees yourself, Marcus Campbell and your buddy fighting off a small group of 'Zeds', or the zombies, with basic melee tree branches after returning from a fishing trip in the woods. You have a small conversation after this, basically consisting of ""What the hell was that!?"" This is how you'll feel for most of the game, discovering new weapons, tactics and horrifying 'special' zombie types.The core of the game is simply to survive. You will have to survive huge zombie hordes, sickness, supply runs and of course each other. You will have a home base where you keep all of your supplies and where your group of survivors live. There are different home bases you can occupy through the map which is a decent size. Each home base has it's own advantages and draw backs, they support a different amount of areas you can setup, as health clinics, sleeping quarters, kitchens, radio stations and many other stations. Each base supports a different amount of survivors with bigger bases supporting more people, but requiring more people to run it. Moving around to other bases also uses quite alot of 'influence'.Influence is a sort of currency in State of Decay. You can use it to obtain all sorts of items, like weapons, medicine and usable items like molotov cocktails. You gain influence completing supply runs, helping people our and completing story missions. In doing those things you also gain experience and level up different skills on whichever character you're using at the time, like shooting skill and stamina. This would largely see you using just a single powerful survivor to play the game, but using a character for a prolonged period sees them tire, and lose more and more stamina. This doesn't necessarily force you to change characters all the time as you can drink coffee and eat energy bars you replace the stamina, but it's alot more intuitive to do so.You must go on supply runs to scavenge for items like food, medicine and building supplies, keeping your home base well stocked to survive. You can order different survivors to go on supply runs but they often get into trouble with zombies and as they walk on foot over using a car, take a very long time. I found supply runs took up most of my time in State of decay, adding to that realistic survival immersion, leaving little time to complete missions and help people.There are, quite literally a ton of weapons to use in this game, from silent melee weapons to powerful automatic assault rifles. Firearms are loud and attract attention to it's normally best to save them for tight predicaments where you have no alternative. Otherwise of you're only facing three or four zeds it's better to just take them down one by own with a melee weapon, such as a police baton or machete. There are lots of different blunt force and sharp objects to use. I thoroughly enjoyed hacking arms and heads off zombies with swords, and shooting brains out with long range snipers rifles. I found the best way to deal with the huge zombie hordes of twenty plus zeds was to just run them all over in a vehicle. Don't think you can just drive around invisible like Mad max however, as cars get damaged smashing zombies into bloody pulps. You can setup work shops at your home base that will repair cars parked in designated zones over time. This is likely the best route to take as vehicles are limited.Overall I very much enjoy this zombie survival style game, has a decent number of hours worth of play and offers a more realistic approach over the likes of Left for Dead or simiar. Even with all this variety and different tactics you can use, it does eventually become repetitive as most games do. If this sounds like your kind of game, I'd definitely give it a look (once it's on Steam special!)"

I don't hate this game for what it is, I hate it for what it isn't!List of things that I think are great about this game:1. Open world zombie game.2. Survival elements.3. Drivable cars.4. Great melee and shooting mechanics.5. Multiple home bases to choose from.6. Resource and community management.There are probably many more, just can't think of it right now.List of things I feel are wrong with this game:1. The character generator really sucks!  With all of the possible variations you could have, it still generates the same dozen people and it drives me crazy! Example: I find these 2 guys that are just friends (not even related) and they are the same guy: same face, hair, clothes and voice! Just different names. I have 6 people in my camp that look exactly the same!2. Way too many of the same cars around. Could really use more variety. Even with the selection the game has, they aren't spread out well enough.3. Though the shooting is good, aiming with the mouse still doesn't feel quite right. Its very obvious that it's a console port. Makes for bad aiming sometimes, especially when trying to get head shots!4. Too many, very obvious immersion breaking continuity errors. They would take forever to list.5. Bad design of home base building areas. There are areas in the base that you could obviously build there, but the game won't let you. I'm not really sure why they designed it that way.6. No CO-OP! You can tell that this game was designed to be an MMO. But still doesn't have a multiplayer feature at all, and that really sucks!7. There are some really bad graphical problems with this game. Frame rate issues even on a monster rig. Lag issues.

But I decided to give it a try because it was a singleplayer game (I hate multiplayer), and it was on sale during the steam summer sale. Anyways, the best way I can describe this game is to call it a combination of Fallout 3 like scavenging and exploration, with Saints Row The Third like controls. Basically, your goal is to build up a shelter that you and your crew live in. You need to explore the countryside looking for useful supplies that your shelter needs while hiding from or fighting several zombies. As you do this, you are expected to complete story and optional side missions. You cannot create a custom character. Instead, you find new recruits, and if they are friendly enough, you can play as them. You switch to different characters when your current character gets too tired. All in all, I would give this game a 9/10 for gameplay alone (weak story, though). I was surprised when I saw that I put 30 hours into this game in less than a week! That was NOT expected."

The short answer is, it's not a game made for the PC.It's a shame, because its a hugely fun game.  However, especially considering the auto-save function, it's nearly unplayable with all of the crashes (it zones you back in upon reload at home base, saving no progress in the mission, but costing you game-time and resources).

Second is that there is a lot of polish and not a whole lot of bugs ya there is the ocasional zombie jumping to its death and sometimes the A.I. wont get out of your way but that is just minor things granted the A.I. can irritate me but thats me. Third thing is it's DLC is good and the concepts are really good and it executes them Really well, now you cant get a perfect game its impossible and you also have backrounds that could randomly pop up at anytime now granted they are somewhat repetative in multiple playthroughs but there is no two people in the game who have the same backround stories.DLC-BreakdownThe sandbox version of SoD and it is relatively good. Basically its regular State of Decay except it has no storyline.-LifelineNow this one was interesting its mostly what would have happened should it have been like a military extraction mission, and it is well executed now it does change maps and adds a few new things, your in the city now playing as Soldiers who are trying to extract high value assets now im not military but i know what that means, and other than that you can get besieged by zombies on lifeline.I give this game a 8/10"

It's a medium sized open world, where you have to scavenge houses for ammunition, medicine, build-material etc. For your survival.With your resources you can also upgrade your own stronghold/home. Your also able to place your own outposts in different houses as well.Every character also have it's own skilltree with perks, which you have to gain exp by kill zombies or through scavenging.In this current state (Early acess-build) there is some bugs, not that many that i've seen yet but you should bare that in mind if you buy it. Some zombies can get stuck into objects, some animations may be a little bit choppy and so on._Pros_&_Cons_+ Large exploreable world, you can enter every house.+ Cool skill-tree features.+ Upgrade your home to gain more features.+ Sometimes intense combat.- No multiplayer.- Can be graphical problems playing with Crossfire.- Not full support for keyboard & mouse."

The fact that you have to search for resources like food, medicine and ammunition makes it a lot more realistic.The vanilla game is pretty good. It has a simple storyline of escape, but adds different elements like other surviving factions. There are lots of resources and vehicles, and even more zombies, meaning that even by not completing missions the game is still fun.I would recommend buying the Breakdown DLC. It adds in a sandbox mode, which makes the game a lot more fun because you have a lot more control of how you play. You choose where you start, which survivors you allow into your group, and which survivors you leave for dead. And just to make things a little better, you can decide to at any time move to the next level, which basically resets the map, makes it harder, with more zombies and less resources, and you can take 5 survivors with you. This means that the game is more or less endless.Buy this game if you enjoy survival games and zombie shooters. The only improvement I would like is multiplayer.*********************************************STATE OF DECAY LIFELINE REVIEW:Not as fun as the original game or Breakdown. You start of with a few skilled survivors, a large base, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of guns and ammo. You don't search buildings for resources, but get it dropped in by a helicopter. All the missions are to rescue different people and take them back to your base.This DLC is very repetitive. I would have liked to say it is good, but it is fairly average. Buy Lifeline if you are buying the game and Breakdown just to complete the set, but you won't play it as much as the other game-modes."

,Recommended,241540,7982917,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Encephalon,"State of Decay is a third person open world zombie survival horror video game, developed by Undead Labs and published by Microsoft Studios originally released for the Xbox 360 on June 5, 2013. The Windows version was released on September 20, 2013 via Steam's Early Access, with an official release following on November 5, 2013.The story begins with a character named Marcus Campbell who had gone on a fishing trip with his friend Ed Jones and upon returning from the trip, found that the world had turned into a zombie apocalypse. Throughout the first hour, you are introduced to the open world thru Marcus's eyes right until the game reaches its first home zone where he meets more survivors.Once you reach the home zone, this is where the game really shines. Marcus no longer takes the role of main character, and can actually die throughout the course of the game depending on how you handled him. If he dies, life carries on, and you can choose another survivor to continue provided you have established a rapport with him/her to at least being on a friendly relationship. This was a very refreshing and surprising twist compared to other similarly open world action games. And this is where the game subtlely reminds you of a very important point in the game. ""There are NO heroes, only survivors.""Gameplay wise, it feels very much like GTA, with quite a large open world consisting mostly of country sides and a mid-sized town. Its not a very huge place, but feels just right. Unlike GTA however, you can customize your home zone with whatever facilities you require, and may even be required to re-locate if the need arises. Every character is unique and has traits that you can level up RPG-styled. You can have someone who's very good at Heavy Weapons, or a very nimble character who kills fast with a bladed weapon.Like GTA, there is a main story plot to follow with lots of random sidequests and storylines. However, I personally felt that just playing a character and surviving and roleplaying him/her grow from a reckless newbie to a hardened survivor is in itself a very rewarding experience that no other story can ever match.Graphics wise, while not jaw-droppingly gorgeous, does its job and portrays the world well enough. I did not like how the Bloom effects was overly excessive when I set it to maximum setting though. Personally i felt that a medium setting was good enough. Music is especially commendable when it can have a range of relaxing tunes when driving around the countryside, to heart pounding tunes when faced with a horde of zombies. Voice acting is also competent but i did notice that there weren't much variety to the voices at all. Because there is no main character in the game, the voices tend to be recycled alot.One thing to note is that this game does not allow you to save games as you wish. Games are only saved after missions or at intervals, and what it means is that you can spend a long time leveling a character's skills only to lose him/her in a single mistake against a zombie horde. And thats it, you lose the character forever and cannot backtrack to an earlier savegame. I can see how alot of people may dislike this but I personally felt that this was an important game mechanic further reminding you that there are NO heroes, and to do things tactically instead of just rushing into danger.Downsides, the game can be buggy at times, with vehicles sometimes getting stuck in the 3D environment, characters holding invisible weapons etc. I also didn't like how the game did not allow you to cancel a mission when you have started it.You are unable to sleep off the night, which is very strange as most sane people would know that it is suicidal to go hunting for zeds at night. The game forces you to go explore with nothing else to do in the homezone during night time.Unable to get followers to help carry additional rucksacks, or even unable to load rucksacks into vehicles which obviously have enough space to put them.In addition, because of how traits are randomly generated on random survivors, there is a tendency for players to purposely kill off survivors who just don't have the trait they want. I am personally guilty of this, and i wished I hadn't done so because it somewhat trivializes the idea of preserving a character and forming emotional bonds with them. I wished there was a way where we could maybe train any survivors on any traits we want him/her to have even if he/she didn't come with it.There isn't any co-op mode, which was a missed opportunity as this game would have been even more fantastic if it was implemented. However, due to the way the game is set up, I can also understand why there isn't any co-op mode.Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10Finally, a proper Open-World zombie survivor GTA styled game that plays rather like an RPG. It can be extremely addictive when you take the time to level up all your survivors in your home zone, and because of its no save policy, it forces you to think like a survivor instead of just rushing up and kill anything you see.Because of the time spent with your surivivors, you can really form an emotional bond with them over time, and can be especially heart breaking when they die. This game is possibly one of the best way to really tell players that in a zombie apocalypse, there are NO heroes, only SURVIVORS."

As a PC gamer, I really wanted to play this title but the console to PC port left me with clunky controls that ruined my experience.

,Recommended,241540,7905148,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,Arod Snaux,"I'm actually neutral on this one, since it feels like a beta. Only get it on sale, and make sure you download cheat mods if you do; you are going to need them. While fun and innovative, the game is also VERY buggy and frustrating.Positives: The game allows you to face the bitter realities life in a zombie apocalypse, which as it turns out, happen to be mostly about doing repetitive, dangerous tasks while managing your ever-dwindling resources. It WILL scare the hell out of you.Negatives:It is a ""persistent world""; if you don't play the game, time in the gameworld continues. This means your well-established and safe homebase could suddenly be out of critical supplies then next time you play the game, and it gets worse the longer you don't play. Given that its a single player only game, this is horrible. Worse, if you die, that's it. You die. No saves, no reloads... you just become another character.RPG elements are linear and entirely scripted... there is no thinking outside the box here. Upon seeing soldiers about to execute innocent civilians, my first instinct would be to snipe the soldiers and rescue some new friends, but the game prevents you from killing ANY humans, even those that post a risk to your camps survival. Your only real choice is to ignore quests, which usually has a negative effect since this causes them to fail.Finally, it's buggy as hell. I can deal with permadeath, if it's the result of my own bad choices, but inthis game, its usually from stupid bugs like my truck flipping end over end and exploding from hitting a wood picket fence, or jumping off a 200' tower because I can't get in just the right position to grab the ladder, or being STUCK on said ladder because there is no jump-of feature once I'm on it. Graphic glitches are frequent and numerous, and the entire game feels like a bad Xbox port (which it is).Finally - good or bad - this is NOT an open world. Your actualy choices are very limited, and the game does in fact end if you follow the main storyline past a certain point. Its really a shooter with VERY minor RPG elements and a crippled strategy system. If you are a zombie fanboy who grew up on casual-gamer xbox-controller games, you'll love it; if you are a serious RPG or RTS fan, this will only annoy you."

It's basically an openworld zombie survival game kinda like GTA V but all the civilians walking around are zombies.You can play the game as you like and missions pop up for you to complete. It can feel a little frantic sometimes, especially if you don't know what you're doing.Other survivor groups pop up from time to time and if you don't pay attention to them, they can be wiped out easily. Even some of your mission choices can get them killed (with the reward being some other in-game benefits to your group).An unusual feature of this game is the ability to switch between most of your survivor group. Your survivors can and will die and so you don't have a main character as such, but you can decide to just play one particular person if you like.They're going to need to rest eventually though!You can recruit other survivors to your group, scavenge for resources like Ammo, Medicine, Food, Building Materials and Fuel.All of the above is self explanatory except fuel. You never need to top your vehicles up, fuel is used to make certain weapon items.Another feature that I love is the ability to move your survivor group to other homes and set up there.Not everywhere can be a survivor home and some locations have different benefits than others.I haven't really experienced any bugs.The only slight annoyance was my vehicle disappearing after i drove like a maniac and overturned it.I had left it for a few minutes to help a survivor kill a special zombie and when i came back to retrive the vehicle it was gone!It was full of ammo, medicine and food that i was going to return to my base so it was a big hit that I took."

After that, you can switch between survivors, upgrade your little bastions of humanity, pretty much anything a basic sandbox should have.This being a console port, the visuals are less than stunning but then again when's the last time you haven't played a zombie game with graphical quality as poor as a zombies flesh is rotted.A decent zombie sandbox that is still in development."

So im not sure why you're reading this, or rather why I am writing this. The remastered version is not much different than this. I played SoD on launch for 360. Looked terrible but it was great fun. Then purchased it on PC and played it twice for a total of 3 times. By no means is the game perfect. The story was weak and the gameplay was sub par.But the over all experience did really well as one of the earlier survival games before just about every smaller dev thought about cashing in on the concept. SoD was excuted quite well, so its a shame this original; less buggy edition is no longer open for users to purchase. If you can pick up the re-mastered version for like $10 on a sale, I'd say do it. It'll keep you busy  for at the very least 10 hours, making it worth your money."
,Recommended,241540,8914953,"Posted: 30 January, 2014",all,Grognard_87,"I just completed this game (or rarther, the main storyline)  and found it to be really thrilling. It's a game where you do not play a single character, but many different characters in the survival situation. All the characters have seporate skills that level up as you fight and train them like in Dead Rising with Cardio, Fighting, Wits and Shooting. All obvious, though Wits is to speed up your search time and find more items.You get to set up a new location for home base, set up outposts to help survivors that wonder get back home and there are many different resources. The main resources being Food, Ammo and Medicine whilst the two others are Petrol and Building supplies which can be used to help improve your homebase. Building watch towers, libraries, bunkers, storage areas, medical centre and so on. All these give different boons and improvements to your stats.You also get many new missions to help improve the survivor's Moral. Not only yours, but of others that appear around the area with many chocies slightly altering the game world. The ending is a little flat, but I'm more than interested in buying a DLC for this game and see where it leads from there. A must sell for anyone who loves the zombie apocolypse genre and wants to play one with not only decent combat, but also survival mechanic that's not too detailed either.However there are glaring issues. When you find supplies and leave them for later you can't remotly get other survivors to get them later. You can only do that whilst in the house. You are unable to dump the supplies you find in the boot or back of a car, which would make long-distance scavenging easier and not a endles chore. The ending is rarther bland as it could've been far more interesting taking this game on the road and developing a better plot, like finding what caused the zombies.Survivors do not accompany you unless part of a mission or you invite them along which costs 100 influence. When they do accompany you, you can't ask them to pick up supplies to carry for you or any other items. There is also no ""luxery Item"" thing either which could've been used, like in Dead State, to help raise moral and keep people in a positive mindset, despite this being a end of the world kind of deal.All in all, not the best game in the world, but it's worth a look if you're into the whole zombie apocolypse thing and you'd like to see it done with some time and resource management in it."

The game continues to play when you're not playing, meaning that if you have things like a job or children, you will come back to food being missing, people disappeared, and storyline quests going by. The dev's argue that no one is supposed to die and storyline is not supposed to progress, yet I have come back after a week at work to find several people gone and the ""You just missed storyline"" radio broadcasts going off. As well as -430 influence and several of my resources empty. There IS a client loader that's supposed to fix it, but I believe the programmer for it quit the project, and the dev's updated the game so it no longer works.If you have no life and WANT to put the time in, it is a fantastic game. The storyline is meh, but the gameplay is some of the best I've ever seen (with mods to fix certain things of course). It's far too dark at nighttime, but the base building and upkeep with survival management is something I'd love to see in more games.Graphics: 8/10. Seriously fantastic.Sound: 8/10. The voice acting in great though a bit repetitive, the music is actually mood enhancing, and the ambiance creepy.Storyline: 5/10. It was honestly hard to tell what was going on most of the time, as there was too much going on, and you always feel like you're missing out on something.Gameplay: 4/10.

If you feel the price tag on it is too much, it's worth it, atleast in my eyes. and if it's on sale BUY RIGHT AWAY. because you will have hours of fun seeing your friends ripped apart if you're doing bad.The only bad part about this game is: no Co-op. A Co-op on this game would be lovely! Work together to survive and have one homebase to handle.Story is... well... Decent, but the gameplay really makes up to it.  You get a base to survive against the zombies, but having a base has some negative things with it, you need resources to survival. You get Resources by looting building around your base, before you go further to get more. When you go out on a scavenging run try not to alert the Zombies wandering outside, because sooner or later, you will screw up and fight for your life.Having the opportunity to make suppressors, molotovs, making ""rooms"", move your base whenever is a big bonus for a survival like this.I might need to add: This is a persistent world, which continue while you're not playing it.

This game reminds me of Hidden & Dangerous 2 plus The Walking Dead.SOD, afterall, can be a great selling point for survival horror game industry. While many titles focus on single-player horror, SOD wins in every direction with its teamwork plus individual management. I truly hope the developers can look into a bigger map, a bigger storyline, as well as a bigger pool of different friends and fiends.This game reminds me so much of my all-time-favorite - Hidden and Dangerous. There were so many great games back then.

Speaking of ferals, the game has a set of freak zombies that are extremely dangerous encountered with groups of normals. However, when encountered alone, they're much easier not because your survivors are overpowered (they're not) but because you learn their behavior patterns and can counter them effectively: The first time I combat-rolled away from a feral's tackle attempt before following up with a ground finisher for a one hit kill, I almost squealed with glee.

Action is persistent and survival is truly paramount in crafting your own storyline experience. Excellent graphics and getting better.

Stands up to repeated playthrough as you are responsible for how your survivors prioritize their goals and strategy. Definitely one of the better games I've played in a while. Highly recommended.

The graphics are pretty ancient and you have to mess around with unofficial solutions to get higher resolutions but despite its flaws and bugs (there are many) it is great fun.  I like survival type games which are as open as possible.  This isnt totally open world but its open within the plot driven story progression.  So it is in the middle ground between linear (tunnel shooter) and proper open world.It has elements of rpg and you can switch between characters.  Some nice ideas such as developing the survivors camp and adding facilities which is a nice idea.All in all it is fun.  Someone should take this concept (especially the base defense and facilities development) and take the whole concept further, there is a lot of mileage in this yet.So not brilliant but good fun if you can ignore the ancient looking graphics (old console port).  Very entertaining and the field of view issues which so many console games had doesnt seem to be quite so bad as some other ports.  All in all good value for money and a fun experience."

There are no ""Main Characters"", you start off as Marcus but you are quickly able to play as other survivors in your base. If one of the survivors die, they are gone forever you don't get a ""game over"" you simply play as one of the remaining survivors. That being said each survivor has his/her own traits, skills, and levels. The more you use the survivors the more they level up, if you play only as one survivor and he/she dies you will have a harder time playing as the other low level survivors (if you didn't level them up). You get to build up your base and you are even able to relocate to other bases. Getting all the materials to build and level up your base can be grinding but well worth it. There are a variety of buildings you can create in your base. Watchtowers (to snipe zombies), Garden(to grow crops), Library (to research advanced buildings) and a variety of other buildings.This game is a fun game to play to just kill some time, the bugs are a slight Inconvenience but nothing game breaking.8/10"

I should find the fetch quests annoying - if it's not some moron wandering into a zombie party, it's a moron who wants to go kill the 'freak' zombies. I should find the glitches and bugs a deal breaker, but I still boot the damn game up, over and over again.I know I shouldn't, but I find that I really like this game and can't stop playing it. It's got that 'one more mission' addictiveness that draws you in, and it doesn't complicate gameplay with too many moving parts. Kill zombies, find materials, don't die. It is repetitive, but in the same way that Mount and Blade was repetetitive. It's the same map, the same people, the same combat, over and over again, but it's still fun. It's fun burning mobs with molotovs, it's fun finding those much needed supplies, it's fun splattering zombie heads all over the grass.That said, the story game isn't worth more than a playthrough, and even then, honestly? It's really only valuable for introducing you to the geography. Breakdown is where the real fun is, and though it is a bit of a scumbag move to make you pay for a feature that really should have been in the game, put together the game is still less than thirty bucks. For the number of hours you'll get out of it, it's a pretty good deal. If you do get the game, grab the mod that lets you put bags in the back of trucks.

Time waster. You can train your survivors with different skills. Each is playable (besides the radio girl).Offers for a lot of replayability.

Would like my money back.It has a semi-persistent world feature, which is puzzling for a single player game. Let me elaborate: my play time in a single session is very limited. I returned to the game after not playing for a day, and I found that two of my fellow NPCs had died, my main character developed a fever and all of the home base supplies had dwindled to nada (all relayed to me by a nifty journal feature).Fantastic. As a result of the above referenced events (that I had no opportunity to influence) the remaining NPC survivor morale dropped significantly. Due to their low morale, I could no longer directly control or request their assistance. I was then forced to venture out as a single character to find new survivors / supplies.Every attempt ended in tragedy. The fever that my main character suffered from directly affected his stamina rating. With a low stamina, you can only attack zombies four or five times before becoming exhausted (aka defenseless). Each zombies at least four or five strikes to kill. The dwindled supplies meant that I had no potion like items to temporarily boost my stamina. Thus, it was virtually impossible to defend myself against more than two or three zombies at a time. Fine and dandy considering the game spawned a buttload of zombies during my downtime.The impasse was further complicated by the fact that the game also features a ""rogue-like"" save system. It autosaves at the conclusion of each mission or boot up of the game. To the best of my knowledge, there is no other save function. Therefore, the several hours of playtime that I put into the game were rendered moot. I could not go back to an earlier save to try and stockpile extra supplies / find more survivors / not get a fever (not sure that's possible either). Due to the autosave upon boot up, I was stuck with a single, sickly controllable character with no supplies and a roomfull of NPCs that hated him. My only option was to completely start over (fat chance, after starting over once before. See bug below).There are further game crushing bugs that occur (one neat bug stops you from aborting or completing a mission that was halfway complete, permanently halting progression of the story). Seeing as the developer is now releasing non-free DLC, it seems unlikely that they will fix said bugs.Again, great idea on paper. Sadly, it never got off the paper."

The only thing holding it back from being the best Zombie game ever is not having multi-player. This is about building up you base collecting followers and scavergering for supplys while trying not to attract the hordes and bigger things out there.

This can mean that you can build up a strong character and lose them in a zombie horde and then have to revert to a weaker other character,  The good part is that you have a tendency to try and build up numerous character to a reasonable level and try to protect them a little more than many other similar games.The AI is a little basic in relation to the zombies themselves but I've seen worse. They are quite easy to kill but the numbers can be overwhelming.The building aspect of the game is more just a basic upgrade options for various parts of the base and can be a little confusing to implement certain upgrades.It does get a little monotonous at times but once you start following a few story lines it maintains reasonable interest.Personally i believe if this game was a first person game rather than a 3rd person it would have been much better.  The camera angle mess up a bit at times making it hard to aim and perfom some actions. Also it would have been more enthralling as a FPS. Anyway thats my pet hate with this and many other games. 3rd person just doesn't cut it. IMO.The other issues I have is the lighting, as in torch is near useless, but again I think its more to do with the 3rd person view.  Als the car physics feel very toyish. Theres no real feel to the driving etc and little things like you can smash into walls and zombies and besides a little damage to the car you're fine, but hit a street sign or mail box and the car will flip into the air and birst into flames?Besides that, it still is an enjoyable game and well worth the money.  There is far worse gams out there, and in this genre, I personally think this is one of the better ones.It's not perfect but quite good!"

It excels at nothing and does a vast variety of mechanics quite well.

Food, Medicine, Building Materials and even Fuel. Where you have 5 different locations to build your fortress and survive with your chosen community of misfits. Where survivors get get sick, injured, sometimes even pass away leaving critical security issues with your bases defense and operation.The base building aspect is where this game crushes all other zombie games to date in my opinion. It is extremely satisfying to upgrade your initially sparse home to something of a fortress. There's also RPG style leveling per survivor so you can build them up across many paths of specializations.If you can overlook small nagging issues, you will love this game."

It was a unique experience and I had a lot of fun playing the Lifeline DLC (the military one) but Breakdown, I found it pretty much an arcade version of the original vanilla version which, for me, was not that fun. This game put a unique twist on the zombie survival genre and because of the permanent death of your community members and the sieges on your base in Lifeline, I really did enjoy the game as it was actually challenging. Though, my biggest problem was how slow it was. I played for 11 hours and I enjoyed the game, but it lacks a story and pretty much have to wait and play for about 20 minutes before the next main mission comes, at least for Lifeline as that is the only one I actually beat. The original was waaayyyy too slow I couldn't do it and Breakdown was boring after nearly thirty minutes unfortunately. If you enjoy zombie games or base building/community managing games, this is a must pickup, if not, maybe pick it up on the Steam Summer Sale."
,Recommended,241540,6041392,"Posted: 22 September, 2013",all,Michael Sly,"State of Decay is a good zombie game for an early-access game. People have tried to compare it to Dead Island, the DayZ, the WarZ, and Dead Rising. Somehow in its own way, it carves its own niche and offers a cross between a survival game and a management game.You can access different characters if you befriend them. Once a character is dead, they are permanently dead. Once a car is out of commission, it's permanently out. With that and the numerous home bases, the game ensures you take the time to plan out accordingly. You have to make sure your resources are well-invested, your characters are in tip-top shape, and recruit others that would be good for your group of survivors. The zombies act as they should. They are not intelligent but they come after you as they should. There are freak zombies that require a bit more strategy to take out.As it's an early-access game developed by a small company, there are some growing pains involved. There are bugs, although they don't detract from the overall feel. There is no support as of yet for the keyboard and mouse, although you can still play with them - you'll just need to find a guide for the mapping. There's also not going to be any multiplayer due to certain constraints the dev team must stay within.In a nutshell, if you like management games like Tropico or Sim City and you also like survival games like Dead Island or the DayZ, you will like State of Decay.

I could see if the AI was smart unenough to decide not to fire without one but not to do it and have one is off.3. Not too much character dialogue. You have all these people at the base and not a peep. they do not even look in your direction. Or acknowlege any major accomplishments at the base.4. The notification system. So many alerts I rarely look at it, it totally confuses me.5. the Mini map is not accurate. I cant tell you how many times I stopped at the wrong house.6. Not to many buildable items even though there was space to build at some of the locations.7. No clear path on how to develope other skills.8. No gear outside back pack.Pro:1. Everything else which is totally too long to mention.What i would like to have seen in this game is an expanion of the concept of base building from the NPC's. The Npcs should be out doing missions and gathering people. The idea not 1 NPC attacked me was strange and my character was loaded down with goods. Makeing friends and staying away from enemy groups would have help this game a lot.It should have been a rush to get the best base areas or take them over by force.I did not like the concept  of switching around characters too much, for me it took away personalization.  I think the game should have let you design your own character and stats and allow  you to bring along NPCs.  You should be able to give them gear but they can never be able to lead unless your character is killed.This game kept me at the egde of my seat the entire time. I hope to see better in the future in this genre.Changed my  review after year one editon. UNDEAD LABS cleaned up the graphics and resold the game at full price. Now everyone has an idea why the contractor filled the game full of male genitalia."

A true zombie survivla game that while has a few minor flaws that keep it from the ""state of perfection"", i will admit in light of the overall package that means squat. State of decay is a perfect example of what happens when DEVS put alot of effort into all aspects of a game to generate a great gaming experience.Any gamer that likes zombies and GTA will LUV this game. A similar experience, feel and look to GTA is here. You get open world exploration, freedom, combat and vehiclular zombie homicide. Not to mention great npc interaction, great audio, and fervored survival and home base strategy. though the strategy is limited it is still there to partake in. There ar ereal time events that create purpose and sometimes tragedy, and you feel liek a part of a bigger picture.The enemies vary, and act according to the way you would percieve the undead to act. I have always appreciated DEVS that give life to the lifeforms in thier games and SOD hits it dead center. At first it's a little slow then all of a sudden BLAM you are slammed hard with more, and MORE!!! Let's not forget perma death is real and this game and I don't care it makes it mre realistic and visceral. I have started over 2 times so far because I didn't wnat to lose an NPC. There's a;lot to be had here and alot to be appreciated for once in a game. SOD should be a game that is awarded for production and execution hands down.The only minor gripes and I MEAN MINOR are the clipping issues and for the most part manual camera.....however GTA's had the same issue and look at thier success, plus the fact that you are saving people and not maiming them so it's healthier for the younger crowd to play unlike GTA's affairs.This trully is the type of game I have been waiting for,,,for a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time!!Now give us a sequel that does NOT ruin the firsts masterpiece process; that takes place in hawaii, europe, alaska  with snowy areas and zombies, plus other undead like ghouls, skeletons, wights and vamps!!

All item drops are random, as you can find a shotgun in a house one time and in another play through you find a flare, and once the items placed around the world thats is, no more items spawn unless you reset.Each person you bring into your community is playable after you become friends and each one has their own set of skills that you can train up such as small guns or large guns, unarmed combat or using blunt weapons, it all depends on each person.The zombies are pretty simple in that they only want to kill humans and will follow loud sounds such as cars, gunshots, running, then there is the special zombies, some are easy to kill such as the bloaters or the swat zombies, and some not so much like the tank zombies or the ferals, they all can be killed in diffrent ways (mostly by car).The game has a story line and it's all about you surviving and trying to get out of the town you are stuck in, along the way you get to meet some new people which won't become part of your community but will help you in diffrent ways such as givving you cover fire, droping off a new car, all at the cost of influence, thats the money of the game, you help people out and they will be more open to help you.Something to note is the game plays while you are away, by that I mean when you turn off the game it takes remembers when you turned it off and the next time you turn it back on the game translates that into game time so it will take/give you items based on if the other people in your community went on supply runs or not, the largest jumps for this is 3 IRL days, after that it cuts it by a large amount.There is plenty of missions you can do but after awhile it gets a bit dull having to go after yet another swat zombie or another supply run.PROSOpen world.Zombie survival.World changes at all times.CONSShort story.Lack of diversity in missions.Doesn't explain the time jumps well.All in all this game is an awesome game that you should check out if you enjoy zombie games or open world games.I rate it 7/10"

You start as a survivor called Marcus with his useless friend called Ed, and after discovering that there's a zombie apocalypse, they decide to searching for more survivors. They found a community made by other survivors, they join them, and with their help they try to escape the county.Even if the story is not so great, what I've liked about the game is the gameplay and more of its mechanics and details.- The game is open world. You can visit every part of the map, where and when you want.- You can build your base with Infirmary, Kitchen, Sleeping area, Storage etc., but you need materials for building them. For getting materials, you have to scavenge all the abandoned houses, shops, farms and other buildings all over the map.- Every character in your community is playable, and have different skills that need to be increased by normally playing (Stamina, Fighting, Shooting etc.). Once you increase a specific skill to a certain level, you can unlock special abilities that are helpful while fighting, like dodge zombie attacks, being more accurate with rifles by slowing the game time, grab a zombie and smash them to the ground, and other more...- During the night, the zombies became more aggressive and are harder to spot them. Their eyes glow red, but sometimes are hard to notice.- The zombies are attracted by noises. If you shot with a gun, or do a lot of noise while scavenging, all the nearby zombies will run where the noise has started. Sometimes they come in horde and you can't handle them, and force you to escape or you will die.- You can't use only one character. If you use a character for too long, his stamina starts to decrease, and if his stamina decrease he can't defend himself from the zombies if he gets attacked. So, is advisable to let him go back to the base for let him sleep, and switch character.- If your character dies, it doesn't respawn. It dies forever in the game, and you can't load a previous save, since this game saves automatically.- The attack animations are great- Fantastic atmosphere, especially during the night. It gives a lot of tension and I'm worried about being seen by someone and attract a horde- A really nice soundtrack- ModsIf those are the positive things, there are also a lot of things that I hate.- Boring story- If you don't play the game for a while, you lose part of the resources.- Side missions are repetitive.1) Apparently, the other survivors in my community, can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥on their own and they're always in trouble in the most annoying parts of the map... and obviously I have to save them, or they probably die.2) A member of the community is always♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for something, and I have to ""talk"" with him (going in a random place and killing 5/6 zombies)- Lot of bugs that aren't fixed. If you want those bugs to be fixed, you have to REBUY the remastered version of the game!!!- NO MULTIPLAYER! A huge map like that, with those game mechanics without multiplayer, is only a WASTE!!!For concluding, this game is... great, and deservers to be played at least once. Just buy it, but ONLY during sales!"
76561198044544643,Not Recommended,241540,11576505,"Posted: 6 August, 2014",all,Impatient,"CONTEXT-------------------Before you read the review itself, I give you a bit of background on my likings. So you can build a bit of context to what I write in the review.I like the zombie genre and I like games like l4d2 very much. l4d2 is a first person zombie shooter. Very immersive in single player and cooperative gameplay and very precise to control and very tactical in competitive gameplay.Builder- and strategy-wise I like games like Civilization, Total War and/or various railroad- and transport- strategy games. In these strategy games building and managing stuff enables you to do more or new things in the game.A characteristic of all games I play is, that the player is in control. The player has precise means to interact with the game world. And information about the game world is delivert in a clear and unobscure manner.And because I am used to such games, State of Decay became a true horror to me - not because of the zombie apocalypse.Which brings me to the ...REVIEW-------------------First of all, to me State of Decay is a typical port of a console game to the PC. Meaning, for a PC-gamer it is annoying because it is PATRONIZING THE PLAYER ALL THE TIME!It is patronizing the player in these ways:- the player can not save the game!Yes, you read right. You can not save the game. (This is typical for a patronizing console game.) The game autosaves one savegame, when you start or finish mission. When you exit and continue the game it will set you to predefined or sometimes random mission start or end locations. And in a very obscure manner messes up car locations, available equipment and party composition.- third person view only(I wanted my money back for that already, because it is mentioned nowhere). With 3rd person view only comes:-- less immersive game experience-- melee targeting helper system-- thus chaotic melee fights-- separated controls for view and movement-- extra aiming mode when trying to shoot-- you can not see what is befalling you from inside rooms, because the camera is outside-- not very exact to controlSecondly this game has a lot of flaws by itself, whether bugs, design flaws or sloppy design:- mission events sometimes reset and f*ck up cars and parties.So I drive to a mission start point. When I arrive, there is a little scripted mission intro conversation. And after that, the car is gone. The car, I just parked and exited, is gone. WTH? Most likely relocated to the moon, because it would have interfered with the scripted mission introduction conversation. I would like to puke into the face of the designers!Then i exit the game and continue it, to see what the savegame position does. Well, I spawn somewhere near the mission start location. Randomly somewhere near it (why the hell? why?). My other party member, i brought with me, is gone. Command overview says he is at home. Most likely he was insulted by me exiting the game and telported back to base.- really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car colision mechanicsIf you go off-road with a car, and driver over or between obstacles your car may suddenly start to topple slowly but irreversibely. Or it may get ""sucked"" into a narrow gap. Yes, if the car touches fixed objects on each side of it, it may get sucked into the gap between. And then of course it is stuck. And then it may additionaly start to slowly topple. This is really buggy.- awful car driving behaviorYou really have to be very gentle with your fingers on the keyboard, when trying to steer a car in this game. (But you learn it eventually.)- You have to face searchable objects from a certain direction, or the UI will not show you the search option.- This game suffers heavily from being scripted so heavily.For example, in the DLC Lifeline, you can setup a fully developed and equiped base, without haveing to bother with sieges, missions and resource drain, just by picking up Dr. Horn, NOT escorting him to the LZ, but to taking him and the two other buddies to scavange, setup outposts and earn influence easily. Because as long as Horn is not at the base, base sieges and other missions will not occure. You can even build and solarize the generator. Because you are on the Horn-mission, it will not give you missions to find additional equipment. And you will have a four people gang to do all this, which you wont have again in this game. Because you can not enter the base, all resources you need for base building, you simply radio in via the landing zone facility. HQ is not dead until the 2nd siege. ... That exploit is only possible because of bad event scripting.- the player can only switch between party members at base- the player can not easily swap items between party membersOutside of base there is one party leader. The leader can do all the inventory stuff for itself. The other party members can not be controlled. If the party finds equipment, one party member except he leader needs, the leader has to bring that equipment to a storage. Then the player has to take control of the other chracter and retreive the equipment from the storage. WTF?- can not unload ammunition from guns, to dispose of gun but not the ammo.- the hack and slash melee fights and the scavanging is boring already after 1 hour of gameplay.- the party management is very clumsy- gasoline tanks, that were exploded once, are intact if I visit a location again... and this disappointment after 1 hour of playing this game. I did not even try to build a base.I like certain chracteristics of this game though:- day and night cycle- cars can be used- open worldAnd I got a bit of a hook onto State of Decay - Lifeline.I am happy I bought this game and the DLC in a -66% sale. I will write it off as a 10€ reminder to read reviews and watch youtube videos before buying a game. Even if it is 66% off and has a nice trailer."
,Recommended,241540,10088304,"Posted: 11 May, 2014",all,💗Vaxi is back~!💗,"This game is by far thee best Zombie Apocalypse Simulation game I've ever played.The game takes place in a small county in some state which I forgot the name of, I think it must be near Colorado or something. It sports several towns in a huge map which can be entirely(Albeit cautiously!) explored.It is an open world RPG Sim, and permits everything from micromanaging your stronghold(Including upgrading), to resource collecting(Ammo, medication, food, building materials), to search & rescue of survivors. It is an extremely polished game with some seriously eye opening in-your-face difficulty: Once a survivor dies...They're dead, end of the road, buddy!It is definitely not a zombie game for everyone. You all know the most popular zombie game of all, I know you do: Left 4 Dead 2. Everyone who likes zombie games, have played it, at least once in their life. And just like this one, it's not for everyone. L4D2 is a shoot 'em up RTS with obligatory co-op that takes you through a streamlined level chain that has a marked beginning, and end.Well, State of Decay is remarkably different, in a good way.There aren't any 'levels'. All there is, is one massive world to explore as you please.Melee weapons are your primary defense. Ballistic Weapons, and ammunition, is extremely scarce, and should be considered prized possessions. Furthermore, Melee Weapons can break.You switch between the survivors you play, as playing the same one will cause them to become exhausted. A survivor can't be out and about non-stop, they have to take it easy too, or their physical(and mental) stability might suffer.Survivors have a happiness meter. If the happiness meter gets too low, survivors will start to become confrontational, even aggressive, or suicidal, simply running off and most likely getting eaten. Murder is also entirely possible. If you're not careful, the zombies are the least of your concerns.Graphics are a little choppy, and framerate -can- be an issue, but they're still good enough to make the experience memorable. You don't need to play this game at ultra settings by 'any' means to make it good. The gameplay alone makes this game amazing. Warning though: This game favors Xbox 360 controller.I consider this game the current pinnacle of 'true' zombie gaming, and is a definite must-have in any Zombie Horror Survivalist fan's library."

76561198006695823,Not Recommended,241540,11714618,"Posted: 15 August, 2014",all,nobbie,"State of Decay is a game that tries to fill a void in the current zombie game market, but kind of mixes and matches multiple mechanics that are not fully realized and do not really integrate with one another. The engine might be kind of overkill for the art style, the game is riddled with bugs, the story is non-existent, and in the end, game ends up heavily repeating itself.The game is refreshing in the way that it makes you take care of the bigger picture than most other zombie games. You have a base with a group of survivors in it. You control one survivor at a time in third person. You can explore, complete missions, or scavenge for resources which are in constant demand. Survivors get tired when they're out and about, but you can switch between survivors. Survivors can also train to be better: melee fighting makes them better fighters, running improves cardio etc. Characters have different traits that can make your life easier or more difficult as time passes. When you log off the game, the game keeps track of how long you've been logged off, and when you log on again, the game simulates how events have turned out. If you've left the game with survivors dealing with many severe problems, most likely those problems have escalated and caused some kind of harm.The game does feel a bit like it combines multiple zombie games into one. You have special zombies (Left 4 Dead), melee focused fighting system with some shooting (Dead Island, Dead Rising), managing a base and its resources (Rebuild series), stamina and health that do not replenish automatically and require special attention (DayZ) etc. This is not bad in and of itself, but the game should try to marry all of these elements together. Many games have this problem where mechanics are added without really understanding how they interact with rest of the mechanics. A mechanic might work on its own, but combined with another mechanic could cause frustration or make one mechanic completely obsolete (Saints Row 4 homies vs. superpowers of pretty much all other characters).There are most likely multiple things to do at any one time and those things can be very far apart on the quite large map the game takes place in. When your survivor gets tired, he/she loses maximum stamina, which effects how much that survivor can sprint, how long and how hard your character can keep swinging a melee weapon etc. Characters with already low maximum stamina are essentially rendered useless from the get go, and being tired can also visibly affect even the high stamina characters. This causes strongest characters being used (and improving) the most with very little incentive or opportunity to improve lower level characters.The tiredness system ties into another problem. Most of the missions have something to do with your own group having trouble with something: they need to hunt a special zombie, they're surrounded, they need escorting, someone at base needs to be talked to because of anger or fear etc. The entire situation reminds me of Spore's galaxy stage: being diplomatic would mean befriending other civilizations, but as the game went on, these civilizations would send an increasing amount distress calls and ask the player to do laughably trivial tasks or face that civilizations destruction. State of Decay is not so obnoxious with the amount, but those calls get aggravating with the time it can take for one survivor to traverse the map from point A to point B. You cannot send capable survivors to take care of the situation, so the character getting tired quickly causes constant yo-yoing between different locations and the base, which causes major stuttering in the games flow.State of Decay is not an atrocious game and I've had some fun with it, but I can't escape the feeling that it's not completely thought out. Heavy repetition, very little flexibility in controlling the group, light weight story and very little interaction with survivors of your own group and even with other groups make this game feel very bare. Maybe in the future someone will get this right, but State of Decay gives a peek into what new could be done with the zombie genre."

,Recommended,241540,7950761,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,bobert awful (F+),"What kept me playing State of Decay instead of quitting: The bruised versimilitude of it all. Sure, the characters are irritating and behave like idiots, but I love those idiots! NPC characters are interesting and add flavor, and if you get tired of your overpowered murder machine of a survivor, you can switch to a character like Ed, who constantly impresses the zombies with his movie trivia so hard that their heads explode. The way the game lets events and little touches of story fall into place instead of laboriously scripting every goddamn thing is really nice. The game gives many ways to stealth or fight your way to your objective, any of which can complicate matters and bring zombie death down on your hapless survivor's head. These are the kinds of little actions and touches I thoroughly enjoy in video games. State of Decay is all the more richer for these.Despite my praise, this game does quite a few things wrong - game progression happens in real time, even when not playing! So it's a lot of fun to leave a game and come back only to find all the houses have been picked clean, and all the characters have been having fun eating all the sandwiches and shooting each other without you, you zom-loser. Building things at home is essentially a really boring RTS, even more so because the construction happens over actual time, which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. Also the game is glitchy as♥♥♥♥♥♥- cars flip over if you drive them onto curbs just right, human characters thank you for saving them from becoming zombie chow by standing completely still and pretending you're not there. The plot is gaaaaaaaaaarbaaaaaaaaage and hangs out like the smelly hobo in the middle of the Halloween dance party. The game does not allow you to delegate most activities to other survivors, which puts your character in the Commander Shepherd habit of having to do everything yourself.Breakdown DLC: Open-world survival mode where you hold out against increasingly more dangerous undead, fix up an RV to get the hell out, and get so hideously drunk that the RV gets totaled in the same area that everyone was so desperate to leave, starting the process all over again. If you haven't had enough of State of Decay, you will after this. Mainly because you'll see the thousand little quirks that the developers haven't hammered out because making downloadable current-gen games is expensive and complicated as♥♥♥♥♥♥ even from a small experienced team of developers. And also because it's the same old routine of inhabiting a safe house and building the same damn buildings again. It's a game mode with diminishing returns, much like the resources of the land that your characters are raiding. I still think it's good because it itches that scratch that the original game barely got to."

,Not Recommended,241540,11983885,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,NJOldersocks,"This game is fun for maybe an hour. Death for a character is permanent, which is usually something I love in a game, except State of Decay will kill your favorite character with one of its enormous amount of glitches. I gave this game many chances, and was let down furiously every time. There is no reverting back to a previous save. If a character dies and you want them back, you have to start the game COMPLETELY from the beginning and lose ALL of your progress. Yes, all of it. Also, you gain ""Influence"" in the game by completing missions, usually 5-25 per mission, and it costs 100 Influence to bring a companion along with you for help. What they don't tell you is that you can't bring them for help ON ANY MISSION. You'll waste the 100 Influence asking them to come with you, drive all the way to the location, just to have the companion disappear when you get there (no refunds either). I wasted 200 Influence bringing a companion along, the first time because I simply drove past a mission location that I wasn't going to, which prompted the mission to start automatically, effectively disappearing my companion. Then I had to do that tedious and unrewarding mission, drive back home and spend another 100 influence to ask him to come with me again, just to have the same thing happen AGAIN. Also, you can't set a button for ""open door"" or ""barricade window"" or anything; it's just one button for everything called ""Interact."" So on my second time starting the game completely over from the beginning, I lost my favorite character AGAIN because I pressed E to barricade the window and instead she opened the door, letting all the zombies in and killing her. So I started the game over AGAIN, being very careful to avoid this happening, and sure enough it happened YET AGAIN. I play tons of Alpha-access games with less glitches and problems than this one. Get 7D2D or DayZ instead and save yourself the frustration."

I have played this game for exactly 60 minutes before I uninstalled it in disgust. Maybe I didn't play long enough, or played it in the wrong way? How could I possibly have had enough experience to formulate an opinion for a review?Well here's what I experienced;(TL:DR, It's not good enough for your money, probably even on sale)Terrible graphicsTerrible, cheesy voice actingNo-clipping zombies - Walls, trees, cars, yourself, other zombies,Combat is clunky, inconsistent, and totally kills your ability to suspend your disbelief (why do my weapons disappear?)UI is a♥♥♥♥♥♥heapControls are a jokeThe zombies are pretty lame (and they are the core concept of the game!)Vehicle physics that have been surpassed for Twenty years in PS1 games!This game is like a really really REALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥Dead Rising that takes itself too seriously and yet somehow doesn't even commit to being dark enough.There are definitely some aspects of the game that are good and that I might enjoy, but if you've been playing video games for as long as I have you too might not be able to overcome the appalling level of enjoyment destroying crap that you have to deal with.The Walking Dead, L4D series, Dead Rising Series, have so much more immersion, polish and enjoyability. For god's sake, Project Zomboid is a crowd-funded Alpha, with placeholder graphics and no implemented storyline and it's better than this AAA game.The S.T.A.L.K.E.R series is horrendously bug-ridden, but the utter dedication to immersion is what would make me recommend it over a game like this.Bottom-line; this game seems like a directionless attempt to cash-in on the zombie culture revival and hasn't committed to the bit.

I think the hardest part for me was putting down one of my own people after he was bitten, and he did not want to turn.SPOILERS!!!! Only thing that I would improve on is the community aspect. I felt that after a certain point, it became moot. As long as you had enough supplies (and supply caches seemed to pop up in random places all the time), it was too easy to keep everyone in line.

Sadly while it is a game that may not garner as much as higher priced video games it does have its own moments. Everyone who plays it has their own shameful moment in the game where they did something embarrassing. My worst moment came from when I decided to go shooting in a parking lot with a pistol trying to open up a hero for a start play. Wasn't thinking too much but after awhile I had gathered a large army of zombies because of the sound of my pistol. So I decided to throw a firebomb to open up a exit from the crowd. Fell too close, caught on fire, and ran into the crowd. Got knocked down and killed. This is one of many moments in the game everyone eperiences. Sure, you will find a moment in the game that is glitchy. I once saw a zombie running forever, unkillable. It was more like a ghost of a zombie, with the ghost still acting out its mortal body final moment before death. Even though there are problems so far I have seen a development group working as hard as possible to correct many of these errors. They are not done improving the game either. Now I will admit, you will need the breakdown dlc. That breakdown part is the sandbox game otherwise you will be stuck with just the story. The breakdown dlc is what makes the game so perfect. Graphics are dated compared to some other games, but who cares so long as you trying to build up your settlement to get into a rv to escape your death. Really havent paid attention to sound but there have been several moments in the game where i get completely surprised or scared just because the sound makes it worst then it really is. The best part is it is still being improved upon constantly and theres still a whole lot more going to be added yet. So come on and survive the zombie world with your own light machine gun. ( Game does include light machine guns, grenade launchers, smgs, and to take over a base. Not build a base but if enough people come in and demand the ability to fully build your own base and not just upgrade, I am sure we can get them to change their mind)."

I think it's a fun great open world game regardless though.Everything I wanted from a free roam survival zombie game. Throws you right in, it's brutal, it's awesome.PROS/INFO/EXPERIENCEYou build up a community of survivors, they aren't trained too well, just average people. Some have specific traits and background history which is quite interesting. Some may have low cardio and not be able to run as much. Others may have leadership, some may be good with guns/blunt weapons etc. You can train them in weapon specializations which is pretty cool.When you play a character you play as one of the survivors in your community. One thing I really love about this game - it has permadeath. If the survivor your playing as dies, he/she is gone. You have to search for other survivors, become friendly neighbors, help out in general.Was on a walk killing zombies casual chat with two random in game characters, make it back. Decide to leave alone to go explore the area, on the way back get torn apart by a feral. 10/10.Cool guns, silencers, melee, exploration, many buildings, scavening, vehicles, base upgrading, special zombie types, unique survivors, small stories within the game.Game has some modding support, I use a couple such as allowing the dlc weapons to spawn in the normal game.Vehicles - The vehicles in this game actually stay where you leave them. There are quite a few vehicles on the map, but it's important to take care of them because they eventually will run out.CONS/PROBLEMS (for some people)Alot of people say this game is buggy, and it is in some ways, it has problems. Sometimes the events will mess up, you have to walk outside the building you are defending to kill zombies to progress the mission.You are constantly warned about hordes of zombies, special zombies, or infestations. May get annoying, but it's a zombie apocalypse, makes sense.This game is repetetive. I have no problem with that because I like killing zombies, surviving, and open world games, but for alot of people this can most likely get boring after a couple of hours.CONCLUSION:If you're wondering how long the game takes to beat, most people beat it in around 15 hours, Im 23 hours in and haven't even completed the main mission. Mainly because I explore and scavenge alot. I also played a bit of breakdown which I played for a couple of hours.I would reccomend this game easily to alot of people I know, just check it out for yourself and see if you like it! If it goes on sale definetly pick it up!"

I feel like a lot was left off at the end, particularly when you have very few options of where to set up camp for a large group of people. Eventually the world's resources dwindle and you end up dying off, unable to continue your reign as master of the apocalypse. I understand this is what is  most likely to happen in the real world, but then again the real world is much bigger and scavenging for resources can last much longer when you aren't restricted to such a small collection of loot points.For me, the fun lasted for about 15-20 hours. I really wish more content and worldspace was crafted, but I feel like they ran out of time, tied it off and sold it before it truly came to fruition."

,Recommended,241540,7841566,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,TBWolf,"Very solid single player zombie game-- I've always looked for an open world zombie simulator like this one, and I'm fairly hooked now that I've found it! There's a pretty decent story, lots of stuff to do, and many cool things to factor in like being in charge of bases that you can upgrade, or the ability to barracade yourself inside a building to practice your shooting on passing zombies, and many more.I especially love the mechanic of having to gather resources and survivors for bases-- you often have to bring sacks of food/building material/ammo/fuel back to base in order to keep morale up, survive, and build stuff. In fact, base management is probably one of the most in depth systems this game has to offer, letting you move base location to a wide variety of spots, establish outposts based on how big your home base is, and creating a self-sufficient base that can grow food and has everything you need.That said, there are a few things that might turn some people off. For one, while this is an open world game so to speak, there's only 3 towns, and they're rather tiny. There is a decent bit of wide open area as well and you won't be short of things to do inside the towns, but if you're looking for a large expanse to explore and scavenge, you won't find it here.2nd: The game is pretty damn easy. It's really hard to die, even if you lose all your health you just spam spacebar for a revive. If you die again after that in a fight, you lose that character and maybe the ones who were fighting with you, but it's very rare that you die unless you afk in the middle of the road(That's how I lost Marcus, the main character :( )Zombies are easy to kill and you don't have to avoid getting bitten. In fact, hordes of zombies(10-15 zombies roaming together) can be killed in a few seconds by just running them over with a car, which you can do several times before the car takes significant damage.Overall, it's a great game still, and I would definitely recommend buying it if you enjoy doing objectives and following a storyline while still having the freedom to pretty much do whatever you want/go wherever you want in the map provided. I currently am still having a blast several hours in, which is more than I can say about a lot of the zombie games recently released! If only there was a way to have a multiplayer system in this game though....Ah well."
,Recommended,241540,29405716,Posted: 21 January,all,Roghisnzas,"Short ResuméThe game is a open world third person zombie survival game, that takes place in Thumbull Valley. You're running a small community of survivors, that you must help survive. To survive you must upgrade your compound(base), so that you can grow food, make meds and stuff.You're not playing as one specific character, but you can play as many different characters, that you have recruited.What did i like about the game?The game is one of it's kind. It has a unique play style, where you must go from base to base, leveling up traits and skills and complete the main story beside everything. Even though that the game have a lot of bugs, it doesn't really matter.The main story are taking around 8-10 hours to complete but it depends on a lot of things. There's also a lot of side quest you can do beside the main story. Every 5 minutes or so, there's a new mission to be done. An example of that, is that one of your community members are in danger and you must help him or her out of an attack from a lot of zombies. Another mission could be, that you must help a community member to kill a zed. Zeds are special zombies that can kill you easely if you aren't careful.There's also a lot of action in the game. It's fun that there's so many different ways to kill the zombies. You can drive through hordes of zombies, just to see them get teared apart. You can also use an automatic weapon, and kill a lot of zombies. The opportunities are unlimited.What did i NOT like about the game.The worst thing is the game is probaly that it is to easy. In the whole game, i only lost 1 community member to a Zed, by a mistake. I mean what the hell. It's a zombie apocalypse. People that you care about are supposed to die!Another thing that i don't like is the fact that you can't play coop, but later this year, state of decay 2 is getting released with a coop feature."

It's still a bit dodgy the way they disabled the original version in favour of the remaster, and I'm not sure how to feel about that as a business tactic, and I'm not positive that they didn't break the game on purpose for a while (and then fix it resultant of the backlash), but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and change the review back to Positive, because I loved this game and intend to play it again some day.First Edited Review:GAME NO LONGER WORKS.  FAR AS I CAN TELL, WAS INTENTIONALLY BROKEN TO FORCE YOU TO BUY THE REMASTER.  I'LL DO ONE BETTER AND NEVER BUY AN UNDEAD LABS GAME AGAIN.Original review:Fantastic game.  It doesn't feel as lonely as it could (not a fault, just something I was hoping for), but there's times when you may feel quite deperate.  If you die, you die.  No-one is there that isn't expendable.  Survival aspsects are done pretty well.  You'll always want to go out there prepared.  You never know when you'll be spotted by a horde.The final mission felt good.  That doesn't always happen.  And the last bit of voice acting actually made me feel something.  Great game but it certainly isn't for the voice acting, so it was good to see that where it counts they made it what it had to be.Overall, it's an open world survival game but very arcade-like, and it does it well.  I don't be buying games for more than a couple of bob, so perhaps I'd feel different had I paid something closer to the year-one survival edition launch price, but as it stands, this cost me half no-thing and I enjoyed every bit of it."

Now on to YOSE edition. I agree somewhat with what people say about YOSE and how it is a paid update BUT i think its more of the GOTY edition of state of decay it bundles everything into one nice package just with enhanced graphics and extra goodies. Now lets say this were bethesda who always make a *enter cool name here* edition of their games not many people complain about it the only difference here is that the devs have a few extra fixes in the mix. Mot only do they add extra goodies they reward 2nd time buyers with a perma-discount and an exclusive character aka they feel that they should reward you for supporting their game A 2ND TIME after you experienced the content that they released which is VERY rare for people to do so they aren't greedy monsters who want your money!

I'm not saying it needs to be a perfect MMORPG with AAA graphics and a perfect and touching story. I just want to make a base with my friends and act like we're in a zombie apocalypse together. you could at least just made it a little realistic while implementing a simple coop function or something so that some mates can play it together. but what am I saying, all of that sounds like hard work.Do I recommend this game?

I feel like I am constantly missing frames at times, the response time is low, and there are oddities. Even setting it to the most minimum graphical setting doesn't fully alleviate the problem.However the game is an interesting approach to somewhat Roguelike play. A character dies they are gone for good(although I do believe the supplies and stuff they had stay with their body so you can get it with another character). You have others and part of the game is managing the camp you use.

For me personally the base game doesn't have the replay value without the DLC. What prevents this game from getting a perfect 10 is the fact that there is no crafting of any type, other than a few basic things you can make with certain facilities.

Ienjoy this game and can see myself sinking several hours into it. Now, being that it is a single player experience it feels focused.

It's incredibly frustrating and unfair, LITERALLY it's an unfair game in just about every aspect... I consider the Dark Souls franchise fair... this game, not so much. It's a game that requires a ton of patience and free time so if you have a day job you might want to get your priorities straight before commiting to surviving a zombie apocalypse.That aside, I'll explain myself as best I can and give an accurate description based on what I've experienced thus far. It's a mixture of Resident Evil meets GTA meets Friday the 13th (NES) meets a bad Sim game. You switch back and forth between survivors with limited storage space, in a decent sized sandbox world, located on a boring map set taken straight out of Friday the 13th on NES... A giant loop with nothing but nonsense in the middle. While all of this is going on, you command your cronies to build medical centers and workshops so you can get a small perk here and there and keep the loafers alive and well, in case you kick the bucket and need a replacement.I realized this game was junk within the first few moments when I literally found a large backpack in the first place I searched... wow. Surely this couldn't be the highest storage unit in the game, could it? This early? Yup... I went from 8 slots to 10... that wasn't even enough space in Resident Evil! This game is a sandbox world where scavanging items is imperative to your survival and progression... *shaking head* ridiculous.So needless to say you spend the first, oh I dunno... 15 HOURS rummaging through dilapitated vacant houses scrounging up PEALS (That's Pills in Louis talk) and bags of chips (or crisps). All the while finding rucksacks full of wood, gas, medicine, dill-doe's etc... It's all junk YOU personally don't need to survive but is required for you to keep your ""live stock"" healthy. Yes, you only have one life to live in State of Decay and are quickly and easily replaced by your ""friends"" loafing around at your home base. In the off chance you've researched and upgraded a medical facility, there's a chance you'll be resurrected as long as you didn't blow yourself up with a grenade.So you basically take this game in very, very, VERY, slow baby steps... pretty much a crawl... until you gather enough resources, weapons and survivors to create a small armada of rootin' tootin' zombie killin' mach-ines. You have to level each character individually as well and equip them with crap you find laying around the world... Which is a fairly hard thing to do considering you need to carry around at least two melee weapons of your own, a gun, some ammo, chips, meds, a distraction item like firecrackers, maybe a pipebomb or grenade... so what does that leave you with? TWO maybe THREE slots to work with? Such an amazing design...I also love the part where my main character is tired from leveling up his level 7 katana skills and needs to rest for 24 straight hours... WHO THE HELL SLEEPS FOR 24 HOURS!? A hibernating bear, that's who, NOT PEOPLE. So now I have to switch to some noob, who's a complete headcase, that has a level 1 star in blunt weapons and need to start smacking zombies in the face with boards that have nails in them all over again... HOLY HELL this game is OB-NOX-IOUS.So after it takes you a week (of real time) to ransack the surrounding first suburb you'll slowly realize this game is very time strict (and boring)... Meaning every day (in game) that passes, more resources are being used by your room mates and the surrounding area does not replenish resources... ever. But what does continue to respawn are the zombies... so yeah, again, time is of the essence. If you choose to take too much time or are unlucky enough to not find anything worthwhile, the zombies will just bleed you dry and you'll basically be starting the game over on a new profile... Aren't you grateful this game is SO in touch with what a real Zombie Apocalypse would be like? /sarcasm.Essentially there are only three giant moves in this game (which is pretty bunk for a game with multiple bases and such NON-LINEAR gameplay...pfffffft) Get your home base established and then as soon as possible, MOVE to the south west warehouse and stay there until the finale... Then you can commandeer the fat palatio estate on military grounds and start bombing these undead ♥♥♥♥S with air strikes. It's a good thing I was able to figure this out quickly otherwise I pity the people who wasted their time moving in slow steps from one portion of the map to another trying to syphon resources around them... not worth it, go big or go home.Alright on to the controls, they blow pretty hard...nuff said.The story is garbage as well, it's a virtual scavenger hunt game like Fallout but with more zombies and less giant rad scorpions... save yourself, save others, escape and move on to another infested part of America, the end, you win?....riiiight.Also zombies clip through walls and doors and evidently have become illusionists because they seem to pop out of thin air like magicians assistants... too bad ammo caches don't do the same. :/Also be prepared for the inevitable back and forth, driving around in circles from the extreme north end to the extreme south end of the map over and over again until your head wants to explode from all the boring landscape... also the cars in this game are made from cardboard and glue... they blow up so easily it's just insanity.The topography is just a nightmare as well, indestructable wooden fences, mountains, boulders and trees litter every inch of the map that isn't paved road. So if you expect to take a short cut, expect to ram head first in to a wall or get stranded in a ravine looking for conveniently placed, step shaped rocks you can grapple on to. (In other words, don't explore a game where you're meant to explore)The graphics are abysmal, the animation is stiff and your character feels like you're driving around the Tin Man from Wizard of Oz... if only the dev's had a brain (I'm aware the scarecrow needed the brain but it's just funnier this way, and definitely more fitting with a game dealing with zombies, so shut your CAKE holes)All in all, it's great if you liked the tripe that was Friday the 13th on NES because it was so impossibly difficult to conquer without a guide of sorts, this game feels pretty much identical... and looks identical to boot... a gaint circle of BULL♥♥♥♥♥♥and NOTHING, aimlessly wandering around looking for the next piece of candy. If you don't have a plan, and prior knowledge of the layout of the game you've already lost both the game and time... both of which cannot be refunded.If you're like me and like having games spoon feed you a bit at the start and introduce you to the chaos slowly, so you can, YOU KNOW, actually GIT GUD at it, then you're going to hate this game.It basically throws you in to a STATE OF DISARRY (wink, wink) and softly says, ""Okay A-hole, clean up this mess and maybe then you can start to enjoy killing stuff""...Just another example of a game with an amazingly profound concept and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor execution... If more thought went in to this, it could be an amazing concept for an MMORPG but as a single player game with randomly respawning zombies, awful controls and combat and limited resources, it's not a good mix.Rating out of 10: Trash / 10.I'd rather play Resident Evil 6... and that game is only a step above this at a rating of Ballsack / 10.Cheers."

Melee/guns.Characters have skill trees you can somewhat customize.Special zombies with different abilities.Zombie hordes.Can build a community and build a base. (you pick from static locations) Meaning you can't build anywhere you want.SP Campaign.Cons:Only 1 map. The map does not change, ever.Mouse acceleration hardcoded into the game.Single player only.There is a ""best base"" on the map that you can pick for your survivor community and that kills replay value.Missions can become repetitive.You can't truly build your own base where you want because you have to pick from specific locations on the map that you can build inside.DLC: Repetitive and probably not worth the money considering the map doesn't change, thus there's no point to it.This games biggest drawback is the fact that the map isn't randomly generated, and it has no large cities on it, only small towns. There's a few things here that's making this single player zombie game a few short steps away from being nearly perfect. There's only 1 map that never changes and only has small towns in it. You can't truly build your own base, you need to pick from specific areas and 1 of these areas is much better than the rest, which kills replay value. It would have been nice with co-op as well, but yeah... this is only a 20 dollar game.for 20 bucks, its probably worth it. I enjoyed my time in it, I just wish the things I mentioned were an actual part of the game. I'm not sure if the pros outweigh these drawbacks.I'll say this, the game was fun, but the fact that the map isn't randomly generated, no cities, and you can't truly build your own base where you want, exactly how you want, it almost makes it not worth it in the end. I enjoyed it, but I wish it was different in these regards. Good... but it could have been so, SO much better. I enjoyed the game but at the same time I was also very disappointed by it. I would not recommend it because that's all you feel after you play it, disappointment. Disappointment in regards to why these key features aren't a part of the game."

,Recommended,241540,21663873,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"I'm a sucker for anything zombie related and State of Decay  was basically a dream come true. I heard about this game a long time ago and was guttered to find out it was going to be a xbox 360 exclusive. I jumped with joy however when I learned it was coming to PC. What were my feelings when it came onto PC, disappointed but satisfied.You're put into an open world infested by zombies and one thing that I like about the game is tht it literraly puts you right into the action. It doesn't give you any sort of tedious and padded out opening, it put you into the action. I'm not saying I don't like those sort of games as most game that do that end up being one of my favourite games of the year (The Walking Dead.) Gameplay works as a sort of third person shooter with stealth and melee combat. One bad thing I find the combat is that it's way too easy. Attack, attack, attack, reversal, rinse and repeat. Other parts that are included in the game prove to be a challenge. Mangement of resources, mission objectives expire so that means you need to question what your camp needs more of with a chance that you may never gain that amount of resources. It's also incredibly fun to play aswell, exploring the open world, exploring buildings that might contain resources but on your way home a horder could come for you and the resources will slow you down. Also when a survivor dies, they're permanately dead, you'll have to use a different surivor in your camp.Graphics are beautiful but they could be better. I noticed a few pop ins and badly textured rocks, moss and foliage. There were also quite a few times where performance took a turn for the worse. I experienced multiple frame ratedrops which is apparently something the Xbox version suffered from. I also experienced a few game breaking bugs and multiple crashes.You will want to replay State of Decay again even after finishing the story, as you will want to see if you can keep your survivors alive for a second time through.Pros+ Good unique ideas+ Good gameplay+ Good graphics+ ReplayabilityCons- Crashes- Frame rate drops- Some bad texturesFinal Verdict: 8/10Steam Curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

The storyline is a bit iffy, but the customisation's in game mixed with the elements of survival make this game different from the other zombie surivival games. Every npc you come across and befriend can be a ""switch-to"" playable character, your starting character has a selection os passive skills and ability's and perks, each other npc u choose to play has various different passive's, ability's and perks, making the game play experience different, you might want the heavy gun expert for a group of infected, but then switch to the keen eye'd medic to help save a fellow survivor whom has a skillset you want to tryout. The enemies have veriety seen in many zombie games, and this game has the potential to add more in that aspect. Finally the game offer's a gta style of play, you can choose to steal a car & then take it home to improve it, and drive from one small town to the next, which really sets this apart from other zombie games that are centralised into a much smaller setting. 6.5 / 10 so far with possibility to become 8.5 / 10, it's a WIP."

The game pretends to have a resource management aspect, but everything is so incredibly abundant - like, two orders of magnitude more abundant than what would start to vaguely resemble something approaching scarcity - that it might as well not be there.*The combat is incredibly dull. Melee combat (no skill, just spamming buttons) is so effective that firearms are rendered essentially irrelevant. Before long, you'll start dreading being spotted by the zombies, not because they can end your life, but because you'll be locked in another repetitive mashfest for another several minutes.*In what's perhaps one of the most wrongheaded game design decisions of all time, the authors decided to link resource consumption to real world time. So, if you do the entire game in one sitting, nobody has to eat ever, basically. Not that it would have mattered otherwise, because as already mentioned, everything is plentiful to the point of irrelevancy.*The game is full of idiosyncrasies that throw you off. For instance, in one mission you're required to barricade a house in preparation for a zombie attack. The house has some 4 small windows that are barricadable, and one HUGE glass window that's not, no reason given. You think the game bugged out and start freaking when the zombies approach (at this point you still don't realize how little threat they represent), only to realize they uncannily ignore the huge window entirely. The game just doesn't consider it an entry point - real world logic be damned - and it doesn't bother to explain that to you. But no matter, now you've barricaded everything, and the mission doesn't end. What's going on? Oh, right. The game forgot to tell you, now that everything's barricaded, you have to get out there and fight them all. Which begs the question of why you're barricading to begin with.*There's no actual simulation or emergent behavior going on. No matter how many zombies you kill, it's never going to make a global difference; more will be randomly respawned. Zombie and survivor migration, uneven resource depletion of areas, survivor competition, none of that is simulated.*As a result of everything above, everything you do starts feeling like a chore. No gruelling life or death decisions, no tactics, no strategy, just♥♥♥♥♥♥that needs doing. Might as well stop playing now and go wash that pile of dishes in the sink."

I'm not even kidding, everything feels so satisfying to do, killing zombies, getting supplies, saving people, everything you do feels worth it and and like your actually achieving something, which alot of games fail at... especially Survival Instincts, bleh. Most things are random generation as well! zombie hordes, special zombies, surviors and events, all making it hard to get bored of this game, which is a very good thing!Its arcadey becuase its clearly directed for console, but as long as I can play it on my gaming PC on full graphics im totally happy. There alot of glitchyness as well where zombies do weird things and get stuck, but its easy to shoot them out of it or just move along. Theres so many goods in this game its easy to ignore any minor flaws, what game dosent have glitches? Look at Oblivion, its famous for them. XD9.5 out of 10! been waiting for a zombie stragety/action/RPG/simulation game this satisying for a very long time, all you ever got before this was overdone FPS crap, this game shows the zombie genre is not perfect unless it has survival and stragety elements! cas duh, its an apocalyse, most of the game should be just about surviving. Although there is no eating or drinking to stay alive and such, there is stamina and health, recoverd by eating food or taking meds, and once your character dies they die! rather horribly...a big incentive to run, hide and stay alive as best you can, so it is survival at its core, you always feel on edge even tho your badass as hell.I promise you 20 bucks for this game is a steal! even if you do have to use an XBOX remote to play this game properly for now its just great sandbox fun, I cant wait for PC controls for proper shooting and a better PC experiance!. ^^"

The game may not look pretty ( came from Xbox 360), but it certainly has a lot of replay value and fun along with immersion. You're a survivor and the main point of the game is to survive by scavenging what you can, when you can... and trying to build a community despite the zombie threat that surrounds you. You can have multiple characters and switch between each one, and each character can die. Once they die, they're dead for good and you cannot reload a previous save.The game is a bit unoptimized for PC, you may see a stutter here and there and ugly textures, but graphics is not what makes a game. If you are bothered by the looks of the game, there is a ""State Of Decay: Year One Survival Edition"" coming out Spring 2015 that will be a remastered version of the game made for ""next-gen"" technology. It will look better, play better, run better. It will contain all the DLCs so far and bring new content and features to the game. I suggest picking that up.All in all, State Of Decay is a great game, but not the prettiest one out there. I also suggest visiting State Of Decay Nexus website to find mods to enrich your experience in the game. Once Year One Survival Edition comes out, this franchise may become something fantastic and new."

Nice story line and the play for the most part is great.There are a few things that I would love to see changed such as if you accidentally click a build you should be able to stop building it without wasting all the resourses and time. After all in real life we are never forced to continue building something we realize was a mistake.Then there is some issues with damage and wear on objects. for the most part it is excessive but understanding the game is trying to force people to keep moving and look for resources i get it. I think it could be done better by giving them more stuff to look for rather than them having to replace the steel bar they have been beating zombies to death with because it miraculously breaks or your gun wears the hell out or some such thing. I clean and maintain my real firearms I haven't been forced replace a single part on any of them in decades even with the tens of thousands of rounds through some of them.All in all the game was worth the money and will provide a lot of game play."

Major issues include a sheer overload of missions that must be completed within a certain time frame or they are failed. Terrible AI that requires the player’s constant intervention to correct. And perhaps most damning is the fact that the game world continues between play sessions, so that any progress you make in gathering resources, fulfilling missions and recruiting other survivors is set back when you next log on to play again. You might spend hours working to recruit survivors from another enclave only to log back in on your next session to discover they have all been killed through no fault of your own.

I continue to try really hard to focus on the positives but the negatives are too overwhelming for me to really get into the game. First of all - the game looks terrible. I understand it was developed for the Xbox 360 and was limited by 8 year old technology but c'mon now...they could have at least upscaled it and done more to make the game look better for the PC but it seriously feels like I'm playing something from the PS2 generation of video games and it's really hard for me to ignore. The animations for characters, driving, and zombies is just atroicious. It's way too mehnical and basic and it feels like the developers didn't really care about animations. I really hate how buggy the game still is. Zombies walk through walls a lot. Screen tearing and graphical glitches happen too much.Open world is all about immersion and I know this complaint will probably sound stupid but State of Decay plays too much like a video game. Like...I'm not immersed into the game at all which is suppose to be open world. I want to feel like I am apart of the world that I am playing in like I do in other open world games like Skyrim, or Fallout, or even Red Dead Redemption - State of Decay doesn't pull me in at all. I feel like I'm playing a glorified arcade game which in itself is not a bad thing but this game is marketed as open world and while that is true it really, really lacks at atmosphere and immersion.I think State of Decay has a solid foundation to build upon for future open world zombie games. It's an okay first attempt but its very unpolished and has way too many flaws for me to really enjoy the game but I think with a few more years and more time for development the concept of an open world zombie game has a bright future."

Zombies randomly spawn in areas you JUST cleared, vehicles breakdown too quick, especially considering they are the only effective weapon in the game.

I only got a few hours of actual game time, because this game is a terrible port from console.Yes, these are the days where games are developed for consoles and then ported to PC; no longer are the days where games are made specifically for PC. This would be fine if the company would invest some time porting the codebase over. i read somewhere that this is the result of the drivers required to run this on the 360, and they never changed it when they ported it. Basically, a bunch of people have issues where their graphics cards massively overheat. About half of those people end up with a kernel deadlock. About half of those people, can't get a fix that works.This is the kind of thing I would expect from an alpha, or beta, or even a fresh released game. This game has been out since Nov of 2013 though...this is pathetic. To make matters worse, their support consists of one lady, who can't help you because she has no support from the devs. I went through the usual channels, of me sending them the dxdiag to make sure all my system was in a good state, then she recommmended all the things I can easily google for myself that I already know for a fact didn't work, then she went silent for about a month. The only reason I ever talked to her again, is because I had to send a reminder, asking if she had any progress from the devs. These people had the audacity to have the dev send me a single sentence, telling me to enable vsync...something that I can easily find on how to make ANY game run easier.Pros:- you can cook eggs on your graphics cardCons:- support is near non-existent, and pathetic- the game is in the state of an alpha or beta, even still a year after its actual full release- the overheating issue I described applies to a wide variety of cards, by my research. If you buy this game you run a big riskI have a i7930, but the big thing here is graphics cards, which is a HD RADEON 5870 which I ran with the latest drivers, and the drivers prior to the latest drivers to be sure. This is certainly not a card that I would expect to struggle with a mediocre graphics game like State of Decay.I got my refund through Steam after explaining the support conversation and showing them how pathetic the company and game was."

There's a better version of Resident Evil (the original one) as well but does that mean the old one now stinks? No of course not. And you have to pay for the new updated Resident Evil too, same as State of Decay Year One Edition.So is this game now bad. Absolutely not. It's a great game. I've finished it and all the DLC.I could have bought the new version when it was discounted but it's pretty much the same game , if you want slightly better visuals get it, I don't think it's worth getting myself, not unless it was on a sale for under $5/£5.I'd still give this version a solid 8/10 and a blue thumbs up."

I wanted that team survival, build up the base , have a connection kinda game, like on the walking dead. This game just hits it well for me so far ( 2 hours in ).Pro's- The game is evolving as you play, as you get more people in your base, you will see more zombies!- Hits the G spot ( for me ).- Make friends, you can play as them when your guy needs to rest or if you die!- You get to manage your base.- Is not hard to understand but can be hard if you don't know when to run.- Runs pretty smooth.- Day/night cycle.- Cars are fun, your best friend.Con's- some unique zombies. I personally only like dumb slow zombies, But this does not take away from the game!- Sometimes ( for me ) you feel like you might have looked over a quest you wanted to do by accident.- No hostile groups of people that I know of.- Zombies can't one shot ( bite ).9/10"

Outright bad, unoptimized and lackluster port of an extremely buggy game by itself that has interesting concept, nice gameplay and something people call 'charm'.If you've spent hours and days modding Unreal, Quake, Far Cry, Dead Island or STALKER and are ready to spend 5-6 hours of your time to fix the most obvious bugs by yourself, then by all means buy the game and Breakdown DLC. If you are a ""customer/consumer"" type that wants to buy a product and enjoy it - STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME, it's ♥♥♥♥ed up and barely playable, dev team is small, bug fixing is slow, you'll only get frustrated by bying it.Long story, pros and corresponding cons:+ SImple and addictive hoarding gameplay- Extremely poor coding: lots of ingame mechanics that should ADD things for you to use rewarding your efforts OVERWRITE your stocks instead and you end up losing tons of stuff you've spent hours to get. Includes ammo, meds, snacks, silencers etc.+ Deep base and morale management systems- Which are glitchy as ♥♥♥♥: your walls randomly require repairs regardless if any zombie hordes reach your base or not, Outposts (facility that you build in a building with some resource to get some of that resource daily) either don't give you anything at all (namely Medicine and Fuel outposts) or work regardless if you have resoureces to keep them running or not (Ammo ones). Skilled survivors that mow through zombie hordes like living tanks run away screaming if they encounter a single horde as a random event. And there still are more than a dozen of such bugs.+ Gorjeous 'level up by use' leveling system: the more you run the more stamina you have, the more you slash, the better you slash, the more you shoot - the faster you reload etc.- By now, you must've already guessed it. Yes, it's bugged, oh God it is. Damage source tracking is nonexistent, you get exp for killing zombies for your current weapon regardless of what killed them. Throw a Molotov at a horde and start slashing air in front of you - and you'll get a ton of exp for bladed weapons. Rinse and repeat.- Hard-coded limit on the amount of things you can have (due to xbox memory limitations). After 15 or so hours of gameplay you'll start spending more time juggling stuff around deciding what to keep than actually looting new stuff. All items and guns are repaired daily for free and you'll end up destroying 70% of things that you've spent hours to get because there is physically no way to use up that much and no way to store that much either.- Game was patched and overhauled so many times that many changes aren't logged anywhere, there is also no manual. For example, the game says that levelling up Cardio skill (run a lot) increases your available stamina. In fact, it also increases stamina regeneration rate and decreases rate of stamina consumption when you sprint. And there is a ton of things like this, go figure stuff out.- No multiplayer- Very poor PC optimization (controls are mostly fine though)- Poor physics- Zero modding support, loads of bugged hard-coded stuff that is unfixable via CryEngine's configs and xml sheets.- Very few features and game mechanics half of which are bugged- Eventually zombies become so numerous (mostly at night) that game engine is unable to handle that much and zombies become immune to any form of harm, but they still can harm you! Ensures loads of fun.- Inconsistent realism: for example you need a special tier 3 facility to repair vehicles, that takes a ton of time and resources to build, yet melee weapons and guns are repaired daily for free with tier 1 facility and neither of two requires a mechanic nor some kind of resource. People that are sleep deprived treat it by consuming FOOD and so on. Eventually it gets mind-blowing.I can go on like this for hours. I've actually fixed some of this stuff, some was fixed by guys at forums and Nexus, devs themselves rolled out 5 patches already but still it feels like an alpha or a tech demo of some sort.This was long, but fair.Cheers."

It hands you a (mostly) open world filled with survivors and zombies, and leaves you to make the big decisions, scavenge, and help others depending on where you want to go with the game.The game itself is a mission based apocalypse simulation with a smattering of RPG elements.  You're periodically handed missions - of varying types, everything from scavenging for supplies, to rescuing survivors, to establishing or upgrading home bases and outposts.  Along the way you meet several new communities of survivors, both good and ""not so good"", who you can assist and then even invite into your own enclave for protection.You're not limited to playing any one character.  As characters tire or become injured, you can switch off to another character in order to further complete missions or to simply ""level up"" their skills.  Speaking of skills, this game cleverly includes several RPG elements;  you can increase your cardio, fighting, shooting, and other skills for general character improvements, and as these skills level up, you're allowed to choose specializations for each character in order to make them more effective at the tasks.SoD also takes things a step beyond other zombie games by adding group morale/moods.  The occasional pep-talk must be given to keep other survivors in good spirits, and your enclave as a whole has a ""morale"" that must be kept up by wiping out nearby infestations, providing adequate supplies, and progressing the game.By far the most interesting and exciting feature of the game is that the game continues on even after you've stopped playing.  If you exit the game and leave your enclave with few supplies or someone in bad spirits, you're likely to log in to find survivors missing or killed, morale has dropped a great deal, and even your entire enclave wiped out.  However, if you leave your group in good spirits with plenty of supplies, outposts, and a high morale, you're likely to log in to increased supply reserves, your group in good spirits, and several new mission opportunities.After all, this is a game of survival, and only the most fit will do so.All in all, desite a few minor (IMHO) flaws, this is the zombie game I've been waiting for - if you're looking for a game that puts you in the shoes of a zombie apocolypse survivor, this is definitely the game for you.Pros-Fairly open world zombie apocalypse simulation.Missions are for the most part interesting and applicable.Character skills and specializations add variety to playable characters.Scavenging adds to the realism of the game.The group morale is a clever idea that keeps the game moving along.Combat is generally fun, with a decent variety of weapons and supplies.Persistent world - your group continues on, even after you've stopped playing.Mod community - the mod community for this game is growing every day.Cons-There are still a few bugs to be worked out.The occasional crash (I've had 3 in 7 hours of playtime)Graphics could use some polish and better textures.Enemy clipping through walls, fences, etc.Combat animations are a bit long and stamina depletes a bit too quickly.State of Decay is a solid 8/10 and easily worth the price of admission."

Anyone that thinks otherwise, has not survived long enough to drive a pickup truck through a hoard at speed. Or passes out at the sight of blood.

If you have a buddy left alive, you can get the backpack your recently deceased comrade has left behind with him or her. You cannot get the skills, experience, and training back that has gone into your comrade however.Now I know what you are thinking, mulligan, do-over, re-load from a previous save, etc...  but just wait though, there is more! You will hate the game as much as you love it because, it auto saves . So NO do-overs. YOU ARE DEAD. Now with that in mind you really do fear death in this game, and you will every minute of it!

,Recommended,241540,7828841,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Havouk,"Now, when I first caught eye of this game I couldn't help but sighing and thinking to myself: ""Not another zombie-game"". Don't get me wrong, I love zombies and the zombie apocalypse concept. There has just been so many zombie games as of late that the idea of yet another had dried up for me. But this game really got me hooked. The survivors you play and manage become a sort of investment as you level them up, as they can easily get killed even if they're far down the skilltree you've been working on for the specific survivor.A downside is that the random missions are essentially repetitive, aside from the main story missions, they can and due to the survival aspects of the game, will grow tiresome.Which brings me to the main story line. It's nothing new in the story being told, which I don't really have a problem with. Seeing as the only option imaginable, during a zombie apocalypse, would be to adapt, overcome and survive. The only problem with it, is that some of the missions has a time window, and if you miss that, the mission are gone forever unless you restart. So make sure you keep track of your time, in case you await sunrise, or want to complete some other missions first. Although the game really peaks my interest by being so open, the main protagonist can actually die, or you can complete the game without playing with him at all. There's a vast open world for you to explore, and seeing how you constantly have to work for finding food and other resources, it keeps you pushing forward into it."

,Recommended,241540,7829031,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Coolicy,"This game is a true masterpiece. The thing that held the game back was the fact that it started as a XBL game. Which means that they had a 2GB size limit, limited hardware to work with, and a control system more tailored to consoles than PC. The PC version has been given a bit more love by adding higher resolution, better graphics, a full M+KB control scheme, and smaller touches to take advantage of stronger PC hardware.That doesn't diminish what this game HAS managed to accomplish though. It's incredibly ambitious for a downloadable game, and is executed very well. The survival aspect can get hard at first, and lacks a good tutorial to explain all the systems in play, but once you get past the learning curve the game is incredibly fun. The combat and exploration all makes sense in a zombie apocalypse world. In many instances, it felt like a single player version of Day Z, and it's definitely what War Z WANTS to be but failed.The game is already not very expensive at full price for what it offers. Definitely pick it up when you can. A sale is just a cherry on top of this very good ice cream. If you're a fan of zombie games, you won't want to miss this."

But it would be 10x better if you could play multiplayer on it. I would love to play with my friends in this game. Also, new maps would be amazing, like in the second expansion you get to play a whole new map and i loved that! So much more area to explore, new cars, new weapons, new homes, objectives, it was like a whole new game! Probably the last thing i would want to add is first person.

I played through the whole game as Marcus, the default starting character and whilst the game does lower your stanima after a period of time, it always happened as soon as I was done playing for the day. So on the next day, Marcus was once again 100%.Now I do love this game and am startng the Dlc's soon but by the endgame, Marcus was so over-powered that the only enemy that ever gave me thought was the juggernaught's which I just ran over mutiple times with crappy cars to be rid of them.So In the end, the game is great and a whole load of fun to play and I recommend it fully, but try to swap around with charcaters if you want to experiment.PS: Take a car everytime you go scavengening, the boot's of cars can hole extra supplies so you can have more than one main Home Supply, it would have saved me at least 3 hours if I had known this."

I thought i might have to do that again but then i lost 2 people in about half an hour and i am actually scared. There are way more weapons, an awesome map, a way better sense of HOLY CRAP IM GOING TO DIE, and there are WAY WAY WAY more zombies. I am not kidding on that last statement, in normal state of decay in a warehouse there are about 5, in this there are about 12 AND a feral (that's how a major squadmate of mine died, RIP KILO). I give lifeline a 9/10, only issue is the AI is still stupid enough to run out during sieges and kill themselves. AND DID I MENTION ZOMBIE SIEGES!? BECAUSE THEY ARE AWESOME AS F***"

And they managed to still make it irritating to play. It's really close to being great, and the only real problem I have with it is how bad the human AI is. The zombie AI is top notch, but the humans make me think that this is set in a universe where only the idiots have survived the initial outbreak. They won't follow you at somepoints for no apperent reason, which leads to them getting torn apart. Even if you are in a car and trying to escape, they would rather just stand still and die. I can't fully describe how bad the human AI is, so I'll leave that alone for now.The controls aren't terrible, but they aren't great either.With a melee weapon it reminds me of a hack n' slash if you get in over your head, which makes it a little more survivable if you just start swinging for the fences when surrounded. But the weapons tend to break incredibly easy. You can repair them at any storage locker in your base if you're built the required stuff, but if you get overwhelmed, they'll break after only a few zeds have been taken out.Gun play in the game is okay, but it doesn't seem like there is a huge difference between them all, except the different calibers do lend a bit of variation, not much though. Reloading is pretty fast, but for some of them it seems like the character is taking their sweet time to ask the gun how its day went. And I do have a pet peeve about some guns using the same ammo as others. (A .50 pistol using the same ammo as a .50 rifle kinda stops my suspension of disbelief, but that's a personal  thing.)The game is kinda glitchy. Zeds just walking through closed doors, my character inexplicably teleporting to the other side of a house during a fight was annoying. And a few other odd things similar to all that, but not necessary to put after those two main points.The cars are pretty solid. They actually can take a bit of punishment before breaking altogether, plus you can slap a zombie with your door.The different zombies you encounter add a bit of drama to the game, but they aren't anything new. Strong zombie, loud zombie, super tough zombie, explosive zombie, etc.Micro-managing your group is pretty solid. But the inability to actually build up your fortifications beyond boarding up the windows and making some gun platforms kinda brings me back to my point of only the idiots surviving. Having zombies be able to climb right into your compound and survivers just standing around while someone is getting chewed on actually made me laugh, then gave me a headache because I was afraid to leave them alone to do the whole playing-the-dang-game thing.As you can imagine, the part where the world keeps moving after you leave the game coupled with the derpyness of the AI can lead you to stop caring about them altogether.Even when the character I had been playing as since I started the game died, all I could say was ""Meh"". I find it really hard to care about characters when they don't care about themselves.Alright, this review paints a pretty grim picture about the game, but if it's on sale, go for it. Don't do what I did and pay full price for it and its DLC. (Which all went on sale the day after I bought it...)I can't say it's the worst game I've ever played, but I really don't want to recommend it to anyone, either.Buy at your own risk, I suppose."
,Recommended,241540,10321342,"Posted: 2 June, 2014",all,Ruski,"State of Decay has done what many other early access games have attempted: actually contributed a rather polished version of an alpha-type game to the community. Although it isn't perfect, it is incredibly detailed and, to keep it simple, extremely fun.Zombie themed games seem to be the new trend, with titles sprouting from the out-stretched wings of mods like Day Z. The problem with most of these emerging titles is simple: Although they are foundered on incredible ideas and concepts, they're kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's just being brutally honest. I'm not a huge fan of zombie-content entertainment, although I do enjoy it when it is done well. It's a genre that has allowed people to fantasize what life would be like in a post apocalyptic world.So what does State of Decay do that others don't? Well that's just it, it doesn't do a lot that others don't. It does pretty much the same as the rest, but much much better. That's the number one key difference. Polish. Now I am not saying that it doesn't have unique features, because it does, I just don't necessarily believe those features to be ""key"" in terms of success. This takes what people love about zombie content, and instead of over-complicating the content, it embraces it with simplicity. Do you want to smash a zombies head in? Of course you do. So do it! Do you want to own your own sports car, considering the guy who used to own it is probably drooling and walking down the street with an awkward limp? Yep, so take it. Society has collapsed, so build your own community and make it work, or die. Simple.Some features that make this title a front running in the zombie genre:1. Single player. That's right, single player. I don't always want my games filled with annoying children that think it is fun to go out of their way to ruin the experience for other people. Sometimes it's a super fun and cool aspect to a game, other times it's just plain frustrating.2. Simple controls, and simple enough gameplay. It doesn't take days to master the controls. If you wanna smash some zombies, do it. Just be aware that your characters are not god-like, and will get into trouble if you're not careful.3. Consequences - the above point explains this pretty well. Running into a horde is generally a really bad idea. In fact, avoiding zombies in many cases is by far the best option. But hey, if you feel the need to do so, I'd suggest using a character you really don't care about, as death is perm.4. Good story, good chracters.5. Do your best to manage your small community. It's not always hard to do, but keeping the right balance is. If you wanna spend hours upon hours running for supplies to keep everyone happy, cool.6. Perma-death. Coolest aspect of the game. Makes raiding abandoned houses in the dark that much more tense.7. The game continues to play while you're away from your computer. Let's face it, the zombie apocalypse doesn't halt because you have work or school. It's brutal, but a cool feature.Features to not get so excited about:1. ONLY single player. I know right, contradicting myself a little! But this game would be cool if co-op was an option.2. There are still little bugs to work out. Nothing game-breaking, at least not for me. But something to be aware of when buying early access.3. The game continues when you're away from your computer. I know, another contradiction. Although this is a super cool feature, it can be heart breaking when one of your beefed up characters decides to off-himself/herself while you're finishing that assignment, or working some overtime. All part of the experience in my opinion though.4. It gets a little repetitive. Like ALL games, there is a ceiling of entertainment value. This has a high ceiling, but not high enough. Being solely single player lowers it slightly.5. Finally, I can't play this game when my girlfriend is home as she is terrified of all zombie content. Why? I made her watch 28 days later when we first started dating. As she was heading off home in her car, and pulling out of my driveway, I pretended to be a zombie, sprinting after her car waving my arms around like a psycho. She now has a phobia of zombies. So babe, I am sorry for being a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You'll probably never get to read this, but this is the only apology I'll ever give, as it was hilarious watching your tires screech and smoke zooming out of my driveway. This has no bearing on the actual game, State of Decay, just a limitation of my own experience.All in all, you should buy this game. I haven't really covered everthing in this review, as I believe most people should experience most features of the game for themselves. But to sum it up, it's worth the money, and it's a very entertaining experience that will leave you wanting more. Good luck, and keep your weapons in top notch condition!"

This combines those two. I dont want to compare it to Dead Island to much because they are different. The open world allows you to enter any building and there are so many places to explore! The missions have the feeling to dead rising where if you dont complete them soon, they will end. BUT it isnt as stupid as dead rising because the time to complete things is in real world time. Also this game is permadeath meaning once your character dies, you have to play another one. You can switch between survivors you find any time when you are in safehaven.

Sometimes the buddy system can be kinda... bad? Why cant i tell my friend to take a big bag of construction materials? instead i have to clear the house and radio in a scavanger (Funny part was when i used one of the characters as a buddy, found supplies, couldnt found out to order him to pick it up, Ended up sending him home and radio in a scavanger. Same character came running 5 minutes later :P )The RPG element feels well implented, but at times it works strange. Some characters will start with 1's accross the board. Others will almost be maxed out the first time you touch them, it makes of an uneven (but challanging!!!) experience. When it comes to combat i should warn you that when it comes to gun handling. They dont snap to target, which is nice, but sometimes the hitbox wont work, and you'll waste precious bullets! Guns are sparse and far appart, which is good! Aswell as the noise you make when you use them. First time i went into the major city (Marshall) I ended up cornerd in the middle of the night. Used my rifle and i just saw my minimap flash up with red zeds. I have to say i was on the edge of my seat! :)If there was one thing to really complain abvout, it had to be the cars. There are so damn many of them! And sure, they make noise, get damaged, attracts zombies, But they dont do it enough! Cars should, in my eyes, be a last resort. You shouldn't be able to casually drive around the game and feel like a wrecking ball of death. Why isn't there a penalty for using them? A bigger one that is? Maybe you get swarmed by hoards? (which should be a lot bigger!!) Just saying. I try not to use cars as much due to the god-like feeling when just ramming things sends them flying.7/10Ps I hope they add more/bigger maps! i'd love a bigger town/city!

I fully recommend getting the Breakdown DLC as it allows you to play a more 'open world' mode even though its the same world map as the original story mode. There's lot's of little bells and whistles to go with in Breakdown. First off, if you unlock achievements in Breakdown, these go toward unlocking different 'hero' characters you can start a new game with. You don't HAVE to start as Marcus. If you did well enough the first play-through, you can start with K.C. or Amelia or even Heather LaRue (""Oh, honey! Thats wonderful!).The game PLAYS in the 3rd person very similarly to Red Faction: Guerilla. In fact, it's VERY similar to that only more fluid. The physics for driving the vehicles, however, is really one of the only few CON's to the game. I get the feeling like im driving my car/truck/suped-up-rallysport-hatchback on the moon and at high speed one little  pebbled will send your car flying and tumbling.The assortment of weapons is amazing! With Breakdown you get MORE. There's A LOT of weapons to find and they will be spawning different kinds in different places every time you start a new game or advance a difficulty level.There's no shortage of things to do and you'll often find yourself detracting from small ""missions"" peppered about the game to go out and scavenge supplies.I HIGHLY recommend this game!

The base building while simple has some depth due to the inability to fit every upgrade in a single base. The way they have implemented having a group instead of a single survivor is fantastic. Especially with the perma-death mechanic - meaning that you value your highly skilled or specialist survivors more than you would otherwise.Combat is satisfying with melee combat feeling visceral and ranged gunplay is similarly enjoyable. However it is a shame that undead labs couldn't afford to hire more voice actors because the lack of variation in voices can pull you out of immersion. On the other hand though the voice actors which they have are good there are enough not to ruin it. Breakdown dlc expands the game significantly making it far more enjoyable as the breakdown game mode allows for way more replayability.To sum it all up, this game is fun, challenging and i think im going go play it now that they've just released the new lifeline dlc."

It runs well, and it's a little tense at times. It feels like a much less hardcore DayZ- which helps fill the DayZ void in my life right now. With only an entertainment oriented PC with HD 3000 graphics, this game was a God send for my zombie fix. One thing I would suggest is downloading the graphics mod (basically it actually makes the graphics settings the way they should be- because shadows and bloom should not be on, on minimum visual quality- which the mod fixes). My only minor gripe at the moment is that the camera can be a bit wonky, and it pays to use a controller. Mouse and keyboard are not ideal for this game, and I understand why. It's worth the money, and hopefully when I get some more cash (and if I like the game enough) I'll probably invest in the second DLC for this game."

This game is as close to my dream of a proper zombie apocalypse survival simulator as any game has ever come. The player controls a group of survivors that can be added to by completing various missions and helping out fellow survivors. Once your relationship with others increases to a certain point you can take control of them and use them at any time. Every character has their own special abilities, and personalities, even going so far as including a list of hobbies and former occupations, which is a nice little touch. However, care must be taken as once a survivor dies, that's it. They're gone forever.Underneath the action style gameplay, hides a very deep rpg sytem, where survivors can level up certain stats, giving them access to new abilities as they are played. Just like Skyrim, these stats are only raised by using them, so if you want to level up your shotgun ability, you better equip a shotgun and get Zed hunting. The bulk of the gameplay involves searching for supplies for your base to keep your group fed, and healthy, as well as building supplies to better improve your fortifications against zombie attacks. I can't explain it, but the ocd in me loves going house to house and searching ever nook and cranny for supplies, and seeing each building getting slowly ticked off your map once they're fully searched just kept me going.If there is one thing I could recommend in future games in the series, it would be to have the map and characters be randomly generated on each playthrough. On the one hand, it is nice to see so much care be put into handcrafting the map, but that also means you see the exact same map every time you play. Don't get me wrong, the map is deceptivly big, but once you've played the game for awhile you'll have pretty much every square inch of it memorized. Plus there's a set number of survivors so you'll encounter the same group of people every single time you play the game. Not a huge complaint, but it would add some longevity to the game to have some rogue-like elements to it.Overall, I freaking love this game, and I'm looking forward to putting in another heaping of hours into the steam version. Can't wait to see what Undead Labs can do with future entries into the series!"

This game's focus is on the ""community"" of survivors banding together, scavaging, and hunting zombies to survive. By ""community"", I do mean a gaggle of people so pants-on head r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d they can hardly find their way out of a cardboard box without you there to hold their hand. The ""community"" is more absorbed with how much influence (this game's currency) you have than with actually accomplishing anything.That being said, running various zombies down in a vehicle has yet to get tiresome. Beating zombies senseless with a weapon or the slo-mo cut scenes of you caving their skulls in with your feet or knee remain vicseral and satisfying.It's a pity there's no multiplayer (even just 1-4 players), expanded base-building options, or much for replayability as the campain is the same everytime minus random loot and random zombie spawns.Overall, amuzing and worth the money if you're looking to kill/build in a zombie themed world."

However there is no excuse for them to have not polished it up by now or fixed a lot of these issues. In fact this expansion somehow feels like it controls even worse than the original and I've been randomly experiencing an infinite spawning horde of zombies at random points in the game. They clearly aren't planning on fixing anything and would rather just pump out more scenarios for you to scream at your monitor when none of the controls respond to what you are commanding.So basically don't waste your money on this dribble they puked out.

I am enjoying it but actually finding the waves too frequent for me to get any of the tasks done. Maybe that's the point - having to choose between rescuing a survivor, gathering the missing supplies for an upgrade, or clearing an infestation next to your base, and then having to return only to desperately defend your base with your lives.

Its one of those games you come along that you don't expect much out of it since there is little fanfare about and its done by a small studio that you might not ever heard of. Mostly, you wonder if you just wasted money buying it and having it sit in your library reminding you of that horrible purchase. Well, you can put your fears to rest, this game is definitely worth buying and very addictive. To give a rough idea what type of game it is, if you were to put all the good things from dead island, the walking dead, skyrim, thief and the sims in a blender and mix it real good. The end result would be this game. Plus this is the first time I play a game that after I logged out of the game to go do things in real life the game doesn't pause and start where you left off when you logged back on. Its continues on without you and you might not like the results when you get back. I found that out the hard way after not playing for a two days. In my case, I came back to find the base morale at 25%, two characters had died from their wounds and several infestations had shown up close to base while I was logged out of the game. So now, everytime I logged out, I start wondering if my base is secure, hoping no one dies, and so on. But definitely gets you wondering what's going on while you away. There is still some things that still need to polish like minor clipping, some more options on customizing the graphics of the game (Ultra setting the game looks awesome, but the blur bugs me a little bit when I move around real fast in 3rd person), maybe having a first person setting and having some basic tutorial levels to play around before diving into the game.

But 17hours in I have to say I'm loving it.The story (so far) revolves around a group of survivors during the first few weeks of a zombie apocolypse. You make friends, help other survivors and try and stay alive by scavenging abandoned houses and buildings.The game can go from fine to ""Holy Sh!t"" in a millisecond, ammo runs out and isnt always available for the weapons you have, melee weapons are always available but they drain stamina and can break, guns attract attention (always unwanted) and while you can silence them these have a finite amount of uses.While the game isnt perfect and there are some mission breaking elements to the glitches, due to the save system (returning home after a mission) you will always only be one step behind if you find you need to reload.Graphically its not that impressive, textures are blocky, the characters are plastic looking and the areas bland and horrid, BUT, this is not why you play it, you play it for the game and the game is great, it has suspense and terror, panic and you will be horrified if you are unlucky enough to see a Feral or Juggernaut special zombie kill you or an ally.Anyway, buy this game, play it and enjoy it. If your a zombie game/movie/tv show fan then this is for you."

Overlooking the occasional bug, State of Decay has you play as a cast of survivors attempting to survive the unbelievable.  Base customization, events happening based on real time, survivors getting tired requiring you to switch to a different playable character, the gameplay flows together to guide you through the apocalypse, but allowing you to make your own (mis)steps through the persistent land at a good pace.  Some may dislike the real-time based elements (base construction/stamina regeneration) but it's enough to play for a bit and put it down to see what tomorrow brings!"
,Recommended,241540,8386314,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,BR3ADMAKESUFAT,"It's been said before, think GTA meets dead rising. But this is really so much more than that. This is a fantastic open world zombie game, especially at it's price point. I picked it up on sale for $10, but even the regular $20 price tag is well worth it. This isn't a game all about killing zombies. It is about having to provide for your group and keeping things under control. As your group grows, the resources needed to maintain and build your ""base"" increases. This means there actually feels like a reason to take risks and search through buildings to look for supplies. It is a very nice blend of zombie killing, resource management, and RPG elements thrown in.I would have to say this is the most realistic and fun zombie game I have played in a while. You can't just take on every zomie you encounter, you may find yourself far from home without a decent weapon, with a wrecked vehicle, surrounded by zombies, and have to sneak past or hide from a horde until you hopefully can find an abandoned vehicle to hop in and mow down the zombies remaining in your path. I would say once you get about 5 or 6 zombies on you it can become a problem. ALthough you may take down the first 3 fairly easily there is a good chance your stamina has completely dropped at this poing and taking on the remaining can be a bit of a challenge, especially the fact that the noise of your struggle will probably draw in even more zombies. What I'm saying is this is a game where you really feel in danger at times, especially at night with very low visibility. You don't feel practically invincible like some zombie games make you feel like. I really enjoy this.Vehicles break, weapons break, noise is a factor, watching your stamina is a must, looting and gathering supplies is key, almost every building can be entered and serched, keeping your base and ""community"" happy is needed, and perma-death is a thing. Once a survivor dies, that's it, they're gone for good. There are just so many great elements that make you feel like you are truly trying to survive. It can get repetitive at times, and you will find yourself doing the same type of mission quite a few times, but they are normally things you would legitimately find yourself doing in real life during a zombie apocalypse. Tracking down a lost fellow survivor, helping fortify and fend off a horde of zombies attacking a home, etc.All in all, even with it's flaws such as occasional repetitiveness, lack of a real emotional connection with your group, frame rate drops, not very polished animations, graphical glitches, and a few other small things, this is a fantastic game for the price and I haven't found myself as sucked into a game in quite a good while like I have with this one.If you are a fan of the zombie genre, and want something different and unique I highly reccomend picking this one up."

(I reccomend setting it to low or medium) Zombie AI is somewhat okay and the zombies will react to the player or any noise that is in their range, in other words: They can't see you, they can't eat you, just don't be too loud. Next, homes sites you find and move too have different pros and cons, like an area closer to supplies or an iscolated place far away from zombies. You can interact with survivors to either scout for supplies or accompany you. Otherwise, a great game with awesome features,7.5/10 at best"

Decent AI for partners too.Cons - Clipping errors abound, Camera is sometimes poorly placed (though entirely movable with the mouse).

I'm a little bit disapointed by the lack of multi-player though. Don't get me wrong I don't really like zombie survival MMOs all that much but if any game franchize deserved multiplayer co-op between you and your buddies this would be it.On the technical end of things I've found it largely free of bugs, which surprised me. I don't know if I've just been really lucky or if Undead Labs are somehow beating the average because this game has never glitched, crashed or otherwise acted weird on me.

,Recommended,241540,10854650,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,Dr. Just Some Homeless Guy,"Yeah yeah, it's another zombie game - but it's kind of different. Here, instead of playing the immortal hero of save-die-reload, you instead guide a community of playable characters (some of them randomly-generated), all of whom get tired, sick, injured, and can die, and the game will still continue (and be winnable) as long as the community can supply and defend itself. And yup, there is no save feature - the game autosaves constantly, but there is no way to backtrack on your decisions, so you just have to live with the risk. Add to this the fact that the only way to keep your community alive is by scavenging items from the game world - and the only thing that respawns in the game are the zombies. Otherwise, search a house and you'll never find items there again. Blow up a car and you'll never be able to drive it again. Let a group of NPCs die and they'll stay dead. The whole world is open to you from the start, but get careless and you'll find yourself quickly ripped apart by zombies. While this might sound daunting and really hardcore, the main story game's difficulty is actually pretty moderate - nothing near DayZ levels of difficulty. The visuals and the writing in the game are passable at best, but somehow the whole package is pretty compelling and just works, thanks to an interesting gameplay concept. It was an enjoyable playthrough.The Breakdown DLC is basically a sandbox mode, and is very worthy if you liked the campaign game and want more. Unlike the main story game and its moderate difficulty, Breakdown is ruthless and makes for a way tougher gameplay challenge, on par with some of the hardest survival games out there."

Like Dead Rising, but set in a forest, the game starts by encouraging stealth and cautious scavenging. The focus on building up and maintaining a base of operations is something I've longed for, and supply runs can turn nasty without preparation.However you very quickly become accustomed to the hordes, and are more than capable of handling yourself against overwhelming odds. Cars are overpowered as always, and guns... don't even bother.You can send out your crew to scavenge, but they always end up getting caught and you have to stop what you're doing and drive across the (rather expansive) landscape to save their sorry asses.They drip feed you the story missions, which at first gives you time to expand and explore, but later becomes infuriating.If this were multiplayer, and harder it would be a winner, but as a trivial single player experience with throw-away storyline, it just can't go the distance."

That being said this game is brilliant and probably one of the most fun games I've played this generation.What would you do in a zombie apocalypse? What would your community focus on, would you build beds to make sure everyone is rested or plant a garden so that you're group will be well fed. THIS is real choice in a game. You have limited resources and you have to figure out how to best spend your resources and it will have a fundamental effect on how you play the game. In addition to the macromanagement of the community you have the ability to switch between characters and play as any survivor deemed as a friend. You can then level up and individualize these characters to fill specific niches (melee fighter, marksman, scavanger). Of course this is about a zombie apocalypse so that community that you care for so much and the characters you have invested time into are always at risk. One slip up and your level 7 marksman will be zombie chow. This unrelenting brutality makes for such a compelling experience. For what the game lacks in narrative power it makes up for with the incredibly deep and complex systems that keep me coming back for more.In the end it might not be for everyone because the graphics, glitches and perma-death of characters but if you can get past that you will find one of the best crafted games I have seen in years.Overall rating: 5/5"

As an ever growing fan to the evolving zombie apocolypse games, I must admit I was a bit sceptical to this game as many others like these are launching quite recently. However in the first hour of playing State of Decay, I was deeply involved in the game's story and the characters involved. The distance on the map is quite vast (not as large compared to DayZ or H1Z1 though.) which allows vehicle use to be benficial. As a PS user I found the Xbox controls initially difficult but I was impressed with the various combat techiques which can be carried out when taking out a zombie. The only thing I found quite annoying was the sound (as it always sounds like your in an echoeing room) but you can alter this if you wish. As a game to give what is needed in the market for this genre, I would serioulsy recommend it to a friend. What I will say is that once these other developing games have been launched later down the line, this game will surley be left in the dark."

Within an hour of the game, I couldn't take anyone other than my first person I played as without them dying due to being weak.

,Recommended,241540,10588501,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,SuiXi3D,"I absolutely cannot reccomend this game enough. For everything it does wrong, it does two more right. It's an imperfect game (with a terrible ending) but the fun is in the journey, and what a journey it is.State of Decay is a 3rd Person Open World Zombie Apocalypse Simulator, complete with everything that brings. You want guns? There's a ton of 'em. You want melee weapons? There's a whole world full of 'em. You want do drive (or walk) from one end of the (admittedly small) world to the other? Pick a car off the street and go. You want to rescue survivors, scavenge for resources, and build up your settlement? Oh boy, you can do that to your heart's content.Even at full-price, this game is a STEAL if you enjoy survival games. Now, I don't mean a survival game like Rust, Minecraft, or Don't Starve. I mean a survival game like small-town GTA had all it's inhabitants turn into shambling corpses. The default story mode has you moving from place to place, trying to work your way out of the valley the military has you trapped in. Don't worry, you won't be shooting other survivors, army included. You're all trying to make it out alive, and you're trying to bring everyone you can with you. The story ends pretty abruptly and reaches a terribly unsatisfying conclusion, but the gameplay is so engrossing all it'll make you do is want to play MORE.The gameplay focuses around looting damn near every building in the valley. Almost every single house, store, and warehouse can be entered and looted, which is pretty impressive when you look at other open world games and realize that most of those don't let you go inside most of the buildings. On occasion, you'll find other survivors trying to make it on their own and you can do some missions for them to raise their trust in you and ultimately have them join your own group.The survivors you'll find aren't perfect, however. Some are alcoholics, others are asthmatic, and still more are just lazy. Most survivors you find are just average people. The awesome thing about State of Decay is that you can switch to playing most of these characters, so you can increase their skills so they aren't completely useless. On occasion you'll find survivors that have special skills that are needed to keep some parts of your settlement running. Mechanics, gardeners, and librarians are just some of the people you'll need to fully upgrade your settlements.The real kicker is that once a character dies, they stay that way. If a survivor dies, you switch to another character and the overall moreale of your settlement goes down a bit. You can thankfully recover all their gear should this happen. You can also loot houses and other structures for weapons, medicine, food, ammo, and building materials. All of these are needed to perform various actions at your settlement, from cooking big meals, to repairing vehicles, to building and upgrading new workshops, medical labs, storage facilities, and more. You can also set up outposts to provide a small safe area away from your main settlement. Outposts provide you with access to your settlement's inventory and also set traps to kill meandering zombie hordes.So all that's nice, but how does it control? Well, if you've got a gamepad laying around I'd suggest you use it. The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse just fine, but it wasn't made for it. Each character has a variety of different attacks and moves they can perform, and the vehicles drive adequately enough, though sometimes the vehicle physics will cause cars to flip over, rendering them useless.There's DLC for the game, Breakdown and Lifeline. Breakdown is an endless survival mode that, in my opinion, is better than the base game. Lifeline is a seperate story set in a smaller map where you play as a military squad tasked with escorting survivors out of the city. It's a fun time, but is exceptionally more difficult than the base game or Breakdown. Both are worth the money if you enjoy the base game.The graphics in the game can be a bit frustrating. Lighting is a bit harsh with regards to just how dark shadows can be, even to the point where you need a flashlight to search houses during the day. Luckily, there's mods to fix such things. Overall, the game isn't terrible looking, but it won't be winning any beatuy awards. Generally, the graphics get the job done, and the game performs well enough on PC. Framerate isn't limited as far as I know, and the game runs at 1080p just fine for me.Seriously, I've played this game more than any other (besides maybe Minecraft) in the last year or two. Everyone owes it to themselves to try this game out."

76561198064527406,Recommended,241540,10574911,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,TeeLight,"This game is pretty awesome. In the main game there are only a handful of buildings you can't go into. The freedom alone is worth buying this. My first play through I looted nearly every building and ended up having to end that playthrough simply because I had run out of resources to find and pick up. Seriously, this game is great!The freedom of the game is what I love the most. The characters you interact with are different each time (mostly) and you have the freedom to choose how to play each one. You can choose to help neighbors, or just let them face the horde themselves. You can help out a friend, or take him on a trip and feed him to an infestation. The plot of the main game is... well it's stupid. There's no way around that, but really you'll be playing the game for reasons other than the plot. The Breakdown DLC is essentially just that. State of Decay without the plot. It was probably my favorite version of the game. More challenging and I didn't need to suffer through the zombie tropes. Lifeline is a great DLC too. There's a plot there, not sure what it is, but I liked it. Of the three I actually liked Lifeline the most. At that point the game devs seem to have figured out how to properly set this game up.This game is no where near perfect though. At this point one of the zombie horde's listed powers should be the power to glitch. They will glitch through walls, ceilings, floors, cars, and anything else. Heck I saw thim glitch onto rooftops. That's kind of funny for regular zombies, but the super ones will do that too (I'm looking at you teleporting Juggernaut that nom nommed Sasquath's face off). In long stretches of play it beceoms really clear just how many awful glitch zombies there are. It can give the game charm for the most part, but when the glitch kills a mission character good luck finding the bright side.The real problem I had with the game though wasn't with the glitches. Like I said, I enjoyed a sizeable part of those. The real problem is that this game doesn't respect the gamer's time at all. Unlocking the Breakdown heros takes an insane amount of time. And they pretty much universally suck. Buildings take forever to build, and that's if they don't get delayed for arbitrary reasons (like needing tape). There were so many times where I ended up just leaving the game running and walking away so that I could complete something. Or some challenges are just difficult to the point where I was crying. 25 headshot streaks. That sucked. No two ways about it. Seeing Sasquatch get killed time and time again. That sucked. Those kinds of things nearly killed this game for me. I did manage to get every trophy, but I really wonder if it was worth my time.This is a really fun game that I would recommend to friends just to play. If you're thinking about getting all the achievements get prepared for a load of frustration. Just playing for playing's sake this is top notch, will do it many more times, but playing to complete it is nothing more than a frustrating slog. After about 70 hours with the game I finally caved and modded the game so that I could get through the final bit. And let me tell you, the mods on Nexus for this game are pretty fun. Just saying, there's lots of ways to just play and enjoy this game."

While it has a fun, open-world sandbox, there are some things that kept State of Decay from being a smash hit.#1: No Custom SurvivorsIf you know enough about editing the game's code files, you could probably in a way make your own survivor, but I really wish that State of Decay would've had something that would've let you, essentially create your own adventure with your own survivors. Customization makes just about any game far more interesting and adds a nice amount of immersion to it, being able to play as and survive as your own creations, create your own story if you will.#2: The Zombie Spawns are TerribleThis has always been my major complaint with the game. Its mechanics for spawning zombies is atrocious. comparative to a level of DayZ's days on ARMA. Actually that's probably not fair, I think DayZ had an even better system then which was shoddy at best. Nothing is more annoying than clearing off a whole horde of zombies, turning around to get some items from a stash pile, then spinning around and seeing a whole mini-horde spawned in on the area you just cleared out. Very frustrating, especially for hordes that you feel like the game throws in front of you just to spite you and make sure you die. They really should be randomly-generated across the whole map. I know its done the way it is now probably for optimization, but that's just not a good system.#3: Vehicle Physics are Non-existentYep. Your cars in this game are about as light as a feather. The slightest bump in the road at a fast speed will throw you through the air like a tumbling leaf and render your car to nothing more than a noise distraction when it blows up. The vehicles seem to have absolutely no mass or weight, seeming to defy physics. I was taking a back road in Marshal once and, I'm not really sure what happened, I think the rear-end of my vehicle clipped a piece of wreckage and I was shot a good twenty feet into the air, did a few flips, and landed upside-down.#4: Needs More MapsI still laugh at every time in Breakdown when I choose to go to a new ""area,"" and it's just the same map refreshed. I wouldn't mind it so much if it wasn't advertised as ""going to a new area."" I would love to see some variety because it gets quite repetative playing Trumbal over and over and over again. I know they're already preparing a new one in the new DLC, which I hope will be of a decent size, but I still hope to see many many more, perhaps even an editor of kind for the community to make their own.Despite all these shortcomings though, State of Decay is in fact a pretty fun game, again if you get it while it's on sale. It's definitely not worth the full-price, I think some customization on the player's behalf and some map variety with maybe some extra NPC types and enemies would vastly improved the sandbox DLC."

It's what I've been looking for in a zombie game, and while it isn't perfect, it explores some of the things I've been looking for in zombie games. Things like scouting different areas, searching for food and resources in any and all buildings, choosing where to set up your home base, being able to set up safe zones (outposts) in any cleared location, vehicles that last quite awhile (if used properly) and don't fizzle out after hitting five zombies (looking at you Dead Rising 2), and much more. If you aren't much into those things then don't get it. If you are, then go ahead. There are different zombie types (regular, feral, SWAT, juggernaut, screamer, and bloater) which I'm not the biggest fan of, but they are all dealt with easily enough in their own way. Plus, I believe there is a mod to make all zombies the basic mindless type.Give it a shot. I've easily put in 25 hours so far.

It’s probably one of the purist zombie apocalypse games. There are multiple character’s you get to play. Usually try to play all of them because some characters will get tired or hurt. Also improving their skills is very helpful throughout the game. There are tons of side missions throughout the game which can be a great time sink. However if you play the game for its campaign you may see only 11 hours, more or less. Just to prepare you the ending sucks FYI. For a zombie apocalypse game its probably one of the best. Managing how much you take back that you find and what you need at the time. However one huge problem I have with the game is the most op weapon in the game isn’t even a weapon it’s the vehicles, and vehicles will never run out of gas. Overall the game is good for a time sink however the game itself is ahead of the rest. However whenever DayZ does go to finished product it will make this game look like crap.

It feels like the game is half over already. Maybe that's because I've been doing the same things over and over.State of Decay creates a wonderful atmosphere for you to experience zombie survival in. The setting is a group of small towns in America and you have to set up and manage a small community of survivors whilst scavenging in the abandoned houses for supplies. There is a real feeling of development as you level up your characters skills as well as developing your home base to become more sustainable and efficient.Melee is fun. Plain and simple. Great finishing moves that, despite being very repetitive, really drive home the zombie apocalypse feel with lots of blood and braaaiaiiins.The character you start with can die. This may take a while to happen to you, or it may never happen because you are smart and conservative.

If you enjoy both zombie FPS and open world RPGs, you wont be disappointed here.  Depending on how much you want to get out of the game, you could spend from 10-30 hours on one play through.  However, the fact that most missions, item drops, zombie base spawns and NPCs that can join your party are random will keep you coming back for more.The FPS zombie aspect of the game is more akin to Dead Island and Dead Rising than it is to the superior FPS zombie titles such as Left for Dead and the Last of Us.  First, the zombies in State of Decay aren’t really scary, and are more cartoonish.  There isn’t humor in killing them like in Dead Rising, but the glowing eyes and cartoonish walk of the zombies in State of Decay really takes some of the scare out of the game.  The shooter controls in State of Decay are adequate but clunky.  The melee controls work surprisingly well, but range weapon control is not so great.   Similarly, driving vehicles in this game is average, but not poor; the controls are clunky, they psychics aren’t there, and cars randomly flip over for no reason.  But again, this is an average FPS game.This game really shines in its open world, RPG aspects.  Without spoiling anything, you have establish a home base in one of ~10 predetermined areas, then plan how to build that base using limited supplies, facility locations within the base, and utilizing the specialties of the cast of survivors you have assembled during that play through.  Resource management is a key element to the game, and much of your time will be spend trying to acquire those resources, be they material or actual people to work in your shops and man your guard towers.  Along with managing resources, your characters will also auto level up as you use skills and achive random perks that tweak your playstyle.  While just a tiny bit of an RPG, it helps the game quite a lot.There are few downsides to the game, some of which are more glaring than others:-Glitches: these generally occur with NPCs, and range from NPCs being stuck in walls to NPCs not moving to waypoints in missions, or NPCs not going to proper locations in the base-Story: the story is quite poor, incomplete and disjointed.  There are tons of holes in plot, lore, and backstory that could have been filled by various items and interactions in the world, but they are not-Voice acting: it seems like only four voices were used for all 16 or so of the NPCs during my particular play throuh.  This is one of my biggest complaints with this game, as each NPC has a unique back story, but the same voice, which kills immersion-Mission spawn rate: There seem to be lots of mixed feelings about mission spawn rate, I personally think missions happen to frequently, especially at the start of the game.  This leads to an overload of information in your quest journal that is difficult to keep up with.  It also prevents some exploration, though as you move along in the game, you realize you can skip every other mission or so and that is OK."

For years I feel the area of the gaming market has been dominated by blood lust games that focus on the killing of zombies over the survival of your characters. SoD introduces this eliment to a fast paced game. While killing ""zeds"" is still fantastic fun, survival is more important and I very much enjoy the base building and character building SoD offers. You find yourself seeing each character as more than an empty vessle for bashing zombies with, and strive to see what part they can play in your post-apocalyptic community.Pros: SoD blends zombie grinding action with a RGP-esc game and succeeds. It's atmospheric (the music adds to this) with plenty of content to keep you entertained.Cons: I'm not going to bash the game engine here because as far as I'm concerned it's all about content over style when it comes to games. All I will say is that it took me a few days to get ""just the right"" graphics setting in order to remove the graphical glitches (lagging and such like).All in all THE best zombie game I have played to date."

It's hard to describe, but it feels like you're getting tossed around instead of running or walking.The game itself isn't so bad, but it's pretty much nothing like the description. You don't get to make Your own base in a way you'd expect, you have around 5 or something options of already set locations to create bases, you can create outposts, sure, but they're really glitchy and won't even get created most of, if not all the time. I've tried creating 3, lost a ♥♥♥♥ton of materials but nothing happened. Though, base customization sucks. You just sellect what you'd like to have in already decided spots around the base (You can have beds in the kitchen. No I won't make a sexist joke here), and upgrade them by pressing ""Upgrade"" then having to wait ♥♥♥♥ing 10 - 30 minutes for it to become upgraded.The way you discover other people is also stupid. Basicly what you do is, you find others that have set up their own base somewhere, and say ""Oh hey would you rather our base instead? It's way cooler."" and hope they join. There are no survivors out there that really feels like they NEED help at all, which honestly ruins a lot of the point for me.The zombie spawns are way to much. Zombies are fun to kill, deffinetly, but it's just too much considering the game takes Place in small villages. It feels like I've already killed 10 times the actual population to this city, and if you're gonna claim that the zombies ""wandered into the town"", then why did they do that? What the ♥♥♥♥ is so special about these mostly isolated towns that made so many zombies want to go there? If there actually IS a reason for that, the game doesn't explain it at all.Oh and another thing is the way the special zombies appear into the game. The game is based around missions, (the developers can deny that all they want), and the special zombies just appear in ONE missions because it just so happens to fit in, and then suddenly they're a normal sight everywhere. That just doesn't make sense, at least provide some kind of explanation to why.Though the worst of all is the ""Nothing respawn"" feature. What they mean with ""nothing"", is ABSOLUTELY nothing. This may sound like a good idea, but considering this is supposed to be a survival game, it means you'll run out of food, weapons and medicine, so you can't actually survive. This is gamebreaking for me, all the other things I could deal with, this I can't.The game isn't really worth replaying, because you know you won't be able to ACTUALLY survive and will have to restart AGAIN, and besides, there's nothing more annoying than having to start all the way from the bottom when you had already made a decent base and had some nice equipment.The game does have a lot of cool features though, I love how when you're talking to someone over the phone and enter combat, your character will say ""Hang on a second"" and then say ""Ok continue"" once you get out of it instead of just talking while fighting. And of course there's the ""Your character is tired/beat up, choose another one and let this one rest"" function. That's really cool. It does mean you won't really get attatched to anyone at all, but it's a lot better than ""Eat Food to restore health, stop bleedings, remove pains and cure broken limbs"" function most games have.Though despite that, I wouldn't recomend the game at all, at least not for the price it's asking, but seeing the effort that was clearly put into the game I can't really say that it should cost less.Tl;dr? BAD GAME. NO BUY. BAD."

Good story.Good storyline, controls are pretty good and user friendly, if you have use console controller before, this should not not be difficult for you. Try getting a controller its definitely better.You start of as one of the character and goes on to recruit other npcs to your group, along the way your task is also to find more rations and other items to your inventory. The more items you find, the more influence you have, the more people will be willing to join your group or camp, so setting up camps and outposts is part of the game as well.Of course zombies wil be obstacles along the way.

I know I don't have many logged hours, but I play mostly offline and it didn't log those hours for some reason. I like how you have to do thing to build up your reputation (influence) to use things from the storage and make decisions about how to upgrade your base. From what I've played, everything seems to run great. However, the controls do get a little clunky at times, but nothing bad enough to be upset. I'm also playing with keyboard and mouse, this game is an XBLA game so a control would probably work better. My only real complaint is if this is a ""simulation"", why are you the only one able to carry thing on supply runs? You can take people with you on the runs but they don't pick up anything?? If it is a person you can switch to, you drop the bag when you switch. You can't put the bag in your vehicle and get another either. I'm just very picky about details. This is a great game at a very good price, what else could a gamer ask for?"

Where to start.I got the demo of this game, when it first released on the Xbox 360, as an Arcade game, and it took me about 15 minutes of gameplay, before i decided to buy it. Even though it had some bugs, and quite annoying moments, the game grew on me, and as i progressed through the storyline, the game got better and better. As soon as you get comfortable with the controls, you'll have a great time with State of Decay.The storyline is in my opinion really great, i really grew attached to Marcus, Ed and Maya, and only used them, even when i got to the Church in Spencers Mill. But on my first playthrough, i lost Marcus  not long after reaching the church, and eventually lost Ed to Black Fever, which is truly my own fault, and not being to careful. When you progress longer into the storyline, you learn more about Trumball Valley, and some of it's history, and about the Army. I got the feeling, that the Army, were ignoring the helpless survivors in Trumball Valley, and only wanted to find out, what caused this mess. So a feeling of truly standing alone, really helped creating a great and 'scary' atmosphere, which exists in Trumball Valley.I eventually moved over to the PC version, which in the start were a quite bad port over in my opinion, but the developers managed to get it working, just as good as the 360 version. And when Breakdown were annonced, i couldn't wait to grab it, just to get challenged even more, since this game haven't got a difficulty system.The graphics, can sometimes be annoying, and look like crap, even on ultra settings, but i can live with that, when the game has so much good to offer. In my opinion it's the best zombie game out there, because of all the great things you can do, and every single action that you do, has consequences in one way or the other. I can't help to grow attached to my favorite, and most skilled survivors, you decide their history once you take control of them, you decide wether they will stick to the homebase, or be the guy/girl who is taking charge of the community, and lead the attacks or scavenging runs. But when the worst possible thing happens, and i can see that my survivor aren't going to survive this encounter, with a zombie horde i get this fuzzy feeling, a truly sad moment, when somebody dies. It's especially sad, when i alone, are the reason for their death...I really recommend this game, to any fans of the zombie universe out there, sure it has some bugs, and annoying things, but all games have that, and i think that this game makes up for it, in features and atmosphere.I'll rate this game 10/10, and i hope others will get just as great moments with this game, as i've had.- Pita"

In the beginning, you start as Marcus Black, a strapping fellow with his BFF Ed who've just returned from a fishing trip at a lake. To your surprise, everyone in the town has mysteriously gone crazy and taken up cannibalism. Or so they though, until they discover that the dead are returning to life.The game tasks you with keeping the peopel of your surviving community happy. To do so, you will often need to scavenege for Ammo, Medicine, Food and rarely fuel. The game will also throw ocassional events at you which will help you gain trust and become better friends with other survivors. You can play as other survivors after you've gained enough of their trust.One part of the game that is crucially emphasized is stealth. It is EXTREMELY easy to be caught up in the middle of a crowd of zombies and meet your demise. So it is crucial that you are constantly aware of your surroundings, lest you bring on the herd of the undead.Lastly, allow me to re-iterate how important knowing your surroundings is. It's helpful when scavenging to have an exit strategy, as many who are impatient will often use the quick-search feature. The quick-search feature is nice, but will generate plenty of noise which may attract MANY zombies. So, always make sure you have an escape plan. If you aren't careful, your survivor WILL DIE. Once they die, they're never coming back.For an indie game, I was extremely pleased with the action of the game. I would highly recommend any fans of the games: DayZ, WarZ, Nether, Dead Rising, etc. give this game a try. For $20, this is a great buy. The campaign will last between 10-20 hours, and the Breakdown DLC adds even more playtime with the sandbox mode.Have Fun."

I honestly hadn't had this much fun playing a game since Skyrim.  This game is near perfection in that it seamlessly blends RPG, action and even a bit of strategy into a finely tuned open-world, sandbox thriller.  I've been sick to death that the trend of games have been to increaslingly focus on story at the cost of gameplay, to pull players by the nose through a predestined series of events with almost no elbow-room for self-exploration.   The base game does have a story, but it cuts you loose and barely expects you to follow along.  It also randomizes events, locations, and enclave NPCs, so each playthrough is different enough than the last, that this game has near infinite replay value.  How many games can you play these days that you want to play more than once?  And then there's the Breakdown expansion, and that has almost no story and even more replayability.

You have a base of operations but you need to regularly venture out to find supplies (food, medicine, ammo and fuel) by scavenging surrounding locations.You can go on foot or drive. You can also have an AI partner follow you.Solid visuals, voice-acting (Scout, is that you?) and controls are pretty good once you get used to them.Although fun for a while, I feel there were some missed opportunities in this game, especially in the potential for customization. I don't just mean characters, but vehicles, weaponry, safe houses or even player-created content. It seems that the developers tried to add many features into the game, but many of those feel bare-bones. This game would benefit greatly from the Steam Workshop. There is a modding community out there that addresses some of the issues the game has, at least.Overall, 6/10. It's not a bad game, especially for the price. Modding it to your liking certainly adds more, but I feel without the Steam Workshop behind it it stills falls short of its true potential."

,Recommended,241540,9038641,"Posted: 9 February, 2014",all,Grrgee,"It's surprising how much fun this game can actually end up being. At first it seems insanely overwhelming, but once you play it for a bit and get used to everything that the game requires you to keep track of, it becomes really enjoyable. I have a problem where every time I play, I run into the problem where I keep telling myself that I will only gather supplies from one more house before I stop playing, but the next thing I know, it's been an hour and probably a dozen locations have been looted with multiple side quests complete. It's sometimes hard to get myself to stop. Some people might find it repetitve to go loot one house, then kill a horde, then loot another house, kill a freak, do a quest, and rinse and repeat across several characters in your community. It might not be perfect, but it's a lot of fun.Of course, it's not without its flaws. There are a fair amount of bugs involving zombies, including them falling through floors and becoming unkillable (thus rendering a side quest impossible to finish) and them glitching through walls to get to you. There's also the whole having to save people in your community every two seconds because they get themselves trapped in a house by some zombies (even though I later find them equipped with a wrench and shotgun) and I come to save the day with a baseball bat or pipe wrench. The other members of your community are good bait for zombies and freaks, but they also sometimes completely forget that they are supposed to attack, leaving you to clear out an infestation by yourself while they just stand there. It's not perfect, but it's not game breaking.Despite the issues, this game is a lot of fun if you are willing to invest the time. It does have to be kept in mind that resources in the community are comsumed over-night in real time, so if you don't play for an extended period of time without leaving plenty of resources for your community, you might log in one day to find people missing and/or dead. So try to make sure you have a little time to devote to the game at least every other day.UPDATE FOR BREAKDOWN: After playing the Breakdown DLC, most of what I said holds true, and this is still a good game, but Breakdown presents a couple problems that the main game did not have. The first one is game difficulty. Once you get to the higher levels, around 4+, the game starts to get rather unforgiving, to the point that you really cannot take on too many zombies at a time like you could in the main game, as they simply hit too hard and are too aggressive. Since the game mechanics are not modified to deal with this, the game can become insanely difficult. There's not really anything wrong with that, but it forces you to change how you play, and that can become frustrating.The other problem forced me to change a tactic I had been using in the main game. You cannot use NPCs as bait. In fact, even having people with you is insanely dangerous. I actually started to fail infestations that had a Juggernaut because he would keep killing the NPCs with me. At Breakdown Level 5, I had an NPC that had taken no damage up until that infestation. The first hit they took was a bite from a Juggernaut while I was trying to kill it. He killed them after only one bite. They had taken no damage prior to that and there was nothing I could have done to save them. After that I just started to ignore all NPCs and do everything myself, since I was sick of people dying when I could not save them. I know other players are better than me and don't necessarily have this same problem, but it just starts to get slightly annoying at the higher levels. I'll still play this game and will still recommend it, but I'll probably stick to the lower levels for now."
,Recommended,241540,9537720,"Posted: 17 March, 2014",all,核 Nuclear,"This will end all ""Is it worth it?"" threads on the forums. State of Decay (SoD), where do I start with this game? In my PERSONAL OPINION, it is one of the best zombie games on the market. However that doesn't say a lot due to the current state of most zombie games. SoD is a fairly short game for a 'sandbox' (I finished it completely with all achievements in about 24 hours and I took my time) but its definitely an entertaining 24 hours. The game also boasts a feature where the game continues to progress as you're offline. One may flashback to their Animal Crossing game where they haven't logged on in months and their town is covered in weeds. Fear not, the feature is slowed after a few days and turned off after a certain amount of days you haven't logged in. So your game will not be ruined because you forgot to log in and scavenge for food or medicine for months.Gameplay?If you don't know by now, Undead Labs' State of Decay is a third person zombie survival game. It's a mixed blend of shooting and role-playing. Some would add strategy but personally I don't consider it that much strategy to add it as a part of that genre. The only strategy you will concern yourself with is building the facilities you need in your home base and doing supply runs every so often for your home base.CombatThe combat in this game is satisfying and fun to play with. the variety of melee weapons and guns definitely add a spice of life to the game. Shooting alerts other zombies so you have to make a decision whether you want to kill them quickly and risk bringing more zombies or kill them silently hand to hand. You can also add silencers to some weapons which will help your gun-oriented survivors. The guns are easy enough to aim with as any typical third person shooter, melee combat is fluid, you have to be tactical with your melee hits as your stamina will drain if you just spam the attack button. If your stamina is all gone, you're zed food because you cannot sprint nor efficiently attack when your stamina is depleted.StealthWith no indicator if you're hidden enough or making too much noise or really any indicator having to do with stealth other than hiding in a bush. The stealth aspect of the game is definitely lacking. The silent kills are fun as hell to do however.Role PlayingThe game is classified as a role-playing game and to some extend it definitely is. If you are spoiled by TES or any other true role playing game however you will find this sorely lacking. You control any survivor you have befriended playing with said survivor you will increase their stats, Cardio, Wits (helps you search for resources more efficiently), Fighting, and Shooting. Increase their skills enough and you will be able to specialize them in special fighting moves or a weapon specialization. There is no character creation, in the main story you will play as Marcus (at least he's likable) you will also be able to switch between any survivor you have befriended. Marcus can die, your game will not fail if he dies. The traits randomly given to some survivors gives them some more life so you will end up liking or disliking most survivors, rather than just being neutral towards one. You will be able to take ONE survivor with you as companion. They will be automatically dismissed for some missions where other NPCs will be your companion. The companion cannot help you carry resources which is infuriating, however you can call for a scavenger from your home base to come pack up one resource bundle to take home.Strategy AspectA home base is the place where when your survivor is fatigued they will go to rest, restock on ammo, heal, etc. There are certain home locations in the game that you can claim as the home base. You will need the material resource to build facilities and you will need medicine and food to run your home base efficiently. There is a limit to how many facilities you can build at your home base, you will always not be able to build every type of facility so you must choose which you feel are more needed.Controls?I played the PC version with a Xbox controller and it a typical shooter setup with a few variations. Easy to get the hang of.Story?The story is a sort of typical zombie story, ""oh no it's infested, we have to escape to this place where its rumored where no zombies are"". It's sort of forgettable. Some characters you will remember, others you will definitely forget. It is linear, there are no branching choices in the game which could've added something to the story.TL;DR: Meh.Soundtrack/Sound?The music I've completely forgotten to be completely honest. At least it isn't bad. Aside from a few glitches/bugs the combat sounds in game are OK. Not amazing, but OK.Graphics?I'll be honest. When I first saw this game on Uberhaxornova's Let's Play, I was extremely turned off. The strange orange tint in Mount Tanner and motion blurry-esque settings made me stop watching within 10 minutes. However, I've forgotten ever watching it and I ended up buying on Steam for the full $20 dollars. Upon entering the game and closer inspection of the graphics it wasn't as bad as my mind had made it out to be. The art-style is a bit cartoon-y I would say ALMOST like TT's Walking Dead style, which may turn off some people. I liked it and it grew on me. The graphic settings however are a disgrace to PC users. The obvious Xbox Live Arcade port's settings showcased in the options menu; Aspect Ratio. Resolution. Graphics - Low Medium High Ultra. V-sync. Gamma. Are the ONLY graphic options you are able to change.TL;DR: If you're not a big stickler for graphics this game will do fine by you. It's art choice is a personal taste, its not bad by any means.Replayability?There's really no side activities or missions aside from collect resources and other survivors for your home base and kill special types of zombies. it can get fairly repetitive and with little replayability you cant help but feel the game is a little hollow. The Breakdown DLC for State of Decay definitely adds some replayability to the game, but its still the same map you complete the main story on. You will end up almost always going for the same two home bases (Snyder or Fairgrounds) every game, unless you purposely gimp yourself to give it a challenge or add replayability. It would've been awesome if the Breakdown DLC or the main game added an auto generated map every time you wanted to play a sandbox game. It should be noted SoD's randomly generated survivors definitely make a second playthrough bearable. The traits they may have are funny, you may even begin to get attached to some of them. Although you wont have to worry about them dying on the main game, you almost have to try to get them killed. Breakdown is another story though. Ramping difficulty gives the DLC a intense experience in the later stages. In the main game the only zombie to truly fear is the Juggernaut and they may end up killing your survivors if you are careless.TL;DR: Can get repititive. Game feels a bit empty with little replayability. Breakdown DLC remedies somewhat but still. It is fun as hell the first playthrough however.Conclusion:Despite a lot of mediocrity in various aspects of this game, it's still fun to play and I actually like this game. This game is a must play for zombie fans. It could've definitely been done better but ist a good game on its own. Is it worth the $20? Eh. I would say maybe. It's a fresh experience but I have spent a dollar for almost every hour I've played it to beat it. If it were on sale for about $10 then yes, it is a MUST GET. The Breakdown DLC, while only touched on in this review, for about $7 is worth it to add the replayability as sad as it is to say. Should have been a feature in the main game to begin with. I am a BIG fan of this game and wish there would be a SoD2 despite the flaws. The com"

It's horrible, but amazing in it's horribleness.It's a grinding, sometimes calm, sometimes insane journey into the nightmare of Zombie Apocalypse. Gathering what you need for your enclave of survivors, and trying to fend off the monsters the whole time it's hard to lose interest. Never ending chores, that HAVE to be done, or the consequences will start to cause problems.Pros: Really engaging game, I don't know if there's a right way to play it, but trying to figure it out every second. When I lose someone, I feel bad about it. I love it and hate it. It's an experience in survival and it's absolutely worth playing. Probably the most engaging game I've played in years.Cons: Could have used more diversity in the voices and perhaps a deeper story line, more interaction with the NPC chracters, dialogue options. I would also like to see more options in the probable sequel as far as defense posts, or walls. I would love to have taken over a whole town in the process of surviving the mess. Another thing on my wishlist is the ability to get into conflicts with other survivor groups. If Judge Law wants my groups guns, I would like to see her try. As it says on the sides of storage units, ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ.Decision: It's a great game, and one of the few games I've played more than one time through. I look forward to State of Decay 2.

But this one is pretty fun, I promise!In a market rife with extremely subpar games trying to ride off the success of DayZ. State of Decay does a very good job simulating the less flashy elements of survival; scavenging supplies, resolving conflicts that resonate among survivors ( Walking Dead soap opera, anyone? ) and introduces an interesting gameplay mechanic; your play time is not bound to a single character, allowing you to swap between characters as one gets tired, injured, etc. Included in State of Decay are RPG elements, allowing for leveling up a character, and a small degree of specialization.The game is not perfect. The graphics are nothing to write home about, and the melee combat, while better than say, Infestation: Survivor Stories ( Formerly known as The War Z ) it still isn't an excellent Bruce Lee fighting scene, and the quests can and WILL pop up many times... the game is still damn fun.

Loved the whole survival scenario, although there are several ways the devs could improve.First of all, relying on one person to gather materials is a broken concept.  When I have a group of over 15+ there are going to be multiple people collecting supplies, there's no reason to have a daily loss of mats when the other slacking survivors are doing nothing besides randomly walking around outside and getting into danger with groups of zombies.Second, zombies somehow climbing over walls WITH barbed wire over the top that is TALLER than the zombie is a very silly thing indeed.  Especially when the player can't do the same thing.Third, more base customizability would be welcome.  The basics with upgrades are nice but a little more sandbox wouldn't be a bad thing.  Being able to make better defenses around home is basic, yet lacking.Fourth, the game's continuation while logged off... I lost an entire parking lot of cars WITH trunks full of loot while I was gone for 2 days.  THE F**K?!Overall, this was a great game with some great ideas and execution.  People should get tired, they should suffer wounds out on the field that meds can't heal.  The fear of death was really drilled into me with the second person I accidently got killed.  It really reinforced the need to be careful and the realistic/pragmatic psychology of dealing with a zombie apocolypse.  You're going to lose people.  On that note, injury could be a little more realistic.  You're not going to get ripped into by zombies, take a couple asprin and suddenly you stop being injured.  You're going to bleed out!Anyway, great zombie game taken to a greater level by introducing the survival genre WELL.  Gathering mats, finding/creating a home, managing people and their tired levels, collecting weapons, avoiding zombies, etc.  Well done, I can't wait to see more."

Building up a base, collecting supplies, and juggling relationships with other survivors makes for a terrific change. There is a bit of confusion in how this is all done thanks to some very unintuitive controls, but with a little wikipedia it's nothing that ruins the game.The biggest downside is the repetitiveness of most things. I'm very eager to see other zombie games (or a sequel to this one) take up this model and improve on it, yet I wasn't dissapointed by any means.

Instead, you must utilised all your friends, switching between characters when one gets tired or hurt, trying to play the hero with your favourite character will get you killed in the end, and once he is dead, he is gone, and you must survive without him, which if you havent built up any other characters, you wont manage.This game is the perfect blend of strategy, jeperdy, and base construction, making for a very real feel for the end of the world, no heros, just people, trying to survive.To continue the fun after the main storyline is done, there is also ""Breakdown"" which pits you against ever more powerful, faster and more relentless hordes of the undead, until they overwhelm you. However, you may just get bored repeatedly starting from nothing on every level before you get to the level that finishes you off."

Published by a relatively new independant studio named Undead Labs, I didn't expect much going into it, however found myself pleasantly surprised by how polished the game is.Some people compare this to DayZ in some respect, and personally I disagree, there is only a single-player mode (though co-op is being looked at), which takes away the entire pvp concept that DayZ focuses on.With that aside, the gameplay is actually a lot more polished than the current DayZ mod, zombie animations and behaviour are a step up from the survival zombie mod, melee combat mechanics are simple yet complex enough that it takes more than simply mashing the attack button repeatedly, and the overall world is highly detailed albeit a tad small for my taste, it certainly would have been much more interesting with more varied locales to explore.  But I suppose they had been limited by the narrative which takes place behind the scenes (and yes that means there is an actual main storyline.)Both games have their merits, but if you happen to be looking for an immersive and decent zombie action game without the multiplayer element then this game would be a good fit for you.  If multiplayer or co-op is your bag then DayZ will be your best bet when the game is finally finished.  Either way, you'll have some fun with it regardless."

After reading some reviews I thought the controls would be clunky and it would be overly repetitive, and in a way, it kind of is but it's not at the same time. That may sound weird, but the repitition is kind of offset by the different environments you find yourself in. The day/night changes and the increasing difficulty as you progress.The controls are a bit clunky but once you adapt to them, everything is a-ok. I have only been using the controller and the aiming is a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥at times so the mouse & key combination might be fine for that but I'm enjoying aiming being difficult, it kind of adds to it - seeing as how you're basically just some random people without much shooting experience, it works.Part of the fun is the learning how to handle different things. I lost a favourite character fairly early in due to just not knowing what to expect on a mission. She got torn in half and I was upset for a good hour - death matters in this game, it really does and it will effect you on an emotional level. I swore revenge and stocked up and went in better prepared. That's a lesson you learn quickly in this game - always be prepared for the absolute worst. Carry as much as you can, but allow a bit of room for scavenging. If you're taking a car, put an extra weapon in the trunk and so on. Don't underestimate the value of molotovs; they will save your life in a pinch.The story progresses quite nicely for a sandbox RPG and allows you to do things at your own pace. Whether you want to focus on building up your base or going straight for the missions, there's always room to move how you want it. It feels a lot like GTA with zombies and I wouldn't have it any other way. Great game.

The problem is the absolutely horrendous save system combined with the constant bugs can easily lead to frustration or game breaking scenarios.This happened about 17 hours into the game with no survivor losses:I was in the middle of a rescue mission which involves my survivor rescuing 2 other survivors: everything was going well, I decided to pause the game and do the laundry, came back in a few minutes and unpause the game. The ""Loading"" screen comes up for a few seconds and I'm back at my base...turns out my survivor and the other 2 I was rescuing all ended up dead...while I was paused...was not even able to recover their stash since it didnt show up ont he map, or the area I was in, so I lost some of my best weapons in the process.Basically at this point I'm done enjoying the game because at any moment I can randomly lose things I've worked for while the game is paused, the enjoyment is gone and now it's just a chore to grind through until the story is over.I understand that a lot of ""random"" events happen and the game continues to run when it's not being played, but to lose my character while the game is paused is absolutely ridiculous, especially since its permenant and unrecoverable. This was probably a bug rather than a mechanic but annoying none the less.It's hard to believe that developers are still arrogant enough to think their games are flawless and implement a single-save, saving system, especially on a PC where manually backing up/recovering saves is easy to do ( which is something I constantly do now every time I pause the game), defeating the purpose of modifying/cheating through reloading saves."

The world is big and there are zombies everywhere.  You have to manage resources and players to ensure that your base can withstand all of those hungry freaks from trying to get in the base.  I appreciate that there are working cars when the world ends, because it is always a blast to just run zombies over with a car or bash them with a door.The problem with the game, that I had is that I have to babysit everyone and I mean everyone.  The AI in the game could be better, such as the fact that if there is a horde in the area, that the NPC doesn't run into them.  Another issue is the annoying tooltips that follow you around for a good 10 to 20 minutes in the game.If you do get it, I reccommend also getting the DLC Breakdown and Lifeline.  I prefer Breakdown for the increase in difficulty that you get when you complete each level, because the vanillia game becomes too easy once you get the hang of it.  With Lifeline, it could almost be considered an expansion pack.  It introduces a whole mess of new assets, but the AI has become more infuriating.

And this game delivers exactly that. While the gameplay and mechanics may leave a little to be desired, the world is fairly open and you are free to explore most of the time. The game also involves recruiting other survivors and allows you to play as them and level up with them. You also have the option of base-building a shelter for your survivors to stock weapons, vehicles, supplies and more. Fighting zombies is fun with a variety of weapons to choose from. One caveat is that ammo is fairly uncommon, so expect to be smashing zombie heads in with your sledgehammer quite often.

Your survivers will level up certain skills as use them, such as fighting, shooting, cardio, and wits (looting speeds). You can't just walk into a zombie horde or an infestation and expect nothing to happen, it's hard to deal with 3 zombies at once with out being hit, and even most of your main charaicters can die if they reach to low health, so you can't really do something with out a ""Plan B"".

That's because as far as zombie survival games go, State of Decay actually is about survival. You have to find a group of other survivors to join because you won't last long alone. You have to defend whichever safehouse you have chosen from roaming zombies and hordes. You have to scavange other places for suplies such as weapons, food, fuel, construction materials, and medical suplies. You have to create outposts with traps in strategic locations (up to you to decide what's strategic) to keep the hordes from owerwhelming your safehouse. You have to find and take care of vehicles as damage to them can be permanent. You have to manage your inventory when searching for supplies, along with managing your safehouse construction projects, and whatever group problems that might arise. You have to take care of infestetions and some special zombies, otherwise they'll do some serious damage if they get into the safehous area. You have to do some side missions for other survivor groups and rescue strangers if you want to expand your own group. And once you've done all that and practically looted the whole town, you can pack up and move to a different safehouse.There are some issues with the game though: the animations are kind of buggy - sometimes zombies will attach to you while you swing an axe at them or jump over a fence, or in the midst of a roll dodge animation; vehicle physics are some of the worst in all of games I've ever played; mouse & keyboard controls suck; aiming is extremely hard with a controller as the camera sensitivity is too high when aiming a gun; and lastly, Lilly doesn't seem to know the concept of not talking!

At £15 it's a bargain that anyone who enjoys open world sandbox games would be hard pressed not to consider. It obviously doesn't come with the level of gloss that is associated with AAA games with larger budgets, but the game punches well above it's weight, and with the beautiful art style more than compensates for the lack of graphical prowess on display. Indeed, much of the visual charm might have been lost were the developers not using stylised art to mask a lower budget. Astounding to think that this was originally an XBox Live Arcade title."

Also there is a large amount of weapons from wrenches to grenade launchers. No saves so it adds suspense when you get in a jam with your favorite character. For Fifteen dollars this is a great buy.

I think it's a good looking game, I like the ability to stealth kill zombies if you sneak up on them, you have to watch how much noise you make or it'll attracked more zombies to you, cars are really useful but are in limited supply and are really loud, guns are useful but again really loud and silencers degrade.Some cons in the game would have to be that zombies respawning is more of a hassel than it should be, you can only carry so much on your person (So many slots depending on your pack size and 1 supply type item) so I find myself going back to the closest buildings on foot because it's not worth the noise to take a car only to find that the house I just cleared now has 7 zombies in it again. It'd really be nice if they put at least a moderate delay so you don't end up clearing the same building 3 times just trying to get the supplies from it. Another issue is the cars, I'm fine with them being in limited supply and loud I think those are good ideas, but twice already I've had a car i was drving flip because I hit a shrub in some yard, once they flip you're ejected and they take damage till they blow up and usually attract loads of zombies with the explosion. Some of the cars handle like crap and smaller cars take alot of damage from hitting zombies (I've had one blow up from mowing over zombies). For a finite resource I'd rather they make them a bit more durable and make them so there isn't some unspoken rivalry with the local shrubs.Pros:Good looking.Survival with a community not just alone.Zombies are actually a threat (Alone you can only take on about 3-4 maybe or they'll rip you to shreds when your stamina runs out.)Good risk reward using noise (Use gun for easy kills, attract zombies | Use car for easy transport, attract zombies | Use quick search to search a building faster but make noise, attract zombies)You can upgrade your home with various areas which is nice (Add a garden to supply additional food instead of scavaging, A workshop to build tools and repair things, etc...)Influence based currency, if you bring weapons and stuff back and store them in the supply you gain influence which you can then use to take ammo and stuff that may be stored, or to ask a person to follow you so you can take on bigger areas.Cons:Zombies respawn in buildings too fast, end up clearing the same building multiple times just to get all the supplies.Cars are alergic to chlorophyl and will freak out from hitting anything with leaves on it.The community ♥♥♥♥♥ing (We don't have enough building supplies, we don't have enough ammo, We're bringing in too many people) I understand them having their complaints but the dialogs that the people use to indicate their disapproval at the state of some potion of the game repeat a bit too often for my taste.There doesn't seem to be a huge background story to drive you forward and you're left to find out what to do yourself.A minor complaint but it's too easy to acciently do something in your home that's irreversable, the first time I was playing through I was looking through the upgrades for the areas of the place and accidently deleted the medical area, there wasn't even an ""Are you sure?"" screen I just accidently clicked a button and bam no more healy place for me, I restarted because it was easier to get back to the point than it was to rebuild the medical area and find the supplies.Lifeline DLC: I don't know if this should go here but there's no place to leave reviews on the actual dlc page. If you find the original State of Decay to be too easy consider the storyline in Lifeline hard mode. Alot of things happen the dlc without fail that make it very difficult. Most of the mission objectives are next to infestations just to ruin your day that little bit more. Hordes seem much more common. They added a new thing called sieges which are waves of zombies that attack your base about every 30 minutes, these get harder as the game goes on and start having more freaks in them. The so called ""Soldiers"" are freaking weak, they end up pinned down 10 seconds after zombies end up on you making them really easy to lose. The civilian survivors without fail will already have zombies attacking them when you get there, they have a good chance of being pinned before you can even kill a zombie and loosing them is pretty easy, also in the sieges I swear zombies that break through go straight for them. Freak infected are more common, just getting canvas for an upgrade to my base from a building that was litterally next door I encountered 2 bloaters, a screamer and a feral which ended with me getting destroyed. The center of the map is a danger zone (achievement for staying alive in it for 2 minutes) which send endless hordes at you and spawns freaks at an excellerated rate.Pros for Lifeline:Much more challenging.More build options.Start with a decent size community and alot of weapons and quite a bit of ammo.You can request supply drops if you get low on something in exchange for influence.Cons for Lifeline:NPC's are frustratingly weak.The map is quite a bit more tedious to navigate.Sieges will make it difficult to explore anything.Similar compiant to Maya in the original game, these soldiers get winded from even short fights, they just seem so weak and there's a real oddness to it given the orginal game was a bunch of random people who could hold their own with ease."

It ticks every single box that a survival horror should. It's relentless, pulls no punches and has you scrabbling around for the last vestiges of supplies, like your life really did depend on it.Having completed 'single player', I've moved onto Breakdown, which iterates through difficulty levels every time you 'win' by choosing to escape in the RV, which becomes increasingly more difficult to fix up each time. It offers significantly more replay than single player (even though that's immensely enjoyable), and really does put you up against the odds.Utterly fantastic stuff. If you're in two minds about this game, put it on your wishlist now and grab it when its around £10 or so, then make sure you get the Breakdown DLC too.

So i'd imagine some to be turned off by the game because the game does a terrible job at teaching you on the basic.But overall the game isn't too complex, so if you spend a (very)little time to figure out how to play the game, you will find that there is a lot of fun to be had out of this absolute gem of a game in the market of oversaturated zombie/survival genre games.All in all, I highly recommend this game especially if you want a great single player experience and not a big fan of pvp that is nowadays found in too many similar zombie/survival games."

Why the same tasks over and over again? Plus, they say the same exact things over and over again. How do I flip my car driving down a hill? That's not good physics. Why can't I skip through the cutscenes? This game has sold many copies, so why not hire some more programmers to fix your junky game? I think I'm going to go back to playing 7 Days to Die. Which has less glitches, better physics, and is in Alpha. They also provide great e-mail support. But you guys never even provided your e-mail. I'm not any programmer, but I sure as hell could fix this game. Just some of the chat sucks, as I said earlier. I do lag on this game quite a bit, but I rarely lag on other games that require way more CPU and graphics card then this.There is a good storyline and many people to rescue, and it's fun to go out in your Army Truck, or your old beat up Nascar car, or your truck. The map has awesome graphics. There's tons of cool guns to buy and special grenades and mines. My favorite part is the actual action, the awesome fighting with you and a few other people again three hordes, or just yourself against one. I just hate dying :DRecommendations:On skyscrapers, you should make them scavangable, but add zombies, but not enough to make the skyscrapers infested.Add more dialogue, with more voices.Change the car's light's brightness. I hate it being too bright and sometimes it's not bright enough.Make multi-player. This would be an awesome game with multi-player.On Lifeline expansion pack, please allow us to send individual orders.On Lifeline expansion pack, please allow us to upgrade our walls.On Breakdown expansion pack, please allow us to bring people with us when we leave in the trailer (or whatever you call it).I do recommend this game, and I do occasionally stop playing it every few days.

It's addicting, so buy before you die, and learn the basics of survival if the real life zombie apocolypse ever comes!I've noticed that it's been crashing a lot recently. Please fix this!

I was very careful at the begin with my choices, but i realized it wasn`t necessary because zombies won`t kill you.

,Not Recommended,241540,11964506,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,FullMetalValkyr,"This game is so unique, I really wish the developers could have gotten it right. Maybe in the future, but I really hope they will continue expanding on this idea. I'm really sick of zombie games these days, but as an open world survival rpg it's different fun and addictive. My enjoyment though so far is being hindered by quite a few things.After the introduction the game just thrusts you forward with little to no instruction. Things are subtly added to a journal, but that fills up very fast. The UI isn't the greatest, there are some parts I still don't understand.Using a keyboard doesn't feel good at all, it can be hard to turn my character. Melee combat is very sluggish and not satisfying, it can often feel pointless. Gunplay is fine, but guns and ammo are scarce. I find this more enjoyable, but because the melee just isn't viable, it's kind of a problem.The game is open world and the events are in realtime. If you can't pickup all the supplies you find, you can radio in for a scavenger to come and loot at your location. Driving feels pretty good, but vehicles seem to take a lot of damage quickly. You can also use the trunk of any vehicle to store you supplies. There is actually a bit of highway driving, and it would be nice to have a radio or something haha. Survivors will help you based on an influence system, the AI however is really bad, so it can be tricky at times to maintain your trust when they dive in front of your car or walk into range of a molotov cocktail.Zombies seem to be attracted to light and sound. This can be really fun for strategizing. You can craft and buy silencers or items like talking dolls, alarm clocks, firecrackers and flares to lure zombies. These items work sometimes, but I find they don't keep their attention for long. This mechanic is very enjoyable, interesting a new. Sometimes I would stay in a car and honk the horn the lure the zombies away from a house, or maybe throw down a noise maker to attract there attention in a jam. Unlike any other zombie game, you can think in this one, depending on your supplies or situation you have to decide fight or flight.I didn't know until several hours in that this game had permadeath. It was pretty brutal, and I was pretty bummed out losing that character. I really like this though because it keeps you careful. All playable characters have status effects, and you have to make sure their ailments are tended to.Feeling a little overwhelmed at times with quests. If you try to focus on the main storyline, you might hear of a survivor that needs help nearby. Failing to help then can result in negative consequences to your base. If you focus on side quests you'll be barked at a lot about the main quest.The characters and voice acting could use a lot of improvement. The girl on the outpost radio has by far the worst voice, she sounds completely oblivious of the zombie apocolypse. I cared about the first batch of survivors you get to play as, but as you reach other towns or play as new survivors you see that they're mostly the same model, cloned with different hair and clothing. If they took the time to give them more unique stories and looks I would care much more about their mortality. The store is presented in talking sequences which can be pretty boring to watch.There isn't really any advanced graphic settings, just preset ones for different specs. They look fine, but it's the effect that makes the game look bad. High contrast and poor lighting leading to graphical glitches, and overall it just isn't very pleasing to the eye. This is probably the first game I've played with the gamma slider in, and it helped a bit.Originally I had this review set to recommended, but I'm changing that as it's been a week of hopping in and being extremely frustrated because of poor mechanics stopping me from progressing in the game. I highly recommend that people check this game out, maybe play a friends copy or watch some let's plays, but as a paying customer I'm a little bummed that I can't enjoy this with it's problems."

Starting off in the state park you find yourself Marcus Campbell with your friend ED. Quickly learning that zombies have come. This game is at a medium pace with being able to get through the entire game in around 13-14 hours if you go straight through. (3-4 ingame days)There are multiple activies starting with gathering supplies such as food, medicine, building materials, ammo. Please note that the looting system is unique as if you find crates of resources it will give you an option to open it, and give you an option to put it in your rucksack. If you break it down it counts towards takable gear, if you put it in your rucksack you can put it towards  your camps resources.The game also has multiple zombie types. You have your standard single zombie, you have your zombie hoard, you have your screamer, you have your ferrel, you have your stinker, you have your giant, and you have your armored zombie. In my opinion the two zombie types you do NOT want to engage on your individual self are the giants, stinkers, and ferrels.The game is between a set storyline and a grind openworld. You will have your missions that progress the game. However you will also have your ""clear the infestation"" missions, you will have your ""hunt the ferrel"" missions. You will also have your ""go get x supplies""These resources are used towards but not include building up your little home. From building items like medical faciliites, a library, a guard tower and bunks for people to sleep on. Now with upgrading, do not be concerned if you use your resources at one base when you are thinking of moving to a different location. There are plenty of resources. They are finate. BUT there are enough.A few problems I have found with the game, for example DO NOT use Marcus Campbell for anything. Once in your first home, (Which is a church, go figure) Switch immedicately. Trust me, if he dies you will be sorry. Apparently a few missions require for him to live. Such as a mission to find a new home.Another little glitch I found that you can run over streetsigns. However 3 minutes later they appear standing again.What I would like to see is better use of the facilities. For example at the warehouse (if you take that as your home) It seems that the warehouse isnt used to the best if its abiliy. There is alot of empty space that could be utilizied.I also see that you have a radio, refrigeration, and other electronics. BUT WHERE IS THE GENERATOR? I mean it would be nice if you could add generators so you could add lights that turn on during the night.The outposts are nice because they can be used as a buffer between your house and zombie hoards (due to having mine defences) however what I would like to see more hands on when it comes to them. Like there are more options with them like .. should it be a manned outpost, should it be an unmanned outpost.Another thing I have noticed is that when you call for salvage assistance, they dont use vehicles, even though you can have like 3 or 4 vehicles. speaking of vehicles, if your person dies, your gear, and vehicle used to get there, stays there. However does NOT despawn. (Dont quote me on it)Another thing I wish to point out is that this game is NOT easy. (Then again I couldnt find a way to change the difficulty) Trust me it takes a little while to actually get accustomed to how the game is played. So do not feel discouraged if you find you have to restart your game 2 or 3 times before you are like. ""Alright, lets do this the right way""Overall this game is entertaining, I would recommend it. I would also recommend looking into mods if there are any out there. (Preferably a mod where you can change the outfits, or equip armor, or larger backpacks, more efficitient camp layouts.On behalf of H/N Kinsha reviews we give this game, 7 out of 10. Well done Undead Labs. Well done."

,Recommended,241540,9412451,"Posted: 10 March, 2014",all,Christmas Island,"tl;dr State of Decay is an amazing open-world GTA-style action game.Undead Labs' State of Decay is a really great zombie apocalypse game that blends a GTA-style (or perhaps a more appropriate comparison: Dead Rising-style) control scheme with a randomized, very dynamic mission system, where missions pop up and disappear every once in a while, sometimes forcing you to prioritize and make difficult decisions. This intensifies as the third major part of the gameplay, the base-building, comes into play. You are part of a group of survivors (and can switch between them), and are responsible for all parts of their survival - which includes ensuring a supply of food, medicine, ammunition, fuel as well as materials to construct defenses from. But due to the unpredictability of the zombies inhabiting the county you reside in, you may end up facing tough choices - do you expand into Marshall at the risk of leaving your base open to attacks from zombie hordes marching in from the north? Do you help a stranger in need or would you rather spend your time clearing infestations? And what if one of your people gets the plague? Can you live with putting a bullet in someone you just spent hours leveling up? Yep, nobody claimed zombie apocalypse was easy.What makes choices like these even more harrowing is the fact that once someone is dead, they stay dead. That means if you play very badly, you may end up with very few survivors and a close to zero chance of making it through the next night. The fatigue mechanic also makes it impossible to concentrate on a ""one-man army"" tactic. Even the strongest survivor has to sleep every once in a while.The biggest problem I've got with State of Decay is that it can end up taking all of my spare time. Personally, I take that as a sign of a really excellently crafted game.Also, the graphics probably aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but they're in no way hideous (except for a fair share of texture pop-in).If you'd like a Dead Rising with looser time constrains (though not by much), a GTA with more zombies or a The Sims action game, you may just find State of Decay to be up your alley. But beware: It just may take up all your time!"

State of Decay is easily in my top ten games now and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys video games. It is an open world zombie survival game and it lives up to every bit of that title. While it is buggy at certain points and AI can be a bit silly sometimes the gameplay is still very fun and entertaining. However, the gameplay is not what makes this game great for me. There has never been a game that has made me sad before when a character died. The closest thing being when I nuked Megaton in Fallout 3 and talked to Moira afterwards. The playable characters in the game have some pretty neat stories and something about playing as them when you get them killed really hit me hard but it also makes for some great death. For example, I was going to save some allies that had gotten trapped during a scavenging run and as I was running up the river I heard the loud roar of a feral zombie and turned to see him jumping at my face just in time. Within seconds my character was promptly torn and half and killed. It then dropped me into another character from my community and I quickly gathered some supplies and went back out to not only save those allies but to get revenge on the character that had been killed. After finally finding the feral zombie I wailed him with a pipe in the face when he jumped at me, knocked him on his back and smashed his head in and then proceeded to save my allies after procuring the items that my last character had dropped. That moment in the game was absolutely powerful to me and felt amazing and wasn't the only time I felt that way during the game. I highly recommend this game and give it an 8/10 the only reason it doesn't get those last two points is for some gameplay glitches and a story that wasn't quite as deep as I would like and somewhat predictable."

This game has some fun zombie-stomping action along with a heavy survival element.  You have to establish and maintain a base, various supplies, ammunition, food, and personnel.  People dying is permanent and realistic.  Much of the game is spent exploring the world and various buildings looking for supplies.  There are several random side-quests that pop up that are optional, but beneficial to do.  Characters don't level up per se, but their skills improve as you use them, making them more capable of fighting and surviving.  You also have to build a base, decide what add-ons to put on it, and maintain it.  There is a lot to keeping up with this game.  Even when you log off, the next time you play it passes the time since you last played and tells you what has occurred in that time.  If you left your people or base in a bad state, bad things can happen!  The graphics are good, voice acting excellent, and sounds are very well done.CONS:  Very short, unforutunately. The main story is about 30 hrs give or take if you do as many side quests as possible.  Breakdown adds an infinite sandbox mode, which is much longer obviously.    Graphics on the PC are good, but very dark.  I have to bump the gamma up right off.  There is some rather foul spoken language that you can't censor.Overall, this is one of the best new games I've played in a long time.  highly highly recommended!"

One that many were probably anticipating for years.You start out in a forest as a man named Marcus in what was supposed to be a normal camping trip, but turned into a fight for survival against flesh eating zombies! You eventually meet up with a few more survivors and make your way into a refuge camp of more survivors. This is the start of your game.Now it's time to plan and maintain your community and it's morale for survival. You can switch to and play as almost every survivor in your community(after building a good friendship with them) and take advantage of abilities each one has. Some people are strong for fighting, others are nimble for scavenging, some are just worthless drunks, and among many others. Your means of combat is with fists/kicks, melee weapons, guns, and vehicles.Of course, your home base will require hefty amounts of food, medicine, construction materials, ammo, and fuel. Luckily, there are many buildings in this open world to scavenge to find exactly what you need. Just don't forget to find a high point to survey the land or else you may find yourself in a zombie infested house! Overtime, you may even choose to move your home base. Will it be that farm house far out in the country side? Or maybe even a trucking depot for extra security and space! You decide.State Of Decay's main story is short, but panned out overtime with many side missions so that you have a long time to play and complete the game when you want to.

I've played a lot of zombie games and were extremely disappointed with them (like Dead Island, not a good game) since I'm used to older ones like the Resident Evil series where you spend more time sneaking and conserving ammo than blasting and smashing stuff non-stop.Although it isn't for everyone, I really enjoy the grind aspect of the game where you have to constantly go out and rummage for resources to build up your home base. I could see how some people would get bored of this but for me it was just a part of the game that made me feel like I always had something to do. Although it isn't perfect, I think the combat system with melee weapons and guns is decent as well--you can pick many specializations and have to chose between melee or firearms, both which can be rewarding and you have the option to build your characters up different ways. Also, I did enjoy the fact that there isn't truly a main character in the game and you have to utilize different survivors that you pick up along the way--all which have a different set of skills to contribute to fighting or optimizing your base. While combat can be pretty easy and you'll often own tons of zombies, there's always a chance. Sometimes when I get careless I'll fire a gun without a suppressor, end up attracting a large amount of zombies with one special one in the mix and lose a character that I'm pretty fond of.  Cars are pretty fun too, always gotta love creaming zombies on the road! All these things make the game fairly immersive.Now, I'll get to the bad parts of the game, which for me didn't really ruin the experience for me but they could be a deal breaker for some. Zombies can be pretty glitchy--they'll often get stuck on different things like rocks etc and can also sometimes glitch through walls. Driving can be kind of glitchy as youll sometimes run into obstacles on the ground like small rocks or stuff by the curb which will make your car flip over and eventually explode if you don't empty the contents of the truck. Sometimes the NPCs also act stupidly and wont help you out during fights. The story is also pretty weak, although in the game's defense the story is only a small part of this game.There's a handful of other glitches that can ruin your fun but all in all, I would again highly recommend this game and the xpac Breakdown after you've completed the campaign."

The voice acting is done with a decent degree of compentencey but nothing specal.Video 7/10: Nothing specal here it all works and all looks good and most importantly nothing stands out as being highly out of place.Gameplay 9/10: definatly the strong point of the game, It gives you a very good sense of needing to stay on your toes at all times. it is built so that every action is permenent and many very lethal. It exicutes a very good balance of having day safer to work in, while night becomes far more hazardous, but there is enough pressuer on the player to survive that it is nessacary to  go out at night too.  It also uses a system for having a base camp of survivors and needing to keep some kind of society around that plays very well."

,Recommended,241540,7990759,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Interactive Civilian,"This is a good zombie apocalypse survival game. If you like fighting zombies and you like exploring open worlds, then this may very well be a game for you. Minor quibble: once you start accumulating survivors, it can be annoying that the only one able to get anything done is the character you are controlling (even though you can change characters easily so really any of them should be able to deal with various problems), especially when several things are happening at once or you just want to explore and gather supplies rather than dealing with stuff. Another possible annoyance is that the game world continues when you quit the game, which means you need to leave your home base with enough supplies and high morale whenever you quit playing, or you may find everything FUBAR when you launch the game again.Otherwise, this game is good fun, and exploring open spaces full of zombies is rather intoxicating. I definitely recommend it. :)[edit to include the Breakdown DLC]The Good about Breakdown: the progression of difficulty is excellent. It starts off fairly easy, on par with starting the main game, but after a few levels it gets quite tough. Zombies start coming out of the woodwork at the slightest sound, special types become more common, etc. While it's possible to play the regular game and not have a single character die, this is quite difficult, if not nearly impossible in the Breakdown DLC. I like this.The Bad: It's repetitive. It's the same valley over and over again. Also, it's really not worth the $6.99 price, as this really should be a game mode included with the base game. To charge so much extra for it is terrible.The Verdict: If you like the main game, then you do want this. However, wait until it's on an extreme sale, because it's not worth the full price.[edit the 2nd to include the Lifeline DLC]The good about Lifeline DLC: New environment, new style of playing, new missions, new weapons, and new characters. Actual C in this DLC. Overall it's pretty good, especially since the developers have done a good job keeping up with and squashing bugs.The Bad: the only bad I can really think of is that it wasn't open enough. You are confined to a ring-road around a city and a few neigborhoods around exits on that road, but you don't get to penetrate into the city as it is walled off (granted it's full of zombies and would definitely be a death-trap, but still it would have been cool to try to sneak in and around the tall buildings and stuff even if it was almost certain death). A very minor disappointment, but there it is.The Verdict: If you like State of Decay so far, then you'll almost certainly enjoy this. And I'll say its even worth getting at full price. A worthy addition to the game that you won't feel that you shouldn't have had to pay for."

What I honestly thought was a pretty standard, repetitive zombie-beater at first then turned into something so addictive and an absolute blast to play through. It's rare for a zombie game to deliver consistently (I'm looking at you Dead Island) but State of Decay does a great job. If you've ever been a fan of zombie games in general or in particular The Walking Dead TV series - you have to give this your time. You literally feel like a survivor - creating a base camp, finding survivors and materials, improving your skills and helping locate the source of the infection. Also - the added risk/reward scenarios resulting from the game's focus on permadeath and stamina/health penalties add to the survivor feel like you wouldn't believe.Now I won't lie - it took a couple hours to get my head around the core mechanics - mission structure, building outposts, maintaining supplies, keeping morale high, character upgrades etc but once I had a firm grasp I couldn't stop.The only downers overall I would say are repetition with certain missions and dialogue. The combat can also feel shallow at times but it has a pretty meaty feel which helps a lot (the shooting is also much stronger so this makes up for it).There are not many games that have hooked me like State of Decay. And for the bargain price of £3.74 in the final day of the Summer Sale you could do far, far worse. The average player can get a good 20 hours out of this before hitting the final story mission with others playing for a lot longer. Buy it now and start surviving."

Half decent voice acting. The game does keep me wanting to play despite the bad stuff below.  Kind of interesting loose plot line / story (not much of one though).  Interesting environment with a fair amount of exploration.The Bad: Another pretty bad console port.  The controls and player movement are wonky and innacurate.  More like driving a very slow segway in the way you have to turn / move.  Terrible car physics and camera is difficult to control when doing lots of turns in a vehicle (you have to move the camera manually to maintain a front of vehicle facing view).  Repetitive zombie AI.  Awful graphics - Shadows are WAY too dark, blocky / chunky.  Mods are reccomended but only improve it so much.  Weapons break way too easily (like in most of these games).Side gripe - why do so many games inisit on 3rd Person view instead of letting the player adjust the distance from First Person to a far away 3rd Person view??

Rinse and repeat.Although I enjoyed my first vanilla playthrough, there were a few nagging details to made the game a bit mundane. After you reach a 'safe' point in the game (a moderate amount of survivors, ammo, food, and upgrades) and you have enough outposts to ensure you have supplies, surviving becomes  almost too easy: the zombies don't hit hard enough to be a real threat while food and meds are little too abundant. Additionally, even with cases of ammo and the guns to shoot it all with, most conjested groups of zombies are mow downed by whatever vehicle you're driving.That being said, many of the player-made mods turn STD into a much more fulfilling survival expirience. Want less ammo available? How about zombies that can kill or incap with a single bit? Or, my personal favorite, even more zombies that run full sprint, who notice even the slightest noises from great distances? Sure, why not?Overall, a decent series to play."

If you don't pay attention and focus on scavenging, well don't be surprised if a zombie horde tears your character apart. ( Characters are dead...no respawning.) It really makes you feel like you are being hunted and you need to be smart to survive while grabbing other survivors, supplies or just scouting around.

Does that sound right? Anyway, it reminds me of a Flash game called Rebuild (and Rebuild 2 by Sarah North or Noth i believe) wherein you have a home base, with a group of survivors and a limited amount of resources (food, medicine, ammo, space for new survivors, etc.). You play as Marcus at first, a man with a very Rick Grimes or Lee Everett quality. Calm, collected, and in a rapidly deteriorating situation, you eventually establish a home. You can fortify, upgrade, and control several aspects of your base.The game takes some time to learn, and the contols arent the greatest. But imo the voice acting in the game is reason enough to buy. Stupid to buy a game based on that? Sure. But every word is spoken naturally, even better than TWD! You can easily relate to these character because they talk like real people talk.Okay, so when i messed up, and a character got killed (which is by the way, 100% permanent character death, unless you start a new game) i freaked, and cried. But isnt that kind of the mark of a good survival horror game nowadays? Random, senseless deah of a beloved chatacter? Truth is, anyone can die at any time. Granted the game tries not to kill people while you arent playing, but other things in the game world DO continue to change. Construction projects march toward completion, supplies are gathered from outposts, and missions become avalible while others expire. Its nice to see a survival horror game A.) have both incentives to play, and incentives to Stop playing and B.) have a plot, an open world, vehicles, AND infinite playable characters with surprisingly detailed backstories,Buy this game. Its an open-world Walking-Dead-Dead-Rising-In-Your-Face-With-A-Can-Of-Mace kind of zombie game, with some complications that arent too bad once you learn"

If anything, they multipled.In a survival game people expect odds stacked against them, what they don't expect is their enemy being able to ♥♥♥♥ing no-clip through a solid wall and attack you from a direction that should've been impossible. What they also don't expect in a game centered around group-mechanics and artificial intelligence, is when they're defending the gate during a siege and have a solider to their left, for a zombie to attack their left side. What they REALLY might not expect to see, is when the camera swings over and you catch sight of that soldier, for him to continue standing there as a second zombie runs. right. through. him and joins the kick-that-guy's♥♥♥♥♥party currently being held on your face.Oh yeah, also, if you happen to be heading back to the base carrying a serious asset for a mission, and a siege occurs in transit, do most people expect your asset to fling themselves from your moving vehicle and hoof it ON FOOT back to the base? Through hordes and freaks alike, thus getting themselves killed and ruining your mission? I sure don't. How about a large modern truck capable of carrying 6 people and you have 4 in your party that you just picked up from a gas station. Do you expect one of those unfortunate ♥♥♥♥ers to get stuck endlessly climbing the nearby ladder because you parked your truck in the backyard about 15 ft away from said ladder? And will NOT stop climbing it to get back into your vehicle for a trip back to base?State of Decay is a fun premise. It's a fun game when it works.

,Recommended,241540,10580596,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,Sp3ctr,"Pros - Exactly what we would want from a game like this.  You get to try to survive, run around and gather resources, build up your fortifications and customize your base.  You can gather survivors together to provide strength in numbers.  You can micromanage their inventory and skills (by playing AS that character).  You can develop relationships with neighbors and trade supplies.  You can collect a car or vehicle you like and with the right stuff it can be repaired overnight if you have a workshop (maybe the car took a bit of damage).  Oh, also, if someone is being a pain in your camp, you can try to get them kicked out.Also, supplies aren't completely finite.  If you have pretty much soaked up everything you can in the area, you can use the radio to ask for the location of some supplies you're looking for.  The average zombie solo, or maybe two, can be a lot of fun - or if there is a slow stream of them coming toward you.  But there is always that edge of fear because you can get quickly overwhelmed if you're not careful and there are some zombies out there that pose a serious threat to you, and you don't want to just bump into them on accident without being careful.  You might not survive it.cons - For someone new to this game, it can really feel like it is pushing you too hard.  It can feel like you can never be fully caught up because someone is always needing to be rescued, escorted, or helped, or you need a certain supply, or a construction project at home needs special materials you need to look for...   But trust me, 90% of this stuff you can ignore, and go on about doing your own thing without *horrible* consequences.  Only certain things, like a runner being in trouble, are things you want to get to quickly.  Once you learn to basically ignore your radio for the most part, you'll feel much more relaxed and able to focus on what you want to focus on.The game is really well balanced, but expect that you will get jacked at least a couple of times.  I suggest playing through the campaign first, before doing a sandbox, because it will help you learn about the environment.  Once you know the threats, you can react properly.Overall, I give it a 9/10 because it is mostly bug free - no game breaking ones that I've seen, and most of them are just normal stuff like AI pathing or a zombie falling down under the terrain and they are fairly rare.  Love this game!"

In Breakdown the only thing resembling a main quest line is to find an RV, repair, clean, and refuel it, and get out of the valley and on to the next level when the time is right. Each time you load up the RV and move the game gets progressively more difficult. Other than that, Breakdown is about surviving any way that you can.

I put 40 hours into it before I had all the acheivements and it felt like it was becoming repetitive.The game would be sensational if some more maps were added for it.Ultimately, its the sort of game you can happily waste hours and hours walking around aimlessly exploring and discovering new rooms and buildings.I really like the diversity of locaitons. Every house is different and there are many different sorts of buildings to explore through.Sadly, it doesn't look like this game will become multiplayer."

I'm not saying that as something negative, but just shedding some light on where the game originated. Overall, the game is fun, but it does have it's issues. The most noticeable issue for this game is it's lack of proper Mouse support. The game DOES support Mouse and Keyboard, along with Controllers, but mouse settings have a built in Mouse Acceleration setting that CANNOT be disabled. Undead Labs have mentioned ""working on the mouse"" but have yet to correct this issue.The problem with this is that I prefer to play my PC games with mouse and keyboard. ""Use a controller"" should not be a fix for this issue. Besides the mouse being handled terribly, the game is actually very fun. It isn't a hardcore survival game by any means, but there's nothing wrong with that. The only reason I would not recommend this game is because of how the mouse has been ignored, when realistically the mouse and keyboard are the two most important things that should have been a priority over everything else."

That's fine but you really want a game that plays without major glitches and is quite polished to pull this off properly. State of Decay doesn't seem to be able to provide this, in fairness it's not the worst game but so far off even being half way to the best it's painful.If the AI was worlds better and character interaction more meaningful than a ""hello"" and ""come with me"", it might be ok to lose your chosen character and move on to anew, but the collective and social aspects are nonexistent, so who gives a flying f^*k whether the rest of the camp die if you've just lost your best weapons and character to a poxy glitch by no fault of your own. My first character died because he was stuck in a doorway and the next got killed through a wall by one of the feral zombies.

I like a lot of systems in it, and dislike a lot of systems in it, but overall the experience is very positive. You start out fighting your way back to town with your buddy and soon find yourself running a survivor camp. You can control any survivor in the camp directly, but sadly the indirect control is not where I wish it was.The combat is done well and is very different. You are completely safe so long as you have stamina, but once that runs low you can quickly be overrun. Individual zombies are a non issue, but take on more than four and you can have trouble. I like that I feel like I am actually making choices based on the situation rather than adopting a single strategy and then just doing that over and over again.the camp control aspect of the game is not as good as I wish it could be. The game forces you to move camps if you want more space, and then limits your maximum build spaces without any good reason for doing so. I feel like they should have instead given you one large camp that you could expand over time so long as you had enough survivors to run a camp that big.Resource management is both cool and annoying. It took me a while to figure out that you can actually store supplies in your vehicle and drive them back to base. Once I figured this out it saved me a TON of time and made the game play smoother. You can take people with you on missions, but they tend to leave the second you start a mission, and cost a decent chunk of a currency used for interaction with your camp. This is dissapointing, because for the most part the AI on these assisting characters works. It is also annoying that you cannot request assistance from a character from the menu. You must directly find that character and speak with them. Even though I had 14 members in my camp, I was hard pressed to ever find more than 3 at the camp at a time. This means that you will very rarely if ever be able to bring more than one guy with you at a time.That touches on what I would consider the main problem with the game. You have to SERIOUSLY be paying attention or use a guide to catch all of the systems at play.All and all this game is extremely fun. I got it for 5 bucks and I am having a blast. The resource management becomes more annoying as your camp becomes bigger because your ability to gain resources does not scale with your camp. This seems to be the kind of game that you love in spite of its issues. There is much that could be improved, but man I can't wait for the second one.Do yourself a favor and find a guide that goes over the core mechanics of the game. You will have a better time if you actually understand what is going on."

Its not too scarry 'horror-wise' (blood and gore), but it will keep you on your toes and running to survive. Perhaps even make your heart race faster..I enjoyed the openness of the missions. True open world - do it as you like, without any real penalty for deciding not to do any particular thing. Only that, you need survivors and if you don't save / rescue them in time, you will lose them. I'm not sure if they ever return.Obviously, on the opening missions of any game, the game leads you around a bit. (I hate that), but its just to get you started. After that, you are free to do what you want basically. I like that the most.There is a nice range of weapons - and their availablity is just about right -  I found.A lot of these types of games don't give you enough tools or conversely you find stacks of ammo and weapons laying all over the place.I think there could have been more scope - (and in the future), to let you do more in the game, like use tents and sleeping bags + other camping gear, that are littered all over the game, But, nope - you have to sleep on the floor or take turns in a bed when your residency capacity is overflowing.The graphics are great!  - Graphics in any game is not about the newness and shiny things and how pretty it all looks. Graphics is about the atmosphere the images create. I feel as though I'm watching myself on a TV program about the zombie outbreak.. (If that makes sense)..  It's like a grainy and colorful setting..There is no rain - wind etc. Just night and day. That's enough for now - perhaps in later future game?Perhaps we could have had more scavenging of building materials that were real physical things like fences and wood to board up windows. (Where does the wood (nails and hammer), come from when we just decide to nail boards over a window?  They mysteriously just appear.. It should be a collect inventory thing..You can only carry a certain amount - but can bet a bigger rucksack to carry your stuff in! Also, I liked to take a vehicle to keep more supplies nearby. You can also leave them out and about, no one else will steal them, Stuff you can back at camp can be brought back in another vihicle.As a TIP: I used to use a cop car for storage and emergency - that way - I always knew which vehicle was my store and escape vehicle. The best vehicles for trasnporting are pickups, some have 4 or 6 seats, and can take up to 6 storage in the back. They should have let us use busses and vans or lorries too, but they weren't drivable in the game. (Maybe next time)!You will have a lot of fun moving to new bases. But I think you should be able to have them all and just expand into the next base rarther than have to pack up and move. Then you'd have more missions to do, transporting resources between the bases etc.There could be more explanation of why there are so many zombies and where they are all coming from. e.g. - You are in a small groups of towns off the highway, and the Z's are coming from the cities, where there are millions of them; Looking for 'BrainZ' food.. Moving out of the city by the dozens daily.There are plenty of items to make and repair, although you don't actually make the repairs or build anything with your own hands. I think this could be a nice addition to the game.. Currently, you just park your vehicles outside your base; for instance and they can be repaired overnight if you have the mechanics shop built and a resident mechanic.Other horror games I play - are usually on console, like ""Silent Hill"" - Now there's a horror game for you.. But you don't get a chance to build and play like you do in State Of Decay.. I really want to have more to do in the game. Actually building and making things and transporting things around - all with the constant threat of zombies getting you..About people you save...A tip or two: I like to sacrifice the odd player. Ones without any real sikills when you get them. You don't have to get rid of people until you have too many and your facility is overcrowded,So, take the person you want to sacrifice, perhaps because they have no skills for fighting or medical / other skills etc.  Or perhaps you just don't like the look of them. Take a tool to fight with, something you don't want or can afford to loose, take no medical supplies and go out and fight to the death with the biggest, badest dude you can find,Always look for and go for the next new person that needs rescuing, you never know what skills they might have. You can always take them out alone and get them killed later.. Suicide... Mission.NOTES:If you liked my review and comment - THUMBS up ""YES"" my review!I read a lot of reviews on many games, that are not actually reviews, but are where people are complaining about their game not running, or that they want their money back because the game is not worth it for some reason, without saying why..

At least that's what I'm calling it.You transition form zone to zone, from the tutorial campground to a rural town to a larger city with the story. Basic combat elements are included, melee attacks with weapons that have degrading durability if overused and an assortment of firearms when there are just too many zombies to slice with a machette.The most intriguing part of the game are the survivor camps you can build and strengthen. If you find survivors you can bring them back to your base, fortify the windows in case of attack and you build your repuatation with the other survivors so you can bring them along as a sidekick. There's a storage area where you can store your extra gear, and you're going to have it. Inventory space is very limited and dependent on the size of your backpack along with a weight limit on how much you can carry. Certain items, like bullets, snacks, and pain killers stack to small stacks to conserve space but you will constantly be returning to base to store your items. A downside to this is that you have to spend your reputation points with your group to withdraw items ythat you had just recently deposi9ted into the storage, a major drawback.And when you're not playing, after you exit the tutorial, time continues on in the game and your camps can be attacked and your survivors killed mercilessly. It's is very annoying if you do not play it every day and I think it's a major drawback. You should be allowed to turn off ths feature but it is what it is.I'd definitely say give this game a purchase if you can find it on sale. I wouldn't pay full price for it and I didn't.

You do so by alternating between individual survivors, each with stats and equipment, gradualy turning weak civilians into capable zombie fighters.There is a limited base building aspect of the game, where you gather ressources and choose what to build in your limited base space. Offers some customization, but limited replayability. The story is also limited, with barely any information offered, but doesnt hinder gameplay or the enjoyment you can get from this game.This is  a console game ported to PC, so the UI, commands and character movements arent perfect. Im afraid the dificulty of the game was also hindered by this, because since aiming with a joystick is harder, IMHO they make the games easier.Pros:- Open world.- Enjoyable melee and ranged combat.- Lots of melee and ranged weapons.- Diversity on driveable cars.- Base building.- Reasonable voice acting.Cons:- Low diversity of missions.- Low replayability value.- No dificulty sliders (may be too easy for some).- Barely any story.- Abrupt and not interesting ending.- Shallow characters.I recomend this game.

If they continue to develop this game with more features while keep the old ones, it will become the very good game.This game is about Zombie Survivor which is sounded pretty generic enough, though this game focuses on scavenging, finding a supply back to your base, Keep everyone safe from the zombies. Everything you found there is a gold; Food, Medicine, Gun and Ammo, they must be managed or it will be gone for good.The missions are pretty repetitive but I find them realistic, like your real life, everything you do is a same thing and you must doing that over and over again, to keep yourself survived another and another day and go on. Instead of waking up every morning to work, go to school or else, you wake up to get rid some of the hordes, scavenge for supply and help other survivor that is trapped by zombies. It's so repetitive that turned out very fun. That's it, instead of trying to figure the math problem, you're forced to learn how to fight zombie properly each day. Instead of learning P.E. just for fun, you're forced to learn how to run longer. Shooting is now your hobby instead.Repetitive is a bad thing in game mechanic but this game screws that rule completely, Made a game realistic in very unique way.A story is ok. It's not something special but it can't be helped because this game should be a sandbox game. They should have added a breakdown mode into the first game from the start. You won't enjoy the full experience without the breakdown DLC. It's not a good move at all. You can still enjoy the based game but it won't be much of challenge and won't much of fun to play since it has no minor goals ( such as using car's door to kill 400 zombies ) and has a great number of unplayable characters.Overall it's very fun to play, for time killing with endless activities ( and repetitive ) of surviving. Not really recommend for those who want a strong story telling, but it's a great sandbox game especially breakdown DLC.Scores 7/10."

The graphics are terrible - especially the colours and the shadows - it took me one or two hours to get used to it, the driving system is even worse.. But the most important part - killing zombies is so good.. The idea is to build a base, help (or not) the other survivors, recruit them (or not..), gather supplies, fight the zombies and level up your heroes. Later you will be able to relocate your base, fight the infestations etc. The world in State of Decay is quite big and interesting - there are some farms in the middle of nowhere, there are two cities, an army base and many more.

ZST lets you control exactly how much time passes while you are not playing (or forces time not to pass at all), so that alleviates some frustration.Besides ZST, you may want to drop by State of Decay Nexus and grab the following mods:- SweetFX for State of Decay - improves palette and shadows.- Real flashlight - just what it says on the tin.- Powerhouse and Reflexes - gives the more physically gifted characters a chance to dip into both Powerhouse and Reflexes skill tree, making them a lot better (it's a joy watching Marcus roundhouse-kick a bunch of zeds in the face and then ruin their day with Wrestling or a big sledgehammer).- Melee and Ranged - some characters can develop both the melee and ranged specializations (also helpful).The game isn't without downsides, graphics are not exactly top of the line (though quite passable); a lot of stuff happens at the same time while you play (the radio girl keep chiming in every five seconds with new missions and you end up overwhelmed), there are some bugs with clipping and getting stuck, but overall it's worth to buy if it's on sale."

Although, I thank the devs for removing the real-time aspect, as it was a pain going out for a few hours, sleeping, waking up in the morning, and finding out that all my food and ammo are all gone and someone has the plague.

I do enjoy a more relaxed approach to the zombie genre, but not so relaxed that every single aspect feels like an arcade game.The combat and zurvival aspects to it are horribly dumbed down. Each indiviual building you clear to ""loot"" is pretty much the same experience and doesn't give you a lot of freedom. Seriously let me freaking loot! There's equipment scattered accross the ground and unopened shelves/storage containers and I'm limited to a couple backpacks or some crap?!Gunplay feels like a grand theft auto game... and I mean like an older one at that. Tell you what the vehicle mechanics feel like an old grand theft auto too. They seem to have never ending gas tanks too.The food and medicine are used to recover stamina and health, instead of maybe maintaining your hunger and fighting illnesses. No need to drink though. There is a ok sleep system.I will give it credit for trying to have a base building aspect, but it feels unpolished and oversimplified. It lacks a strong leadership feeling too. If your going to measure a persons leadership, then give him a chance to use it. Maybe give that charact the choice of deligating what other characters do when you're not controlling them. When adding an expansion to the base, how about giving us the choice to tell an individual or two to actually build the expansion and determine the time it takes to build based on their skillset.The crafting aspect is... none existent... its a zombie game come on!Now all of these things I could overlook for the sake of finally having a decent single player experience with a good story. I'm about four hours in and every other thing that seems to come out of npc's mouths can be summed up in three words; cliche, stereotypical, and predictable. Too many times have I sighed and shook my head at moronic dialogue. Missions feel like ""go there, pick up item(s)/people, come back"" at that too.I'm willing to bet most of this is because of the fact its a console port and this sort of gameplay has become common place there, but at full price I can't recommend this game. If you see this on a steam sale, then by all means take advantage of that, but don't expect a fulfilling experience. Think of it as one of those arcade games you'd pick up on a console's network."

There's none of that excessive B-grade cheese associated with action games, although there is still plenty of that in State of Decay. What sells it for me is the community, intimacy and comaraderie; the sense of belonging and purpose in the midst of a post-apocalyptic setting. When nothing about you is remarkable - not your skills or gear - all you have is family. For a mid-low budget game, I think UL have made a commendable effort. If SoD were to come out with a sequel, I'd want to see character interactions the level of Dragon Age: Origins or Baldur's Gate 2; really push home that sense of close-knitness that's important in building a community that's trying to survive on the backs of slim hope, cooperation and desperation.Update: So, I only have the pre-YOSE game. As others have said, I'd recommend getting YOSE if you're new to the series. And, if you already have this game, don't bother getting YOSE. I'd also recommending modding your game too.

The mechanical challenge of scavenging for supplies, moving from spot to spot as resources grow scarce, and of course killing zombies is absorbing and a lot of fun.It's a shame that the finer details of the game don't hold up though. Dialogue is often quite stilted, mission structure is repetitive, the story is bland, and the artificial intelligence is too stupid to live. At one point I watched zombies burst in through the front door of an AI settlement, only to be ignored by all but one of the people wandering around inside. One man in body armor leaned against a wall and ate an apple while an NPC grappled with the undead not five feet away from him. Oh, and the cars obey no known laws of physics.On the whole State of Decay is still worth playing. It's satisfying to watch your little community grow, and to crack some skulls along the way."

Only complaints 1. Base game and lifeline campaigns are too short could use more content (perhaps elaborate on the disease and move towards scientific advancements from the special missions with the weird dood, instead of just hints of whats going on). 2. Although the Breakdown campaign goes on forever it gets boring due to no storyline they need to add more storyline perhaps even a resolution or real ending after the 12 levels of increasingly hard zombies. 3. Danger zones or uncleared zones in base game are pretty good and kind of make sense but in lifeline why do zombies appear out of thin air at least make them come from over walls and through buildings or something to add some realisticness. Despite these three things I'd give the game a 10 out of 10 hope they release some more content or state of decay 2 soon!"

Whereas games like Left 4 Dead and Dead Island are essentially just zombie killing simulators, State of Decay has so much more depth to it. There's a real looming sense of desperation throughout the game. On top of that, you feel a real sense of community once you build up your numbers. Going out and scavenging, building improvements at the base, deciding who stays and who goes or whether to allow new survivors into your troupe. It's more than just a zombie slaughtering fun time. It really feels like a zombie apocolypse."

You can drive cars, fend off hoards of zombies on the streets, towns, invading zombies, super zombies. Ammo can be scarce, weapons can jam, melee weapons can loose durability and potentially break. The gameplay is kinda repetetive. The game itself plays in real time, even after login in and out of each game session. There really is no story, just lots of zombie action & looting.Pros:  + Lots of Zombie killing.+ Good assortment of Survivors you can save & recruit to your group.+ Has a somewhat RPG element added to the game, skills that can be leveled up, etc.Cons: - Character dialogue between new & old survivors are the same.-  If the character you are playing as dies, somehow all the friends you accumalated with him/her dies.- Constantly out scavenging for supplies and ammo.- Gameplay can be quite repetetive.Verdict? Is worth its full game price? No, just wait till it goes on Sale. The DLCs don't really offer that much content either, sure it adds a few achievements, some new characters, but doesn't really add to its replay value."

,Recommended,241540,9305614,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,ASH+Vocaholic,"Out of the many games that try to 'simulate' a zombie survival setting up to this day, State of Decay is probably as close to home as it can get.. unless you really do have a 'military' background and all you seek from a zombie apocalypse is to either be a hero in a one-man army or make life a living hell for everyone else.The game plays best with a controller and I would strongly discourage anyone from playing it with the keyboard and mouse as the controls and interface may take away a chunk of the enjoyment. Combat feels satisfyingly meaty and comes with it's own risks both in melee and ranged as one could imagine. The game also has you choosing and setting up your own safe home and reinforcing it by scavenging for supplies and/or survivors to help out in defending it. Management of resources and community relations is present though it may not be as complex or custom as some people desire it to be. But for that matter, I would have to wonder if that's not asking too much. Other than that, it's an open world that's susceptible to your own interpretation and leisure.I've heard and read that the game does get repetitive eventually but in all honesty, which game doesn't suffer from this problem without either a captivating storyline or mechanic which are both subject to personal opinion. Some of these concerns are also easily solved with the inclusion of the 'Breakdown DLC' though it does come with an additional pricetag.In short.. it's hard to get exactly everything you want out of a game but for what it's worth, I think this game offers more than enough for the zombie survival fanatic that is more into the actual aspect of surviving instead of the PvP environment / bandit-lifestyle a zombie apocalypse would entail."

You can switch off your main character with other people whom  you've gained trust with so that your main character can rest, recover, heal, or get over illnesses. Keep your home base well stocked and keep your survivors alive. Once you run out of supplies in the area around your base, you'll be scavenging further and further out, increasing the risk.  This game gave me nightmares, which is a good thing.DLC - Breakdown had me a bit nervous at first since you replay the same map over and over again. I figured I would get bored with it even though the zombie difficulty increases each time. However, I realized that most of the characters in the game are from that valley, so they should technically know all the nuances of the area.

There's an extremely barebones story, if you can even call it that. Just go around doing the 3 mission types over and over again until something slightly more interesting happens until you *spoiler* escape the valley after which absolutely nothing happens and you can keep playing the game from the point right before you begin the final mission. The random missions always involve the same three things, go somewhere and find survivor, bring them back to base, go somewhere with survivor and kill a zombie (yes one zombie), go somewhere and help other survivors defend their home which increases their trust towards you, which doesn't really seem to have any meaning. If you choose to avoid these missions of course ""happiness"" of your fellow survivors will go down which I'm not sure what the effect of that even is (presumably makes them even more whiny). You must also occasionally switch survivors for no particular reason at all other than to make things even more annoying as if you play as the same survivor for too long you will lose part of your maximum stamina and health.Also the game is like, completely unoptimized, I could barely get 30 fps even with very low settings"

I played around with mods ONCE but decided to remove them all and play the game in Vanilla because let's face it, mods are only good for the Breakdown DLC because that's literally a sandbox version of the game. in conclusion, state of decay is WORTH buying if you want a singleplayer Only experience in a zombie game (which makes it really, really intense without your friends) I rate this game 10/10 seriously, just buy it."

The game can essentially be divided into two primary components: a third person action game with light RPG elements and a sort of base management game.The action aspect is the title’s primary focus and the player will spend most of their time engaged in fighting against, running from, or sneaking around zombies.  The combat, while not being outstanding, functions fairly well and is fun, although I suspect that if the game were much longer, it might become rather formulaic.  Most of the combat is melee based (as bullets are rare) but firearms do play a part and are useful against larger swarms of zombies.The combat does suffer somewhat due to one particular problem that is almost inherent to third person action games in that it is sometimes difficult to get your character to face the direction that you want in the heat of the moment.  While this problem is nowhere near the level of old school Resident Evil games, it is occasionally a source of frustration.The only truly bad aspect of the third person part of the game is the vehicles.  They just don’t drive well at all and are somewhat of a pain, especially considering how quickly they become damaged.The RPG/base management side of State of Decay is what makes into something more than just another zombie action game.  You have to keep track of several different resources which are consumed steadily as you play, as well as deciding on different facilities that can be installed in your limited space.  Eventually your group can change bases and find themselves larger, expanded digs that offer more possibilities for development.  The game does present the player with some interesting choices here, because even the biggest bases cannot contain all possible facilities and most of the facilities are fairly useful.You will not only manage bases, indeed you will spend more time dealing with the survivors themselves.  Some of these individuals are part of the story, but most of them will be found throughout the game.  On a conceptual level, the survivors are the most interesting part of the game, as you aren’t really playing as any one person but rather as the group as a whole.  If one character dies, you simply move onto another.  I’ve always wanted something like this in survival based games, as it allows for tragic disasters that don’t necessarily force you to reload because of a Game Over.The game does seem to fall into the unfortunate hole that Grand Theft Auto IV did, in that you will spend much of your time babysitting your other characters, as they all seem to occasionally forget that they are in the middle of the apocalypse and wander off to do something utterly moronic.State of Decay is more than a little buggy but there have already been patches which have fixed some of this.  Frame rate problems were pretty consistent, although it was never unplayable.Many of the side quest arcs felt undeveloped, like a novel that ends 100 pages too early.  The game itself is short as well, but I enjoyed this aspect of it, as I don’t really have the time to dedicate to very many 40+ hour releases anymore, but I do wish that certain secondary arcs had a bit more meat to them.Overall, State of Decay is one of those games that come very close to being truly great but is held back by a few problems.  It is inexpensive though, and is the ideal game to tackle when you have a free weekend, as it doesn’t take long to finish.  I am really looking forward to the expansions, as I think that they will polish the game’s faults and perhaps add more of a challenge.  Above all, while the game itself is good enough, it is the promise of future titles, made in light of the lessons learned from State of Decay that really excites me.   The developer has some great concepts that just need to be hammered out and hopefully the success of State of Decay will allow them to do just that."

It's not too diffecult to play even for those who do not play games often or have not played zombie survival games before. I'm having fun looking for stuff and new survivors and getting our homebase nicely set-up. A bunch of things could be a little (or a lot) different as some things just do not seem very realistic and could have been created a little differently. Not to mention that some missions are starting to be rather annoying like friends needing help hunting down certain zombies or they need you to pick em up. I'm running around doing every thing by myself so I would think they can do the same thing. Not to mention zombies  just spawning right in front of you.

I took on too many undead without enough ammo handy and it came back to bite me.  And chew me.  And swallow me.  And now that character is gone.  The game is all the more real because choices have consequences and outcomes that matter.

Controls aren't difficult and the world is enjoyable to explore. No matter how far you advance or how strong you get the fear was always there that I could fall to the undead or the special undead.One of my only dislikes is how the game calculates time inbetween playing and has events occur while you aren't in game.  This can be frustrating for players who aren't going to just power grind through the entire game in a few sitdowns.

I am still playing and i just got it yesterday but I want to write this review now. This game has you manage a group of survivors, that actually have feelings, and your decisions do matter. If someone dies there is no respawning that person is gone.... FOREVER.  So make sure you keep good care of your people and be nice and fortifed. Even though there are some bugs it does not matter. I have only seen one zombie clipped into the floor in my whole 10 hours. Remember everything is up to you. If you don't give 2 craps about your community, people will start venturing off to find their own supplys.(you either have to save them if they get in trouble, or they just die) or if you care about your community you will grow lasting friend ships between characters. RIP Allan Yesterday-Today. Also people might catch the flew. What do I do if my gardener catches the black lung pop (lol zoolander reffrence). You can put them in the sick bay where hopefully(if u have the supplys to help them) they will recover. If they do not, you have to put a bullet in their brain before they turn into a ZED. There are many things to do in this game some examples are: Raid houses full of zombies, take out zombie infestations,find true love,get harrased by the U.S army,eat chips so u can run farther, help survivors, make friends with neighbours becoming allys and you begin to work together. After this my favourite part of State of Decay is that your decisions matter. For example, I was helping two survivors that was going to join my camp, on the drive back to my camp I got a notification that my Neighbours Ally,Chris,and Peter had died. I made my descision to help the new survivors and not them. Therefore they are dead, and will never respawn. In the end I give State of Decay a 10/10"

They attract hoards but they can be the ulitmate weapon. Guns feel useful, they can down a zombie and sometimes outright kill them in one shot, but ammo is scarse and reloads can be costly.

The game is a take on zombie holocaust survivors treading on a humane path of survival and finding strength in numbers. This is not a game similar to DayZ or Infestation. State of Decay does not even have multiplayer but that doesn't mean the game isn't exciting or fun.  There are no bandits here (or trolls.) It's just you (and a small group of AI survivors) and the ever increasing threat of being eaten by a hordes of zed.From resource scavenging to item acquisition, SOD remains true to a non-fantasy game. You don't get to be MacGuyver here and build a poisonous skull basher from an old rake, duct tape and a dead raccoon, or the like. Instead you and your group prioritize food, materials, meds, fuel, weapons and human power to survive. You get to build a working stronghold (which you can upgrade lots later on), with an ever important watchtower (and a sharpshooter and zombies to shoot at), rescue survivors who may join up with you, escort or help out old friends and neighbors with a resource run; there are a lot of things to do in this game. But really, most of it involves running over, bashing, decapitating, or shooting zeds. Serious fun. If you don't mind the gore.-A rich game. No regrets with this one.-Awesome graphics.-Gameplay (fighting,shooting,movements) is simple but not too simple to be boring and repetitious.

But once I broke down and played it, I found a suprisingly good game, better than many AAA games and one of the best Zombie games I have played. Its addictive, its compelling and its fun. My only real complaint is the offline calculations that cause events to happen and resourecs to get scavenged based on how long you have been offline (easily fixed with mods) and I would like a more compelling reason to set up base in any of the other potential home bases rather than just racing to Snyder Trucking.I still remember the first time Marcus got caught, exhausted, with a damaged weapon, out of ammo, by a horde, I had no idea the game had permadeath, a feature I usually hate, but in SoD it makes sense and it makes the game so much more compelling. This game is WELL worth the money at full price.

It hits close to home if your a fan of the walking dead tv series because it has that kind of feel which is pure awesome to me. I will not degrade past zombie games were it was just run and gun, those were great in their day.

,Recommended,241540,12285302,"Posted: 28 September, 2014",all,MaximumTacolord,"State of Decay is a single player zombie survival game between the 78-85% range (depending on how much you love killing zombies).  State is a combination of several factors that makes it really enjoyable to play.  There is loot collection, leveling, exploration, base management, quests, killing zombies (but the game doesn't give you a kill counter), and faction/reputation influence with other survivors.  You might think the game might stretch itself too far, but each trait isn't very deep but still deep enough that it's enjoyable to work with and won't become overwhelming.  Characters level quickly, really good loot isn't rare but there is some variety so exploring is still fun and you want to find supplies for your base, and characters have different traits so leveling different characters can create new experiences of play.Combat is simple, not quite as fun or complex as Dead Rising, but you can be overwhelmed and there is a slight learning curve so you'll get much better at killing zombies quickly.  Stealth is really unsatisfying though and not really worth the effort.  Like Dead Rising, cars are crazy overpowered and will become your main source of murdering zombies quickly.Sadly, the game is buggy and short.  I've made cars blow up or get stuck routinely, seen zombies go through walls, escorted survivors who refuse to work on quest objectives so the quest never ends, and so on.  The worst part is, the game doesn't seem to release updates to polish the game, but still releases DLC.  Which is simply insulting.The game can be beaten in two afternoons and the storyline is simple and unskippable in most parts so if you play the game twice you'll get stuck listening to dialogue you've already heard a lot.  The ending and final showdown is a letdown so being forced to experience it again sucks.Finally, the game doesn't tell you how to do everything.  I have no idea how to trade with other survivors, but it's possible as you'll get a message saying you can some games.  Selecting special skills isn't clear and is really easy to miss.  When you do notice them, you may not actually select them because you have to hold Q first and the game isn't clear about the fact that you don't actually have the skills.  The game also warns you about overstocking supplies but I see no reason not to and one isn't given.Overall, the game is fun and easy to get pulled into.  But it is hardly a masterpiece."

While the overall theme is nothing special, it is a well excuted. Zombies are a threat, you're generally not rewarded for destroying them and thus making too many mistakes in combat can result in the perma-death of one of your characters.You are able to meet new characters and befriend them by assisting them when they require it and eventually they will join your headquarters and become playable, each having their own skill sets, such as being good with guns, or quick with a melee weapon.  The combat system is simple and functions easily in a pinch, melee attacks, kick, push and dodge, which is incredibly fun and fluid when you're beating on a group of three or more like it were the Matrix.The game has the typical open world dynamic events system where you are waypointed to missions, but there is no shortage of them. Most of the buildings in the game are open and searchable for loot, weapons and ammo are generally quite easy to find and you will constantly need to haul goods back to the headquarters to stop chaos breaking loose. It's a zombie apocolypse that feels like it has some weight and morale choice, along with plenty of responsability.All in all, I recommend this game for all of the aforementioned reasons and the small price it is fetching for."

What's not to love?As you progress you continue to build your group. You have the option of upgrading your compound or even completely moving it as you please. You are given various tasks to perform in addition to the main quest line. These quests usually involve killing rogue zombies or rescuing one of your allies. However, once you've done each one of these sides quests once you no longer experience new content the next time. The side quests repeat the same content over and over again. You constantly have to save an ally, destroy and infestation or take one of your suicidal housemate for a pep talk. And if you are considering skipping them, think again. They each will expire after a few hours and incompletion can result in lost resources, morale and even lives.This is an open world game, but with the constant quest requirements you have very little time to do what I personally enjoy most out of an open world game, explore.

It reminds me of such great games as Gta, Walking dead, Warriors, Left 4 dead, Dayz and many more. Has a regular campaign, and two dlc:s which change the gameplay. In the campaign your destiny is to find out what has happened and is there any cure. You travel to a different locations in a vast area with woodlands, cities, farms, etc. You must scavenge for supplies, maintain your homebase, complete different missions and look for another survivors to join your group. There are lots of playable characters and several locations to establish homebase. In the Breakdown dlc, you start in the same map, but this time you can decide if you want to try to survive as long as you can, or advance to next difficulty level, which will remove some cars, adds more special infected, gives less loot etc. There are different heroes with variety of skills and weapons to unlock by succeeding in different tasks in the first 6 breakdown levels. The Lifeline dlc brings you in a completely different city, and the rules have changed quite a bit. Basic survival still implies, but you have only one option as a homebase, and you must defend it against sieges, which gets really difficult in the end. This dlc has campaing missions, but you can just try to survive. All in all its a good zombie/survival game which has some minor bugs, frustrating situations, when a very important person just has to become a martyr, and moments of success, when you land the killing blow on a Juggernaut. Oh, and the game is basically designed to play with controller...+ Survival aspect+ Many playable characters+ Managing the ""homefront""+ Dlc:s+ Lots of stuff to do- Vehicle physics- Vehicle handling- No multiplayer- Camera angles- Ai survivors ""skill""- Too much stuff to do"

You can build and upgrade a variety of homebases and then do missions from there. You must balance the need for materials to build essential areas like beds, a workshop or medical area with the groups need for food, gas, building materials and ammo. All the while there are sudden events that pop up like helping another survivor group or helping your group with killing a special infected.The game is solid at its core with the only major gripes being how absolutely stupid the friendly AI is, and variety of the missions.Some examples of incredibly frustrating AI in a 1-save-perma-death game include:Friendly AI trying to tank a Big Un and instantly dying.Friendly AI standing around during sieges, not helping.Friendly AI not knowing to back up from choke points, preventing you from firebombing, grenading or using any sense of strategy.Friendly AI finishing a mission, then walking straight home across a path of special infected or hordes, which kill them.Because the game can sometimes be a tad cheap with car rollovers or hitboxes, especially with the Big Un's 1 hit kill, I wish that there was at least a single save point, but i understand the direction the game is trying to take. You can also get around this by saving a copy of the game file but a more user friendly option should be available.90/100. A must own for people who love zombie survival and scavenging."

Between the three scenarios and numerous characters the game never gets stale.The maps aren't extremely large (8 square miles with about 4 of them traversable) but almost every building is fully mapped out and explorable which really adds to the atmosphere.The general survival mechanics are VERY deep. It's not wise to run and gun in this game as most resources are finite until you get a handle on how the systems work. Certainly deeper than a lot of AAA zombie sims as of late *cough* Dead Rising 3!!! *cough*I recommend this game to anyone that appreciates good balanced game play and wants to get lost in a world that is ever changing even after you stop playing.

The overall implementation is polished and presented well, the action is good, and the level of challenge is about right. There are missions, but a lot of the game is about exploring and searching out supplies, which gives it a nice open feel.Where it falls down, for me, is that it's a bit too gameified. Probably the biggest manifestation of this is the zombie respawn mechanics. There's simply no such thing as clearing an area; zombies always magically respawn in unlimited numbers. If they came in from the edge of the map or something, that'd be one thing. The fact that they just pop in everywhere to maintain a uniform distribution takes a lot of the genuine feel out of the environment. It's more of an arcade experience dressed up as a persistent world.The mechanics for building up your ""home base"" are also rather to gamey. The available options are very streamlined and simplified, to the point where you're just picking what goes into a few slots. It doesn't feel like building anything at all; it's more like making choices in a skill tree.I can understand why these choices were made, because it would have been more challenging to make the game work without them. That said, for me they make it a much more limiting experience than what I hoped for in my first few hours of play. I'd still recommend the game for what it gets right, but it's not quite what I was hoping for."

The developers have maintained decent patches since the game has come out, as well as putting out DLC. There are some bugs that can ruin your day, depending on how you like play your zombie survival games. One that gets most people are the zeds that occasionally walk through the doors or even walls at times. From my point of view, it's more fun when it's like that because you can't necessarily prepare for when it happens, unlike almost all the other encounters in the game.The zeds by themselves are pretty easy and fun to take down for casual gameplay. It gets fairly visceral when you get the kill cam to shine in on a jumping head smash. Speaking of the kill cam, one thing I wish the devs would change is -when- the kill cam gets activated. I really don't like it when I get to see an awesome kill, then mobbed by 10+ zeds because I couldn't see what was going on from the camera angle. ._.There are a few ""hero"" types as well, for both playable characters and zombies. Zombies you get Screamers, Bloaters, Juggernauts (Big 'Uns), Ferals, and Armored (Army). Between just those types, you get varied range of gameplay when you decide to play it each time. They seem to have been toned down somewhat since I first started playing, or I've just been getting better at doing a combat roll (life-saving maneuver, there).All in all, if you don't mind a few bugs or non-AAA-rate graphics, SoD is a zombie game you can enjoy for a pretty long time.

The permadeath was a great way to really draw me into the terror of a post-apocayptic world. These guys over here are asking for help with a Juggernaut? Sorry, dudes, that looks too dangerous. You're on your own.I was really excited about the base-building and people-management portions of the game.. unfortunately I felt like the people-management was probably the weakest aspect. Too little variety in the types of missions people wanted you to run, I don't feel like everyone's problems would actually be solved by just taking a walk together. ;)I also had a love-hate relationship with the time aspect of the game. It added another layer of difficulty that your resources would deplete while the game was off, and I enjoyed that people would fix stuff while you were gone. But I was frustrated a few times by how quickly some of the missions expired. I ended up missing out on achivements as a result of spending a day off the computer, and that's kind of a big problem.I'm not sure I'll pick up the Breakdown DLC but I AM looking forward to Lifeline."

A perfect middle-ground between tense, thoughtful, strategic survival sim and arcadey zombie-killing fun.  It's clearly a labor of love, and I commend Undead Labs for what they've achieved.That said, the Breakdown DLC: a DLC that, in essence, adds an 'endless' mode to the base game by changing the scripts around, recycling the base map, and gradually ramping up the difficulty.  A good addition, in theory, albeit a bit expensive for what it does.  My big problem is that, for whatever reason, the breakdown DLC actually ADDS BUGS to the game.  Within an hour of playing, I noticed two problems that weren't present throughout my first playthrough of vanilla SoD: first, the on-screen button prompts flicker between keyboard and gamepad input; a problem that isn't necessarily debilitating if you've played it through already using one input or another, but it definitely wasn't present before the DLC.  Second, and considerably more game-affecting: while driving, if you pull up the in-game map and then close it, your character leaps out of the vehicle they're driving.  WHAT?  This was NEVER a problem, and this is SERIOUSLY debilitating if you want to be able to drive and know where you're going.  The fact that I've noticed these two bugs in less than half an hour of play is telling.I loved vanilla SoD, and I stand by it as an excellent zombie survival sim.  That said, I cannot recommend the Breakdown DLC in its current state, no matter how much I love it in theory.  Caveat emptor."

Everything I was looking for in a zombie-survival game is done right by SoD. The rest however is so screwed up that I'm not able to enjoy this at all..The complete lack of a tutorial or any usefull explanation whatsoever: you walk out of the base to get some building supplies but there is someome who needs to get recued and also all the food is gone. There is no explanation about the mechanics so there is no way for me to figure out what to do first or last.How much food do I need? How fast will it run out? What should I do first? Why should I make an outpost? What do I get when I build walls? What penalties are there to dying? What is an infestation and what makes it appear? Why should I bar windows? What are the random outposts with strangers? How does the influence system work.. etc. etc. etc..This also has to do with the user interface. Which is simply horrible. The interface isn't explained well (an interface that needs an explanation is kind of a problem on it's own). The controls in-game but also in the UI are horrible. It's like playing twister on your keyboard, combine this with a horde of zombies running behind you.. simply frustrating.. Also the gameplay does not feel solid, I never had the idea to be in control of my character. All my input felt more like ""suggestions"" to my character rather than being in direct control, which turns close-zombie-combat into interpretative dance on acid rather than slick survival horror.Instead of feeling like battling a never ending stream of zombies I felt more like battling an ever bigger stream of bugs, annoyances, gameplay weirdness and the control scheme."

76561198047575020,Recommended,241540,13743495,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,ChiliRTF,"Highly recommend.Pros:Your characters are average people who can't typically outrun a zombie horde on foot. You can't carry much, so planning is everything- this includes all weapons, ammo, and other items. (Vehicle storage is very useful.) Stamina is limited. Characters who are not at the home base get tired (penalized max. stamina) and must return to the home base to rest.The firearms are modeled after real weapons and the sound effects are well done. The mechanics of zombie killing are true to zombie lore, in that torso hits will slow them down, but only headshots kill. At first I found the melee actions clunky, but after getting the hang of special attacks/exexutes it seemed much better.The map isn't what I would call huge, but the fact that you can enter all the buildings counts for a lot.All resouces are finite and do not respawn. However, anything you run over with a car does. As do the zombies. So many zombies.Cons:As a previous reviewer stated, the characters you are not playing as are as helpless as baked potatoes. While you have control over the home base resources and building projects, you have no control over any character other than the one you are currently playing as. Any character left at a home base can suddenly become part of the endlessly recurring side missions. These wouldn't be so bad if they didn't happen so frequently and if Lily (the character on the radio giving you the missions) didn't keep chiding you to get a move on. It takes the game from being a very solid zombie survival experience and crosses a line to glorified babysitting.This is not a long game (original SoD). The storyline can probably be completed in a few hours, if you want. This could explain the frequency of repetitive side missions- with a short storyline, more side missions fill out the game. But exploring the map on your own and hunting for unique weapons also fills out the game, and the side missions become a distraction.Overall:You won't be disappointed. The relative realism of the playable characters is executed well. It would be a nearly perfect game if you had more control over the other survivors when you aren't playing as them. It was infuriating to bring my character home to rest, only to find the three other characters I improved/outfitted ""away from home"" because they were stuck in side missions. Compared to a title like Dead Island, this one lacks the outrageous crafting abilities and lengthy storyline, but feels like a more believable zombie apocalypse scenario."

The game is brilliantly made balancing surviving zombie hordes with community relations, gathering supplies and finding new people to have in your community. iv also seen people complain that the game sort of continues on even when ur not playing it which is true it does but only with events like saving someone or hearing on the radio that there are some people who want to trade ect, the day night cycle only continues whilst your playing. supplies youv gathered can also drain whilst your not playing but its not insanely difficult to get more, u do need to keep on top of things to make sure youv got the materials you want or need to upgrade things but later levels you dont have to concentrate much on the people in the community as u can have a garden and infirmary to feed and heal your people and medicine doesnt go down quickly and is fairly easy to find. one of my favourite features of this game is just how much free roaming u can do as it gives you the freedom to do whatever u want rather than being told what to do and having to do it to progress. Iv probably missed something to say about this game but overall i cant recommend this game enough as even if your not into zombie or scary things like me, this game is very enjoyable with both surviving, gathering and killing zombies with just enough tension to feel slightly uneasy all the time keeping u on your toes"

,Recommended,241540,7977907,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Auzarius,"Right off the bat it is obvious that this game is a console port.  You are met with poor keyboard and mouse controls and a lot of graphical stuttering / frame skipping.  I would definitely recommend using a controller for this game since the keyboard and mouse feel very clunky.  The game also has an issue with crashing randomly after a while.  I haven't been able to tell if it happens because of the autosave feature yet, but I haven't lost any progress as a result of the crashing.  It happens fairly infrequently; somewhere after a few hours of gameplay.  If you can get past those few flaws (and can hopefully find it on a steam sale) then I would recommend this game.  It doesn't have the polish of a AAA title, but it plays a lot like an open world game like GTA except with zombies.  Graphically this game does ok aside from the framerate issues and shadows/lighting.The game mechanics manage to keep you busy whether you are working the main quest line, gathering supplies, saving a comrade that is gathering supplies, helping other survivors, killing off zombie infestations, etc.  New quests are popping up all of the time.  It can feel a bit repetitive after a while for sure, but it can be a lot of fun wiping out large zombie infestations.  The main currency in the game is reputation, which you gain by doing quests.  That can be spent on ammo from other storage lockers, upgrades, assistance from your friends, setting up outposts and other helpful options.  Supplies are rather plentiful but inventory space is limited so it can take quite a few trips to scavenge (this can be time consuming depending on how far it is from your main base).  You can call for runners but unless they have adequate combat skills you end up having to save them a lot of the time.  Overall I would say if you can get past it bugs/quirks it is an enjoyable open-world zombie apocalypse game."

In this game they are nice enough and the gameplay MORE than make up for anything you might see as lacking.I would certainly suggest getting this and the available DLCs. Fantastic!Revision 02/04/2015: Apparently there is an update version of the game due out this year. It looks to improve the graphics side for the PC version as well as adding numerous gameplay additions. If you don't already own the game then wait for this. The site says all DLC will be included, so that's a bonus."

Before I go into all the things I liked about it though, let me first trash the game in the only way I know how. Lists of cons...1. AI is woefully inadequete. This is obvious during combat when an NPC decides to try and kick a Feral Zombie to death instead of using a firearm, melee weapon or grenade from their inventory. This is both hilarious and frustrating but, if you're not careful, will lead to their untimely demise.2. Fuel. While I know why it isn't used in the game, I feel as though the game is worse because of it. Cars don't require gas which is a shame as that could've led to some scary situations. This was left out due to time constrants but still... They couldn't patch it in?3. Base raids. In Lifeline, your base will sometimes get raided. This is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. In the base game and Breakdown, however, there isn't any true base raids which is disappointing.4. Awkward controls due to it being a port but most are rebindable.5. Finally, the humans you encounter are all super friendly and nice.  I get that the devs wanted their game to be unique but I feel the game suffers greatly because of this. If the world went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ would it really be so peaceful? Probably not.Now that I am done tearing this game apart, I'll list what I do like about it.1. Resource gathering is fun.2. Vehicles can blow up after crushing too many zombies.3. Grenades.4. Survivors can perma-die. That includes the protagonist.5. No save states so you can't reload.6. Several base sites.7. Cars handle differently and can take differing amounts of damage.8. Lots of possible group combinations due to high number of NPCs.9. Campaign is as emotional as you want it to be.10. Sandbox map (though a little small) is big enough to ♥♥♥♥ around in).11. Diverse cast of zombies. They're so special :P12. A lot of hours worth of gameplay, if you play through the story right.I could name more but I'll leave you with the skinny. If you haven't bought it already, wait for the updated version to be released as it will probably be a lot better. Overall, I loved this game and it was a lot of fun."

I honestly have no idea when or where I got this game, but I decided to give it a try over vacation and was instantly hooked.I was expecting a generic zombie openworld survival game and the graphics and lighting effects were almost painful for long period of gaming. The first was quickly revealed to be only a tiny sliver of State of Decay while the latter was easily fixed with a shader mod from the Nexus. If anyone reading this has ever played with and enjoyed the Wasteland Defenders line of mods for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, stop reading this review and BUY State of Decay! Yes there are zombies, yes you hit them in the head with shovels and wrenches, but at the core State of Decay is much more about bringing together a group of survivors and managing resources and manpower to survive the zombie apocalypse. Scavenging is a primary advancing mechanic and you have to intelligently decide how to spend resources, balancing better functionality with the ever growing demands of your home.As if the main game wasn’t awesome enough, the DLC Breakdown adds a never ending survival mode which in my opinion is the absolute best way to play the game. I have sunk a ridiculous amount of time into this game and I plan to sink many more hours.As a last little note, the game has moments when you’ll think to yourself “wow what a glitchy mess” but I have never found them to be a deal breaker.

You start out as a lone survivor and can gather others to you and form your own little community a la The Walking Dead.  There's a lot of wandering around gathering resources, but you can also have runners from the camp go out and collect whatever you find so that you can keep exploring.  Not only that but you can play as almost any member of the community, so long as they're friendly towards ""you"".

You don't want to be stuck on foot at night across town, your car overturned, and horde's attention on your flesh.After a while though, some tasks can feel repetitive. But I have yet to really delve into the DLCs.I knew I was going to like the game when  playing as the ""main"" (first) character, I was picked up and crushed due to my mistake. Gone forever, my first casualty. It instilled so much regret I couldn't bear to lose another survivor.

Elements of the game are quite interesting, leveling skills and character swapping when the person you are playing gets tired or injured.

However, the reason I recommend Breakdown is because the base game by itself is linear.Not in the Point A to Point B Call of Duty sense, but in the 'Every Mission is the exact same for everyone' sense. If you play the campaign, you start as the same person, with the same stuff, and you meet the other people in the game who have the same stuff.The Breakdown DLC however is a complete rehaul DLC that turns a semi-open world game into a completely open world Sandbox experience. While the map is the same as that of the campaign, the randomly generated locations of resources and the amped up difficulty with the Permadeath and the more zombies everywhere makes the Breakdown DLC the quinticential zombie game if you're into survival as well as slaying zombies."

Initially I was really put off my the graphics (which looked dated) and horrible colour/gamma display, so much so that I almost didn't bother playing it past the first few minutes... But, the day after installing it and virtually writing it off, I decided to give it a whirll...What I found was this game is actually incredibly rich, with really nice realistic details, details like like vehicle boots/trunks, why haven't games allowed us to use vehicles to store stuff in in the past? fill the boot, drive it around to various places, then unload when you're home.. (It's a small detail but just one of several that are pretty innovative).This is the story, just the intro, which seems to be the only thing that's consistent... You're fishing with a friend, and the town gets attacked by zombies, then you meet a chick, and your friend gets hurt and you shack up with other survivors in another nearby town... that's the intro pretty much, the rest of it is up to you, but there are missions that seem to follow a story line... And you can pretty much ignore them until you're in the mood to do them, or in many cases, simply forced to do them because as your band of survivors grow, you find yourself needing say a doctor, or a new place to stay etc...Now the convo's are pretty great between the survivors, and you build up friendships and or lose them by let's say NEARLY RUNNING THEM OVER, (this game actually takes that into consideration). Or ignoring their obvious pains, like depression, or fear... (I'm sure there's plenty, but I've only been playing for about 10 hours...) So you can work on them, and yourself and build up skills, like brute strength, shooting skills, diplomacy, etc etc (I'm surprised by the number of options)So as you can imagine, with good conversations, and highly individualistic members, you can actually grow quite attached to the individuals... Here's the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though... When they die... they really die... there's no reloading, all saves are auto saves, and once you've made your character a tough nut who's great at everything, like cardio, and hitting stuff, all you need to do is mess up, keep using them when they're tired, and find yourself in a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of trouble as you're car is pulled to pieces by a swarm of zombies, and he can't fight for♥♥♥♥♥♥cos he hasn't slept for 2 days or his bat has just snapped in half over the last zombies head, cos you forgot to put it in for repairs last night...But... the game just goes on... You end up taking control of another random character from your group, who might have god awful people skills and couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag, but has excellent tv trivia knowledge..!!!That... although an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥! Is awesome!!! cos it's the sort of mechanic that really keeps you on your toes... And makes you genuinely concerned for the group's safety... To top it off, you're pretty rushed off your feet, there are often several (more than just a couple) of missions that you can do, or you can just go roaming rround towns door to door kicking zombies in the nuts and looking for resources to use in the construction of new parts of your safehouse, which is attacked by hordes of zombies btw, intuitively also by the looks of it... The most frustrating is that it happens whilst you're away also, and without your help, I'm sure you'd lose some good friends, maybe even all of them in the process...So anyway... in a nutshell, the game is awesome, well worth investing in, and I'll definitely be buying the other 2 parts once i've got through this part... 8.9/10"

It is to be expected that Indie titles are never going to be of AAA quality, but this game has great replay value.The premise is a simple one, it's a Zombie Apocolypse, find a base, fill it with people. weapons, ammo, food, medicine and building materials scavenged from the impressively large map. Almost every building can be entered, looted, turned into protective outposts, and there are quite a number of vehicles to choose from, although more variety wouldn't go amiss...Where this game stands out is the surprising depth once you have learned the ropes, (which unfortunately will take time as the game is certainly not forthcoming with tutorial-based advice!) But the character building system, traits, weapon variety, 'Special' zombies, likeable characters, and multple bases will keep you amused for some time.Breakdown is my personal favourite game type, as it allows you more freedom and an inclined difficulty level, although if you have played the game as much I have, you will fall into a routine as the difficulty increases and will not find it too challenging.Lifeline, the second DLC on the other hand is rather tough, again with little tutorial advise for new players.However this game does deserve your time as it really is very fun, very rewarding, looks great, and it is easy to see a lot of TLC has been put into it by it's development team. Another plus-point in my opinion; Undeadlabs are very active on Twitter, Twitch, they have fantastic forums and have made game update decisions based on customer feedback.A great game worth playing, especially the Breakdown DLC."

As a complete package I definitely recommend the game, especially for those interested in the survival/zombie apocalypse genre.The level of freedom is, for the most part, excellent. The map is large, varying, and the world is populated by plenty of survivors and even more zombies to keep things interesting. There are an impressive amount of customisable ""home sites"" where you can set up base, raise defences, and build other useful facilities to help you and your (AI) friends survive the zombie threat. It has a neat day/night cycle and some very nice touches to the vehicle combat. The game does have quite a few annoying glitches at times but they are sporadic and do not fundamentally detract from the enjoyment of the game. The most annoying feature of the game that I found was the fact that there were too many things to do all at once. You will receive 4-5 missions at a time which can be aggravating and at times overwhelming considering many are time sensitive. And for the first time ever, I will complain that this game could have benefitted immensely from an online co-op mode. Enjoying State of Decay with friends and trying to survive would be a lot of fun. It's a real shame there is no such feature.In all, it is a good game and definitely worth checking out for those interested in a game with quite a lot of freedom and those just generally into the survival/zombie apocalypse genre. 8/10."

It's fun, challenging, and a little unlike any other zombie/survival games I've played, as the various elements in the game actually works really well together. I like how it's a story driven game, while still being a sandbox-type-of-game, so if you feel like doing something other than just playing the story, there's plenty of room to do so.Now when I bought it, the game was buggy as hell, and I've spent numerous hours making my own bug fixes, optimizations and what not, since the developers hardly did any updates during early access. When it was released it still had a lot of issues, major control issues that is. But rather than fixing the annoying little issues, bugs and what not, they pushed new content through instead. Now it's come to 2 DLC's, and now I've just realized that I'm not ever gonna play the game again, since they just released the exact same game again with a new engine. Rather than finishing their original product they re-release the same again. Nice going, smells like a rip off to me.Bottom line is they made a great game, but they've left the original on the store to try lure people to purchase it, along with DLC's - only then for you to realize that it's STILL buggy as hell and there's the occasional crash. And by the time you figured that, you get to realize there's a re-released version of it on Steam, with a new engine and a lot of bug fixes.Great game, but don't buy it, simply due to the fact the developers took a huge dump on whoever purchased the game - and they feel fine doing so, so one can only expect them to do the exact same with ANY game they ever make.

No frills or distractions. You have your group, you have to keep it alive in world of finite resources, aggro zombies and, most of all, permadeath!The harshness of your character's death and the realistic consequences of your actions (headless charges, screams, noise, arrogance) make you Think before you Do. Judge your strenght, think your goals for the day, have a look for dispersed mates.The game is not fully stealth playable, but it does reward caution and gives you a broad option of weaponry to fight for life once cornered. It is defo melee oriented: only deploy firearms with silencers; noise sources Span zombies all around. Additionally,the friendly AI will most of the time go for melee, so it makes sence to pimp them up for close combat.The 'finite resources' think is overstated. It is true that you have to sweat for your supplies, and they do end, but you will be far beyond the game/level end before they thin out critically.Only downside - the friendly AI. They are totally dumb, so for most of the game you will be One fighting for All."

The gameplay is freeroam the moment you start, but, for newcomers, following the tutorial until you meet your second group will definately improve your skills. Elements like fatigue, serious injuries, or sickness keep the rotation of characters smooth, but until you start pulling in more than a few survivors, you'll notice that most characters are going to be too tired to go adventuring. One tip is to definately not put all your eggs into one basket with character selection, I made the mistake of sticking to three primary survivors that would switch out every so often, and then lost the character to a 'Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' type zombie. There are special class zombies, but they are usually rare. Killing them is simple, some have less health than the others, but I've noticed the best way to deal with a crowd is to ram them with your car. That applies to all except for the 'BB' his health is tremendous and is completely offset to whatever skills aquired and weapon you have in your hands. Unloading twenty headshots from a shotgun, point blank will still cause frustration as you realize that the only way to get around it is to blow up your car with it pinned against a wall. And going in for a melee is outrageously insane unless you want to see your character ripped in half. This is only one of the two unfair advantages you will have during the game, the other is the mutant zombie that is definately faster than you, and will definately take out a large chunk of your health. It has just a little bit more health than normal zombies, but it means you'll have to be faster on the swing, or quicker on the draw because these things will tackle you, leaving you defenseless.The gameplay gets a little repetitive, especially when you have to save a group member every other time you send them out for scavenging. Or, constantly getting calls about hunting a special zombie type that will penalize your morale and inventory if you don't get around to it. The driving is a bit tricky at first, moreso since none of the fences are breakable nor are you able to run over them in your car. This can lead to some massive detours or a serious ding in the paint job. The spawn rate of enemies can be a bit annoying as well, having just cleared out an area, passing through a minute later, and there are two herds closing in from both directions.The instructions for leveling up and choosing a skill that gives you a bonus are for you to figure out on your own, meaning there will be some time spent in your inventory/journal looking for a way to do so. Some more instruction would've been a bit more useful, but aside from the setbacks, the game concept is quite good and yet to be done elsewhere. I would probably be interested in a sequel, fan of zombie games as I am, but I would need to see some improvements on house layout diversity, side mission necessity, spawn rate of enemies, and difficulty scaling. A system that tracked and monitored zombie prescene in an area would be a welcome addition.The collision mechanics are a far cry, and there's never a moment of rest for your character, so I recommend the game at a 6/10."

Combat is both fun, and sometimes intense as in any zombie story, individually, the threat is just not really there, its when they start to swarm you that things get hairy.While you do start off with a character you might consider to be your main character, this is more about group survival then any one individual.  Are there any downsides, yes, but they do not detract from this being a fun game.  This game combines real world time passage with the ingame time passage, something some players might not appreciate, as to me it felt as if the game punishes you for not playing, that and the complete absence of multi-player are the downsides.Everything else makes this an incredible game!!!!"

Bought the original on Xbox and played for many an hour; but as I began to move onto PC gaming I enjoyed the experience so much that I re-purchased State of Decay on Steam; along with the Breakdown DLC (typical that both were half price a couple weeks later... Such is life)There are a few really in-depth reviews on here but I shall be fairly brief. Through all the zombie games I've played over the years, this one is by far the closest I've ever found to 'that game' you have in your head when you want one with zombies. The game is by no means perfect; but by every means points the genre in completely the right direction - the fear of danger with the perma-death system; the scareness of ammo causing every shot to count; the ability to commandeer every car you see, the aspect of stealth, resource management, multiple survivors in a team to increase chances of survival... So many golden aspects that lead me to believe that if and when a State of Decay II comes out, it will undoubtedly be the best zombie/survival game there is. Despite this, I sometimes feel that the zombies do not quite pose a big enough fear or threat for the player (although this is almost solved in the higher levels of Breakdown) but perhaps a higher volume of zombies in denser groups but with slower movement speeds would be an alternative for the future... Or maybe that's just me.To be frank it's all the little things that make this game worthwhile - forgetting to suppress your pistol and bringing in 20 nearby zombies with the sound caused is one of those moments that brings this game alive. If you are in any way considering the purchase - go right ahead and I promise you will not be disappointed."

Given the game dynamic is already unforgiving (final death with no saves, limited resources, leveling required to meet the increasing hordes, etc), any fails linked to software glitching are incredibly frustrating.  I am happy to lose based on my poor decisions and gameplay; I am very frustrated to lose when the game does not allow me to select a weapon in my inventory, or does not allow me to kill a zombie locked in a wall (who can then attack me when I am swarmed).I love the concept.

Unforunately, like a bad relationship, things seem very rosy for the first couple of hours until you really get to know the person and you realize there isn't much too them. State of Decay is pretty much that. You start off scrounging for supplies, not really knowing if it's safe to go between buildings, wondering what calamity is going to hit you next all while hordes of undead are roaming around making everything miserable. The gameplay system is very shiny as it tempts you with character flaws/traits, boons for managing supplies and building your own zombie-proof fort! How cool is that?!Really cool, for like 20 minutes. Then you realize that you don't really need to try at gathering that many supplies, or when you do, it's just a unchallenging grind. You end up glossing over most of the stuff you find because it really doesn't matter if you bring it back to the base or not. All the cool boons you get for having friends i rarely used (except for thepolice dudes from the judges offices, they were pretty helpful). Having your map point out where everything is was actually kind of a letdown in a way, as you knew exactly what you needed to do everytime and that is a huge benefit when you can just avoid parts of town/country you don't want to go into.Ultimately, State of Decay was not that thrilling of a survival game. It was more of a ""survive then thrive"" kinda scenario, where it was hard going in the beginning but once you get past all of that, there is really no point to playing the game anymore other than to have several different hunting rifles in your cabinet you're never going to use. If you like the simulation aspect and you like action/RPGs, then i would still urge you to pick this up (on sale as of Feb.25/2014!) but don't think you're going to play this game forever. If you think you want to play this game forever, grab the DLC to give it that little bit of replayability (DLC, also, huge letdown: let's give you the exact world you were just in only you start one the other side!)."

The controls are clunky, the AI sucks, there's no way to undo a mistake other than starting a brand new game, the cars drive like they're on ice and weigh about ten pounds, entire zombie hordes will randomly spawn ten feet from you on a mission (when they're not supposed to) because your character forgets how turn a car off after the apocolypse.

I really did.First and foremost, the idea that you can't reload a previous save is a dealbreaker for me.  Fortunately, there are mods out there that can get you around this massive defect, but those mods take a bit of work before they will work properly.The play control is really terrible as well.  Most recently, I died because I was pegging on the Z key to finish off a zombie about 20 feet from my home base, but the dang thing wouldn't work.  The zombie kept getting up and kicking my butt.  Full strength to dead in about a minute from a single freaking zombie that I knocked down 8 or 9 times.  Now, becaause the game is broken, I can't revive my character because I forgot to have my mod running in the background while I was playing.The actual game is tedious and repetitive.  Get supplies.  Eliminate a horde.  Travel clear across the map.  It's actually quite boring.I came back to the game a few times to see if I could salvage some kind of value on the money I spent, but overall, the game just plain sucks.

I guess you can give it some leeway since its done by a small company. If your like me and you love rpgs and zombies then this game is a perfect combination of both.  I love how many kinds of melee weapons and guns the game does have but they don't do a good job of figuring out what weapons are the best. The inventory is a good system although I wish there was a way to carry more items. The zombie fighting is very good, the Special Infected are good to. The story is so so, not much to really get you invested into sadly. Your character can die which is a big deal so you play the game more to focus on surviving. There are tons of side quests but they eventually feel mundane to the point you ignore them. Plus the game has plenty of glitches and the AI can go from being extremely stupid to very awesome. Definitely buy the life line DLC as its actually a ton of fun although a bit challenging. So, for six bucks the game was worth it and I do enjoy it, it can just be really aggravating because of the autosave if someone dies, its over. I restarted the game cause I killed my first character early but after awhile I had to just like Marcus die. Still, I'm so glad I played it, and I really did enjoy it and I think you will too!"

Because of this you must play a character until they are tierd, take them home and switch to another one (at this point the one you got tierd should rest but they do not, instead they take on gaurd duty or such) once all of your characters are tierd you must log off for several hours before they will be rested.

Stealth and sound system works well, If you use guns, smash into doors, and hold shift to loot stuff quickly you will find more and more zombies attacking. Small choices in cars and are scattered all over the map. Surveying a city is a great concept in it where you go in a tower and you look for everything below to mark it in the map.

,Recommended,241540,7320581,"Posted: 6 October, 2013",all,Forsakend,"Owned it on Xbox at release and can easily say that it is the best RPG/Sim zombie game I have ever played. Recommend it to any and all zombie lovers.- - - - - - - -Edit: Proper Review : November-29-2013- - - - - - - -TL;DR: Game is awesome. Highly recommend it personally.State of Decay (SoD) by Undead Labs is a 3rd person RPG/Sim where the goal is to scavenge for supplies for yourself and your group of survivors and survive the zombie apocalypse. The gameworld is an open world with a linear storyline.You do not play as a traditional 'Lone Hero' but as a group/community of survivors which you can switch to as long as your relationship is set to 'friend'.There is no character customization as it is not that kind of game, but the characters in the world are randomly generated from appearances to traits/skills/abilities and past lives except for the starting and story driven characters (Marcus, Ed, Maya etc...).The game's focus is survival and scavenging as well as base building, supply and group management. Because your fellow survivors have personalities and in the real world, personalities crash... you may find yourself breaking up arguments or fights if your survivors don't get along.This can be best explained in an example losely based on SoD's human element:Your doctor who patches you up and keeps your group healthy and going is an alcoholic and tends to belittle everyone in your group. This tends to start arguments frequently and your Mechanic (tool expert) finally had enough one day.Your mechanic repairs your weapons and your cars since these are limited in the world and quite valuable. It is what allows you to keep the zombie hordes back. The mechanic and the Doctor get into an argument. Who do you support and back up?While I personally don't know how far the consequences may go if you don't resolve them or talk /calm them down, they may simply leave, leave and take a portion of supplies or maybe even kill each other. All possabilities but I never allowed it to get that bad personally, so may need to ask others for confirmations or possibilites.Back to the game overview!Combat:The zombies have poor eyesight but good ears, so anything loud can have big consequences. You need to decide when to sneak around and go stealthly and when it is appropriate to go guns blazing. Too much noise can attract more zombies or hordes and put you in a tight spot pretty quickly.You can easily take out zombies in melee, especially with a leveled up character, but there is always a risk with larger numbers and especially with rookie characters. There isPERMA-DEATHwith each character... don't go thinking your invincible or you may lose a favorite character.There are a variety of melee weapons with different catagories such as: Blunt, Edged, Heavy/two handers. Each with their own perks or properties such as decapitate/slice limbs, knockback or insta-kill.There are also special Insta-kill moved your character can learn (depending on traits) as he levels up. There is guns, but they have a risk and ammo is very valuable. The latest Loot update/patch improved the randomness and receiving the same items for long periods of time and allows you the ability to collect more guns.Some guns I have managed to acquire are (don't remember specific names): LMG's, assault rifles, various pistols and revolvers, shotguns, submachine guns or 'uzi' type weapons. Considering I am picking up grenade rounds, I am assuming there is some sort of grenade launcher as well.Again, there are weapons, but I refrained from using them due to their risk of noise and making matters worse. I used them more as a last resort.Persistent World:This is a single player game with a continuously existing game world...even when offline. This is a core and big feature to this game that not only adds a new element of gameplay, but simulates the game (this is the Simulation portion).Basically, if you left your group with high morale, no one in danger or felling depressed/suicidal and have sufficient supplies with no immediate danger (infestations close by)... you'll come back to a happy community with little issues and may even find new items that the survivors found while they went out scavenging for supplies while you were offline/gone.I must make sure that it is clear that you are NOT required to play this every day. The simulation will slow down considerably after being offline for 48 Hours and continuously slow down for X amount of days until reaching a complete 'paused' state. It will then resume the simulation once you log back on.Gameplay Hours/Time:Game's story is approximately 15 hours. This is if you simply rush through everything not paying attention to your base, ignoring anything other than basic/needed story missions and not scavenging...may even finish sooner (like 10). The average is about 20-25 hours and those who take their time have about 30-40+ hours in.The DLC released on November 29th 2013 which adds the ability to play as you'd like without the need to worry or focus on story missions. The side missions, base building and everything else still exists, but the mode is like a 'How long can you survive' type of mode.Completing a round by finding the RV and moving to a new location in a refreshed version of the map increases the difficulty. You may find yourself sneaking around and being much more tactiful in this mode than in the base game. There are also new weapons and 'hero' type characters available for use in this mode that will need to be unlocked.I have only played State of Decay: Breakdown for approximately 4.5 hours and cannot judge it fairly at this time (especially since I am still in the first round and haven't moved on yet. But the base game comes highly recommended to any and all zombie lovers."

Being able to establish a community and build it up is awesome and different compared to the others I have played. The gameplay has you with an inventory and makes you choose what to take back home first to supply your base while random missions help keep you occupied. The Breakdown DLC is the ultimate challenge in the game as you loot the valley dry then move on to an even harder valley where you really do fear the zeds.However it does have some flaws such as bugs. Bugs are in the game though I have found no game breaking ones. The ragdoll physics are hilarious. I think there could be some more customization in the base management though and it would have been fun if you could make makeshift weapons like the ones in the Metro games.Yet my biggest groan about the game is that there is no co-op. It would have been perfect for the new DLC and fun to play with friends in the zombie filled world. Ah well maybe in the next game they can put Co-Op in.On a last note the game is made for a controller and you will get your best experience with one though the keyboard controls are good enough for me to adapt.

It's probably the best zombie survival game out there. It has almost everything right, and for a zombie fan, it is definitely 10/10. It is not a game borne of this Golden Age of tutorials and hand-holding. This, rather, is a bleak scramble for survival, and one in which the zombies are all but guaranteed to win. Also,keep in mind, a zombie can never be too dead.State of Decay is an open-world zombie survival game, but what’s not obvious right away – and glorious once you plumb its depths – is that it’s a full-blown role-playing game. A fantastic one at that. Switching back and forth between one of several player characters, you’ll travel across the multi-town desert region recruiting new survivors, searching vacated shops and houses for supplies, and managing relationships with the people you encounter – both those in your party as well as other humans you’re not aligned with.Decay’s only other missteps are minor. The plotline is engaging and sets up a great finale, but it falls a bit short due to a lack of tough choices, such as the ones you had to make in The Walking Dead. And while it may seem unfair to criticize a game for nonexistent features, you can’t help but daydream about the fascinating possibilities and adventures that a cooperative mode could’ve laid bare – especially when State of Decay’s creators have publicly stated that they originally planned to included it and hope (not “plan,” hope) to still add it via a post-release patch.In short: Tense, frightening atmosphere; great settlement gameplay; character system."

Almost every mission is the same, and the non-stop zombie killing with no rewards / drops for kills actually removes any point in killing them - it just uses up time and resources that could be saved by using the very poor sneaking system.But any problems with this game are completely overshadowed by the worst feature - the quality of the port. There is no gameplay change at all from console to PC, the graphics are FAR worse than they could be, and there are even occasions where Xbox controls are shown on screen instead of keyboard (no, I did not have a controller plugged in).I'm not sure if the zombie outbreak was caused by a plague in this game, but you should avoid it like one."

76561198046052145,Recommended,241540,13065260,"Posted: 24 November, 2014",all,SteelDragon45,"State of Decay is a 3rd person post apocalyptic zombie sandbox survival game in which you lead a group of survivors in an end of the world all hell broken loose zombie world. I have not played other ""hardcore"" zombie games like Day Z, but I will say this is a very fun game. It's got an arcady feel to it in the driving around department, but I will say it also has a more hardcore like side to it. You have to balance alot of stuff, between scavenging supplies, doing missions, and other things that roll along those lines. Did I also mention that some of these things are timed and you will barely (or won't at all) have the time to do them all? Don't fret too much, all the ones you don't have time to due because they expire are not part of the main plot and these missions are randomly generated (which also mean replayability). Also you have to get enough materials to keep your base going. I can't say what happens if you run out, probably nothing good. Another thing is perma death, your character dies and you have to use another one. Bringing me to my next point in this game, there are alot of charcters, and you can use (control and be that character) all of your survivors as a fighting/gather mechanism. Another thing, there is a HUGE amount of guns in this game. There is probably a number somewhere but this game has many guns you can use. This doesn't mean that you will find them easily, it just means that your chances of having ALL of the same gun won't happen, although I have found having 2 of the same model of gun has happened a few times. You have many diffrent types of ammo, .22 .40, 5.56, 7.62, .50 just to name a few. Ammo is no easy thing to find, especially when you have alot of people using the same ammo type. This is strictly a single player game, there is not planned (nor do I think there will be) a multiplayer or a co-op. Also the game doesn't stop when you stop playing it, you'll log back on the next day and find out that your survivors have been busy surviving while you have been doing stuff in the real world.A few possible negatives, I suppose the lack of multiplayer may be a bit of turn off to some. Alot of dialog is reused, but isn't noticeable for at least a few hours of gameplay. There are only about 10 or so voice actors so that kind of falls on the last point. If your a perfectionist that has to get everything and do everything right and do it 100%, you may be disapointed. You simply won't get to do every single mission before it expires, sooner or later you will die with a character, you will fail a mission, although I will say that is part of what makes this game unique.All in all that's essentially as much as I can think of at the moment to put into a short(ish?) review of this game. My personal 10 cents is that this is a really fun game that you should pick up, whether you wait for a sale or just buy it and (if you want) all the DLC, that's up to you."

However, after giving into the ever-so-attractive Steam sale, I decided to give it a go. I am impressed. The amount of freedom is great. I can choose where to stay, what supplies to collect, what defenses/assets to build, and who to play. Another great thing is that the freedom isn't too overwhelming either. I never felt lost, or confused as to what to do next. Everything was easily understood.The graphics are decent. It's certainly not Dying Light quality graphics, but the visuals aren't ugly either. They're Xbox 360 quality graphics (since this is of course a PC port). Not saying that's bad, but it's not using the PC hardware's full potential. The combat is intense. You can easily get surrounded by a horde (or three is you're unlucky like me) and find yourself being pulled apart by a unique zed. However, the combat isn't too frustrating either. Sure, I've lost a couple good ""Heroes""... Mainly because I decided to go it alone.Now, one thing I thought was necessary but wasn't included was: Why can't I load supplies into vehicles? I wasted so much time driving back and forth from the home to a supply cache just picking up one bag at a time. If I could load said supplies into the bed/trunk of a truck/car that would be a great addition. Another rather frustrating piece to this game is the mouse sensitivity. One little jerk of the mouse sent the camera spinning at 3,000 miles per hour. The driving camera also, at times, was impossible to control.Overall, I rate this a 7/10. The fun factor, free-style play, freedom of where to live and build, and multiple playable characters are great. The camera controls are very quirky at times, and driving back and forth over and over to clear a supply cache can become time consuming. However, these issues certainly don't hinder the fun-factor in this game. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good zombie survival game."

There's a main story line to follow and also side missions.I wasn't much of a fan of Breakdown DLC since it's basically just a repeat mission of the same town, and it's just purely achievement based.Lifeline DLC is a whole new story in a new town. You get better weapons as you start off as members of the US Army. Protecting your Base from event-triggered waves of zombie hordes is an unavoidable way of wasting ammo and explosives, but it makes you keep on searching the town for more supplies.

However the problem sets in very quickly with this game...repetition.  You will find yourself playing the same side missions over and over and over.  Do you have a choice to not do these?  Absolutely.  Will you suffer because of it?  Absolutely.  Imagine having three missions across the map and each one is a member of your community needing help in some way or another.  If you don't help them they end up upset with you.  If they are upset with you it brings down the morale of the entire community.  This is just one domino after another.  So you may be driving across the map and have a radio call come in to ask you to deal with something and someone.  In order to keep your harmonious community running you feel completely forced to drop everything and deal with it.

There is permadeath and once one of your characters is dead they are dead.The graphics engine is only average to good, but the graphics are somehow rich with a lot of foliage and details, etc. There are also some glitches but somehow they didn't spoil my enjoyment, probably made it a bit more difficult.10/10 Good Game for $5"

Defend and upgrade your camp, Scout for survivors, and keep them happy, full of morale, and disease free though your actions. Save them from danger and scout for supplies. All decisions have weight, Grabbing much needed ammo might mean you are unable to save another in your group. Only zombies respawn, supplies and vehicles do not which means once you have looted an area you need to move your base. Reckless movement, driving, and searching can attract zombies, and it is easy to get overwhelmed and fatigued, with permanent death for your character. Unsuppressed gunshots are a deathwish - especially at night. Progress is saved constantly so no reloads if you screw up. Just continue as another survivor. Deal with limited inventory space, varied encumbrance levels, Damage and fatigue.Highly recommended."

76561197971387955,Recommended,241540,11989999,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,BubbaGurt,"The range of guns and melee weapons is quite a lot.Guns = Pistols, rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers.Melee = Swords, katanas, sledge hammers, crowbars, wrenches, paddles, spiked bats, table legs, etc.Distraction tools = Talking dolls, alarm clocks, fire crackers etc. Those are used to distract zombies, an example, let's say you're being chased by a ton of zombies and you throw a talking doll down. The zombies will run to the talking doll and you can get away. So they come in handy when you just want to run away or make a horde of them move to a different location.Side Missions = Gathering supplies, doing trades with other survivors, helping people to kill feral zombies, help wipe infestations, scouting, escort missions etc. They randomly pop up through out the game and it's up to you to do them, you don't have to do it. If you don't it usually results in something bad as in less influence, less trust, stuff like that.But nothing game breaking that makes you stressed out.The game continues without you, meaning if you log off, the game will still keep running. So when you come on there is always something that has happend or has changed and you can never come back to the same thing, which in some cases is annoying. I logged off and I came back the next day, and all my neighbours were dead, a member from my base shot another member, 4 people got sick, a bunch of people were tired and i'm sitting there saying ""What the ♥♥♥♥ happened?!? I'm gone for 1 day and all this stuff is going to hell and I have to redo all this♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again""The pros and cons of the game.Cons = Not being able to heal your partners at all.Your partners cannot help you carry supplies, they are only useful for killing zombies and that's it.The zombie spawn rate is ridiculous. Even if you have killed all the zombies in the area, they will keep spawning no matter what, making most things difficult to do by yourself.Everything you search through makes noise, it even makes the same noise distance as a gunshot sometimes, so zombies from miles around can hear it and will come over to you.Not being able to hit more than one zombie with one swing of your melee weapon. So fighting a horde by yourself is impossible if you plan on never being bitten.Babysitting all of your survivors. Most of them need a talking to, resulting in you having to take them outside to kill some zombies, telling them that they are being a butt hole, then take them back to base. Rinse and repeat.Not having most things in the game explained to you, and not having a short tutorial for it. So most of the time you'll be online looking for solutions or tips, because the game explains it in very little detail, sometimes not even explaining it.Pros = Tons of different weapons to choose fromBeing able to put an outpost anywhere in any building or home.Choose where you want to settle your new base by exploring and finding potential home sites.Being able to call in military air strikes that bomb the hell out of hordes of zombies.Being able to put loot in the back of your vehicle. Makes loot runs a little more fun.Choosing who can stay and who has to leave your group.No barriers or invisible walls holding you back, you can literally go where ever you want at the start of the game. Except for 1 area that unlocks towards the end.Different zombies, you got normal zombies, zombies that can run faster than you, then special zombies as in Juggernaughts, bloaters, feral zombies, screamers, and swat zombies.Stealing supplies from your neighbours. You'll have different groups settle in random places, you can either give them supplies or take everything they have, which is awesome. They usually have a lot of ammo and food, so steal all that stuff for yourself haha.All in all, i would say this game is a 8/10 in my opinion. It's fun and worth giving it a try."

Seriously though, anecdotes aside, This game is brilliant because it has a really good home system and although there is no multiplayer, recruiting new survivors is a great feeling and the missions are interesting with good voice acting and funny dialogue. Also there is a stealth mode if you are the sneaky type and cars for the loud and proud types. Finally the melee combat system is actually good (which is more than you can say for some zombie games) with gruesome spatterings of gore throughout. Would recommend to anyone.

,Recommended,241540,8038741,"Posted: 14 December, 2013",all,Vanity Dagon,"Probably the better of the zombie apocalypse game out there, that mixes strategy with combat, though it doesn't excel at both, but at a sufficient level where it's fun. The controls will probably♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, since it was a port from the xbox 360. For example, sometimes your movement controls don't register so you can't move. Also this game takes the award for the worst handling of cars. You will crash a lot, and not even on purpose. While driving, you have 3 ways to go; straight, which is holding W, completely right, D, or completely left, A.  Even if you lightly tap D, you will still make a hard right, and probably fly off the road. Going back to movement controls, since sometimes your wasd won't register, you may find your character swinging their weapon away at the air, while zombies approach him from behind, simply because the controls refuse to let you swing in any direction. Maybe there was a fly that really bothered your character, who knows.For a survival game, the difficulty varies a lot. If you ever played S.T.A.L.K.E.R on the hardest difficulty and did well, this game may be a cake walk for you, since you obviously have the patience to take things slow and plan ahead. State of Decay can range from pretty simple, to ridiculously hard. If you go the stealth route, like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R, the game may can play out easier. If you prefer more of a combat arcade style, then prepare for endless amounts of zombies running to your location from the noise, which seems fun, but as in S.T.A.L.K.E.R, dealing with even three enemies at once can be really dangerous. But the main point of using stealth or combat is the same: Find supplies. You'll have to make trips to each building, searching for what it offers: Food, Ammo, Medicine, or Building Materials. Interesting concept, but tedious after a while since you can only carry 1 bag at a time, though I guess it is a ""Survival"" game, so it tries to get close to how life would really be.Graphics, sound, and voice overs are fine. Music is pretty good. Voices are ok, repetitive but ok. Graphics are sufficient, blood and gore, can't mess that up. Though the bugs in the game become obvious pretty early. Sometimes zombies glitch through walls, or glitch through the ground, only there heads sliding around on the floor. Sometimes zombies will grab you in mid air, or out of reach as they glitch over to you. None of them too game breaking, annoying and stupid, but it happens once in a while. Though the worst is sometimes quests don't trigger, rendering them impossible to complete. It's rare, but it can occur since it happened to me once.Despite some mishaps, I still find myself absorbed into the game. The game keeps going on without you, so even when you log off and go to sleep in real life. You can wake up and find out what happened to your group of survivors while you were away. Sometimes they are sick, sometimes they gathered more supplies, sometimes they can even commit suicide while you were away. All of this kind of keeps the game going, the unexpected is always around the corner. Each character has a story to tell. You start to bond with them, and when one of them dies, it's not that simple ""Oh lost a guy"", It's ""Damn, that guy was our expert shooter, how can I defend against the hordes now?"" So you keep gathering supplies, helping out other survivors, clearing the infestations, recruiting people, and before you know it, you've been playing the game for over 5 hours. I have to honestly say, so far this game hits the top survival games I've played (S.T.A.L.K.E.R still remains number one for me).So, to sum up, the game has it's problems, but more than makes up for it. If your a zombie fan, you'll probably like this game as a chance to really see how well you'd do in a real apocalypse. Would you help out fellow survivors, doing errands for them keeping them safe in your base? Or ignore all plees for help, only looking out for you and your small group of friends, staying alive and not taking the risk. For people who like hack and slash fast paced games, this may not hit the spot, but its a fun alternative none the less."

,Recommended,241540,8190978,"Posted: 22 December, 2013",all,FatHobbit,"State of Decay is a zombie survival game a lot like other games available at the moment. There is an underlying story that is neither original or particularly riveting, with the majority of the game spent collecting resources, building and fortifying your home/base, and finding survivors and recruiting new enclave members.For me the thing that sets this game apart from other zombie/thriller games is three things:1. The night is actually dark. You run around with a flashlight which you neither have to hold, nor runs out. It makes scouting pitch black houses for resources all the more terrifying when all you see is a glowing set of eyes running towards you (or ten!), and makes night fights a frightening blend of Blair Witch flashlight waving, heart thumping action, while you flail around with your weapon every which way like a metal music fan in the pit, trying to connect with a zombie head.2. You have to think about the combat and how to engage. Sometimes it is better not engaging and sneaking around. You use a gun and risk bringing the local zombie horde down on your head with the noise, even searching to loudly is likely to bring company. Cars are similar with the noise attracting zombies like flies to a bugzapper. Even 5 zombies can make it difficult for you if you are by yourself, especially if you run low on stamina, as you can't even run away, and some of the zombies are fast.3. Character death is permanent. I found this out the hard way. You can spend hours building up the stats on a character and carelessly lose them. For me it was using a gun that attracted a closeby zombie horde while I was already dealing with a large group. Low on stamina, unable to sprint away I was overwhelmed. While I was horrified at first, I came to realise that it makes you think a lot more about how to approach certain situations, and whether it is worth it at all. You can recruit new people though, and eventually play as them once you build up their trust enough to become friends.Some of the down sides to the game for me include:1. Glitchy graphics. Sometimes stutters and catches with weird things happening with textures. Does not happen very often and only for split seconds and not enough to detract significantly from game play. Happens mostly while driving vehicles. My computer specs are high enough that I can run Borderlands 2 with three screens no problem, Skyrim fully modded etc.2. You will spend the majority of your time saving your enclaves residents from various locations when they get themselves into stupid situations, or helping them kill the bigger zombies as they can't do it themselves. There is only 4 or 5 different variations on these quests, and while occuring in random locations, they get boring quick. They are all the more annoying when you just want to continue the story missions, or search for more resources to build up your home base, as they dissapear after a certain time and you lose moral, and while it never happened to me during my playthoughs, I think it is possible to lose people if you don't save them.3. There is a definite need for a more in depth help system in the game. Some things like the fact you can give each character specialisations, the game doesn't point them out, even when they are unlocked, and doesn't tell you how to unlock them. I ended up using the net to find out how to select them. While most people would tell me to Google it, I can and do, but it is hard when you don't know they are there at all!All in all well worth the money, and the positives far outweight the negatives in my humble opinion, and would definately recommend!"

Perma-death, something that even though its heard everywhere has never truly been experienced before this game; The principle? once someone dies they are dead and that character you spent 2 maybe 20 hours in is now gone and sorry to inform you but you can't just jump back a save to keep your favorites alive.

Nice use of a radio NPC operator to continually send you reports or advice. Tons of mods to adjust some of the balance issues. Not a shooter, if you play it as a shooter you will miss out on the best parts of the game.  Different characters with different abilities to increase, including some traits that have no combat or survival value...just like real folks would have.  Good expansions packs help replay and open up more options.The Meh:Port of a console but graphics were not optimized for PC play. Glitchy gameplay, mobs get stuck in walls.  Hi replay but while individual location loot/mobs may vary, the overall map is identical each playthrough. The radio operator can start to sound a bit naggy after a while.

I played it through again almost instantly (settling in a different base) after completing it first time round. Some of the missions in the base game involve repeatedly crossing a large map which gets a little tedious after a while but that is a very minor gripe. Most of those missions are optional anyway and they are usually fun so you don't mind. The game has a great mix of action and base/supply management. There is a good level of creepiness when exploring abandoned warehouses and other buildings for supplies as the zombies are alerted by noise. Also, you don't want to write off your car in the middle of nowhere as trying to outrun a horde with flagging stamina also gets the adrenaline pumping. You can't help but get a bit attached to certain characters and want to avoid seeing them torn to pieces as a result of a few poor decisions.DLC LIfeline: Excellent too and recommended. Encore! More of this quality DLC please developers. Thouroughly enjoyable 6-8 hours in a different city and surviving waves of zombie sieges.If I could change one thing? It would be the addition of multiplayer - Co-op with friends."

If you are looking for a survival game with zombies, this is probably the best one currently on the market.  Project Zomboid would be the only other one I'd recommend.  This one, you need to focus on finding supplies and managing a group of survivors.  You can upgrade your fort and even move to different locations (Though limited to their choices).  Plus, with the two DLC which are really good, it gives you variety to the game play as opposed to just the main mission.  It's a third person style game and you will eventually run out of supplies.  Only draw back is you only have 1 map in the main game and have only the story mode.  You need the dlc to play survival or get an additional map."

Let me clear that up for others: it's a third person shooter that's got RPG elements, but focuses heavily on random sidequests and events. It otherwise tries to channel GTA in the sense that you drive from point to point in a large map, finding and completing sidequests alongside the main story.Some people complain about the fact that the game ""continues"" while you're away, but I think that's fine. It will never kill off your community, or do more than mildly inconvenience you.Overall it's alright, but I can't help but feel that we've all been here before. Yet another third person shooter with RPG elements, which plays like GTA. I really wanted to see more strategy come out of this game. I'm supposed to be leading these people, why am I not directly managing people's missions? Why are there such hard caps to the amount of land you can control? Why can't I establish multiple bases and assign people to them? Why does it cost so much rep to recruit a follower for a day?Even more depressingly, the zombies never really feel threatening. You can be driving around in a muscle car, shooting shotgun shells at everyone you see, but you never attract more than a couple zombies - you can still see the others meandering around as if you weren't there. I killed an entire ""horde"" with *one* shotgun blast. Even the elite zombies all go down with just one or two mags of any gun - usually less. All the enemies are introduced within the first two hours of the game, and the rest of the game just feels like you're playing a game of whack-a-mole quest turnins.Ultimately, I recommend the game. It's well polished, has good combat, solid mechanics, and a smooth execution. My only real issue with it is that it fell short of all the things it could have been, in favor of being another ""me too"" game that didn't really do anything that hasn't already been done."

This game isn't perfect it has some flaws like bugs in the gameplay and the graphics isn't that great either compared to zombie survival games like dead rising 3 but still has that FUN factor in it. It can be really challenging at times and a but frustrating when you lose a character or want to save someone but just didn't make it in time or have to make a decision on which mission you would like to do first and would it give you enough time to go on to the next mission to save the next person. The resource gathering, zombie bashing, rescue missions along with a great storyline to boot has made me a fan of this game. The bottomline is if you are after some good old action and fun then this is the game for you but if you are looking for something that has flashy graphics and perfect controls and gameplay then I would not recommend this to you.

The actual survival aspect, meaning you need to find food, ammo(for your community,not just yourself), and construction materials. You can suck an area dry of resources if you're not careful and have to find a new home.The gameplay is just fantastic as well. Combat is easy to learn and you should have no issues playing this on a keyboard.The only downsides I can think of are decaying resources and the setting. Your resources decay for a total of one day, even when you don't play. So that means when you log back on, you're missing resources. This was a terrible design for the game. They had mods to remove this feature, but I've been unable to find them. The setting is more of a personal thing, but I don't like the rural setting. I would have much prefered a city. I know Lifeline adds a city, but I've heard nothing but bad things for that DLC.Overall, I would recommend this game, but wait until it goes on sale."

,Recommended,241540,11217714,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,dawookiemonster,"I don't normally write long reviews, but I'm loving this game too much to just give it a snarky or funny comment. This game has turned out to be more fun than I ever anticipated. You play as an ever-growing (or ever-dwindling) group of average people trying to survive a...wait for it...zombie apocalypse. You're probably thinking how you're ready for the zombie craze to end. But it won't. The idea of humanity being forcefully pulled from their lives like a fish fished out of the sea and left on the boat's deck to flop aroung and ungracefully gasp for air as they fight for their lives is all too appealing. And this game seems to deliver the goods for an entertaining and challening zombie survival game.What makes it fun/exciting/worthy of this long review?First of all, it's open world, and you get to ride in cars and run over zombie hordes. Sometimes a zombie will get stuck on the hood of your car. That's always fun. But I digress.You can switch between the available playable characters whenever you want for the most part, but the idea is that as you play with one character for an extended period of time, that character gets tired and weak. A tired character suffers penalties to their stamina, for example, so they aren't the best to use to go scavenging the town. That's when you swap out for a well rested character so the tired or sick characters can regain their strength. Each playable character has to go through their own ""level up"" process, too. And if your character dies, or if one of the playable characters die even when they aren't your active character, they really die. There is no respawn, so the urgency for planning your supply runs and missions definitely exists.Not only are your survivors important, but you also need to build up your defenses for your current home base. This includes scavanging the city for supplies and materials, building new areas within your base, or creating outposts to increase your claim on the land. Once your base is at population capacity or you've depleated all resources for the area in which you are located, it's time to pack up and find a new base.There are also missions for you to complete. This includes helping survivors who may then join your ranks, fighting rival groups, or trading supplies with others. A lot of these missions are time sensitive. So if your fellow survivor is in a jam, you better go save their skin before it's too late...unless, of course, you want them dead. But then your reputation with your group may suffer...which brings me to my last point.You have a reputation with your group, and your group has an overall morale meter. Generally speaking, if your morale is low, your group probably isn't too happy with you. So you need to constantly do things to improve your base, your rep, and your group's morale. The happier your group, the better their performance. And if you steal from your group's general supplies and never replenish it, don't expect them to like you or take you seriously...because they won't.Basically, just play the damn game. It's really fun, and it offers a new take to the gameplay of a ""typical"" zombie game. If you can catch it on sale, it's a must buy. But I honestly think this game is worth it at it's regular price. Now go buy the game already!"

Also the way how you have to prioritise your few resources was really good, so you could carry a realistic amount of items and I found that really good. Finally the weapons are very realistic, they're not invincible so they break after a while which means you have to find another ( I loved this feature of the game ) and also ammunition is hard to come by as well as the guns.

Also features permadeath, if one of your community members is killed, their not coming back with the exception of some characters that are marked essential.

,Recommended,241540,12491379,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,Nerobyrne,"Do you love Zombie survival but hate getting greefed in multiplayer?Then this is the perfect game for you!PRO:1. Freedom:As one would expect from a survival game, the player has to roam an open world in order to gather supplies and weapons. But this game has so much more. Instead of just being by yourself, you have a base with a lot of allies. There are many different resources to collect, and any item you find in in the wild can be used by you or your friends. You can go anywhere on the map, and every area has renewing items and resources that respawn. You can move your base to any suitable place and make outposts where ever you think they best serve the survival of your team. The size of your team is only limited by your ability to support them.2. Building a ""Family"":If you are trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, you are going to need help, and this game's devs know that. Across the map there are many people you can befriend by helping them out, and if you are kind enough to them they will join your team. While you start with a single character, you can freely choose between anyone you have befriended. They all level seperately, can master different skills and combat styles, and each have their own personality. All that makes this the most interesting single-player team game I have ever played. But having a lot of friends also has it's downsides. The bigger the crew, the more problems arise, and you have to help your pals overcome things like fear, anger, and hopelessness.3. The Tools:Crowbars, Katanas, Frying pans, Revolvers, Machine guns, and much much more. All these things can be used to combat the never-ending hordes of the undead. Along side your weapons you can use traps, silencers, egg timers and many other utilities to give yourself an edge in the fight. But it doesn't have to be just you. Once you help out enough in your neighborhood, you can ask for favours in return to help you out of a tight spot.CON:1. Too Easy:Not sure if this is a bad thing, as zombies are after all brain dead, but it's incredibly easy to outsmart the dead. Once you know their responses to certain things, you can easily navigate even big towns without much worry. Since you can see them from a long way away on your mini map, avoiding zombie mobs is a piece of cake. Also, even when 5 zombies are eating you at once, you can get them off you without too much effort.2. CPU Intensive:My CPU is pretty old, and it has a huge problem handling all the different zombies. If I drive around town and load enough undead NPCs into memory, my CPU gives out. This is a big problem since it fulfills the minimum requirements. Basically you will need a decent quad-core in order to really play this game over a prolonged period of time, despite what the sys reqs say.3. Small World:At this point I should mention that I haven't beaten the game, mostly because of point 2. So it's possible that I can unlock more of the world. But at the time it consists of only a small village and a town, as well as a lot of open country. The core game seems to be pretty small so far, but there are 2 DLCs which hopefully will add more to the world.4. No Multiplayer:This is only a single-player game. Doesn't bother me, as I play console or MMOs when I want other players in my games, but it should be mentioned in the review.I would definately recommend this game. Most of the negative points are down to my aging hardware, so if you have a decent gaming PC, you should really pick it up if you love zombie survival!"

Between ensuring the survival of your group and trying to not overtire yourself on supply runs all the while not wanting to die makes this a fun game. You can select many different strongholds to use as you progress in this zombie apocolalypse game all the while deciding if you want to be the hardcore survivalist or just wanting to help everyone.Just a tip: People will die, there will be some you think you can help but will end in tragedy, if you don't lose anyone your either A) really good or B) never take anyone out to watch your back lol."
,Recommended,241540,12382311,"Posted: 5 October, 2014",all,Medic Bag,"So my previous review of this said the game was repetitive and boring. But, I think I might not have been playing the game to it's fullest. I resarted and found out more about the game and different tricks you can do. It's actually pretty fun. It can be really easy at times, but extremely hard at others, you can lose your character at any moment just from ONE mistake. ONE zombie horde. ONE screamer. ONE Juggernaut. Anything. Just play smart, and don't take risks.Now how the infection started isn't exactly stated, but it kind of mentions it...The game is like a single player DayZ mixed with some Left 4 Dead. Which is kind of cool.You can scavenge, free roam, drive, and have multiple weapons to use like molotovs, plenty of melee, and ranged weapons, distractions like fire crackers and flares, and a bit more.Now the things I don't like about the game:It isn't optimized that well, not exactly bad, but I can run Far Cry 3 on high settings at 60 fps but only 40 on this game at medium.The game lies to you about cars, says they're low on gas, and useless, they are the oppisite. They have unlimited gas. And the noise that the cars generate is fine, because they're fast and basically tanks...Anyway, once you're dead. YOU'RE DEAD. This can be a thing good or bad, depending on your personal preference. When one character dies, you play as another till the end of the game or that one dies.And the rest you'll just have to find out for yourself.7/10 Maybe wait for a sale, unless you've got money to burn."

Still, you'll get a kick out of pushing your characters to the max and suffering alongside them as you wage a weary war against the undead and, eventually, your own allies.It's a hoot, so enjoy it while the novelty lasts. Once the main campaign's over, though, brace yourself for a lot of grinding and tedious escort missions. Hopefully the new-ish DLC's help alleviate the boredom.7.5/10"

Can store full rucksacks (supplies needed to survive) in car trunks/truck beds allowing you to do multiple missions before returning to home baseCons:1. Undead Labs intended for this to be Co-Op Sandbox from DAY 1 and it IS NOT CO-OP and WILL NEVER BE CO-OP. (same with the DLC though they say all future games will be co-op multiplayer)2. Perma Death.

Appalled, really. Truly, the zombie genre thrives on forcing 13 year olds to eat rotten fruit. How would I be able to do that if the 13 year olds were simply digital phantasms that existed only on the inside of a computer box?Well, this game failed to dissapoint. It has everything that made Daisie a romp in the park, with the added fun of MMO-Grade Combat. One of the things in Daisie that totally turned me off was a strange glitch that allowed players to harm one another. Thankfully, Bohemia has fixed this for Daisie: States of Decor. You are now completely inable to harm other players, which is great especially considering that the players have been replaced with wise-cracking AI's from all walks of life.Running over zombies with a car is a load of fun, but luckily good old Deaner ""2Rockets"" ""Deadzone"" Hallister realized that the zombie apocolypse is all about pain and suffering, and made the genuis design descision to have your car blow up after you run over like 3 zombies, so that you don't get too much joy in your miserable life.Overal, I spilled Pipsi on my mic.

The story is relatively easy, and personally, I was quite disappointed with the ending, but all in all it's a very good game. Even after the story is completed, you can still go back and play some more, because there is enough places you can move to, supplies to scavange, there's always something new to explore. It doesn't get boring. And if the story line is too boring, Breakdown will never give you a chance to rest!As someone who prefers the survival aspect to the 'shooter' part, and someone who loves horror movies but prides herself on never getting freaked out or jumping, this game switched both for me. It has enough survival to keep me happy, and it's a refreshing new take on the 'shoot and bash them in' aspect. It also has a knack for making you jump and tense up wondering what's around the next corner... You're ruffling through an abandoned backpack in a dark shed, stand up and turn around and there's glowing eyes lunging at you... Or a feral suddenly lands on you out of no-where and you have a split second to react or die...The graphics are awesome. It makes you feel immersed, and it's accurate right down to the blood and guts spraying everywhere... Or when you step in them as you pilfer someone's house and find the remains of the previous occupants still half in their bed... Abushed while they were sleeping. Half the fun is trying to figure out what they were doing when they died... Sleeping, Using the bathroom... Getting a snack before they went down fighting...I wont say it's completely realistic, but it's much closer than most games I've tried so far..."
,Recommended,241540,11044967,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,7even,"I’ve played a lot of zombie games. Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead, Dead Island, Dead Space, the COD: Black Ops zombie mode (just to name a few.) But while playing, I’ve always felt an absence of consequence—how, in the midst of the zombie apocalypse, where the dead have risen and are trying to consume you in varying ways, you can merely ‘restart from a checkpoint’ if everything goes wrong. STATE OF DECAY proves that isn’t the case. With perma-death, long-lasting actions, fort- building mechanics and interpersonal relationships between survivors, you’ll have a lot to contend with, especially if you get stranded in the wilderness severely-injured or without weapons and ammo.PROS:- Perma-death. While this wouldn’t normally be a lucrative option, it adds a sense of realism to the game that makes fighting the undead much more terrifying.- Realism. Everything you do makes noise. Fighting zombies, running past swarms, shooting a gun, starting a car—you get the feeling that you’re actually within the zombie apocalypse and struggling to survive. You run out of ammo and have none at base? You’re screwed. Crash your car while trying to avoid a hoard and break some ribs? You’ll move slower, and probably get eaten. You’re constantly on edge in this game—from rescuing survivors, to gathering supplies, to trying to survive while playing on your own.- Specialists matter. Don’t have a doctor (even if she’s just a dentist?) People are likely to get and stay sick, then probably die. People with weapons experience are better off in your watch tower. And people who have athletic backgrounds? They make better runners, have higher stamina, and are more likely to get themselves out of a jam if something happens.- Weapon variety. You can use axes, shotguns, pistols, shovels. Even frying pans and grenade launchers. Of course, they all have their benefits, and depending on the survivor will be handled accordingly, but STATE OF DECAY lets you utilize everything from 2-by-4s laying around in unfinished construction areas to frying pans if you happen to not have a weapon on hand.- Sandbox. No game is the same.  From finding different survivors, to having survivors die in the field (or in enclaves around you,) to your base getting assaulted at random intervals, you can always expect a fresh gameplay experience each time you start a new game.- The simplicity of the tutorial system. Never do you feel like you’re being ‘talked down to’ or ‘forced’ to go through a tutorial. It explains things as you come across them (and continues to do so throughout the game.) While this may result in acclimating gamers’ deaths, it does keep you from feeling stupid while playing.- OPEN-SOURCE MODDING! I can’t stress how much I love that. It’ll always ensure new things come about even if the developers don’t act.And now, sadly, the CONS:- Survivors don’t use their guns (and other AI issues.) While some missions allow the AI to utilize the use of projectile weaponry, most of them will resort to hand-to-hand or short-ranged weaponry for combat. This can, at times, result in unfortunate deaths while you’re with them or while they’re alone. They also tend to have pathing issues that run them into walls, keep them from following logical routes to pursue you, and sometimes even standing in place. I literally had to PUSH a survivor into camp in order for a mission to complete because they wouldn’t move.- Repetition can become common. Given that ‘missions’ in the base game are divided into ‘story’ and ‘action,’ you are often forced to repeat the same sort of supply runs, survivor rescues or ally searches. While the growing difficulty tends to influence the gameplay, chances are you’ll develop a handful of heroes and cycle them out consistently.- Only one survivor can be with you at a time (except during missions.) While this may seem somewhat of a personal qualm, I would’ve liked to be able to have an extra hand or two with me at times—especially during the beginning, when tensions are high, survivors aren’t practiced, and the green player might not know how to interact with the world.Beyond that, STATE OF DECAY is a truly marvelous game, and promises to improve as development continues. It is, by far, the best zombie game I’ve played."

Making my enjoyment levels hit 0% and making this game completely unplayable.Taking the role from the Soldiers point of view, i thought was a fantastic Idea but in comparisson to Vanilla and Breakdown it seems that the superior human beings that are soldiers seem to be as dim witted, unintelligent and a liabillity to your cause; even more so than what the joe public civillians are. I understand factors that lye within a computer game in making it a challenge while at the same time trying to project enough enjoyment and control to the player itself. But as a player, you do feel that Iniuitive from your fellow AI soldier should become a vital helping hand and a major factor in the game if you're to believe that you are infact playing the role of a well trained elite soldier who can rely on his/her fellow mercenary. With Lifeline, this doesn't at all come across to me in any way.Civillian rescue missions are nothing short of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have rescued my few and some were a breeze but most (80%) of my civillian rescues have ended in me turning up to the scene, unloading shots/melee blows and within seconds said civillian, being torn in two...no chance of saving them what so ever. In Breakdown and Vanillia where you prodominently play as joe public civilians i felt that I was more capable of dealing with hordes of zombies than I feel I am as an elite trained soldier. It just doesn't add up with what the game is trying to portray In my opinion.The game has advanced in the sense of finally adding the ability to load up vehicles with extra supplies but to think your fellow mercenary will help you scavange supplies for a building instead of standing on the spot oblivious to the zombie that is creeping outside and in to the door way of the building you're ""both"" apparently ransacking is just completely bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy.It's little programming flaws like this that If were fixed would do worlds of good to the game, so that you don't feel like your Elite trained soldier companion is standing there picking his♥♥♥♥♥♥oblivious to the fact that the world has turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥and that situations may call for things being done on the hurry up. When rescuing a civilian or turning up at an Infestation it's almost a breath of fresh air to have your partner who is tagging along run straight to the fight...what's not great is they'll usually run straight to the most dangerous enemy a Bigun' or a Feral, instantly hit the deck crying for help to then have them selves torn in two.For what Undead Labs are trying to portray with this title just doesn't work with the mechanics, Intelligence and ethics they currently use. State Of Decay is STILL a fantastic franchise but with Lifeline they've hit the bump in the road.This is one title I will truly leave in in my Steam library to gather dust"

It's effectively Grand Theft Auto in zombie land and it does it really well. What it doesn't do well it explain the levelling up fighting skills, upgrading your base elements. I learned a lot from the first play and really enjoyed the 2nd. In order to survive you are forced to shack up with fellow survivors, raid empty buildings for food, ammo, medicine etc and then as supplies run dry, you have to consider moving base to a new area as those supply runs get longer and more dangerous. The graphics are by no means state of the art, but the depth of the game won through for me. After the first play, I was like yeah, 7 out of 10 but after truly understanding the mechanics, I give it a firm 9."

(Spoilers, Kinda?)Remember how in state of decay you would need to rescue survivors, clear infestations, hunt mutated zombies, and many other things? Lifeline uses those same missions, but with a twist. Instead of saving survivors to stay with you, you're saving doctors and scientists in hopes of researching a cure. Infestations are still existant, and pop up just as frequently, and are dispached the same way as well. Mutated zombies are still existant, and appear to spawn more often, but I'll get to that later.You'll start off with a base, just like state of decay, you can customize and upgrade. However, they added a generator and a latrine option to build. Then, the seiges come. Zombie sieges come every once and awhile, and to me they're the biggest challenge in the DLC. During the siege, zombies will either come east, west, or north to your base. You can set up traps such as fireworks, landmines, or propane tanks to combat the sieges. The more and more sieges you survive, the more and more challenging the sieges are. Mutations will start to appear, and eventually start to appear in groups.Now, I would like to talk about the gameplay.I feel that Lifeline is much more challenging than State of Decay, for many reasons.Survivors are more likely to die, because of sieges, and when they do, they are much more harder to replace than in State of  Decay. The combat is pretty much the same in Lifeline as State of Decay, aside from multiple new military weapons such as a 6 barrel grenade launcher, SAW, Sniper rifle, and a few assault rifles. Executions are the same, except for a few new melee weapons.New options:In your base, like i stated before, there are a few new base ""Sections"" like the Latrine, Spec Ops,, Landing Pad, and Generator. The latrine has one job, to prevent infection and disease. Spec ops is used to give commands to your soldiers that  have no commands, you can give them orders to search the area for supplies, search for surviviors, or hunt down hordes and thin down the zombies. The generator is used to power your base, and is vital to upgrade some other ""Sections"". The Landing pad, in my opinion, is the most useful Section of them all. At the Landing pad, you can call in supplise, like construction materials, ammunition, anibiotics and medicine, food, and weapons, or just a package of a bit of everything.Overall, i feel that Lifeline puts a new twist and options into State of Decay, making it more enjoyable, and making it have great replay value. 9/10"

Its dark and oftentimes the zombie hoards were just hard enough to be a real threat without being frustrating.The only real issue I have with the game is the inability to trade items with your friends. Instead of directly trading you would sell it to the stockpile of weapons, switch characters and buy it from yourself. Wierd, and convuluted, but that was my only real gripe with the game. You could store items in vehicles to, but that had its own issues.Other people in the reviews were talking about how  the game progresses without you actually playing it, and its true. Its actually a good thing though, as you do a lot of time consuming tasks. For example, research and upgrades/repairs can take 3+ hours. In fact I started playing this every other day just to see if it would ever screw me over, and it never did.

Sounds are good as with most games. The Storyline in this game is quite long in my opinion - i'm on 7 hours so far and I've not met as many characters as i thought i would by now. The open world aspect of the game is fantastic and I like it just the way it is.The one bad thing in this game is the options themselves which are fairly weak and don't allow you to customize them aswell as other games.

It took me about 27 hours to complete the main story, for those who are concerned about length.  The game controls similarly to Dead Island, but is more 'survival'-ish... you make a camp of survivors and acquire resources and the like.  The gameplay is entertaining and solid, and I definitely hope the support encourages the developers to expand on this game's concept perhaps with a sequel, because this game with a bit of added depth(there's a decent amount as is) and a multiplayer mode would be an instant buy for me assuming funds were available, and I'd buy like a 6 pack of the game for myself and most of my friends I game with so we could all play.  The game isn't excessively 'difficult', but it is relatively unforgiving if you make a mistake, as it only auto-saves and has one save file... so if you screw up, chances are you're stuck with it... but that adds to the challenge and atmosphere as you're trying to survive, and♥♥♥♥♥♥happens sometimes during the apocalypse."

I love the fact of how you can build barricades on every window, Gather survivors to help around your community, Build your own potential home bases, and scavenge from the local buildings for resources and supplies. However, it is a extremely hard game when it comes to nearby zombie hordes, Damaged/Broken Weapons, or at least one juggernaut zombie while you have so many jobs to assist with like taking down ferals. You can prevent these from happening if you have a friend with you to assist your side jobs or you have as much supplies your community needs. Also, keep in mind to make all of your survivors happy and safe, Your goal is not to progress far in the game, It's managing your community. And when eventually your community won't bother you for help anymore, you may progress without interruption. Furthermore, you must let your survivor rest and heal after working. If you continue to do missions with a tired survivor, you will have less stamina until you rest. Therefore, it is important to switch from time to time. Keep in mind that you must at least carry firearms with a good supply of ammo for those risks of dangers."

State of Decay is a text-book example of a well-designed and executed game.

This is one of those games that grabs you and does not let go (and tries to sink its undead teeth in your neck). It explains very little, gives almost nothing for free and holds no punches. There is no sanctuary of the almighty save function - what mercy you are given by the autosave is all you have. There is basically no tutorial - once you press play, you'd better start figuring things out on your own, and fast. There is no option of powerhousing through the game with a single maxed out character - once you get too tired, the undead will get you. And I love every single bit of it.

I had fun.Cons:- Only a few combat skills can be upgraded on a character, everything else is at the mercy of RNG.- Babysitting people who have temper tantrums constantly- The story primarily gets told in random scraps if you happen to be lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.- As a result, the storyline army captain in particular seems almost bi-polar about ""Today I neither like nor trust you"" ""Today I'm happy to be working with you and you're such a nice guy for saving those people"" ""Today I'm going to shoot at civilians for the crime of being in the area"" ""Today I'm willing to sacrifice my safety and my men to help people""  What... dafuq?- Mission NPCs are virtually unkillable, but allies will perma-die depressingly easily- Weapons degrade and cannot be repaired.  Don't get attached to anything (or anyone)- Cars are the best weapon available, there's really little reason to use anything else if you can get a car.- You can't always play your main character, sometimes you have to switch to a #2 or #3 to give the main time to rest and recoverI found myself trying to build a base that could sustain itself indefinitely, and not long after I felt like I had done that the game was abruptly finished.  Now that it's on sale again I may pick up a copy of Breakdown to play an endless campaign which is  what I had been gearing up for.I will never forget having built up a suitable #2 to have great combat skills to play during main character's downtime.  I brought main character back to base because #2 was having an argument with some other lame-o there, so to cool things down and let her blow off steam I took her out on a zombie hunt.  Standard mission stuff.  So I go out thinking I have an A-team duo of warrior-badasses when on the way there I meet a new and big zombie... who charges me, smacks me to the ground, runs to her, lifts her up over his head and simply tears her in 2 like a phone book.

State Of Decay adds some never before done aspects to this game type. Within the first 30 minutes or so I saw some interesting little features added to this game, for example when you drive a car, Zombies will latch onto to different parts of it. you can either drive them off, or slam the doors on the car open and shut while driving! The charecters you play as talk and have conversations  but not in a choice based system. The strangest feature, although rather unique is the death system, when you die, that charecter is dead, your then given a new one with a differentt voice actor and dialogue, I only died once so i do not know how many times this can happen. In addition to this challenge of trying not to lose cool people, thereis no save system and no save slots, you have one save slot,that runs on autosaves , it seems to autosave apon completeing a quest. This is single player only and the story line is only about 6-10 hours if you rush. The save system bothers me because of the no continue death system, I bought the game on a steam sale for 10 but it runs for 20. the World map is large and the game is sandbox freeroam style. for 20 bucks its a good deal for any who enjoy a good hack and slash zombie game of decent difficulty."

However, if you are that much of a zombie survival fan to stick it through it, like myself, then i highly recommend this game. Once you get the ball rolling for you and your fellow survivors this game becomes highly addicting! Going out for supplies just to simply roll back to your base, hear that your buddies are happy with there lives, then roll back out to get more is incredibly satisfying. The best parts of the game come from working with fellow NPC's within your home: when moving to a larger home, utilizing your friends to help you go out and scavenge in the neighbouring buildings to upgrade your defenses and improve your life becomes an action you will want to repeat over and over. Although, every game comes with its bad habits! State of Decay bombards you with problems; whether it be 4 zombie hordes nearing your base, or one of your buddies is out getting mauled by 10 undead because they were not smart enough to pack a weapon! These issues lead you as the player to constantly be interrupted from more important [and exetremly fun] work, and in some cases require you to cross the damn map [which is quite a size]. Nevertheless, State of Decay is a game any mild zombie fan will love and to put it short - This is a true zombie surivival game...kind of like The Walking Dead comic/tv series"

Though the developers promised a smooth-operating co-op/multiplayer system in the next game state of decays. Geeze I can't even wait to see what kinds of things they add in those.This game is 5/5 amazing. There is always something to do. ALWAYS. You can't keep your base and fellow survivors up to par by dilly-dallying. But you can't keep them safe by being wreckless, either. this game has so much to do and with such great features to keep it interesting for ridiculously long periods of time before you have to say ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i been sitting on my♥♥♥♥♥for 6 hours. maybe.. maybe just a few more scavenging runs""Anyone who likes to survive zombie apocolypses, this game be foh you."

IMHO,pros:  Fairly open ended,  till the last few main missionsYour character dies,  you assume control of the next in line,  as well as being able to switch off.Realistic,  you'll never become Dirty Harry or Conan the Barbarian,  any more than 3-4 zombies at once,you'll probably end up dead or badly injured.  Expect to do a lot of scavenging to keep your group going.cons:  camera control can suck,  especially entering buildings.Vehicles handle poorly.Game time runs even after you exit,  don't play for a few days?,  don't expect all the missions to be there.  It can suck to get your group running smoothly,  only to find everything gone south when youfire it up again.In short,  if you like the zombie genre,  and you want more than just a FPS,  this is worth a look.( I have NOT gotten the addon pack yet,  so I can't speak for that."

,Recommended,241540,8904870,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,GoblinKing,"Top game. Probably the best zombie game I've played since L4D. It's much more than 'GTA-Zombie' as you scavenge for food, ammo and shelter all the while constantly looking over your shoulder. The undead are perfectly pitched - easy to best when there's only one or two, but get to three, eight or two dozen and it's time to run like Jesse Owens!If I had to nit-pick, I'd grumble about bug issues such as un-completable missions, characters falling through the scenery and some rather extreme car physics, but these are minor compared to the horrific loveliness that is SoD (that's an unfortunate acronym)."

It is not a perfect game, but its well built and delivers lots of fun and tension.The ""no progression"" bug that was plaguing the game has finally been fixed, so if your looking for long hours of ""wlaking dead"" experience, just get this game."

76561198072655150,Recommended,241540,9025219,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,LIBIDIB,"This is quite possibly the greatest zombie game I've ever played. It pretty much took everything I loved about 'Red Dead Redemtion: Undead Nightmare' and made it a lot better.The game is completely open world, and you spend most of your time scavenging for supplies to strengthen your home base. Venturing out into the zombie infested world can be very dangerous, but luckily you can bring friends along to help to survive the masses of undead. There is a wide variety of weapons to choose from as well, so killing zombies rarely gets old. There are also story-driven missions to play as well that push the game forward, but you could spend hours just rummaging through houses for supplies and killing the walking dead.For the price, you can't get any better than this. I've only played this game for about six hours at the time of me writing this review, but I'm sure that I will get plenty more out of it. Highly recommended for sure."

Otherwise when your character, that you've spent hours building up dies, it wil be permanent. I lost a few to autosave. There are a lot of cool weapons to kill zombies with. Lots of activities to keep you busy. Decent size map. You can easily be overwhelmed when traveling alone. Try to have someone with you especially when traveling into dense populations of zombies. Should be more variety of Freak type zombies. I Love being able to take zeds out with a car door. Overall a good game in my opinion. Also, stand back if you shoot a propane tank."

It blends just the right amount of difficulty and fun! It has a real feel to it.On the bright side, It has a very large open world. It is so much fun to jack the nearest car, and mow down hordes of zombies! I had alot of fun exploring the environment.On the other hand, It does still have its share of problems. The zombies still do clip through the floors  at times. The constant barrage of side missions, is overwhelming at times, not allowing you to fully explore the environment the devs put so much work into. Lastly, the car is the most OP weapon in the game. I found myself sitting outside infestations, instead of using melee, my gun, or stealth, honking my horn and running them over one by one.Overall, despite its fualts, and sometimes because of its fualts, State of Decay is a fun game.I'd say it's well worth the money."
