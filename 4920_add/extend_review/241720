Concept is cool, Make a gun or a map, use your creativity, and then use them to play the game.2. Workshop is full of awesome weapons and maps, and every(yes, every single one) gun is compatible with every map.3. It has some cool gamemodes.4. You have awesome vehicles, and you can build or destroy parts of the map, even add a giant building to it.5. Read the other reviews for some more pros.Cons1. Game is pretty much dead, There's barely any players playing the game and that's really where the game balances on. So it's best to just start a lan party if you'd want to play this game.2. It gets a bit boring after a while of playing, so it's hard to really play for a long amount of time.3. It's hard to understand the game when first playing, and really isn't a game for people that just started with the fps genre.If there were more people to play the game, i'd rate it a 8.3/10.So i recommend to play the game only if you have a lot of friends nearby, or when people actually start playing the game."

Here's why I can't recommend it right nowNo players, you don't get a chance to play many of the different play styles becuase you can only usually find 1 mostly full Team Deathmatch server and a few other servers sprinkled with 2-3 players.The game could also use a few min building stage when each map starts.. This would diferentiate it between Ace of Spaces, Build n Shoot, and whatever other Blocky shooting games there are out there.What I liked:Varied game styles (see above)Ability to customize content (Althoguh the approval method seems random)Building mechanic: You can set up prefab bunkers or bridges pretty easily.Fun vehicles.. A bit more warning on being shot would be nice but still fun to blow thorugh blocks with tank or chopperVaried guns. Want to blow up blocks then snipe thorugh the hole.. sure.. want to carry an assualt rifle grenades and a hacksaw sure.Edit: After the fall sale this game is still pretty much a wasteland.  If you like Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch then you may find this game pretty fun.  I picked it up for the other game modes and am unfulfilled. I log in every once in awhile see that no one's playing the alternate modes and log off.. Maybe I'm part of the problem, but I don't feel like sitting on an empty server waiting for someone to join up."

,Recommended,241720,8277359,"Posted: 25 December, 2013",all,自殺　Ｆａｌｌｉｎｇ,"This game is incredibly fun, and is really (I think) the best shooter/minecraft hybrid out there. It has auto-build features in-game for what are called prefabs, this way you can be building, and defending at the same time which is very useful. The maps vary in sizes from small arenas too very large castle ridden hills with tunnels all over the place. Every map plays very differently from the last.It is true, the game has a small (really small) player base, sometimes to the point where 4 people are playing in visible servers and that's it. However, this is why you should buy this game and spread the word about it. It has everything to be a very well populated game, it just doesn't have the advertising strength.Some people may argue the game isn't balanced because Sniper Rifles are OP, however, they only kill in one shot with a head shot (if the rifle is max power which results in one shot per clip) and characters move at about 1% of their normal speed when reloading a sniper rifle balancing out the power well, because they become a sitting duck when reloading. Each weapon type has a certain level of skill needed to be used effectively, and each gun certainly does work differently from the next, so everyone will have a gun they can excel with.Vehicle play in this game makes it very unique when compared to games such as Ace of Spades, I mean, who wouldn't want to fly a helicopter over a football stadium and blow a hole through a wall for your team mates to rush the enemy flag through?Pros:- Unique Maps and reflect varying Gameplay- Vehicles- custom guns you can make or download- Good Balance, even with custom guns- Kill Streak Perks- Construction block by block, or automated pre-fabsCons:- Small player base- Poor advertisement resulting in a very very slowly growing player base- Some maps can be too large for idealistic game play- The active servers often have a high ping (90-130), but they are still playable."

,Recommended,241720,9310052,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Jack_Spade,"Guncraft is a voxel-based shooter, but it's not just Minecraft with guns.The standard FPS Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch is reminiscent of the Call of Duty franchise, albeit with a much more light-hearted and playful vibe. Combat is fast-paced and unpredictable, as players are free to destroy and rebuild the environment on the fly. The mining mechanic has been simplified from Minecraft because it's no longer the focus of the game. Mined blocks are traded for Resources, which are measured in dollars and correlate with the mined block's durability; resources can also be earned by scoring kills or achieving objectives. Resources can then be traded for new blocks, Killstreaks (a la COD), or prefabricated structures, which cost as much as their constituent blocks but spawn much more quickly.In addition to maps and prefabs, players can also craft their own weapons. Players build their weapons using the same controls as in map and prefab editing, then select an archetype (assault rifle, shotgun, etc.) and assign points to different categories (hipfire accuracy, shoulder accuracy, damage, etc.). Players can make anything they want as long as it's not obscene or trademarked, and share it with the community on Steam Workshop.Guncraft gives players plenty of opportunity to enjoy their new maps, prefabs and weapons. In addition to the stadard DM/TDM, Guncraft also offers plenty of unique game modes:-In Spleef, players have only a drill and are trying to dig the floor out from under other players so they fall into the lava.-In Paranoia, one or two players are randomly selected as zombie queens, who try to infect normal players and turn them into zombies. Normal players can't chat and don't know who's a queen, ratcheting up the tension.-In Lava survival, players try to push each other into rising lava. The similar Meteor survival mode has them trying to survive a meteor barrage. In both modes, players only die from contact with the environmental hazard; weapons only freeze the target for 12 seconds.-Race is just what it sounds like.-Onslaught pits a team of up to four players against ever-increasing hordes of enemy bots. Very difficult, and very exciting.Overall, the game balance is surprisingly good. It definitely feels like an Indie game, but not in a bad way. The developers are very responsive to community feedback and concerns, and the game is always improving. The community is small at the moment, but loyal. We could always use you if you want to join."

The community is small but friendly and helpful and the staff tends to listen to their clients (Us!). Weapons aren't so much 'Overpowered' as it is a case of there being a plethroa of playstyles/weapon loudouts and classes which offer an all but endless mix of play options and it can take people awhile to find a set of each that works for them. The editors take a bit of learning to use but are extremely quick and easy to use once you get used to the options and shortcuts and one can often find themselves wasting countless hours in the map editor or gun smithery getting their tools of destruction jusst right. Overall I'd give this a 7/10, Like I said it has some growing to do but the company's learning as they go and I for one support them. :D"

I can't.It's got varied and unique game types. This game has not only the standard CTF and Team Deathmatch modes, it also offers a Horde mode, a RACING mode, and a ""Lava Survival"" mode where you scurry and climb to the very top of a map while keeping your opponents from doing the same, whether that is by shooting the ground out from under them, or shooting them and temporarily turning them into snowmen.You can create your own maps, weapons, or skins with the built in editor. You can make maps in Minecraft and import them! You can do literally anything with this game. You can even place helicopters in random parts of your map!However... you won't WANT to do anything with this game. The shooting is very clunky, it's serviceable but not something you'll crave and want to come back to. When you die, you get shuffled to a killscreen with no notification. You are often killed instantly with ZERO feedback on what or who killed you 99% of the time. You hear no gunshot or explosion and just instantly get kicked to the kill cam to watch your opponent and see where he was for two seconds. Then you spawn and hope that doesn't happen again.The driving mechanics are also very poorly done, and take quite some time to get the hang of- and even then, they're not something you want to use often.For all the hate Ace of Spades gets, at least it makes shooting fun. This game falls flat on the very basics and doesn't do anything very well, outside of letting you make some great maps. Then again, Minecraft serves that purpose much better.I'm not going to recommend anyone buy this. Watch some gameplay on YouTube, get a feel for how bad the game was crafted [lol.] At the same time, I'm always going to come back and try to give it another chance. I love the idea and even though I know it's not going to improve, I still have some dumb blind hope that I'll actually have fun with this someday."

Yes, it's called Guncraft, which emphasizes the guns and shooting part, but this game was promoted as being open to building things as well and the choices are not that much. In build mode you get a simple list of blocks you are able to insert into the map, and if you are crafty enough you can build your own structures with the blocks. But for all the promoting and advertising done on this game it's obvious playing it long enough that it is mainly an fps shooter game and secondarily a block building game.The multiplayer aspect though can be fun, with a wide range of weapons classes to use, as well as the option for anybody to build a custom gun and submit it for later use. Killstreaks add benefits to the game if you do well enough in a match to get them. The default map list is large, with various types of maps to choose from that are quite creative. Overall, this game is a fine fps multiplayer game but it does not do so well on the building part. If you can deal with building blocky plain structures, and blowing people's square heads off, this game is for you."

,Not Recommended,241720,10338457,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,FantasyRow,"Do I really need to explain this?Ok, so when I saw the trailer, and the IGN review, I was like ""Oh my gosh, this looks fun!"" When I got it, my first day playing it went well suprisingly, and I looked forward to playing the next day. Then I looked at the servers, and they were unpopulated. So I played some AOS, my only other game. For the next few day the servers were still unpopulated. This went on for several months, so I bascically stopped playing. When you actually start playing, it's a whole other story.The graphics SUCK and that is an understatement. You cant even tell what the heck what's going on half the time, but that isn't usually a bad thing, since there is no playablility.If you're going to ignore the graphics and the many bugs, then this game still sucks. That whole ""approval"" trash that guncraft does to approve something is rubbish. I've seen and felt first hand the power and the over-poweredness (is that a word?) of the fact that a one hit kill minigun with 100 rounds with 10 bullets per second is approved? What the heck?!Speaking of making guns, that system is the only decent theing in the game. However, that still kinda sucks, because in the trailer it never says that you have to make an ironsight. This is what commonly happens; you make an awesome and detailed gun, only to realize you know nothing about computers, and you have to make an upload an iron sight, with some unknown program. That right there is the definition of a rage.Ok, now to the killstreaks. they're kinda cool, but not really. the best in my opinion is the hover bike, which is the only thing people will ever use. How the heck would you even get the kills for the big things like the mega suit. It is so laggy you might commit suicide and not even know it!The equipment. By that I mean, the grenades. They SUCK, and that is being kind and considerate. They do NO damage at all! Gunk grenade is like the blooper from mario kart but much less annoying. The regular grenade I threw the last century and still won't explode. The others, I'm not even going to talk about, they make want to puke.One last thing. Isn't there a law in the constitution or something, that you can't advertise that another game sucks? The first guncraft trailers were just that, back stabbing AOS (which is VERY fun by the way) saying how it is better. But really, it is just the opposite. Sure there are helis, tanks, grapples, and parashutes (correct my spelling is i'm wrong) but those suck. Even the helicopter, which I was excited for, you can't even fly correctly. It doesn't give you a turtorial, ao you end up going staight up until you explode for some reason.Verdict;DONT get this game for your life, you're mom's life, or even your girlfriend's and/or boyfriend's, because it'll just make it worse. If you're going to buy a game that includes building and placing, get AOS. That is fun, and isn't buggy, runs smooth, and the graphics are exceptional. This thing is a discrase to the gaming world, and shouldn't be on steam. Dont get this, please, it will make you're hard earned 13 bucks go to some lazy developer that couldn't make a game correctly.Disclaimer;My graphics card isn't the best, but is I can play AOS smoothly, then there is no reason for this game to lag so freaking hard.To the Devs;Honestly, your game sucks, there is no other way to put it. Pro tip, adding texture packs won't change the game, it make you look lazy. I mean seriously, a game with this bad graphics can't take so long to update with a benificial update. If you update this, i may have a different opinion, but as it is, that wont happen in the next millenia"
76561198038149962,Recommended,241720,9110760,"Posted: 14 February, 2014",all,Аxleaye,"This game can hardly be described in one word, but the word that resonates through my mind is ""unique."" That statement may have you confused because of the game's obvious similarities to Minecraft. Some people may not be able to turn from that mindset, but I will tell you that this is not a Minecraft clone with some first-person shooter sprinkled on top; it's a unique first-person shooter with Minecraft-like elements embedded into it. The game certainly has its flaws, but these are mostly outweighed by the unparalleled involvement in the community and readiness to improve the game displayed by the developers.Guncraft does not simply encourage creativity. It provides the best possible tools and environment for endless customization, and that doesn't apply only to aesthetics. Everything about the game—weapon appearance, weapon performance, maps, player appearance, playstyle—is extremely customizable. For example, if you're about to play on a large map full of vehicles, you could choose your class with a sniper rifle and anti-vehicle gun. Since this class wouldn't enable you to be very mobile (you wouldn't have a space left for a hookshot, which allows you to quickly travel places), you would have a jetpack as one of your multi-kill rewards in order to traverse vertical obstacles quickly.If you don't feel like making something of your own—which I highly recommend—you can always go pick up some amazing stuff off the workshop. If you do want to create something yourself, you will find that it's quite easy. If you want to dual-wield a gold-plated chainsaw with a grenade launcher attachment, go for it. When you're building, instead of having a 1x1x1 area that you can place a block in for days until you finish your project, you can adjust your brush size on every axis by pressing keys; you can even use offset, which will move the brush along any axis away from the block your reticle has selected. Any color on the RGB scale can be used in gunsmithing. Shading really improves the quality of a weapon, even if it isn't very detailed.I highly recommend this game. The things that I assume turn people away are the name, the similarities to Minecraft, the fact that it's Greenlit, and other smaller things such as the terrible ""block and load"" pun and its childish appearance. At least give this game a try if you have an extra fifteen dollars or want to experience something new. I've made use of every cent, and gotten much more than I paid for."

Let's get the less convincing things out of the way first and spare you the loss of build up:- The movement is a little floaty and not like any other FPS I've played. When you slide off a surface, you act like Bubsy the Bobcat and just continue to glide and slip all over the place when you just want to land. Be careful with themz ledges and edges.- Also there is no stairblocks added so far but you can sprint up the blocks, although that gets tedious really fast. Jumping across them is no faster.- The concept of throwing out Bouncing Betties are a good feature from more popular FPS series that they tried in this game. But the reason why it worked in those games and not this one is that there was a limit to one per person. Now, what happens when Guncraft allows players to throw out five Bouncies', die, respawn and repeat?You get a mine field. And that's NOT fun nor strategic.With the bad side aside, let's move to what Guncraft did right:+ If you like those FPSs that I just mentioned then you are in for a treat because Guncraft uses some of those better elements in its own favor such as Perks, Killstreaks and Vehicles.+ While you are equiped with Guncrafts Hookshot, you can fly and parachute all over the map if you have a tall building to cling on to. It's really satisfying!+ An obstacle in your way? Pull out your Sword/Hammer/Pickaxe/Drill and get to work and show that hinder whos the baws! That's right, you can dig and place blocks in battle using build mode to get through a wall or build a barricade to gain that tactical advantage.+ Now to the big one: The idea that the game depends at like 70 percent of your creativity! That's right, you can craft anything like, your own guns, skins, prebuilts that you can just plop in in the midst of battle and to build your own maps and levels and use help from the built in filters and generators incase you want the right terrain like mountain, field, taiga, etc. When you're finished you can also add your new made work to your Workshop Page and let your friends have a look even though they don't own the game.In conclusion, the game does have bad stuff but it quickly makes up for it with its gameplay that's dependant on the player and his commitment.I give the game an 8 out of 10.

You can instantly create an in-game server and play with your friends (by using a password), or make it public and you can test your skills against other players. I also love how you have the ability to create your own weapons/maps/skins/etc. Not only that but the game also allows you to play a variety of gamemodes such as freebuild where you can create your maps, TDM/DM which are my favorites :), onslaught where you fight hoards of robots that will try to kill you (sorta like L4D but replace the zombies with robots), and many more! The only major downside to the game is that there usually isn't many people playing the game. At times I will get on multiplayer and find that no one is in a lobby. It's saddening to see such a great game that has definitely exceeded my expectations not have the attention it deserves.

,Recommended,241720,10773967,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,FadedPirate,"Your going to like this game if you like minecraft and any other shooting game. It combines many features from minecraft like the building. It also has a wide variety of gametypes to play. Onslaught is an amazing gameype you can play with up to four players like call of duty zombies. Its just the zombies are robots and some have guns and some explode like creepers. They also have all the normal gametypes like capture the flag and deathmatch. But my personal favorite is paranoid. Paranoid is like infection from Call of Duty or Halo. It starts out with two zombies and they have to try to infect all the other humans.Guncraft also has a wide variety of customization options. You can build your maps, guns, and even make your own skin like in minecraft but with a lot more pixels. It also has Steam Workshop support so right of the bat you can start some awesome guns, skins, and maps made by the community. There are a few problems though. The helicopter controlls are a bit confusing and the graphics are lacking some detail. Some of the physics just dont seem right. The hookshot is way too overpowerd. You can almost get from one end to another end of a map. But overall I would give this game a 9.5/10. Its a great game. It just wouldnt be the same without the Workshop. Even though there are some minor issues the game is pretty dang good. So I reccommend you get this game."

Honestly, this has been one of the most creative games I have ever played, and probably will stay that way for a long time. It is very exciting when you finish your guns, and most the work will pay off in the end. If you get guns approved, you can use them in game. Not only that, but it allows other users to use your creations, if its a skin, gun, melee weapon, or vehicle and gets approved, anyone can use it. This game deserves a 10/10 in my opinion."

Gun Craft includes numerouse modes like lava survival, Meteorite survival, TDM. FFA etc. Also come with its own customisation tool which is probably the highlight of this game.Otherwise this game lacks in fun.TDM: Its lame! Probably doesnt help when there are no one on servers any more :p, you just run around shoot be shot and then killed feels like COD, but strangely less fun than COD. O-O.Meteorite survival: I acctually liked this one, allthough yet again all servers are dead and the most amount of people I played with was two, the other guy and I.Lava survival: The lava takes a full Ten Minutes to rise to the top, and with all the helicopters and some hover bikes offered right away in lava survival it isnt that hard to get access to high places. When everyone is at a high place you can shoot them but not kill them, they only turn into snow men, once a snowman you shall not move for seven seconds and immediately after yur turn from being a snowman back into a human you're apponent is allowed to shoot and kill you again 2 seconds afterwards, then you are a snow man again for another seven seconds! And yes they can continue to do this >:(. So that sums lava survival up for you, get to a high place turn each other into snowmen for ten minutes, once lava rises close build two blocks higher to survive like what the other person did aswell lava rises to the max. Boom! Both of you have had a Draw YAY!What else do I need to talk about?!?! Oh yes the build tool!The build tool consist of you running away from enemy urgently wanting to get out of fire, you must press B then you are given blocks and you can build you're escape, but wait you want to do some moe damage to the opponent so you have to switch from build mode back to attack mode. Then you;re health is low so you want to escape again so you continue a exceedingly slow build! After you place one block you must wait a unecessary 3 seconds ?! By now you have allready been killed, if only the building was faster and you didnt have to switch from build mode to kill mode in the middle of a shoot out, as this is very frustrating.Dont even get me started on the grapple which gets you Fing nowhere!Overall I have had two fun games, a sequall would be cool, if they improved the features.I rate this game a 4/10, it was worth the summer sale price :D"

Being able to dig trenches, a small wall, or even a fancy bunker made for an interesting game where the key to winning isn't just shooting people, but being able to build things to keep people from killing you as easily, be it as simple or complex as you desire.This is not the case here.... All this game turned out to be is a simple run and gun game that provides silly killstreaks ala CoD.. Hell, it is nothing more than Blocks of Duty if anything.. The whole building aspect is utterly pointless in game, because there is no way to shoot over anything two blocks tall, meaning you can't use cover to protect yourself while you reload and fire from it. Heck,  the mere act of building takes ages, and it is much easier to just ignore building all together and just shoot at each other. Even breaking the map isn't fun, let alone the fact that it can sometimes be very easy to fall off said map without warning in some places.Seems the only building element in the game is for the guns, which of course is easier said than done, since it requires third-party programs in order to fully complete your gun, and even then it could still get denied if it doesn't meet certain requirements.. The guns that do pass, however, are frustrating beasts to deal with.So, you can't build (let alone even use) cover in a game where you die really easily, the combat is pretty much CoD in block form, and oh yeah, some of the maps suck pretty bad too.. Can it get worse? How about the fact that the community is so small that it is depressing to just think about it?Really, if you want a fun block builder/shooter game, stick with Build and Shoot, it is free and much funner than this, let alone it probably has more players than this game ever will.. And BaS doesn't even have a large community either, so that is saying a lot."

From what I've played the only things that actually stood out for me was that you could create guns then submit it to the public and do something like minecraft where you can destroy blocks and place them. However, I wouldn't call this a Minecraft spin-off at all because Minecraft is much more fun. Even the attributes has major problems, such as finding any good weapons that are fun to use is rare, and placing blocks down costs currency rather than gathering blocks, still with the currency there's no purpose to place or destroy the blocks in the first place. Building a base is pointless because the map designs have been made so that there are nearly no cases whatsoever where this block system would be useful, and destroying blocks most of the time take so long that it'd be shorter to walk around the obstacle rather than tunnelling through. Thus, the final nail that's driven into this game's coffin for me is that besides both the poorly made attributes above it's nothing more than the mindless ""press the button to kill whatever's on your screen"" strategy which a lot more games do, and a better job of doing it as well. So if you're into mindless shooting at pixels on your screen with a minute amount of varity in it than buy it, other wise can't recommend."

I got it during the the Steam Sale when it was 4 dollars. The thing that makes this game most unique is the gun crafting portion of it, presumably its namesake. However, I've had trouble with this feature multiple times. At many points I'll create a gun thinking it is good and have it actually suck horribly against the default guns. Naturally, one would tweak it to accomodate for its errors, but every gun has to get approved, and this process could take hours.So, due to its mediocre gunsmithing feature and its mediocre gameplay, I'm going to tell you to NOT get this game at full price. However, if you are reading this during a sale and it is 75 percent off or so, I won't lie and say you won't enjoy it. It is certainly worth a couple bucks, just not 15."

You can create the standard assault rifles, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., but you can also create something fun like a machine gun with explosive rounds. Once your weapon is looked over and accepted by the community (which can take from a day to whenever, depending on the whim of the community), you can join one of the servers and blow someone to blocky hell with it. Sounds fun, right?Trust me, it's not as fun as you think it is.While modifying and tweaking with weapons parameters can be intriguing for an hour or two, it just doesn't go much deeper than that. You can't change projectiles or projectile colors, projectile behavior, weapon sounds, or anything else to give your weapon its own personality. Thankfully, the game does balance the weapons attributes so you can't create a fully automatic sniper rifle with zero recoil and earth-shattering rounds.While you can create your own arenas for you and your friends to play in, as of right now, no one is playing this game. You might find a few diehards in game, but rarely will you be able to bring the mayhem online.So should you get it? If a sale ever brings the price down to around $2.00 I'd say go for it.

You can use perks and create your own class but the rest of the game is so bad that it won't stand the distance (even vehicles are boring, you can't recruit gunners).Like the ""Predator vision"" that surround players by a red square... very good when you're a sniper ! (add to that ridiculous heads to land hit everytimes). The basic rifle is also a big joke, deadly at any range with a big rate of fire and clip size...Blockstorm is much better on the fps aspect and balance.

It does not have very meny people playing at one time so you can't play that often. some of the workshop items can be over powered (they did try to prevent that) so you need to use workshop items because they are better than the default stuff but that means an infinite amount of weapon and skin possibilities.

This game has so much wrong with it I found it difficult not to give this game a straight 0. I will share my exact experience with you all, and hopefully deter you from buying this flaming pile of crap disguised as a game.From the second you start the game you well be met with some nauseating menu system.Shortly after you are bound to attempt to navigate the terrible menus towards the video setting.Finally, you made it to the video settings…..I think? There are NO video settings, no resolution, no vsync, no quality settings, NOTHING.You were just let down by the video settings but you have high hopes for the game after looking at all the touched up screenshots that you will soon find out are all lies.You connect to your first game, you will notice almost immediately that you have no idea what anything does for any of the prebuilt “classes” as there is no description for any of their perks and bonuses. You would have to mess around in the character builder for 10 minutes to find out just what their prebuilt classes do.Ok you don’t care exactly what everything does, you just want to play! You hop in your first game and immediately notice that the graphics are NO WHERE near what was shown in the screenshots, but you don’t care much about graphics so its all ok.You see your first enemy run….I mean LAG by. That’s right, as if all this was not enough they have lag issues, trust me it’s not your computer, it’s not your internet…Its their poorly built game. I will spare you my entire pc specs and just tell you I have an i7 and 2 GTX 680’s…this game SHOULD NOT have frame issues.You have been playing for about 10 minutes now, you undoubtedly noticed that this game has SEVERE balance issues. Not only are the guns unbalanced but the killstreaks are as well. Ohh wait, did I forget to mention the game has killstreaks? Ya…it does.So you are sick to your stomach now, realizing you wasted $15 on the game, you are just about to quit out when the game crashes on you. YUP CRASHES! This game has that problem too!(5 out of 6 of my friends crashed in the first 15 minutes)Well you had a bad experience with the game, so you go to the forums to discuss you issues with it. 30 minutes later your thread is locked/deleted and you have been banned from their forum. YUP! The devs are censoring any negative comments about their game….can you guess why? Because most people are going to say this game SUCKS.Ohh and to top it all off….this game has been created before. Ever hear of Ace of Spades? Go look it up..are you still in the mood for a cube style shooter? Well Ace of Spades does it quite literally a HUNDRED TIMES BETTER than this piece of crap.Recap!THE BAD-Nauseating Menus-No Graphic Settings-No Resolution Settings(stuck with black bars on top and bottom of screen)-Crashes-INSANE BALANCE ISSUES-Graphics SUCK and still manage to produce fps lag-Network Lag-Devs censor all bad reviews-Complete and utter KNOCK OFF of games that do this betterTHE GOOD-The build mode is…cool…until a structure that took you 10 mins to build is destroyed in 10 seconds by an explosion.DO.

The problem lies in the fact that hardly anyone plays it anymore, but that's not the fault of the game itself (which I and everyone else is supposed to be reviewing), but rather the fault of the game's marketting. Most negative reviews complain that there aren't many players playing the game, but their point can't be valid because they aren't judging the game itself. I think that the main reason this game fell was because of the stampede of horrible call of duty/minecraft knock-offs that made it onto the store. This game happened to fall under this category, but was the only game to do this type of game correctly. However, not many people bought it during this time due to it seeming similar to the other, horrible call of duty/mine craft knock-off games.In conclusion, Guncraft is a great game with fun and addicting gameplay, aswell as a good bunch of games that vary all around and feel complete. The problem with this game is simply its community, or the lack thereof, but this shouldn't be judged and put against the way the game functions itself. No negative review should include this flaw as their main point as it is far too invalid. If you get the chance to play this game, please do. It is well worth everyone's time and money."

But this game dont.Second thing is ; customization. You can customize almost everyting. And its free ! Skins, Guns.Third : İt is not a hard game. So you can kill anyone, it makes fun. So you'll have fun with this game.And a lot of vehicles, Coppers, Tanks.... Everything is breakable, its kind of minecraft.But there is a sad things about this game.First is : Less player, i dont know maybe problem is me, but when i try to play this game, i see maximumu 30-40 player.Second is : (I really hate this thing) Menu Theme.

Servers are laggy, people treat it like COD and over-all really isnt worth the money. $15 for something that ive only played for some legit time at most is 20 minutes, which is how long the matches tend to last through teams camping one hallway to a full on siege mode map.The building is highly unpolished and tends to feel a bit cheatsy since the other team doesnt know that you are mining underneath them and the maps are hella tiny so not having a weapon out is allmost certain death and the guns people make are at times really OP and jst overall look bad in its pixely form.in a nutshell: wait for it to be on sale, dont buy it full price like i did"

To those of you who thought this, , congratulations  you are now psychic. This game is everything wrong with modern shooters with none of the redeeming features added in. The weapons do not feel or act like real guns aside from killing things and going bang, but even that is underwhelming. I was able to be 4th on the server by throwing caution to the wind and sprinting around with a shotgun, killing people who were at the edge of my firing arc. The levels may be well built, but with so many objects able to blow them to pieces you are soon spending more time climbing out of holes and craters that appear when someone shoots a block with a free block killing weapon or their standard gun.Aside from these issues, where are some others to keep this from becoming any longer than it is.- Uninteresting game modes- Boring weapons, leaving balance and innovation to the community- Missing the point of adding vehicles to a modern shooter- Overall feel of cashing in on the modern shooter franchise.Probably shouldn't do this, but if I had to score it, here it is.4/10Don't buy it unless you want a cheap Call of Duty experience at an indie price"

The group of friends I played with at the time loved it, we would play a small game with just the four of us and other players would quickly join. However, we eventually stopped and began playing a similar game: Murder Miners. While Guncraft was more of a minecraft meets Call of Duty scenario, Murder Miners does the same approach but with Halo. Overall, Murder Miners is superior in gameplay. There is also the unfortunate truth that is Murder Miners is a lot cheaper. Comparing the two, Guncraft died long before Murder Miners did. Now they're both dead. So, if you have a group of friends and want one of these games, consider Murder Miners for the price tag. If it's strictly about the games and not the price tag, they're both equally good in their own ways. Visually and gameplay, I think Guncraft loses to Murder Miners. I am going to thumbs this down, the price tag is just really bad for such a dead game."

I think that lowering the price (maybe 8 euros instead of 15) and maybe adding bots to fill the servers could help bringing Guncraft back to life, at least a bit. I wish the devs would at least add the possibility to play against bots, because it's a shame that an actually good game had to die like this (also because many of us payed for a project that is pretty much abandoned by its devs now)."
