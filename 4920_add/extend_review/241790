I first used a version a million years ago and while it was very powerful, the ui was terrible. Now, the UI is gorgeous and so easy to use. The fx sounds amazing and are incredibly easy to use as well. If you need any kind of synth or sound design or electronic music instruments this is a great choice. It's easy to use and learn and there's so much depth to it. It's the best synth in my collection."

Lots of options and a really kick♥♥♥♥♥randomization feature that will 9 timees out of 10 produce something really cool.  This is the type of program you can get lost in for hours due to the depth of the options and feature set.

I have song ideas in my head but find myself still messing with the sounds hours later.There are tons of preset sounds and even a free pack of 8 bit game sounds as well that can be added. Prepare to lose your self in that alone checking out all the sounds.The interface with Music Creator works great but I just recently upgraded that to Sonar and have yet to test this with that but will update when I do.I highly recommend this.
,Recommended,241790,9934726,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,wxyzzyrd,"I will start off by saying that Z3TA+2 is incredible, and it seems quite underrated.This program has so much versatility to it that enables you to make so many awesome sounds. The waveshaping function is simply incredible. There are up to 6 oscillators, each with different modes such as sync, normal, inverted, and multi. You can't go wrong with 6 envelopes, 6 LFOs, and 2 filters. The envelopes and LFOs can be mapped to whatever you want. The filters have many different types that are not always on other VSTs, including comb, formant, and reso. There is a cool sounding resonance seperation slider, reso boost, and limiter. There is so many different shapes for sounds by default (however if you want a pure wave you'll likely need to import it yourself). There are many effects built into the synth, however they can be quite basic. You can choose if you want to map the distortion to a filter. I won't go too in-depth about the rest, as there are quite a few effects, however it will probably be a good idea to supply your own VST effects.Z3TA is an additive synthesizer. Now, because it's additive, it can be confusing at first. When I first loaded this up, I felt like I was looking at the controls of an alien spaceship. The matrix at the bottom can be slightly difficult to figure out at first, especially to one new at making electronic music, but once you get used to it, it is very powerful. You can use it to control knobs within Z3TA+2 with LFOs, envelopes, and other things. You can also use this to keytrack different values and map things to note velocityamong other things. It also supplies you with a curve option, which will exponentially or linearly increase the knob value depending on what you choose. The one thing that I do not like about it is that you cannot modulate specific options in the Envelope (such as attack, amount, decay, etc). You can still automate the knobs in your favorite DAW, so it's not the biggest deal.All in all, this is some great software. I will certainly use it in many of my songs. I highly recommend this to any seasoned electronic music creater.Disclaimer(sort of): I am not the greatest music producer, however my abilities are always growing. I learn something nearly every time i start FL. Also, Steam says I have only used this program for 5 minutes, and I will tell you that this is not true. I use Z3TA in FL Studio (as stated before), and to do that it cannot be ran from steam. I have used this program in at least 50 hours of making music from the point of writing this review, with many more spent simply experimenting."

The sounds you can craft on it are amazing, grinding leads, heavy fat basslines, atmospheric pads. The presets included are perfect to get ideas, you can totally get immersed in the tweaking. This VST is pretty much my go to synth these days.I had previously used the first version of Z3TA until it was wiped off my hard drive, i decided to invest in this version. I was happy to see that all the patches from the first Z3TA are included in Z3TA 2, so any synth presets i had used in tracks could easily be replaced by Z3TA 2.Currently running smoothly on PC as a VST plug in with Renoise DAW. Really hope Steam does more VST's in the future."

Great for EDM and just about any synth use.  It isn't as advanced as the high software synth like Massive or Absynth or Reacktor from Native Instruments or as powerful as Zebra.  But it is much better than most ofp the sub £100 software synths.My only real moan is there are not many presets with the base package but enough to show you how to make certain sounds so you can then go mad and make your own.A great deal when on offer.8/10"

,Recommended,241790,21676149,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,Finngor,"This a real professional synth, sometimes at an insanely low price on Steam.It is very powerful but relatively easy to use. There are videos on Utube that can help you.It is suitable for virtually any kind of music but is well known for bass and use in eletronic music.There is a large and good collection of arpeggio patterns, but they are not directly editable, but you can make your own in midi.The presets are varied but many of them, especially the basses are more of a showcases (that are good to study)  than bread and butter. Thankfully it is easy to roll your own bass sound."

Capable of producing a wide spectrum of rich sounds. High degree of articulation with modulations and waveshaping. Huge library of arp sequences. Effects include many advanced options. UI keeps me coming back. Get the preset packages to fully appreciate its capability.

I've used this instrument for 100+ hours.

,Recommended,241790,32723366,Posted: 24 June,all,kouby,"Amazing value if you get on a sale, decent value otherwise.There's a fair amount of presets in the basic package and even though it doesn't have the modulation capacities of a Serum or a Massive, this is still a very decent synth with basic presets ranging from acceptable to quite good imo.I would say Zeta+ excels at synthetic sounds and soundscapes. It often reminds me of massive's sounds in that you can easily get a synthetic growl out of a bass, but at the same time it might be a bit harder to come out with ""softer"" sounds (not that it can't do it, simply I wouldn't say it is this synth strongest point).Been using this for years now in ableton and along with massive it still remains a staple synth in my setup.ps: seriously if this is under 50€ jsut get it, I'd rate it practically on par with Native Instrument's Massive VST which costs 150€. this is so worth it."
,Recommended,241790,14847553,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,jsdratm,I'm a noob so it took me a while to figure out how to get this thing to work!  At first I started it on its own and couldn't figure out how to hear the sounds and spent about 30 minutes troubleshooting.  Then I learned how to launch it from Music Creator and then finally heard the sounds!  It really is a powerful synthesizer and I'm looking forward to all of the funky sounds I can create with it.
,Recommended,241790,16067353,"Posted: 29 May, 2015",all,pango,"This is the best plugin synth that I own. It's not a toy or a cut down version for casual people who want to ""make a cool track"". This is a hardcore, complex, fantastic-sounding synth with 6 oscillators and fantastic waveshaping capabilities. You can modulate 16 different waveshaping features in addition to pulse width modulation and other things and there is Frequency and Phase Modulation.It's not perfect though. I would have liked a way to edit the arpeggios inside the plugin rather than by loading midi files, but it is overall the best synth I own. Add to that the fact that it is 75% off in Steam sales a couple of times a year and you have something which represents stunning value."

I cannot even register it.  it keeps popping up a window that say 'IDS_BITMAP_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE'... am I doing someting wrong?  if this is not a standalone they should say it clearly.  I cannot recommend it for now.  I guess you need Sonic or another studio program first to use this.
