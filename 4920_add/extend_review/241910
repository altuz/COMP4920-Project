Except it's even better this time: three times the Rufuses, three times the chaos. Do yourself a favour and get this game if you've played the first two, because it's not only the grand finale, it's probably also the best game in the series. If you HAVEN'T played the first two... Well, go read my recommendations for Deponia and Chaos on Deponia instead then!EDIT: After some consideration, I think I should make special mention of that one specific part of the game. If you've played it you know the one. It's the one joke that is just absolutely not funny, and where I think the devs definitely stepped over the line of what is okay and what is not. It left a sour taste on what is otherwise a funny series. However, I still recommend it for all those other moments."

It was a fantastic title and a fitting piece of media for those that played the other two titles. I'm giving it a no in recommendation because of the ending.This is similar to Mass Effect 3. The creators' desire to have this out-of-the-box ending ended up ruining my love for the whole franchise. Instead of giving us the tv tropes ending we were hoping for, they decided it'd be better to have this open-ended depressing conclusion that makes you want to eat fecal matter to wash out the taste.Should you play it as a fan of Deponia? It depends. Are you playing it for the humor and the puzzles and don't really care for an ultimate happy conclusion? If so go for it. If you're like me and got invested in Rufus' and Goal's story, then do yourself a favor and ignore this."

,Recommended,241910,14081991,"Posted: 20 January, 2015",all,MakoSipper,"HUZZAH, GOOD THINGS COME IN THREES!Short Verdict: Slightly better than the previous games. Must-have for point-and-click fans. Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!Overview: Goodbye Deponia is the third and last game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium. Well, if you played the previous game, you know nowhe wants to save Deponia, too.The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even romance.Pros:The interface is really great and easy to navigate, including the new feature of being able to control 3 characters during a fairly long part of the game, switching between them and exchanging itemsThe story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the wayGood length for an adventure game, probably the longest in the seriesThe puzzles are really nice in general--the game provides you a few not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. I think you can do it without a guide, if you can deal with some frustration that helps you forward.Characters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some ""role play"", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles.Great voice actingThe 2D graphics are really amazingThe BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songsCons:Definitely the least playtested/polished of the three games. There are a few minor mistakes in the speech, subtitles, translation, and even some small not-game-breaking bugs, like when I manage to make Rufus remain small when moving closer to the cameraThe puzzle scenes close to the ending dragged, and they kinda lose the hand on controlling the climax, and, ultimately, the ending was not much satisfyingThere were some parts of the game that didn't seem well thoght-out. For instance, you can go through a long quest in which you have to use something like 6 or 7 items in order to obtain another item, which you still don't know the use for. Others were sheer trial and error that didn't make much sense to me, even in hindsight (but the overall balance is still positive)Bought on: Steam Store for R$ 6,24 (US$ 4.99 on the US store at the same time). If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buyThe Complete Journey(the full trilogy) instead.Verdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check the Deponia series! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it! But make sure you start with Deponia, then go through Chaos on Deponia before playing Goodbye Deponia, or else it won't make much sense."

,Recommended,241910,30974573,Posted: 6 April,all,Informal Informant,"NOTE: This is the same review for the other two games in the original Deponia trillogy aswell. I thought that as they are a continuation of the same story that they should stay together.What the game isTheDepnoniatrillogy is a classic point and click game on a wold filled with garbage. In the trillogy, you assist the, at first forgettable/dislikeable, protagonist Rufus try to reach the floating paradise of Elysium. Over time, the originally forgettable Rufus uses his witty dialog to slowly get you on his side rooting for him on his quest.Pros+Amazing storyThe story, although only really played out during cut scenes to new areas, is deep in detail. It pulls you in, really pulling you into the world.+FunnyNot many games have blaitently funny dialog, but these games definatly do. Rufus has funny responses to other characters, his own acvtions, and stuff you try to have him do.+CharactersAll the characters seem fleshed out quite well. Each has a uniques personallity, displayes different emotions, and just act different. The variety is also pretty good.+EnviromentsMost enviroments are well detailed with other people and objects to bring the scene alive. In some cases, youll get people who are from other games showing up in the envirments aswell.+MusicThe music worked well with each area you would be exploring. Although mostly being simmilar themed, it all was different and interesting.Cons-Animations/MovementThe walking animation on Rufus, for me was a bit weird. He didnt really face where he was going and took odd paths to where he needed to go.-DurationSome areas seemed too short, while others were too long. It was an odd thing and may have just been the way I solved the puzzles in each area, but it struck me as odd how I could clear one area in ~30 min and another in 2+ hours.Final OpinionTheDeponiatrillogy is an amazing set of games that brought back tthe nastolga of point and the point and click style. The quirky dialog was fun to hear and laugh at resonces. The story makes the narcissistic Rufus someone whos actions have you rootingor cyingfor the duration of his adventure. If you have some time free I can highly reccomend all the games in theDeponiatrillogy andDeponia Doomsday."

I was very disappointed when I saw the ending. More like a confusing open-ending like the first Deponia game. It just doesn't make any sense. Now what I really hope is a Deponia 3.5 (or Goodbye Deponia.5) with a epilogue that shows us a true and not-so-confusing happier ending.Sorry Daedalic team.

It's lengthier than the previous offerings so there is a great deal more to do, some locations from the previous games are revisited albeit in the form of different areas of those places. and most importantly Rufus, is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is not nearly so callous as in the previous games, a final recognition of his  character development. HOwever As for Argus and Cletus, well once again Daedalic fail somewhat there, in fact the largest rub I've had with the Deponia games is the lack of true understanding of their characters psychology. Daedalic tend to go for gags and tropes with the characters there to fill in the holes. This is unfortunately very apparent. It's a pity the writers have focused on the humour more than on their character motivations, it does seem to be improving however as they have gained in experience through the series.The bizarre Piers Anthony humour still abounds, and the game has a plethora of pop culture references to find and discover.The quirky art style is still just as appropriate to the underlying themes, and the vibrant, mechanisticly lush environments are as wonderful as ever. The music (much of it rehashed from previous games) is enjoyable without becoming overwhelming. As for the Chorus Guys... well their lyrics are still just as awkward to try and ""sing""...Overall I will recommennd the game, however it needs to be played with Deponia and Chaos on Deponia as well, so if possible try buy it as a part of a package deal, and not standalone."
,Recommended,241910,9966477,"Posted: 28 April, 2014",all,Noto,"In many ways, I am extremely disappointed that this series had not reached what I felt was a higher potential, but it also delivers a frantically great experience that will have you entirely immersed in the fascinating world it presents.Throughout much of the game, the humor that was once so charming crosses partly over to being crude as well as insensitive. And, the opportunities they had to develop these characters more, for us to see them thrive and gain more through their experiences, to grasp the reality of their situation, then to grow wiser as a result, was all missed. At its core, all the characters are static. Rather than growing and being the preferable dynamic characters they should have been, they learn nothing and remain the same. It really is a shame, because all these characters are so likable and interesting. Instead of development, we had been given an abrupt ending that very poorly tried to end the series with an open note, but absolutely failed to do so.The gameplay is improved, however. The first section is very well-done, and I found myself enjoying it far more than any other part of the series thus far. As the game went on, it became progressively more cryptic and difficult, but still managed to maintain a somewhat fresh twist on the point-and-click formula. The settings and environments remain beautiful, and the animation never failed to impress.The Deponia series, despite its shortcomings, proved to be a very memorable trilogy of games filled to the brim with a sense of wild imagination that spurred my mind alive. It possessed additional potential that could have propelled it to become a true classic, but as it stands, I feel it is still well-worth your time if you're even remotely interested in this type of genre.Edit done due to a minor grammatical error in the review."

The first game in the series was pretty enjoyable, if a little short, and the art style and setting were unique enough to allow me to get past the loathsome main character.  The second game was maybe a little better, with better puzzles at least, and I really looked forward to the final game in the series.But it was terrible.  Start to finish, this game was terrible.  The puzzles were contrived, overly complicated, and all but required a walkthrough to complete.  A good adventure game has some logical connection between different puzzles, with items that conceivably could be combined or used together to move the character further along the story.  If that's what you're looking for, look someplace else.Well if the puzzles were bad, maybe the story was good?  Nope.  I won't spoil anything, but an interesting twist revealed about halfway through has no real implication on the ending - despite the world-changing ramifications of it, all it amounts to is an excuse to make puzzles more convoluted.  The main character, Rufus, only becomes more obnoxious and disgusting as the game goes on until you're just left feeling filthy for having helped it all happen.And the ending.  Don't listen to the people who talk about redemption, about ""people only wanting a happy ending"", or any of the other long-winded explanations for why this is a good ending.  It isn't.

To be honest, when I finished Chaos on Deponia I simply didn't want to believe I was about to finish a so far amazing trilogy. I had a lot of fun with Goodbye Deponia, and it's probably my favorite in the trilogy. There is just one thing about the game that I cannot stand but I am sure that everybody has previously mentioned. The ending. I just finished the game about 10 minutes ago and I really don't know what to say about the ending. I'll summarize the ending with 2 words; BULL.♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really dislike the ending of this game, I was really starting to enjoy it. Especially after the speech and the Organon hymne, but nonetheless the ending is complete and utter crap for a game this good.*SPOILERS*So basically, after Argus, Cletus, and Rufus are all stuck in the Rotor, Goal comes and is confused (of course) of which one she should save cause the 3 all look alikeFirst of all I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tWhile Cletus and Argus may look very similarRufus is more tan, doesn't have a goatee like Cletus and Argus but I digress.Goal ends up saving Cletus letting the real Rufus fall.Like ♥♥♥♥ are you kidding me?But anyway for an ending of a single game I might accept this, but for an ending to a TRILOGY? Where you're definitely not going to make another game in the series? No. Absolutely not.Despite this ending I am really sad to see this series go. It was a fun ride throughout it.I recommend Goodbye Deponia, BUT only after playing the first 2 games because you'll have absolutely no idea what is going on.To summarize:Pros: Pretty much everything, the graphics, the soundtrack, the humor, the colorful cast of characters, the locations, the unique puzzles, the drama.Cons: The ending.

If anything, the ending just gets me choked up because of the music at the end reminding me how much fun I had with the trilogy. Overall, I still recommend the game, but don't expect a happy ending because the whole trilogy had sad endings, this one being the saddest hitting you like a truck when you actually realize that Rufus did and DIDN'T deserve to be on Elysium because frankly, he was an♥♥♥♥♥ but throughout the games, he did all that he could but people still doubted him and trash talked him, and when he was just a jump from Elysium he sacrificed himself, just so he could give his ""friends"" a better life, just so he could prove them wrong, like Goal said, there were so many opportunities where he could've gone to Elysium with her but he didn't. Just because he cared too much about his fellow Deponians, so in the end he sacrificed it all, so he didn't get to Elysium after all, so what? I mean we were all hoping it but as I've heard from other fans of the games they have said that Daedelic games always have unhappy endings, but hey that's just what I've heard, if you want to find out for yourself, buy the first game and try it out, as for me, I still whole heartedly recommend the trilogy and it is a fantastic series that I will always hold close to my heart.I just hope Daedelic gives some closure on wheter Rufus survives or not, granted he did fall from a huge distance into a pile of needles and survived but I digress.

Not just because of the lacklustre ending to the plot, but also because of the ugly nature of many of the acts of Rufus. In previous games he was a crazy but lovable hero, whereas in Goodbye Deponia, he is responsible for selling a black woman into slavery to a monkey who forces her to dance in a skimpy outfit, whilst you feed her boyfriend to some sort of mutant parasitic monster burrito vendor. He also is responsible for the deaths of a group of orphan children that he comes across, and feeding a baby an entire bottle of anti-depressant drugs. At the end he is also finally responsible for the death of his biggest fan, who jumps off the Highboat when Rufus falls.Overall, this game was a massive let down, and the ending to the plot made it even more of a waste of time, as the eventual result could have been achieved by just letting Cletus and Goal return to Elysium in the very first game, but many more lives would have been saved in the process.If you love the Deponia series - Do.

When you think Rufus can't get crazier or more offensive, he walks the extra mile; in this one, among other things, he shows an indifference tochildren (well, that Rusty was a little annoying indeed)that must be shocking to most people. The way he gets to other people's nerves (specially Toni and Bozo _ I missedWenzel) is hilarious. And what about what he does to poorGoon and June? And the hommage toDonkey Kong?I also love the ragged bard's appearances, introducing the chapters with well written lyrics (with very irregular metric _ reminded me of some songwriters from my country, like Jorge Ben and Edgard Scandurra). The games are really funny and the voice actors are great. The puzzles and minigames... some of them are so out there that you'll probably will have to resort to a walkthrough once in a while.

And forgive me my poor English.Simply put: if I knew beforehand that the ending of this series was this lousy I would've never bought even a single part of it. I wouldn't recommend to buy this series of games for those, who would like to play for an interesing story with pleasant ending, though despite the ending all three games are interesing indeed. I can even tolerate the fact, that you have no other choice, but to act as a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing some evil deeds around you not only unintentionally, but also deliberately. I could event tolerate all bugs and crashes of this series. But the ending is terrible. (Here comes the spoilers): Basicaly, the protagonist dies(presumably) and the antagonist gets the girl. Who the hell would think that this is a great idea to end a three-parted series of adventure games? I love the psychological and philosophical challenges of all Daedalic game plots I've seen so far (which also includes Memoria aside from Deponia trilogy), I like how in the end you always face some unpleasant decision, like (here's the spoiler for Memoria) to make your loved one stay with you without her being happy or to lost her, leaving her happy, considering that she completely forgot you and doesn't love you anymore, but why the hell am I supposed to enjoy the ending that kills off main character, who was desperately trying to make his life better and was constantly struggling against all the problems that came in his way? He certainly didn't get what he wanted. He was stuck with not a choice, but yet another problem, and the only solution was to literaly ""let go"" separating him from his love, killing him and making his loved one to go with not the one she loved. Total crap! I know that life is cruel, but why the hell am I supposed to be reminded of this fact in an entertaining game?"

As I've mentioned in my review of Chaos on Deponia, these additions (chapters?) should have just been a massive expansion as very little of the gameplay was changed as far as I can tell. Not a bad thing, just an observation since the story does continue directly where it left off.I enjoyed this one quite a bit, from the improved character development to the voice acting. Add in a little more of a solid storyline in this one, and the soundtrack was considerably better in my opinion. A new mechanic where you were allowed to control multiple characters at once was a neat touch. The puzzles seemed to make a little less sense in this game for some reason, I found myself saying more often, ""How do you even guess that..."".I sort of agree with some of the other reviews that the ending was ""meh"" and really sort of left you wanting something different or worthwhile."

But it’s worth it for the ending alone.Long version:Goodbye Deponia is somewhat of a rehash of the previous episode, Chaos on Deponia, in terms of story structure: yet again one of the main heroes (this time Rufus) is split into three, and you have to complete separate episodes for all of them to eventually progress in the main storyline.The problem is that these sub-stories feel like reused, underdeveloped ideas from cancelled titles– for example the starting sequence in the hotel feels like if it is set in an entirely different universe. There is little connection between them, they are full of plot holes, and one of them is rendered pointless a minute after it is concluded. Not to mention that Rufus gets an origin story that is questionable at best, midichlorian level unnecessary at worst.This stands in stark contrast with the last act, where the arcing plot reaches a surprising, clever, and fitting end. This takes up only a fraction of the story, but it is written so well the game is worth for this alone.The puzzles are closer to the difficulty level of the first game; there is a new element in the form of item swapping between Rufuses (similar to Day of the Tentacle), but it is rarely used. The minigames offer more challenge, but they can be skipped here as well.In conclusion, Goodbye Deponia cannot live up to the rest of the series, but strangely it provides an adequate conclusion that makes it recommended for anyone who went along for the ride this far."

It is withought a doubt, the highlight of this installment along with the accompanying music, which is also likely the best soundtrack of the three in my opinion as well.Eitehrway, if you really liked the previous ones, you should defintly get this one.

Somebody decided to opt for a more uncommon or ""what if?"" and slightly tragic ending, than what we were all looking forward to. Oh well...that being said, I did have some great humorous experiences from the three games, just don't get attached to any of the characters and expect something like you would see in the end of a interesing/humorous Japanese anime love story, that just never ends up right and most always ends up leaving the audience confused or wanting for a happier conclusion or a conclusion at all. Eye of Satinav series at least takes that aspect (and frankly values its audiences time more) into consideration for its players, and in the end they are more satified for it. Enjoy!

If you too played some of that last generation of 90s point-and-click games (Curse of Monkey Island, Toonstruck, Discworld) and want something that matches up to that greatness, then this game is it!Sure, it has a few tiny issues (mostly translation issues from German to English), but these can be very easily forgiven since Daedalic got the mix of funny cynical charaters, story, puzzles, dialogue and story just right, picking up where these great games left off and drawing on everything that there is to be learned from them. If you like classic point-and-click game you WILL NOT be disappointed. They haven't fiddled with the genre or tried to bring it to thr touch screen like certain other devs have - they left perfection as it was, focussing instead on what matters in these kinds of games instead of trying to re-invent a genre which doesn't need to be re-invented.Perhaps the only thing I am annoyed with is no native Linux support and wished the devs would port this like they have with some of their other games.

This one was probably the best GAME for me - the puzzles were good, not too easy, but not so hard that the only way forward was to cheat (I only had to ask my friend Google forhints, not just the answer like in some places in the other games where the puzzles were just too obscure) . The gameplay is also clever - minor spoiler here -the way that you have to work through three Rufus' stories simultaneously is very fun indeed- and the humour is up to scratch (mostly).But, alas, like seemingly all of my favourite games, this one has its flaws. For most of the game, it was bugs for me. From the start it was a bit buggy - quite unlike the other two games, which were fine - problems with the drop down menu, visual glitches, audio glitches when people were talking. All of these things were rare and minor - but occasionally it would completely screw up, and Rufus would start walking through things, and that meant I had to go back to my last save. That, on top of the minor bugs, was very annoying. Luckily, I save often enough that it wasn't a huge problem.The other problem was - you guessed it - the end (no spoilers, I promise). Now, I don't have a problem with itper say. On reflection, the actual way thestoryended was fine, if not exactly happy. It was the execution that bothered me. It was over too quickly, I didn't expect it to be over and I was, at first, disappointed. The clips didn't seem dramatic or clear enough as to what was happening (It did NOT help that they were slightly buggy, and cut together awkwardly, in my case). When it was over, it took me a few minutes to work out what had actually just happened. It was a good ending - sort of - but it felt badly done, and rushed. I also wish that they'd tied up a few more loose ends, if only to give me a little more time in Deponia before it was over, to see where the characters ended up, after three whole games had made me care about them. As it was, I felt like I'd been kicked out prematurely.As a trilogy, this wasn't always perfect - but I do love it. I like the world, the humour, the characters and the story. The puzzles throughout are mostly good - some a little obscure - but this game, the finale, was definitely the best, for the solidarity of the story (until the very end) and puzzles which actually left me with a sense of achievement rather than of frustration.I'm very happy to have played them.Trilogy - 11/10Goodbye Deponia - 9/10 (bugs.

I wasn't a fan of the graphics stlye at times, but that's due to personal aesthetics rather than quality. The sound on the other hand was very good indeed.The bad and the ugly are the same as they were in the previous part. The biggest problem is that the game's quirky style of humour weakens immersion and makes you not care about the plot. And then there is Rufus. Yeah, it's been said, but i really don't like the guy and he does his bit to undercut the plot too.I won't spoil the ending, but despite what a lot of people say, i don't think it was that bad.

Yes, the game on the outside looks much like the other two games did. As I began to play the game there were a number of scenes that were very controversial in my mind that turned the once known light hearted humor into some very dark humor. This destroyed the story for me throughout the entire game and even the ending that I thought would be a good closure for the series way was not. I was left with more questions than I had for Deponia or even Chaos on Deponia (And yes it has been said that Poki does not plan on making a 4th game, something that I am actually thankful for). I guess many of the other elements to the game were similar to the first two, but in some ways I felt like the game designers tried too hard to make this out shine the first two, which ended up leading them to a pile of garbage! I still recommend the first game and the second for that matter. Unfortunately they made the second game like most games and movies that come in trilogies, where the story is intentionally left wide open in the second installment. And while all of the games appear to have some loose ends, the first game was clearly my favorite and the best ending of the three.

While not as strong as the first game, if you've followed the series this far, you will not be disappointed by the conclusion.As is to be expected from Deponia, you follow the adventures of Rufus, an unlikable individual who manages to break everything around him, as he tries to now save Deponia from being blown up, maintain a barely healthy relationship with Goal, and not kill everyone around him.  The recurring characters are who they are, and if you like or don't like them, this game won't change anything, but that will mean the difference in if you laugh or cry when Rufus faces tragedy.  I don't like Rufus and laughed at him.  I did like his flawed humanity throughout the series though.The writing and animation has improved a lot since Chaos on Deponia.  This also follows the translation where a lot more effort and reviewing has been put into it.  The developers knew they didn't want their series to fall down on its final moments and put the extra effort into making sure the final game went well.  Some of the jokes can fall from jovial to borderline offensive.  As an example, you break up an inter-racial couple and make the black woman in the couple take a job replacing an organ grinder's monkey.  Some of the events are engineered to make you feel less positive about Rufus or yourself.  While most of the game doesn't skirt that level of unfriendly, your mileage may vary with some of the humor.The puzzles follow the same blend of narrative and dialogue puzzles they have in the past.  The difficulty at the start is not too bad, with the game reaching a high peak somewhere toward the middle.  Once you reach a certain point, the game rushes to the conclusion with the difficulty of the puzzles easing off and they become little more than pauses or intermissions in the narrative.  Much like the Chaos on Deponia, the game does use some puzzles which cause you to think outside the box and outside the conventions of normal adventure games, with tone puzzles, creative use of cursors and positioning, managing multiple characters, and plenty of red herrings.  So, you may find some of them easy to do if you think outside the box or you may get frustrated and have to consult a walkthrough at some points.I've praised Daedelic's gameplay adjustments enough to not have to mention them.  They are here as well, you have the mouse-wheel inventory, the hot keys, and the highlightable interactable objects.  They all make the game much smoother and don't bog down the game or story in the minutia of inventory clicking or mouse searching.While I don't think they've recaptured the magic of Deponia, they don't have to in a conclusion.  This is a satisfying ending to a memorable adventure game series which, through it's ups and downs, kept me entertained for a long while."

While the previous two games veered into questionable territory along the way, they never managed to be outright uncomfortable. UnlikeGoodbye. God, I wish I could be saying otherwise, I wish I was typing some sort of positive summary of my time spent with this trilogy. But I'm not. From the moment a found therapist's referral was put down to a character having 'clearly lost his marbles', something in me sank and, let me tell you, it didn't stop sinking. I swear, at some point during the game's second half the writing team was switched out, the change was so marked.Previous character development and traits were thrown out the window. Rufus, despite having joined the rebellion with Goal, pelts a pair of female recruits with endless mysogynistic comments about how they don't belong. He's shown having been drawn to Toni and ""sassy"" Goal (although, in hindsight, that might just be down to the fact that women in this series are almost exclusively baby-like or outright aggressive), yet the idea of women in that position is so alien to him he can do nothing but make relentless jokes? Not that that was anything in comparison to being able to sell one of the series' only black characters (who dances, nearly nude, as an organ grinder's monkey) to the grinder himself, who is rather blatantly drawn to be more ape than man, a rope salesman set up opposite a therapists office, nooses adorning his shop's roof or being able to lure children into the path of a paedophile. That last bit makes my blood boil just writing it. This game isn't just distasteful it's uncomfortable, even to think about, at this point. The whole series, the whole beautifully drawn, well acted series, has gone from something joyful to something I'd love to be able to purge from my steam library for good thanks to the bad taste it's left in my mouth and the knot of discomfort it's left in my gut.Who, at any point, thought any of this was okay?

,Not Recommended,241910,11677187,"Posted: 12 August, 2014",all,[𝕭𝕷𝕻] Badger Lord Pat.,"A comment on Rufus, particularly: I absolutely hate him. He is utterly self-centered and willing to harm anyone and anything to get what he wants. The fact that he is incompetent about it is supposed to make him more endearing to us as an audience. The positive reviews seem to indicate such was the case for most people. But I am not one of them.Consider the following (spoiler alerts): In Deponia 1, he doesn't want to do the dishes. OK, fine, neither did I. But he will go to great lengths to make espresso for a pretty girl, even to the point of flooding a ""friend""s house, blasting underneath three others', robbing Gizmo of a fair amount of his equipment, etc. He thinks nothing of picking up an unconscious girl, whome he claims to ""love"", with a crane and dropping her onto a pile of coal to ride, with every possibility of falling off, down a mine track. Then, when he goes to clean her cartridge, he doesn't do it delicately, as such fragile components need tender loving care. Don't you think if he loved Goal he would have cared to clean her cartridge more delcately? Instead, he messes it up even more, corrodes it, and scratches his name into it!! That's not funny! That's giving a person brain damage! That's intolerable. And that's just the first game!And he doesn't get any better in the next two: In the second, of course, he buys the cheap cartridges and splits Goal's personality, all for the sake of a ten-cent all-day sucker. The nerve! That's not adorably selfish. That's despicable beyond words. And what he does to Baby Goal - he does realise she's completely under his power in that state, right? It's just like handling a baby. He is basically no better than Ian Watkins (a recently sentenced paedophile who used to be a famous musician - God rest his soul ) when he hits on Baby Goal. He's even worse when he abuses her childlike trust to use her as a living lightning rod! Would you do that to a child? Is that an acceptable abuse of a child?No. We should not give this guy our sympathy where it is not due. And the vast majority of his character is not sympathetic in the least. It is almost entirely abusive, and I do not think anyone can credit it to the reasons Hermes - God rest his soul - gives for why Rufus is the way he is. Rufus is not merely a jackass. He is the jackass to end all jackasses. When he killed Goal in the pod - I don't care whether that was an accident or not - the game should have ended there, or Rufus should have changed utterly. As previous reviews have mentioned, that, of course, didn't happen. He is no better by the end of the game.And, worst of all, not only is this despicable specimen of intelligent life the protagonist, he's the guy you play for the span of all three games. You follow him everywhere. You ARE him. I hated a lot of the choices I made playing this game, because I could not make a moral choice, a good choice, if the story was going to advance. I can think of better writing than this. I think most people can. If Poki was just trying to be as crass, or selfish, or harmful as one can be while saving the world, he hit the mark. But to call Rufus a ""hero"" - I sympathise with Bozo. I applauded when he exploded in Rufus's face, with the baby vomit all over him, and the antidepressants in his hair. It needed to be said. And more, much more, besides.The way the game ends - it's almost a relief. Almost. But, Poki, you've left everyone to ""die in their sins"". You let Rufus die in his selfishness. You've left Goal to die in her misguided love. You've left the Deponians to die on Elysium, Elysium to die probably on Deponia. At the end of the Deponia trilogy, the world is not a better place. And, Poki, maybe that's how you see the world. Maybe that's how the modern world sees the world. But it is not so. Poki, I read your forum post (translated into English). All men have a goal in life, a race to run, a fight to fight. Neither should we settle for the garbage on the ground, nor shoot up to the Heavens. Heaven is not enough. Rufus was made for more than Elysium. He could have been the next Doctor Who, or Captain Kirk, or (God forbid) a Saint Francis or even Buddha (well, perhaps not Buddha - except on caffeine). These are men who adventured. Who helped make their worlds better, in little ways, wherever they went. Rufus could have been the subject of a new series on TellTale, or somesuchthing. And, fo course, he could have come to know the neverending adventure - God Himself. And someday, I plan to make a response to this dreadful series along those lines. I surely wish to, anyway. No story should ever play out the way this one did. Ever. This is Hell."

Although Deponia's story is ok, it's not like the story is enough to redeem the game. If anything, Deponia's story is just a justification for the puzzles.Pros:+ Decent story+ Storyline is fleshed out and resolved much better than previous games+ Same characters and sense of humor as the other games, assuming you liked themCons:- Same convoluted puzzle-solving as the first two games. You go through a chain of 10 puzzles that are barely related to the game or story at all, and then finally find out that the larger puzzle you were solving was pointless anyway and didn't achieve what you were trying to do. Such an exercise in futility. Also some of the solutions simply don't make sense.- The convoluted puzzles result in poor pacing of the story. It stagnates for long periods of time while you work on asisine puzzles before finally lurching ahead with a cut scene.- Poor mini-game puzzles, which are just confusing rather than challenging- Very disappointing ending to the story. I won't spoil anything, but don't get your hopes up.- I have to mention a shockingly offensive moment in the game in which Rufus ends upselling the only black character in the whole series into slavery where she has to pretend to be a monkey for coins. How does something like this end up in a finished game without anyone realizing or caring how inappropriate that is?"

It's horrible, seriously, to go from the two first opus to this one crap. Suddenly the humour is totally random, with really bad taste humour.And i did search why. And i found why : the lead artist Jan Muller-Michaelis, who founded the game, who wrote the texts and scenario of the first two episodes, has been set aside to only direct voice acting. So, the whole thing falls apart.

76561198039271135,Not Recommended,241910,28997846,Posted: 3 January,all,calkhi,"I have played through the trilogy of the games, and the only thing I have to say is that I'm not very impressed.While the gameplay of this game is certainly vastly better than the others, including proper puzzle tutorials on how the puzzle worked, I can't help but feel as though something is wrong. As though, somehow, I've been cheated out of something.Oh, right, a respectable ending.[Spoilers be beyond.]This game, its script writing, and everything about it seems to revolve around puffing up the writers' and developers' ego, and focusing almost entirely on their own egocentric views as placed through the main character, and multiple references back to the game devs and writers that break the fourth wall only seem to shore up that representation. It's like what happened in Bubsy 3D, only far less charming when presented by an over the top, sexist, egocentric madman, who, until the very end, was the same worthless bag of trash until he finally found a reason to sacrifice himself. Even then, we didn't get that saddening, emotional ending that would have left everyone satisfied with the series on a whole, and willing to close the book. Somehow, an editor boards the ship and ends up falling with Rufus just to break that tragic ending with more self centered egotism.If this had been some character like Deadpool, I might have made an exception. But it's not. He was not shown as some bad♥♥♥♥♥chopping his way through those that opposed him while making sly comments and breaking the fourth wall. No, he was a bumbling fool who stumbled through danger and solved menial puzzles, caused suicides and death, nearly causes the destruction of his home planet three times, puts his friends in immeasurable danger, and at the very end, when we finally get to feel sad and sorry to see him go? We're not even given that.You know, the worst part of this game wasn't really Rufus, though he was the character that said it, it was how the writers decided to approach sexism. To the point where talking to any female who is not Goal became an ear grating experience, and not just from listening to Toni either. Rufus, and the way he talked to females, most notably regarding Bambina and Lottie outside the tank, was disgusting, and over the top for even Rufus. It felt like the writers at that point weren't calling out how bad sexism is, but were, and likely still are, sexist themselves!Now let's talk about another part of this game. Cloans. Really? ... Actually, that's not that bad, no.It was Hermes. I took one look at him and I said ""Star Child."" For those of you who have played the Mass Effect series, who know how bad of a taste those two words leave in your mouth, then you must see exactly what I mean. He was the cop out. He was the ""I have all the solutions to all of your problems!"" guy. While I will admit that his exposition certainly did make some of the mysteries of the trilogy fall into place, we then follow it all up by having him commit suicide. Oh bravo, BRAVO! Way to touch on that situa- Wait, did I say touch?No, once again, the writers, or perhaps not them, perhaps someone higher up was ""touching base"" with them constantly and telling them what to write. Either way, the writers blatantly show another facet of suicide later on (rope noose store) and even have a therapist suggest one of his patients kill herself. I'm sorry, but what happens if someone who suffers from severe clinical depression picked this up, played it, and saw that? Do you really think some people aren't going to be affected by that? I mean, as someone who, at one point in his life, had to deal with those tendencies, it's horribly offensive, to say the least. Not that I'm claiming the writers ever came up with any tact regarding insults no matter the character those insults came from, or what or who they were about.But I can't deny this game having its moments. Romance between Goal and Rufus was certainly charming, to say the least. Finally seeing Bozo snap and slap the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Rufus was also very, very nice. Seeing his ""father"" unravel himself in front of everyone else, seeing Rufus finally get his time under the spotlight, and truly having their support for one, final plan... That was finally a moment of heroism when it was never even once allowed before even when the PLAYER wanted to make a right decision in the series. Oh, and you thought I forgot about that.Oh no, this is something that NEEDS to be touched on, even if it wasn't a big problem in this game. Stopping the player from making the right choice, and instead taking that option from our hands. That is just disgustingly pitiful, and a clear show of a lack of effort there. Nothing gets me angrier than when my ability to decide a key moment means nothing in that moment. It's not funny, it's just a disgusting way to allow the writers to slack.So, all in all, can I recommend this trilogy to to other people on the internet? It highly depends. If you like puzzle games, and don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about the story, please, get this trilogy in the full. The puzzles are actually quite fun once you understand them, and often very well crafted. Even if you enjoy your puzzle games having a story, but are still mostly in it for the puzzles, get the trilogy. But if you care about the story and the characters, walk away now.The story is ruined by the characters, the comedy does not exist outside of some slapstick moments, and the twists are oh-so-predictable.Finally, I have to include one last bit. I'm not an SJW, and I will never be. I don't want anything that I've said to be thrown under their banner, even though I know half of it will. What I said in this review is entirely of my own opinion, and only my own. I touched on the things that felt like they were well over the top, even for a character like Rufus. I enjoyed the gameplay, which was quite honed and well made, but I could hardly stand more than a few characters in the game. This is not a book I close with contentment, but with contempt. Good day to you all, I need to get some sleep."

I'm struggling to remember any woman playing a somewhat neutral role such as vendor, therapist, journalist... the ones we see working are part of the main cast and mostly fall into tired female tropes.- self-aware unfunny racism. See Rock Paper Shotgun article and other comments- the writer(s) built a somewhat consistent character, but not a consistent world: friends and foes are mostly differenciated by their aptitude to put up with the main character, which is very high for both, despite all logic. The world does not react to the main character in general, making his antics tiring by the third episode rather than entertaining. We can't empathise with the character nor can we with the world, which is the shame.- Not only the main character doesn't change throughout the series, but his actions become more selfish and tasteless as the story progresses.- deus ex machina explanation which binds the whole story together- we never get to play in Elysium- disappointing ending.Overall, I felt that the first episode was suprinsingly charming, because of the discovery of the great design, animation, music and somewhat original setting; the second introduced great new areas, clearer puzzles, and more funny moments even though the character becomes a bit tiring and his actions more cringe-worthy; by the third I no longer felt like investing myself heavily into the world and puzzles and I cringed much more than I laughed, both due to tasteless scenes and bad story.This is a no for me."

I want to say many things about the story and the characters, and the potential that I felt was unfulfilled, yet justifyingly so, but I will try to refrain from writing any spoilers in this review.As the last game of the series, the puzzles are only getting harder with the addition of managing multiple inventories instead of just one. There were definitely more times where I had to look up a walkthrough to find salvation for my overheating brain than the previous two games, but the challenge definitely makes the game entertaining to play (kudos if you can play through the game without looking up the solutions). Throughout the game you'll find various character references to other games/movies, and you'll have quiite a few giggles interacting with them as the MC. And finally, the adventure was simply beautiful and... magical. I never thought I'd be so emotionally invested in a point-and-click adventure game, but I've never been more glad to be proven wrong.If it's not clear enough by this point, I am very impressed with the game and would recommend it to those who has already played the previous two games. For those who have not started the series and are looking for a game with a challenging-but-not impossible puzzles, a few good giggles and a great story, then I will say that being able experience the adventures of Deponia is worth every single penny in your wallet.

Worth getting if you're even a casual fan of point and click adventures. Some puzzles are challenging which is good and you really never find yourself slamming your head into the keyboard.

You need to play the other games for this one to make any sense, as it is a direct continuation of the story.The main plot (while as convoluted as ever) does a good job of wrapping up all the loose ends, and it fills in all of the backstory question marks. I thought the ending was cheap and unsatisfying, though.The puzzles were on par with the first two games, although this chapter throws in a new multi-inventory system that adds an extra layer of complexity. There is also a heavier reliance on needing to perform actions in a particular order.I liked, or at least tolerated, most of the mini-games in this one. There were no hair-pulling sequences like Platypus Bataka, and it was easy to get all of the achievements.Goodbye Deponia contains an array of new locations, but brings back most of the side characters from the first two games. You also eventually gain the ability to switch back and forth between multiple parallel story-lines.The pacing is better than in the second game, but it still feels like a slog. I think by the third game, I just got sick of taking twelve steps backward for every one step forward. It would have been nice, for once, to feel like I was actually working towards an end-goal, instead of spending all my time band-aiding the problems caused by Rufus's idiocy and recklessness. I think if you combine Roger from Space Quest's bad judgement, Leisure Suit Larry's sexism, Urkel from Family Matters' accidental destruction, Mayhem from the Allstate commercials' intentional malevolence, and the cast of Seinfeld's problem-solving skills, you might get something approximating the experience of controlling Rufus.In general, I felt there was a tonal shift from ""generally funny with occasional dark humor"" to ""everything is awful and every joke is at someone's expense."" Chaos on Deponia had its own morbid and uncomfortable moments, but Goodbye Deponia purposely goes out of its way to make Rufus as irredeemable and disgusting as possible. While it makes sense in retrospect, it is difficult to play through. I missed the comedy that made the earlier games palatable.[Major trigger warning: the content of this game contains images and dialogue related to depression and suicidal thoughts]What can I say? This is an irksome and doleful game that happens to have high production values and decent point-and-click puzzles. While it is a fitting end to the series, I don't think it was necessarily the right end. I give it a 6/10."

I am somehow proud of the developers to be so courageous to not put a happy ending.Nobody would have taken a grudge. Rufus and Goal would have beenfrozen in timefor us happily.But I don't believe in something like this. This would be Elysium. And though we have seen the people in Elysium always happy, we only have been shown very little of them and I believe there was a shadow hiding in the hearts of the people there. That Goal left with Cletus is proof enough for me.Of course I am projecting their fantasy world onto ours. Perhaps they can be happy while abandoning their people. I somehow believe we cannot and this seems to be even somehow religious.The ending is inspiring. And it is variation, change. Change in Rufus. Change also in Cletus, who now started to go creative.

And I agree, there's a lot of South Park style deployment of racist, sexist, transphobic, and otherwise wack and offensive tropes in this game, and the previous two Deponia games.  The most overtly offensive bits in this Deponia game seem at least to damn Rufus's conduct as such, like killing babies to solve a point and click puzzle. No spoiler tag, the main character Rufus is a scumbag.  2) I heard that the end sucks. I strongly disagree. I loved the ending and was surprised to approach a redeemable place in the story. I'm glad I picked it up while it was on sale."

It is an masterpiece with great puzzles, characters, and story. It is actually addictive to play with.Oh and an impressive "" Goodbye Deponia"" ending."

It has two awesome predecessors and one great successor. There are all of the old strengths and also some new ones. The story is as always pretty interesting and funny. Rufus, founder of the resistance, master tinkerer, Mister Charming himself, saviour of Deponia and lover of Goal returns in this game to continue his adventure of true heroism.Pros:-The Graphics (comic-style)-The Story-The Gameplay Mechanics-The Jokes-The CharactersCons:-Last game in Trilogy (Original)-"

I enjoyed playing the trilogy and I will definitely be playing them again the future. Like the previous parts this game has good puzzles, good characters, nice animation and a fun soundtrack. On the down side there was a few things I found  offensivelike selling June to work as a monkeyand the puzzles being a bit obsure but those things aside I still enjoyed the game."
,Recommended,241910,35064863,Posted: 19 September,all,True Anomaly,"The story is clear and interesting, even though I didn't play the previous parts. The graphic's nice and soft. But animation is sometimes quite goofy. Musical accompaniment is cool, but you will notice that developers have overused one track in several places, which is bad. Gameplay as a gameplay. With riddles, inventory and forcing the brain to work. However, sometimes it's difficult to catch essence, and then you can stuck in one area for a long time. Approximately half of the tasks are not logical, and difficult to understand, and when you solve them, your reaction is about: ""What? Is this even possible at all? And how am I would supposed to figure it out?"" Originally I'm from Ukraine, but I played game in russian (Because it doesn't supports ukrainian) and I noticed some inaccuracy in localization. Like missing letters in words, or random spaces between letters. But that doesn't make much sense. Definitely recommend it."
