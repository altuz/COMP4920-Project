,Recommended,242110,7324028,"Posted: 6 October, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Joe Danger 2 improves upon the first game by adding more vehicles and other ways of transportation. I don't know what to tell you about it really. If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation.Also, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.In the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride ![Rating: 77/100]"

The screen is often too cluttered with explosions and various other moving parts, making it easy to lose track of your stuntman. Check out the original game first. It's the better of the two. If you like that one enough, then I suppose you'd probably get some enjoyment out of this one as well."

And it works without a problem on shank and shank 2 using steam for linux. So I'm sure it does not come from my system or the steam client.This game has no interest at all played with the keyboard.If the devs fix that I would totally change my review for a positive one.The game is actually fun and performs well on linux. The gamepad bug is killing it.( I tried using both xpad and xboxdrv )For windows users, no problem at all the gamepad works flawlessly.Besides it's a quite funny game trying to get that japanese crazyness from arcade games. And they succeeded at it pretty well in my opinion.The graphics are nice and colourful. I am actually sad of that situation."

But damnit, its pretty fun.Hello Games needs as much support as you can give right now, since their studio flooded. So I recommend picking this up if you want to see No Man's Sky get made."
