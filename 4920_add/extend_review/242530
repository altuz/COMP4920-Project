The only reasons that I haven't uninstalled it are due to the nostalgia I get from playing it every now and then, as well as it's not taking up a lot of hard disk space. But seriously, you're better off downloading an emulator for the consoles and getting the rom if you're planning to play the game at all.It's supposed to be a ""remastered"" version of the original game, but little about this game seems ""remastered"". Pointless and useless features don't count, especially those that make the game look worse.Online multiplayer is poorly optimized. The framerate drops drastically even if you're playing with a teammate sitting right next to you in the same room. As I have mentioned earlier, if you want to play with a friend, get the emulator and play local co-op. Unless playing Chaos Engine on 0.5x speed is a fine thing for you.1/10 Would download Sega Mega Drive emulator and Chaos Engine rom again"

I could never complete this game when I was younger, and I still can't now; but that is what I loved about it. The level of mechanics for such an old game is amazing. The diverse characters adds a lot of replayability. Steamworks integration allows Online Coop however, if you want to feel like a kid again, hook up two controllers and play locally.Would definitely recommend picking up this game if you ever had it on older platforms, for those nostalgia trips and for those who love a good shooter.Special power, FOOD!"
,Recommended,242530,9563592,"Posted: 19 March, 2014",all,VulpusAlbus,"This is a return of an old classical 2 players game. This is not a new remake. As I noticed they changed only three things:1. Added a filter that makes pixels look smoother. Can be disabled, but I really liked it (steam store screenshots have it turned on).2. Added autosave of the last unlocked password. No need to write them down on a sheet of paper. Handy.3. Not only local, but also a network multiplayer (2 players coop campaign).None of these features really make this game better or worser than it was before. I hightly recommend it to those who played this game years ago and liked it. It's still the very same fun game. On the other hand, mashing Fire is still a need as this way you shoot faster than if you just hold Fire key/button.For those of you who didn't... Well, it's a good 2 players coop game, played good if using the same computer (keyboard or controller for each player). The game is of average difficulty. It can kill you really quick if you are careless, but not unbeatable and doesn't require super reaction or precision. No combos, dirty tricks, you can play it straight out of the box. A lot of guessing elements appear later in the game and make you life easier or harder depending on your choices. This game will not take much time, it has autosave every half an hour or an hour at later stages when you reach a new world.. or if you loose all your lives before that :D. If everything goes good, you'll be able to complete it in one go in somehting like 3-4 hours. Six different characters and different special power (unlocked later) give this game some replayability, but not too much. Finishing it 1-3 times will probably be enough for most players.If this sounds fun - you should try it. If not - pass by, this game is quite good, but not a must see."

I highly recommend this game to anyone who was gaming in the early 90s for a good dose of nostalgic rage (when then CPU player takes all your food/power ups!). The majority of the game is flawless but there are still issues which have not been addressed. Like for instance the online multiplayer being laggy to the point of unplayability and some of the achievements are inaccessible/broken. Apprantly there are ""minor sound issues"" and a friend has also mentioned ""laggy menus"" but I myself have not experienced these problems or neglected to notice them.

I thought the Music was fantastic, very steampunk and in some parts intimidating, the gameplay was enjoyable and simple to understand, the characters were clever and well designed and the worlds were also very well designed. The story is easy to understand and plays well through the campaign. This re-release is about as good as it gets as far as The Chaos Engine is concerned, they have correctly identified the positives in the game, such as the Music, and amplified them to be better on newer systems, the controls are smooth and simple, as was the case back on the old Amiga, the achievements are entertaining and though there may be a small glitch when it comes to fully upgrading your character, I would strongly recommend this game to anybody out there who a) Wants a challenge, this game is tough as nails. b) Enjoys the typical run and gun style game. and c) Want a nostalgia trip.I have played the Co-op mode through Steam and it is alright, does take a while to adjust to the slight delays but soon it wears off and plays very well. Those of you who remember this game will know that the co-op mode was always difficult to follow and takes alot of practice, I regularly play the game with my borther over Steam and we do enjoy the challenge.10/10Steven Owen"

The Chaos Engine is a fantastic game that has a rock solid design, it is also one of the first games I ever played on the Amiga and was thrilled to see a remastered version released on Steam. Playing this again for the first time in about 18 years was the ultimate nostalgia trip. This game was way ahead of it's time, as was it's music.Even though the game is still hard as hell, that isn't an issue to me, it just makes me even more determined to try and beat it again. With the addition of online play, leaderboards and achievements, the Steam version of this game gives you more of a reason to keep coming back to have a go at it.There are some small issues with this port however, none of which are truly game-breaking but can be annoying. The main issue is the co-op play. 9 times out of 10 the game play is extremely choppy and make it very difficult to play properly, I believe a patch was promised for this and I really hope it comes along soon.Another thing that bothers me are some sound bugs that weren't present im the Amiga version. The sound of the the computer player teleporting to your location is elongated and high-pitched, it goes right through you now, especially after hearing it so frequently.  The theme after completing a level is also bugged and doesn't play properly, instead it just cuts straight to the menu music, not a big deal at all but it's just something I noticed. It could just be my memory, but I'm sure that the monsters use the wrong death and pain sounds too, I don't ever recall the monsters using the same sounds as the player characters.All in all, this is a good port of a great game and I definitely recommend it to old and new fans alike. There are some small issues but it doesn't make it any less of a great game. If nothing else in this game does anything for you, play it just for the soundtrack."

,Not Recommended,242530,8464221,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,Sdoots,"It's certainly The Chaos Engine.That's unfortunately where the praise ends, and admittedly, some of it isn't the games fault.Online co-op is absolutely dead, immediately rendering one of the selling points of this quick and dirty rerelease moot. Of my 100+ friends on here, 2 own it, and they never want to play it, so I've been unable to try it out regardless. I'd hope that when you do get in a match, it at least runs well, but considering how quickly the search results for the online matchmaking went from ""player found"" and then dropping back to the menu, to outright failing to find anyone, I doubt it.You can stretch the window to fit your monitor, but that looks just as terrible as it sounds. You'll want to leave it in the native resolution, which, thankfully, is bearable. It's just amazing that they give you the option to change the resolution, when all it does is stretch the game window and make it look like a big square of mud. The supposed graphical filters that they include just make things look worse.I loathe this statement, but I am left to wonder if The Chaos Engine has been a victim of time. On it's own merits, just as a game, it simply isn't very good. Enemies are ruthless, and the characters all feel identical outside of their weapon and maximum health, despite the game adamantly stating they are very much unique in nature. I never saw a reason to play as anyone other than the high health characters as a result of this. If I was going to be dodging bullets all the time, I'd rather have a lot of chances to screw up than only a handful before my game ends.After each stage, you are able to increase your characters attributes. This should be awesome, but it is absolutely hamstrung but constantly having to babysit the other character. You already only make a handful of coins a level, but when playing solo, that amount is automatically cut in half, with half given to the AI. Because, you know, that's fair. So the most you can ever really do is buy an extra life for yourself, or maybe increase your maximum health. Those interesting, possibly viable upgrades like increased movement speed, firepower, and such? Don't even think about seeing them in action. Your little AI friend needs an extra life.When you are actually on the field playing this mess of a game, enemies spawn from generators much like in a Gauntlet title. In those games, everything was restricted to movement in the four cardinal directions.The Chaos Engine hates you, so you are stuck moving and shooting in the four cardinal directions. Meanwhile, enemies can move wherever they damn well please, and some can shoot in 8 directions as well. Are you having fun yet?To complete a stage, you have to shoot all the posts in the stage to open up the exit. There are unlisted hidden posts that can open up secret exits, but the game isn't enjoyable enough to make that an enticing idea in the slightest. When you finally complete a stage, you really just wish you would run out of lives already.Luckily for you, the game has some mercy. When you do run out of lives, there is no continue option. You just lose. You can ""continue"" from the main menu, but this just loads you at the start of the last stage you were on, in whatever horrible shape you were in before you got murdered. So that's great.Why did I like this game when I was a kid?"
,Recommended,242530,20368071,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,Hexelf,"This game is very hard, but can be very rewarding and enjoyable once you get a handle on things. Once you get used to how Chaos Engine does stage layout - with lots of walls and stairs appearing or vanishing to create new paths - and get a better handle on positioning, distance and pacing, the game becomes a lot more manageable. But expect your first couple of runs to end in misery - it happens to everybody.They made some changes to the game with this port but for the most part they are minimalistic and geared mainly towards making the game look and play better. The new save system let's you enjoy the game without having to punch in long passwords for one, but it won't help you cheat like an emulator would.Picking the Navvie (one of the six playable characters) makes things a little easier for beginners. His initial stats and powerful weapon makes him a very sturdy character, and his special is a no-nonsense smart-bomb. The other characters are more technical and require a little more knowledge of how the game works to use properly.Playing online with a friend is an absolute blast, but the netcode is so-so."

I found this game (I was playing it with my dad on Amiga a few years ago) and I thought it is a really nice gift for him. I saw that this game was not recommended by players but I thought that they just don't understand old games.I wasn't actually right. I had to purchase this game twice: for me and my dad. What we actually found (this version problems):- choosing champions (however I should call them) and purchasing upgrades just sucks, nothing changed since Amiga game and this is definietly not good idea for keyboards. It is so idiotic,- graphic didn't change. I mean I like it but I gave too much money to have the same thing what my dad actually has,- there should actually be some facilitations (other than saving game after each level) - no, it wouldn't be too easy because it is typical arcade game so pretty hard one,- nothing really interesting and innovating about in-game control.This game is a huge mistake. Studio did an emulator just to gain money. It would be okay if this game costs 5-10 euro for you and your friend. I don't recommend this game right now. Maybe if it is a little bit (you know what actually ""a little bit"" means:) ) less.Of course if you want to play with me (I am going to finish this game anyway - I don't wanna waste that much money) - write to me.Watch videos, I think I'll record also The Chaos Engine soon.www.youtube.com/c/PearlyEuBye and see you soon in other reviews!Regards,Pearly"

,Not Recommended,242530,14798837,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,D2Kvirus,"Way back when, back in the days of the Amiga 500, The Chaos Engine was one of those games that I kept coming back to and playing over and over again, even though I never actually saw the end of the game - not because of a lack of skill, but because the RAM on my Amiga always crashed as soon as I'd finished the final boss battle.  So, naturally, when the game resurfaced a couple of decades later on Steam, I jumped at the chance to get stuck in once more.At first glance, the game feels pretty close to the one I played in the 90s: the soundtrack is as great today as it was back then, and the gameplay has pretty much the same feel - right down to the Brigand ally always nipping in to steal the bounty from the enemies I just killed.However, there's something that just seems...off.Some of it could be put down to the resolution, as the options seem to boil down to having it look great in a small window or having it look ugly when blown up to full screen, and it isn't the rose-tinted spectacles telling me the game looked better in the 90s because watching a walkthrough on Youtube has the game looking better.  Or it could be that, having played the game with joysticks back in the 90s, playing it on a keyboard simply feels unintuitive, which given the speed the game is played at is an issue.The main issue, though, is the game calling itself a remaster just feels disingenuous.  Compared to an emulated version of the original, this version isn't as smooth and is just plain slower, which is a double kick in the teeth when you consider the system requirements.I still love the original game, which can be tracked down by fair means or foul, but this simply is not the original game.  It may look and sound similar, but the pile of tiny yet significant flaws mean this just isn't The Chaos Engine of old, merely a poorly programmed port that does the original a disservice."

I have the Amiga original, which still holds up in spite of graphics and sound from 1993, largely due to its excellent gameplay. The Steam port (at least on PC) is nearly identical and therefore the same praise applies. If you like the original, you will like the port.I have one complaint, which for most people probably won't matter, but it is worth noting. Why did they have to go and mess with the original colors? I'm not talking about the hazards of trying to emulate Amiga hues on another system. Some colors in the game were deliberately changed, like the color of those little white cyclops guys with amber eyes (my avatar), whose white skin gave them a cool, creepy alien look. In the new version they are green with purple eyes, which makes them look more ""cute"" than creepy. They also seem to have brightened up the frogs too much, and the ""mossy"" gear backgrounds seem to have been changed to ""rusty"". More demerits! So far these are the only major, deliberate color changes I have noticed. Overall the colors are close enough, and admittedly, most people won't notice the hue changes or care.If you have never played the original, don't be put off by the slightly-blocky-by-today's-standards graphics.

The offline play remains pretty true to the SNES version, but the special power button seems sort of bugged out. I was playing with a 360 controller and it get mapped by default to the L trigger, which seems to be sort of wonky. Luckily you can remap the controls, but it still seems sort of sticky to use. Movement and regular firing are about the same as SNES.Other bugs include leaderboards showing The Priest in lieu of some other characters. I was doing a play with the Thug/Brigand and the leaderboard shows Thug/Priest, for example.The enhanced graphics are ok, but not that great. It looks like a photoshop smooth filter was applied to the character models (the map seems the same?) and a bit shinier of explosions, but that's about it. You can switch between either graphics instantly while in game, though, which is nice. There's a nice ""how-to"" menu that explains the formerly bamboozling upgrade system and explains the powerups nicely.I wouldn't really recommend this game at its fullest price point unless you're a bizarrely huge fan of the original game(s). I'd wait for a steam sale for its price to drop substantially to really justify it, considering you can find SNES roms of it for free."

The combat is simply too devolved by today's standards to be worth a purchase for singleplayer. The perk of being able to use a controller with full 360 degree is a nice upgrade, but don't bother with this unless it is your mission in life to beat old hard games or you have a buddy who will sit down a play with you.Overall, for what the game is trying to do (more tactical smash-tv with a campaign format) it is a 3/5 but I don't recommend getting it for the 10$ asking price."

Bonus and redeeming feature is multiplayer over network.This is indeed a solid rewrite of an old classic and it is true to it's origin, really f****ng hard.

I was STILL disappointed. This port is as bare-bones as it gets, for all the options the game gives you, you'll be looking for a quarter slot.The in-game manual is ugly as sin and clashes with the core design aesthetic.There's no reason for this port to exist besides accessibility, in case you don't have an Amiga lying around. But they do offer Achievements so if I was a longtime player I would probably want those.The gameplay is honestly kinda boring when compared to other topdown shooters with often better controls, even from the same era, but as an Amiga title it may be interesting to people like me who've never played many Amiga games. Just not interesting enough to keep me coming back.By the way if you're looking for the 'Enhanced mode', it's just a smoothing filter and bloom effect. But of course the info page and every prerealease blurb online mentions it as if it's an actual thing that exists.The game does have online co-op--if you can find anyone to play it with...This is a fun game and had it been released *as a port and not a remake* I'd have no complaints at all. Maybe if you think of it the same way you won't feel cheated if you buy it. They did add 16-way aiming for analog controllers, which I could take or leave. The game is obviously designed for 8-way and 16-way technically makes it easier. therefore debalanced, but other than that I'm sure OG Chaos Engine fans will find exactly what they're looking for if they just need a port of the game for their modern computer."

And what makes this shoot'em up even more fun is the ability to level up your character, as well as your computer partner's character. And each character has their own characteristics which affects gameplay.It's hard and there are lots of secrets to uncover. The soundtrack is also pretty cool. It's well worth the full price.

Of the three classic versions, the Amiga CD32 version had the best graphics and sound while the consoles had much snappier loading times. With the Steam version, you not only get the Amiga version of the graphics (more advanced color palette and animation detail) and sound, you also get the incredibly fast loading times.Also, the Steam version comes with achievements, cards, matchmaking and some image enhancement options. I highly recommend playing this game at the original, intended resolution. Scaling it up to ""HD"" will only blow up the pixels to a size that is nearly unbearable to look at. However, if kept at the original size, one can really appreciate the exquisite pixel art of the Bitmap Brothers. Smoothing can enhance the visuals even more, but, again, it is best left at the original resolution.  As for the added bloom effects, they are successful at enhancing the already impressive original explosion animations and other elements of the game world. I would put this game on a list of examples of games that use bloom to great effect without overdoing it.My review is really focused on whether or not this is a good port.
