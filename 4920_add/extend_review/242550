,Recommended,242550,8349995,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,[AReV]Nomed,"Rayman Legends is quite possibly the best 2d platformer released in the past 10 years.It’s the follow up title to Rayman Origins (also a great game) and if you missed it, 40 of the stages from Origins have been included in Legends as additional re-mastered content.It features over 120 different stages each with varying atmosphere, amazing music, and plenty of hidden collectibles. Each of the levels are hand drawn and beautiful to look at. Despite not being overly impressive on a technical level, Rayman uses a timeless style. While games like Crysis 3 probably won’t look that great 10 years from now, Rayman Legends will no doubt retain its charm.The game also has multiple characters to choose from along with a host of unlockables. There are underwater stealth missions, time trials, and even musical stages where you jump to the rhythm of remixed popular songs. The inclusion of daily and weekly challenges allows you to compete with your friends, adding tons of re-playability.If you enjoyed classic 2d platformers like Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country, you should check out Rayman Legends as it’s the closest thing to them in this day and age.For a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195783687Rayman Legends also made our list for The Top 35 Games of the Generation.

Weekly and daily challenges add even more to the mix.The only thing I might hold agaist it is the requirement of uplay. It might cause some issues with online content. Get stuffed Ubi. Steam should be enough DRM.EDIT. Weekly and daily challenges can be quite frustrating due to cheaters. It is a common sight to see people steal the diamond cups with riddiculus results like 9999 lums collected within a minute, or a challange completed in 00:00:00. It would be nice, if Ubisoft would make a sweep every once in a while and ban these people from multiplayer. Come on. Make this DRM uplay do something for players for a change.

76561197970524443,Recommended,242550,31532991,Posted: 3 May,all,HooksGURU,"Rayman Legends is a constant reminder of what makes an outstanding platformer.From the very start of the game you are greated by a vibrant and cheery soundtrack, that sets the stage for the game's warm and engrossing experience. Ubisoft's artistic framework engine paints a canvas of equally vibrant, and often comically over-the-top design and mechanics. From the amazing time-synced musical level showcases, to riding on the back of a buggy-eyed mosquito, to swimming through the depths of an inflatable ocean; the scenes are simply amazing in each of their playstyles.Levels are introduced through a series of paintings. With each segment leading to the next, in a series of what feels like a never ending chasm of silliness and complexity. Mechanics are introduced to the player as each painting series is completed. Newer levels often offer a mixture of previously refined skills, and newer skills that may take time to master before moving on to later portions of each series. Rewards range from the game's currency (Lums), to trophys for mastering each painting, new characters, showcases of the previous Rayman Origins levels, to ""scratch tickets"" that offer random rewards placed in a gallery.Difficulty ranges from, ""oh, I jump over that mushroom,"" to, ""there is no way anyone can do that."" The replay value easily outweighs the expense in that regard.At it's roots, Rayman Legends is a platformer. However, it feels like there is so much more than a platformer going on at any given time. Influences from Sci-Fi movies, Rock & Roll hits, inside jokes of Tom Clancy's series, the greatly overused ""Zombie Apocalypse"" themes, and sprinkles of nostalgia to those who grew up with Rayman.There's just so much Rayman Legends does right.If you are someone that gew up with platformers like Mario and Sonic, or just someone looking to add some frustration to your life, and have a laugh about it...pick this game up. You won't regret it.Uplay required, controller recommended, 10 minute breaks a must!"

The games were always very colorful and beautiful. I truly enjoyed 3D games like 'Rayman 2: The Great Escape' and 'Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc'. They took a lot of hours of my life and I remember helping my cousin to beat them. Every single time Rayman games amazed me with great soundtrack, great gameplay and gorgeous characters.'Rayman Legends' is no exception, it's very similar to 'Rayman Origins', but I dare to say that it's easier than Origins. Why? You can collect everything without much effort. Lums are quite easy to get in a first try, the same goes with Teensies. I still love this  game though. It's beautiful beyond measure. the art is truly breathtaking. The same goes with music, it's really catchy and I found myself humming to it quite often. Daily challenges are nice addition and they keep you busy, even after beating the main story.It's a pleasant game and I can't wait for the next Rayman's adventures. Hopefully, next time we'll see them in 3D, because till this day one of my favourite games is 'Rayman 2: The Great Escape'.To sum up, 'Rayman Legends' is truly enjoyable, not too hard but still a must have for platform games fans, and what is more important: for Rayman fans, just like me."

76561198068161450,Recommended,242550,13455719,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,scoven 2.0,"I have beat this game multiple times on console (don't hurt me), and I can easily say that this is one of the best platformers ever...hands down! Whenever people hear ""greatest platformer ever"" people always point at the original Mario games, Super Mario Galaxy, etc. However, this easily joins among their ranks.This game is a breath of fresh air in the platformer genre. Along with its counterpart Rayman Origins (which I have also beat), they are both really refreshing platformer games because of their unique style, in graphics, gameplay, and level design.Firstly, the game is visually stunning. The game uses an engine called the ""UbiArt"" engine, which is used to easily animate any image. The animations in this game are flawless given the many different movements that Rayman can use. Plus, the game feels INCREDIBLY smooth, and there are no visual flaws whatsoever. If I was to ever to die in this game, I cannot fault the game for choppy frame rate... I always blame myself!Speaking of which, the game has a difficulty balance that can accomodate both new players and old players. Some levels can be a breeze, but then others you can die A LOT, especially some of the later levels.The level design is really good. Like most platformers, each world typically has a ""theme"". In my personal opinion, I believe that the ""Fiesta de Los Muertos"" world in Rayman Legends is the best, clearly because the level design is so great in every single level (if you play the first level at the world, you will see exactly what I mean). What a lot of platformers truly fail at achieving is creating MEMORABLE levels, and Rayman Legends has at least a few memorable levels that will be stuck in your head. Even the boss battles are really great!The gameplay is also really addicting, with plenty of different moves to learn. This can range from a series of simplistic punches, all the way to cartwheels (a slightly more advanced move). While the objective is to complete a level, there is also a ranking for each level to grab a both a certain number of lums and ""teensies"". Lums, unlike the last game, are accumulated and can be used to unlock new variants of characters. Plus, lucky tickets unlock plenty of different things, including updated Rayman Origins levels!...and the multiplayer...oh my....the multiplayer is GOLDEN!!!! This game easily has the most fun local multiplayer in a long while! The multiplayer is perfect for anybody, whether you want to play seriously or if you want to troll your friends. :)Another memorable part of the game, even though it is not as prominent, would be the soundtrack. The soundtrack really compliments the game in different ways, and I had a couple of tunes stuck in my head. Overall, the game can last you quite awhile, maybe about 15-20 hours to complete everything (depending on how good you are). What can also add to the length would be the daily and weekly challenges, where you can REALLY hone your skills.There are a few flaws, given the overall grand scheme of things, but hardly hold this game back from sheer greatness. I think that there should  have been more minigames along with ""Kung Foot"" because ""Kung Foot"" isn't necessarily my favorite part of the game. Also, I think that there are also too many ""clone"" characters (variants of Barbara in particular).To whomever might read this review, I would not even hesitate getting this game. Play it and love it! You won't regret it!"

Ubisoft has create some very discouraging factors for players to even buy this game.It has unnecessary DRM that forces you have installed Uplay and steam at the same time to just play the game. This is a rather rude concept when i speciffically purchaced the game on steam and want to keep and play my games on steam.A online multiplayer could had made this game a huge hit for many years and instead we get one of their ppl tell as excuse that he likes it local because you cant hit other ppl online... really? I could see a endless line willing to slap him for that.Still, the developers did manage to safe this game by making it simply amazing from graphic and gameplay to amazing level design.The game allows you to play also the levels from Rayman origins but has also many bonus mini games that unless you are really bored, you wont probably play those much.Multiplayer makes most games more fun but doesnt have effect on the whole playtrough so single player is just fine.Pc controller work fine in my case.So if you like quality games, you are a rayman fan and can tolerate Ubisofts flaws then the game is definitely worth it"

Taking mechanics that worked from the first title and buffing them to a mirror finish, and then introducing new ideas to make it original.For me, Origins was a really, really fun and solid game and a great return to form for the Rayman franchise. I've sunk many hours (three digits) into it and, despite not being the completionist type, have been pushed to try quite hard to do so by it's captivating art and great soundtrack, plus pile of content. With Legends, Ubisoft has managed to recreate this gem, but better. It's as simple as that.The UbiArt engine is slick at all times and always stable, the game is even prettier then the first and, somehow, even more tuneful. I haven't anything to complain about yet, except perhaps that it's not occasionally as brutal as Origins in spots, but there's always plenty more in the game, and I haven't even mentioned the online challenges yet where the player competes against a global leaderboard.If you like platformers, you'll probably love this game. It's fast, it's competitive and is sensibly integrated into online challenges, and doesn't suffer very much from being originally WiiU exclusive. It's my favorite game of 2013 (previously a title given to Revengeance), and a perfect 10 in my books.I do recommend picking up Origins before this one if you're a newcomer to the franchise, though.

The vector graphics are back and look prettier than ever, there is the addition of a sidekick as well to help you get through some levels.There is a lot to do in this game, each level has 10 teensies to find (The little blue guys), as well as the challenge to find enough lums (The yellow flying guys) to earn the Gold trophy. There are also unlockable characters as well, collectable creatures, unlockable bonus levels from Rayman Origins (each has teensies and trophies to collect) and Time Trial levels as well. If you're a bit of a completionist like I am with these sorts of things, you'll have lots to keep you occupied. There is also the new music levels, which are very much like the chest chasing missions in Origins, completely timing based where you jump or attack in time with the music. These are excellently thought out and the timing is spot-on. These are a bit more forgiving than Origins' chest chasing missions though, having checkpoints rather than making you restart after each death.There are downsides though, this game is a console port and at times it shows, making some actions hard to perform using keyboard if you don't have nimble fingers. It is perfectly playable with the keyboard though and supports full key remapping (Which I suggest you do, I set mine to the Origins controls and it saved me a lot of trouble), but it may be easier to play using a controller. I can't say which is better, since I've only played using keyboard, although you can play one handed using keyboard, leaving your other hand free to do other stuff like eat a sandwich or write a book. It also doesn't really have much replayability, apart from the music levels which are awesome just to play occasionally, unless you are a big Rayman fan. Plus it only works through UPlay, which is not a bad piece of software but it does make things frustrating when you just want to get right into the game.Overall, this game is worth picking up, even at full price and the annoying DRM.

It has got bright colorful graphics, great controls, interesting level design and it offers a good level of challenge without being unfair or frustrating, something Rayman Origins often missed the mark on.The main part of game world is divided up into 5 different paintings, each with 9-10 levels based on different theme.  The paintings all end with a boss and a musical level, where the action in the level follows the background music. I loved the musical levels and I wish there were more of them. There is an extra unlockable painting that let’s you play the musical worlds again with added challenges, but it is basically the same level.The game has tonnes of content with invaded levels, daily/weekly challenges, and you can unlock most of the levels from Rayman Origins. You certainly get your money’s worth here.Honestly the only caveat for this game is Uplay...I have had issues with it in the past and I know many people continue to even today.To Ubisoft’s credit, over the last 3-4 years they have taken Uplay from being an unusable piece of malware to more of an annoyance. So let’s give them credit for that, I guess…My advice is just log into the Uplay application once, set it to offline and never, ever, touch it again."

,Recommended,242550,22443006,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,龍 Mao,"Make your life legendaryRayman Legends is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Rayman Origins, with Legends taking what worked from Origins and refining it.Pros:You no longer have to unlock powers separately, meaning those who’ve already played through Origins can experience the entire moveset from the start.A fantastic artstyle that’s a lot more shinier and polished than Rayman Origins.A large pools of fun and great levels, backed by good level design.Additional modes like Challenges and Kung Foot help make the experience more replayable for both local co-op and singleplayer gamers!Surprisingly well optimised for lower-end computers!Nitpicks:The bonus “Creatures” element of the game is completely unnecessaryBeing locked out of certain levels in the challenges mode by a leveling system is frustratingOnline Multiplayer would had really made modes like Kung Foot more popular.The levels containing Murphy feel a lot more repetitive than normal, although at least they aren’t auto-scrollers.Cons:For a mostly local cooperative game, there’s no excuse for this to require Uplay., even if it has a lot of somewhat unnecessary online activities.The ReviewAs someone who grew up playing Rayman, I adored the return-to-form that was Rayman Origins, and Legends continue the trend with new levels, shinier graphics, and a ton of additional packed goodies.Rayman Legends is a mostly 2D platformer with a lot of collectathon elements, but it’s great to know that collecting all of the teensies is much a major requirement, which allows for speedrunning. There’s a huge amount of levels to play, and since you aren’t restricted in playing all of the worlds in order, you are given a lot more freedom to tackle levels! The return of 4-player co-op is good fun, although it quickly devolves the game into a chaotic mess, so completionists are better off playing alone (Which is still fun!).Gameplay for the most part, is as refined as Rayman Origins. The controls are responsive, and your moveset is versatile but simplistic enough that you are given a lot more control. It’s actually really difficult to talk about this game because of how perfect controlling the characters is. The physics, the button layouts, it just feels so natural. However, for keyboard players, I highly recommend picking up a controller to play this game, as with other platformers.The newest mechanic in Legends is of course, Murphy. By the press of a button, you can have him slap switches, tickle enemies, and cut ropes. For the most part, however, Murphy’s only included in some of the levels, which I’m perfectly fine with because Murphy feels heavily gimped from the Wii U version.As someone who’s 100% complete the game on Wii U, I’ve noticed huge differences between this version and the Wii U one as well. For one, there’s no 5 player co-op, or the ability to have complete control over Murphy. Both versions seem to trade one thing for another; The Wii U version allows complete control at the cost of not having direct control over your player in single-player mode, and the PC version lets you control your character, but have more limited control when it comes to Murphy. A good middle between the two would had fixed the problems, but both versions are stuck with the levels containing Murphy being either a slog or being quite the unintentional challenge when speedrunning/completing comes to play.The reason why Murphy levels feel weird in the PC version is because they were designed to be slow-paced, which makes them unintentionally more difficult now that you have full control over your character and can freely run.The game includes a wealth of side-modes to play, and while they aren’t anything to write home about, they are nice additions. Challenges make for a unique set of leaderboard challenges that’s constantly reset weekly (although a lot of the challenges are the same things from past rotations and can get repetitive), and Kung Foot is an insane blast to play. However, the addition of a XP bar to lock challenges and the “Creatures” addition seem to be completely unnecessary, and only serve to make 100%ing this game feel more like a chore. Also, Online Multiplayer would had really helped when it came to modes like Kung Foot, because I can’t really get my friends together all the time to play it.Presentation-Wise, Rayman Legends nails it. While I like the more zany look of Rayman Origins, Legends polishes up the artstyle to look completely unique and beautiful. When certain enemies or objects are shown as a 3D model, it doesn’t look odd or unusual, making it a solid blend of 2D and 3D visuals. It’s music is a joy to listen to, despite being dangerously close to being generic medieval fare. The UI mostly doesn’t distract the player, although the constant in-game notifications definitely are annoying.So how’s the PC version of the game? Surprisingly good! I managed to get it running 60fps on my laptop (which seems to like running games at terrible framerates), and it’s been doing superb for me on my main PC (to no surprise). If you have a low-end computer, you should give it a shot, it isn’t as intensive as it looks.Unfortunately, the game requires uPlay (which is weird because Rayman Origins didn’t!), and it’s as big of a mess as always.TL;DR - Rayman Legends is a fantastic platformer with splendid controls, tons of bonuses, and a stellar presentation.

,Recommended,242550,15116046,"Posted: 29 March, 2015",all,sarysa,"I have to say, this is a pretty inspired platformer. The controls are simple, power-ups are few, but instead you get treated to some seriously well designed environments. The daily and weekly challenges are a testament to how much gameplay variety the game has. There are enough background touches that replaying a level a few times, you'll notice things that you missed the first time through. The musical stages are a treat for the eyes, and a nice homage to the early auto-play ROM hacks (i.e. SMW Kumikyoku) which would do the same thing. (though you need to jump and fire to the beat, of course)You don't have a lives counter. When you die, you just start back at some arbitrary checkpoint. You can also just opt to restart at the last checkpoint via the pause menu if you messed up getting some collectible. (lums or teensies) Challenge purists may scoff at this feature but anti-frustration features such as these are long overdue. Some players go for utter perfection and they can still impose that challenge on themselves. Those of us who'd rather not endure dozens of repeats of an entire stage for one difficult section will have things the way they are. Not to mention, anti-frustration features are much more kid friendly. Finally, Ubisoft cycles through challenges every day where you can compete with the world. They have you covered, though they admittedly do a miserable job at managing the hackers.The game is fairly non-linear, with paths opening up as you collect more teensies and lucky tickets.  Teensies make more standard stages available, and tickets (eventually) open up more of the ""Back to Origins"" stages.90% of what I _didn't_ like about this game can be summed up in one word: UPlay. The fact that they're using steam as a conduit to push their redundant DRM system which significantly adds to the startup time is appalling. One thing you better not do is check the box that says ""don't tell me again"" when you close the window with your key. You won't have the steam overlay available to get it again when it's time to enter the key again, many minutes later. I almost botched my install this way...luckily I hadn't copied something else into my clipboard. This experience alone almost caused me to knee-jerk a negative review in...lucky for them, the game is extremely good.The rest of what I found irritating were some of the pop-ups after a level. One made it look like an option but literally forced me to stop what I was doing and go play an invasion level. I also kept getting annoying popups to use the tickets even though I'd already responded to one such popup. It's my own damn prerogative if I want to use them all at once. I also don't like the fact that unlocking levels is somewhat RNG based, but I'm guessing that they had the sense to heavily influence the ""randomness"" of unlocking said levels.All in all, I guess I recommend it. Hopefully someday Ubisoft will realize they're alienating gamers with their DRM, and...yeah, I'm sticking with Steam. Thanks. That said, the game itself is worth the annoyance."

The gameplay is superb, and although it does lag a tiny bit now and then, you won't even care because you're too focused on how fun this game is. ;) Some levels require fast thinking, multi-tasking and being quick on your feet (Rayman feet) as you jump through obstacles and fight off enemies that come in your way whilst a fire blaze is coming after you. There are also lever-related levels where you have a handy sidekick guy who helps make your obstacles a bit easier, as long as you remember to use this little sidekick guy by pressing 'w', or 'q' and 'e' to make him rotate the wheel/s. Furthermore, there are mini games such as challenges, and a sports ball-kicking multi-player mini game. Throughout the game, you'll have little bonuses popping up here and there to help you gain more points/life, and during the game loads, there may be a free life-line heart which you must grab before the loading has finished (if you want to!). You also must try to free all of the little blue guys (in some or all levels) in order to gain all three trophies for each game room. Overall, from a Rayman lover, I think this game is worth the buy, especially since I was able to get it 75% off (special sale).

Once you beat certain levels and reach a certain level of collectibles, levels unlock that are tougher than the main campaign for those seeking challenge (they usually have time limits which require perfect control or else you will not reach the goal).  The steam version also has the previous game (Rayman Origins) included, but require unlocks to play.    For those who love platformers, this is a must-have game."

The artwork is phenominal, the level design is smart, and the music is lively and joyous.  Every character is quirky and fun, even if they're not that different gameplay-wise.  Rayman Legends capitalizes on the simplicity of the platforming genre, and does it in an accessible, streamlined experience.The good:  The game modes.  When you finally exhaust the immense amount of levels, there is still more to do.  You can play a surprisingly intense round of Kung Foot, which is soccer meets the Matrix.  You can play some levels from the previous games.  You can also do some challenges that are devilishly tricky.  Obviously, this stuff was added as an afterhtought, and it isn't as fleshed out as the main levels, but it was a smart afterthought, because it is still quite fun.The bad:  It's an Ubisoft game for PC, so you know what that means.  Yup, you're gonna have to deal with the annoyance of Uplay.  Booting up the game from Steam only to have it open Uplay and update itself, and then slowly clunk you into what you actually wanted to do in the first place, which is play the game.  It's unfortunate that this exists, because the developers had nothing to do with this decision and it's all Ubisoft's fault.  Bah humbug.Overall, this is a must own for lovers of local co-op and/or platformers.  It has a unique charm about it that is unseen elsewhere, and it's worth dealing with Ubisoft's incompetence to get to the reward of this phenominal experience.Verdict:  Buy it for any price, you won't be sorry."

Which is just as well because after a few easy introductionary levels the difficulty picks up. It's all very nicely balanced, though. Levels that may seem impossible at first become feasible and you'll find yourself zipping through them. The feeling of satisfaction when you're conquering another world is a joy.The tunes are memorable. You'll find yourself humming them. The graphics are poetry in motion. Check the trailer and you'll see what I mean.If there's any drawback to this game (I have well over 200 hours playtime in this and my kids (4 and 6) about 50 hours between them) it's the lack of a coherent story.

Although it isn't better than the first three games of the quintology, this title is superior to Rayman Origins and it brings back fourty levels from it with adapted gameplay mechanics and slightly improved graphism, but the return of the RO levels might make the experience feel repetitive.

The Rayman Legends movie was done with Silicon Graphics Computers™ and the instruction booklet says the game's graphics were created with the same 3D computer models used in the making of the blockbuster movie.We don't know however if the game uses Silicon Graphics Computers™. If SGI Computers™ were used, we suspect they were only used for character animations because the backgrounds do not have the detailed quality graphics of Donkey Kong Country. As any good dedicated game-player knows, Donkey Kong Country was created with Silicon Graphics Computers™ and doesn't have edging problems.  Whats even more strange is that  Rayman is the only character with edging problems. All of the other characters look great.One question remains, why didn't Ubisoft use Silicon Graphics Computers™ for the entire game? Were they too expensive? I don't think so. Come on.

Today I decided to reinstall this game  because I needed some inspiration, as I make games on my spare time and I remembered this game as one of the most amazing looking games I ever played, then write a review nobody will read.Every screenshot is an artwork. But visuals anyone can tell how good it is by looking at the videos and screenshots, so I'll move on and talk about the rest of the game. By the way, if you're into art I also recommend googling Rayman concept art and get to know Aymeric Kevin's artwork, the artist behind it.Now that I started writing this I realize I don't have much to say about the game. There is nothing new to be analyzed; you jump and attack through the levels. So I'll put it like this: imagine the best 2D platformer you ever played, it's likely done by a small team, indie. Now imagine if that game had the amount of polish a triple A game  usually gets. That's Rayman Legends. Every second on it seems to have been crafted by a hundred skilled hands and playtested to exhaustion. It's so well paced that at times it's challenging without being frustrating, at other times it's easy without being boring. At the end of each chapter there's a musical level where you run and jump as you do in bit runner and other rhythm running games, and it's so fun I was laughing out loud while playing. Laughing because you are having fun is not something I'm used to. Laughing of a good joke? sure, but it's not the same thing. It's a super nice variation from the previous levels and it does feel like a reward for beating every level. This is something we always want as gamers, rewards for beating the game. It's why we watch the whole credits and absorb every bit of extra content we have. In the old days we would examine every pixel of those static images of the end game credits. I feel like These musical at the end of each chapter gives us exactly what we want. An explosive and fun reward for all the ""work"".Also, it's not every day you see a reboot light years better than the source material. It baffles me every time I remember what the original rayman was like.If that's not obvious by now, I quite like Rayman Legends and I recommend it."

You can probably spend around 30 hours just to 100% the game and around 20 hours trying to complete the levels.

I've loved the Rayman series for it's immersive gameplay and unique style since the announcement of Rayman Origins. Ubiart Framework is a fantastic studio and I just adore this game like no other. The game is quirky and fun, you'll notidce that little is serious about this game when you play it. It's comical and charming all together. Fans of Rayman Origins will definitely enjoy this game. It has a lot more features than Rayman Origins had-In this game you collect Teensies, there're 10 in each level, and how many in each painting varies. In the invasion levels, and other specific levels(such as bosses or music levels) there're 3 teensies to collect. Each level is just an epic immersion into the marvels Ubiart Framework can achieve with their technology. The music is phenominal, it adds dynamic to the overall gameplay and allows the player to truly get into the game, and the E3 press conference mostly emphasized one of the music levels-but it's not just the music levels that have great music. The entire game has a beautiful soundtrack that truly adds to the game's feeling. I only have a few complaints about the game...Some of the invasion levels are merciless and tedious. For one level I spent a good hour trying to get it just right to earn all 3 teensies. The levels are put together awesomely, but the spike in difficulty of invasion levels sometimes takes a toll on gameplay. If you're a perfectionist, it becomes more of a chore than something fun...But it feels great once you do get it just right. The daily and weekly challenges always add a spice to the game, allowing for players to earn more lums for completing various tasks in certain levels, it helps keep things fresh, and it definitely made me come back for more because I always wonder what's going to be the challenge for today. In this game you recieve lottery tickets after earning so many Lums, which is pretty cool-but you can also earn 'creatures' for your creature gallery. I never really understood the creature collection. They supply lums daily, but otherwise they don't seem very collectible unless you just, you know, like to collect them(personal opinion).

I have only played through the first 3 worlds, but they have been fun and amazing. Definatly worth full price, but if it goes on sale, BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!!!"

Legends is Rayman's finest game so far, and the Ubi Art framework is nothing less than a masterpiece of technical witchcraft.

I've since played most Mario, Sonic, Mega Man, and countless other platform games over the years. I have an extensive history with them.Based on that, I have to say that Rayman Legends is one of the best I've ever played.- The controls are very responsive and the gameplay just flows effortlessly from move to move making it your own fault if you screw up.- The art style is amazing and is something I will never tire of looking at.- Extensive number of very well designed stages that are extremely fun to play- Time Trials, Daily and Weekly challenges, and most of the stages from Rayman Origins can be found here.- Musical stages, where you run and jump to the remixed beat of popular songs. I play these over and over they are just so enjoyable.Basically, if you don't already own it, buy it. Yes it requires Uplay, but so what? The game is so darn good, I honestly don't see why it matters."

A friend of mine lend me Rayman Origins and it was good. When I saw on Steam Rayman Legends for sale I bought it straight away and I have to say its one of the best games Ive played. I grew up with 2D platformers like Mario and Sonic, I played the New Super Mario Bors on WiiU but its no match for Rayman. Rayman is in my opinion the best Ubisoft Game and the best platformer hands down. It has so much content - unbelievable. Here you can even unlock the levels from Rayman Origins - so basically you have two Rayman games. The later levels are challenging but not unfair thanks to well placed auto-saves where you dont have to restart the whole level - which is fair because I think I wouldnt finish some levels, or I would have to play them till I retire. It has a very high replayability value and is definitve worth the money even on full price. The next Rayman game I will buy right when it comes out - im looking already forward to it. An by the way, the graphics are cool but the music is just awesome - especially the music levels. Love this game - go get it!!!"
,Recommended,242550,9886477,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,Toby,"Rayman Legends is a must have if you; enjoy sidscrolling platformers, played Rayman Origins and liked it or you are a fan of the Rayman franchise.First of all, the art style is outstanding! I was amazed after playing Origins as it just looks beautiful. Everything is very unique and have very smooth animations with each boss being 3D but looking like they are still 2D.Secondly, the sounds and music are amazing with comedic sound effects for hitting enemies and great music that suites each atmosphere very well.The level design is very well done with many challenging and gorgeous looking levels you won't get bored, with levels filled with secrets normally hard to get to, intense boss battles, fast paced music based levels and difficult time trials. There is also a extra area containing levels from Rayman Origins with the new art style and new lum system.The game also supports controllers and allows up to 4 players locally, unfortunately like Origins there is no online co-op support, although it does have a daily and weekly challenge which has online leaderboards and gives you prizes depending on how high you were in the leaderboards.The length of the game is hard to say but as you can see I have played quite a bit of it and still have not got everything with there being 700 teensies to collect and the addicting challenges you will pump hours into this game, if you do have people to play locally with then there is a game mode called 'Kung Foot' which is a football game where you have a very small area to play with 2 teams. The ball is very bouncy and can be hit all over the place making it very chaotic and fun. Although there is a lot to do once you do it all and collect everything you most likely won't play it an awful lot after although you may replay after a year or so or if you have a friend to play it with again.Some improvements from Origins stand out other than the extended gameplay and improved art style which is that they removed the annoying thing where enemies turned into bubbles on death, although the player bubble death is there which isn't a bad thing. The lums have also been improved making it so the first lum in a row of lums is purple/pink and if collected will give 2 lums and will pass onto the next lum unless a yellow one is collected making collecting the lums in order more important and can be challenging when they moving around. The amount of collectables has also been increased.Lastly, the characters in the game are similar to the ones in Origins just with a few more reskins but also the addition of the princess-barbarians which wield an axe as a weapon the first one being Barbara which each need to be rescued. Although there are many characters the reskins are very minor for the princesses mainly.Overall I highly recommend buying this game it is certainly worth it full price, one problem people may have is that it is run through uPlay which means you need to make a uPlay account as well and can sometimes be a problem for people. I was very pleased with pre-ordering this game for £25 which also got me Rayman Origins free with it."

However, this game is much bigger and more detailed than most of the indie titles. The game appears to be bigger than its predecessor, Rayman Origins, as well. There are 60 main stages, ""Back To Origins"" levels re-playing some Origins levels, rotating daily and weekly challenges, and more little stuff. All of that adds up to a lot of gameplay, especially considering you'll want to go re-play stages multiple times to get the fastest time, or collect all the things.Speaking of which, this game is a collector's paradise. Every corner of the game is littered with collectable items, which the game constantly tallies and rewards you with new levels and characters. There are a lot more characters in Legends than there were in Origins, and they all have their own amusing animations.This game is highly polished on every level. From the character animations, to the visual style, to the music, this game is a joy to behold, unless you're only interested in the brown-grey wash gritty shooters. In a way the game is visually old-school, in that every level has a theme(swamp, fire, etc.), but it's always interesting to see new scenery, and it's all beautifully drawn. I can't tell for certain, but I'm pretty sure the soundrack is recorded with a live orchestra. The resulting sound appropriately zany, but rich and authentic at the same time. Again, this is on a level beyond what an indie side-scroller can offer.The gameplay is fairly old-school as well, in good ways and bad. While the simple, classic controls never seem to get old, the game can also be very demanding, requiring split-second precision. If you want to get a perfect run through a stage you pretty much have to retry and retry, and basically memorize every button press, or every attack in a boss fight. While it can be frustrating, there are relatively few moments where you're bottlenecked; you don't have to grind unless you're a perfectionist.I was happy to get the game for $20 during the holiday sale, and I think the game is absolutely worth it at that price. Is it worth $40, though? I'm inclined to say yes, simply because of the amount of content and the level of polish throughout. This is a full-size game, and it comes at a full-size price. If you can get it at a discount it starts to be a great deal."

With beautiful hand-drawn artwork and polish that is truly unrivaled, the game gives off an immediate great first impression. Fortunately it doesn't stop there.Lead by great music and fantastic level design, Rayman Legends manages to snag your attention and hold on to it for dear life.

It is pricey and never goes on sell but this is one of the few games paying full price is worth. Even if not that into platformers get the demo right away and you will be hooked!

76561197983662248,Recommended,242550,9944933,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: Rayman Origins was a very fun and generally very well designed game, if slightly flawed in certain areas. Rayman Legends is a very fun and generally very well designed game, if slightly flawed in certain areas. It's the same ""old-school"" platforming experience delivered in Rayman Origins, but this time it's delivered just a bit better. Gone are some of the absolutely infuriating and sometimes unfair memorization-heavy levels (for the most part; I'll get to that later). Out of the core five worlds, there were really only three levels that I wasn't too terribly fond of. For a game that has about 40 levels in the core worlds, that's quite good. In fact, my only ""minor-major"" complaint about the core worlds is the implementation of Murphy. It shows that he was meant for the Wii U version, but it's not that much of a deal breaker; just that it maybe could've been handled in a slightly better manner (let's say controlling Murphy with the right analog stick).Note that I signified the fact that the ratio of good to bad levels was quite good in the core worlds. There is also a portion of the game called ""Back to Origins,"" which is essentially a best-of collection of levels from Rayman Origins. Again, most of these levels are pretty good, but it just seems lazy to me to only bring back some of the levels, rather than bring back all of them. They've essentially given us all of the good stuff, leaving us no reason to go out and buy Origins. Much to my annoyance, they also brought back the boss fights from Origins, which are the aforementioned unfair memorization-heavy levels. They were the worst part of Origins in my opinion, but they are not the worst part in this game.That ""honor"" goes to the Livid Dead Party world, which in my opinion contains some of the worst levels in the game. The Land of the Livid Dead level from Origins was easily my favorite level in the entire game, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found that all that was new and Livid Dead related was another music stage. It wasn't bad, but it was still very disappointing. Then... the remixes strike. These are 8-Bit reprises of the music stages that you unlock at the end of each world, with the two primary differences being a lack of checkpoints and an (in my opinion) incredibly stupid and infuriating visual filter(s). The first stage wasn't so bad; it just kinda hurt my head since it was a fisheye lens. The second stage... made me not want to 100% the game, even though I had gotten 682 Teensies up to that level. I don't get motion sickness, but that stage nearly made me throw up about three times due to the godawful visual filter done exclusively for ""LAWLZ RETRO GUIZ."" The rest of the stages were more of the same, albeit not nearly as bad as the second remix stage.Again, despite my negativity, I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who anyone who just wants a pure fun platforming experience. Just stick with 100%ing the core worlds; the rest of the game ain't worth it. For an incredibly well crafted and fun set of core levels, a mediocre way of padding out the gameplay, and an immensely disappointing Livid Dead world, I will give this game an 8.5/10 for gameplay.Story: Skipping this, as the story can literally be told in less than a paragraph.Graphics: Man, I wish Ubisoft would release the level creator/editing tool to the public so that we can do things with it. Then again, maybe it's for the best that they don't; it'd only be a matter of time until the Internet poops all over such a glorious utility. What I'm trying to say is that this game is gorgeous and that we (as consumers) should totally be able to get our hands on the editor to make more amazing stuff happen. The character design is quite good as well, if some of the characters start to look like the others after a while. Despite this, there's a great deal of characters that you can switch between, so that you're not stuck staring at the same character the entire game. For proving yet again that style trumps number of polygons, this game gets a 5/5 for graphics.Music: You can tell that the composers had a great deal of fun with the music in this game. That fun of composing transcribes into additional fun in playing the game. It's not something that most people would want to listen to outside of the game (at least I'd think so), but it's still very fitting and lends itself quite nicely to the ambiance of the stages. The songs chosen for the music stages puts this soundtrack over the top, allowing it to receive a 5/5 for the music portion.Overall score of 8.5/0/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. If I didn't decide to be a completionist for this game, I would've rated it higher; however, the Livid Dead Party is still a pretty large blemish on an otherwise excellent game. Again, the best experience is achieved by just sticking to the core five worlds in my opinion."

,Recommended,242550,14907222,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,{dain},"From what i've played so far, the game is really fun. Though, there are quite a few sections in the game where (assuming you're using an Xbox controller) you have to press Y to control a fairy guy to activate obsticles on the course, and it's a little obvious it was made for the WiiU's gamepad. It's a better transition then you think it would be, but it really ruins the pasing in my opinion, the flow is almost completely ruined in those levels. (Update: It's worked in a lot more levels, but in quite a few he could definitally been left out) That, and the added punishment for people who actually bought the game, and no one else, which is known as ""Uplay"" (A DRM service for ubisoft games as an anti-piracy method) is also used for the game. Multiple people have reported Uplay crashes when attempting to boot up the game, and they have also reported stolen gamekeys, so Uplay doesn't think you actually bought the game when you did, and the customer service is reluctant to help. So be cautious with the software. Currently, i'm unable to get cards and steam acheivements because of Uplay, so that's a bummer. Probably won't go for that completionist because of it. (just saying, Uplay is basically gunlaws for piracy, the only people you're punishing is the honest.)But, with the game's amazing art, controls, gameplay, music, and even a large collection of levels from Rayman Origins, it's definitally worth getting on sale, just in case Uplay does ♥♥♥♥ you over. Otherwise, i'd maybe even spend the 40 if you're a platformer or rayman fan. And it's easy to see that Ubiart put a lot of care into the game, they even added lore for pallet swaps. Reccomended.Edit: forgot to mention the lack of online multiplayer, because ""You can't punch people over the internet.""Ubi pls no."

I would not be the one supporting DRM in my DRM, no sir.I eventually bought this more than half off and found out that there's no option to disable gamepad rumble, and do believe that I loathe rumble.After having muttered some Ubisoft addressed swear words I started playing and...

,Recommended,242550,8686131,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Spike Rose,"Rayman Origins felt like a test. A well-thoughtout game, but a bit unpolished. Legends adds that extra pollish to both controls and art style, although that's hardly what feels improved. Difficulty curves quite nicely letting people experiment and mess around without being forced to progress until later on, and the controls are very responsive (even when used with a controller! Controller mappings are rebindable). The games tacked-on ""underwater"" world isn't actually too bad, more requiring critical thinking than it does skill and percision. Challenge support for this game isn't too unique, I've seen challenges repeated quite often although it was nice to see that I ranked at the very top of Gold-level players. Even if you aren't good at said challenges, a ""ghost"" option lets you hone and improve your skills and learn from other players.Although... I've two semi-obvious complaints. The Ubisoft DRM can be quite invasive before gameplay, REQUIRING updates to its service and making you lauch the game from its Uplay service (I do not approve of it, mind you). My other negative thought being there is NO online multiplayer. Enjoy crowding around your monitor with 3 other people shoving controllers into every USB port you have."

When you are good enough you unlock lucky tickets that may reward you with a random gift such as : a creature, lums, a teensy or a level of ""Rayman Origins"".You'll also unlock time trials levels, where you need to rush to the teensies before the evil foes launch them with rockets.At the end of each world you'll have a boss level fight and after that a ""karaoke"" level.

Only several levels are missing. In this one you'll find normal levels, shooting levels with the mosquito, rushing levels with the moving chest, and last levels with a boss at the end.Finally the online challenges will be required in order to have all achievements and it will take time until you reach the needed rank.

This game continues where Origins left - gameplay and ""story"" alike. It also adds some things to the formula, like your pixie helper you can raise bridges, cut ropes and eat cake. Also you can be turned into a duck or infiltrate a James-Bondian underwater lair. So far, so Rayman.If you played Origins, you already know the new Rayman is a splendid combination of Mario, Sonic and Rayman games in terms of Jump'n'Run, Speedrunning and Wackyness. Legends doubles the fun with perfectly speedrunnable maps, many secrets to find and even Rythm levels. The game is smooth, beautiful and has even more gorgeous soundtracks the the previous title. To the less important additions count a strange monster collecting game and ticket rubbing.Rayman Origins is, in my opinion, the best Jump'n'Run in history. Rayman Legends comes close, but despite the greatness of the levels, the less punishing checkpoint system and the TLC overall, I feel slightly disconnected from the overall story. You can skip worlds and levels and do them in your own order (with boss and rythm levels being an exception) and the feeling of advancement is overshadowed by the ""Do whatever you please"" attitude. It is probably more fitting for a Rayman game, but Legends cannot quite grasp the tone like Origins did it, where the the transition between the worlds was smooth and logical.P.S.: James Bondian Laser Security System can be run through without you needed to stop which felt so forking awesome!"

,Recommended,242550,14907309,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Deuterium the Sentient Mattress,"As of late, the 2D platforming genre has seen a bit of a resurgence, especially in indie games like Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy and to a lesser extent in more high-profile titles New Super Mario Bros. and the like. Rayman Legends, the sequel to 2011's reboot of the Rayman series, Rayman Origins, is one such platformer, and quite possibly one of the best in its genre.Rayman Legends, like its predecessor, is very simple in terms of its gameplay: Run, jump and punch your way through each of the levels, rescuing the small, fairy-like Teensies (who replace Origins' Electoons) as you go. It's actually quite a good thing the gameplay is this simple, because this game's difficulty is certainly not to be sniffed at. On some of the Challenge levels in particular it might take someone many different tries to get past a particular area of the game, and whilst at first this may seem aggravating there's no feeling quite like finally completing that ONE level. Another interesting addition is the Murfy mechanic - whilst playing, the player can use Murfy to guide their character through the level, by for instance moving platforms or distracting enemies, adding a little variety to the gameplay whilst still retaining the simplicity that makes it so enjoyable. There are also additional characters, but the differences are mostly cosmetic and don't change the gameplay, though in all honesty this is more to the game's benefit, since the gameplay is OK as it is, and doesn't really need any different character abilities to make it any better.Also like Origins, Legends' story is barebones, quite possibly to the overall game's benefit. Not focusing much on the story means that the player can divert their attention to actually enjoying the gameplay and uniquer art style, which are the game's main points.I have but two overarching criticisms of this version, however: First of all, the implementaion of the uPlay DRM system, even on the Steam version, which is unnecessary and cumbersome. Second: This game was clearly meant for the Wii U, a fact that shows as you play the game. I thought that maybe the Wii U's features would transfer more easily to the PC, but unfortunately Ubisoft didn't really take advantage of the keyboard ands mouse in the same way they took advantage of the Wii U's gamepad. Actions formerly performed by the player themselves as Murfy on the Touch Pad are now performed with a single touch of a button on the controller, which if you ask me is a bit of a missed opportunity.To summarise, despite clearly being designed for the Wii U, Rayman Legends is the best anyone could ask from a platforming game. It's challenging, it has funny characters, enjoyable levels, it doesn't focus too much on the plot, and most importantly - It will keep you entertained for a VERY long time. Yes, it can get very, VERY difficult, but as you play it, you realise that that's the whole point: Trial and error, improving with every failed attempt, slowly but surely perfecting your strategy. And it's exactly that that makes Rayman Legends special."

,Recommended,242550,13303016,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,Zeream,"Overall, I give this game a B-.  Noteworthy for strong platforming and aesthetics.  Very weak on plot, legacy, and characters.Very fun platformer, for sure.  Difficulty starts low but it ramps up as it goes, and the game feels challenging yet rewarding.  This is at its core, a platformer, though.  Don't expect much from combat and don't expect much from the boss fights.  The platforming itself is spot on, and arguably the game's best strength is its music levels (watch some videos to see yourself).  The visuals are breathtaking and just in style with Rayman, and the soundwork is equally top tier.The platforming, art, and sound all definitely feel like Rayman, alright.  I give these an A.HOWEVERWhile this game looks, sounds, and plays like Rayman, thats as far as it goes.  If you are looking for a Rayman nostalgia trip, I wouldn't exactly say this is it.  Beyond what I mention above, this game holds little in common with its predessesors.  First off, Rayman Legends fails to live up to the tones of the previous games.  The trademark ""grimdark hidden by a humorous and groovy world full of adventure and mystery"" has been thrown out in favor of a completely light hearted and juvenile tone, but somehow isn't even big on the humor from previous games to make up for it.  Rayman Legends is as it implies; its all about adventure, mystery, and exploration, so it manages to keep those at least.  Its not about saving the world or laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off, its about running through various locations while you beat up random monsters that happen to find themselves in your way.  You won't feel much for the characters and they won't inspire you to feel much yourself.  Every character is a cookie cutter of the last; they offer no unique expressions or unique performance.  Rayman won't be offering his snarky comments and you won't get the comic relief you expect from Globox or the Teensies.  Villians from previous games do not make appereances.  None of the additional characters have anything to offer rather than a sentence of flavor text and are cookie cutter skins, and feel quite out of place given the Rayman universe.  Nobody even SAYS anything to characterize them or add any semblance of a plot.  The most plot you get is the order in which you play the levels and the progression between them.I give the game's legacy, characters, and plot a D.Note this game is still quite good, but its sad given that this game is literally half of Rayman; Rayman was known for its superior universe / tone AND its gameplay.Legends and Origins are supposed to be prequels to the 3D games, but since there is no dialogue or plot its highly arguable that this is a completely standalone title.  This dissappointed me quite a bit, since the game's sells itself as Rayman's ""origins"" and ""legend.""  Please keep that in mind when purchasing this product.Also if you are eyeing Origins, don't bother since this game includes Origins.Another thing that might really get on your nerves is that because of the game's target audience, there are a bunch of really dumb minigames that the game is constantly shoving in your face, such as the Monster Room or the Lucky Ticket game.  In fact, in order to even play the Origins half of the game you must play that minigame around 100 times.Overall, I give this game a B-.  Noteworthy for strong platforming and aesthetics.  Very weak on plot, legacy, and characters."

I have no idea why the developers of this game took such time & care on this masterpiece, but I am so glad that they did.  Hours upon hours of absolutely stunning sidescrolling fun.  Will not disappoint.  I wish the demand for this style of game was greater so we might see more titles as polished as this one.  The only downfall is that once you do devote so much time to it that you beat everything and collect all of the teensies, levels, characters, etc. there really is not much left to do.  It was nice of the devs to include 2 daily challenges & 2 weekly challenges, but I'm not sure how long that would keep someone's interest who had already completed everything else.10/10 **********"

This can be avoided by disabling the LAN/WiFi connection on your PC and disconnecting yourself from the internet and then launhing the game. Releasing a game in this state is not right from any company but from the likes of a Triple-A publisher like Ubisoft this is an insult to the paying customer.It also cannot be played in fullscreen on 1080p monitors when using AMD graphics cards without significant adjustment either. As standard this game runs at 50hz in fullscreen 1080p forcing a black frame around the screen. This can be fixed by setting up a Custom Resolution in the AMD Catalyst Control Center.You can also run the game in windowed mode in which case the game is displayed correctly at 1080p and 60hz, but the game does not have an option for full screen windowed either so this also presents the game in a less than optimal maner. Again there is a fix, and again it involves the use of external applications to fix the problems created uncaring and bad developers, you need an application to firce full screen borderless windowed like ""Borderless Gaming"" and ""Fullscreenizer"".This of course is not an issue for Nvidia users, Ubisoft are openly backed by Nvidia and their software solutions, it is only an issue for AMD graphics cards.This is basic stuff and the developers have made a mess of it.

I find it kind of obnoxious that Ubisoft needs to install their own DRM and registration system on top of Steam. To play this game, I had to register a Uplay account and register the game purchased in Steam against Uplay.Update: Uplay seems to have been updated recently to be less invasive, so I've changed my recommendation from No to Yes.

Simple things like not being able to do a charge attack upwards shows how little polish the game has. The running attack mechanic is poorly designed and flings you forward causing you to lose the ability to accurately land after a run attack. You can't ""hang"" off ledges, which means you will spend a lot of time accidentally running off cliffs when you simply meant to get close to the edge.Collecting random garbage is NOT fun. The game ranks you based on how many fairies and mini guys you grab but at no point do you feel rewarded for collecting these things. The fairies are ONLY used to unlock characters which don't have any different abilities or anything unique about them. The mini guys that you find unlock levels but having to find 10 of them per level makes the task feel like a chore instead of a game. Overall you spend the majority of your time collecting items that serve little purpose.Enemies? What enemies? The enemies in this game are WAY too easy. It is almost impossible to die from them as they don't attack back, rarely move, and have such a short range of attack. The game would be more fun if you didn't have an attack button and actually had to land on the enemies heads, at least this would give them a shred of difficulty.The saving in this game is absolute trash. Did you just spend 10 minutes collecting all the random garbage in an area. Well you better not die because if you do you will have to collect all of it again. In almost every other modern platformer I have played the things you collect are saved but you are returned to an earlier checkpoint. Making you go back and have to recollect every item is terrible design. Not to mention replaying the music over and over which is annoying to say the least.90% of the levels are a complete bore and lack creativity.  Each world introduces some new level mechanic but none of these mechanics are really ""fun"". Flying = boring. Sneaking = boring. Hitting Y to move some element in the level = oh god so boring. Compare this game to any other platformer and you will see more creativity in one level than you would in this entire game.Overall the game can be summed with two words ""not fun"". It doesn't hold a candle to  Braid, Super Mario, Little Big Planet and many other modern platformers.  It is a step back in patforming and I am surprised that people have given it such high praise."

It's silly that pirated software works better than this. Would not recommend.Update 1/12 - Have asked for support as of Jan 3 and no reply yet from ubisoft so there's also that. Also, I understand that this review has nothing to do with the game. I'm sure it's a great game, but the fact that the game is unplayable for me makes me unable to recommend it to anyone.Update 1/15 - Received support yesterday after 1 week + of waiting and after about an hour of trying their methods I gave up. Ended up just pirating the game and it ran perfectly. After a few hours, I'd say this game is pretty fun and it is deserving of the positive reviews. I however still can't recommend this for the PC just because of gamebreaking drm.Update 3/10Finally finished this game without ever using the official stuff. Overall, it's a great game but having to install a pirated version just to play it is pretty lame."

Origins, the predecessor to this game, had a clear focus design wise and simple world progression. Legends has needlessly complicated things by adding fluff that distracts you from the juicy core of the game, much like what hats do for Team Fortress 2. Scratch cards, leader boards, animals, and a currency system based on lums (glowing flies you collect in levels). Couple this together with the dodgy adaptation of Wii U tablet stuff made to work with controllers and you end up with a game that is a bit of a mess. Legends would be a much better game if Ubisoft just trimmed off the fat. But the joy found in Origins is still here under all this pointless flubber.

This game saw the limbless hero of many games in my childhood return to his platformer roots. The game was visually stunning and challenging with a superb soundtrack to boot.And now we have Rayman Legends. This game is quite literally the logical next step for the reboot of this franchise. It still has the cartoony visuals, but this time it looks like you're watching a moving painting instead of a colourful cartoon. The level design is top notch and can be very challenging at times (which led to frustration in my case. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing as it made overcoming these obtacles that much sweeter) and oh my God is the soundtrack even better than the last one. Everything just breathes atmosphere and polish and the attential to graphical detail and the interaction between what happens on the screen and the music/sound design is nothing short of a victory in game design. Well done.So, for a fair price you get a whole plethora of levels set in different worlds, loads of collectibles, online rankings (with daily and weekly challenges) and a host of levels from Rayman Origins with updated visuals.In short: best platform game in recent memory.

Okay then.Rayman Legends is the best platformer of this decade. Everything in it has such a touch of affection and detail that it constantly wows the player with it's unique style. Common background elements could have been hung in an art exhibit, enemies interact and animate in a variety of ways that boggles the mind that a team of animators took the time for such a trivial thing. And its platforming is exceptionally tight. The game ramps up in its difficulty in such a way that near the end you're more than prepared for its Lost Levels echelon of difficulty. It hearkens back to the older days of platforming, while at the same time discarding old standards like lives and poor checkpointing. It's constant fun, not tedium. Rayman Legends is what a modern Mario game should have been, and it surpasses the old bastions of platforming on every front.And the music, sweet potato the music. When this game rolled out its series of trailers I was worried that it was just rehashing the songs of the previous title. But no, no no no. Another clever rouse on their part. There was a moment, I think around the third world, where I just had to put the controller down and appreciate how they had integrated the music into the stage. It's that good. In Origins the special stages were exceptionally difficult, particularly the Tricky Trunk levels. While Legends is no cakewalk, the trunk levels have been superseded by musically timed levels. It's understandably strange to jump and hit to the tune of Eye of the Tiger, but not unwelcome. But there's more than just those special stages, there's a huge variety of levels that leave the player with a myriad of options, all fun. There's a Gradius clone with mosquito mounts, time trials, wall running, a whole host of others.There are criticism, and if you've made it this far into this recommendation I guess I could give them to you. The game has the same problem as its predecessor in that once you've collected all the baubles and creatures, there's really nothing else for you to do than the multiplayer stuff or to farm for days to unlock a skin for your character. Once you complete the main story, all that's really left is tying up loose ends, and it feels a little lacking in reason either than tying up loose ends in this game is still quite fun. Also, the introduction of touch based gaming in the series has been replaced by button prompts. Unless you're playing on a system that utilizes the touch, then some of the Murphy levels feel cheating, as entire swaths of gameplay get replaced by hitting the Y button.But these are minor peeves. The game is still fun. It's a labor of love, and it shows it, bleeds it. I think, if you have the opportunity, that Rayman Legends is really worth your time."

The story is... well it's ok. I liked the first storyline way more but this is still ok.One thing i really think Ubisoft need to look at is ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING HACKERS IN CHALLENGES!Sure they sometimes get banned but not all of them and this really grinds my gears.Other than that, it is just a pretty well made sequel to Rayman Origins with similar style but there are more levels and the graphics are a little bit more detailed. It also introduces a new character; Barbara.A small thing that annoyed me is that Xbox One controllers are not supported and only Xbox 360.So you will need something like Xpadder for it to work.Conclusion:Rayman Legends is a fun 2D adventure game that most people can both play and enjoy.I will give it 8.5/10."

This was originally a Wii-U game, utilizing the touch-pad on the Wii-U for certain segments of the game. In this PC port, these segments still exist - rather than redesign the level to be more fun platforming sections, instead they ham-fistedly added a ""press Y to do a thing"" function that makes these sections occasionally fiddly and tedious.Other than that, this is more of the same (quite literally, as a good few dozen of Origin's levels make it into this one too as a bonus).

I would definitely consider this a huge step up from Rayman Origins, which is also a pretty phenomenal game, though I think this game makes Origin obsolete since it includes unlockable remastered Origin levels.A side note, the pop culture references this game makes are pretty amusing. The swimming levels are pretty much a throwback to Crash Bandicoot: Warped's scuba diving levels (too bad they control just as badly with a keyboard though, but tbh I haven't really seen that many ""aqua combat"" sequences in games that were actually fun).

The mechanics have been changed for the better in my opinion combine that that a large amount of level from Origins are in this game, all of them redone with the new mechanics, makes me feel ripped of for having paid even more for Origins than I did for this game during the Steam Holiday Sale. Presentation is fantastic and even though I have not unlocked one yet, I played one of the music levels which was fantastic, like Bit Trip Runner but with Rayman Art and Rock music and some very good level design. For the masochists, the games levels progress to what i assume are insanely hard with a 6 skull rating. For the collectors, every level has two sets of trophies to earn more Teensies, which is effect is the currency used to unlock more levels, along with Lums which is the currency you earn in levels and other places that are used to buy new characters, and even on top of that there is an awesomeness ranking which I forget how you earn, but is used to unlock daily chalanges, of which there are up to 4 each day where you compete with poeple all over the world to see who is the best, and as you can figure these levels are different every day. Though similar to other levels already in the game, it still incrases the overall content and replayability of this game. For someone like who play it very casually, you can still run into the same problem that I ran into with Origins which was that I reached a point at which i had to redo previous levels to unlock more levels. This is less annoying in Legends because there are multiple story arcs, and so it means i wont feel as bad not finishing the game as I did with Origins because I wanted to finish the story. In the end the game is wonderful and gives you many ways of earning progress, including the reaffle mechanic (even though the interface for it was clearly made with the Wii U in mind)."

I played it with a friend who never plays any games and we both had fun- find another platformer that can say that; it is a challenging game if you want it to be, and a very enjoyable ride if you don't.

The music is great and the stages are just gorgeous, honestly I didn't think they would top some of their over the top levels in Origins but they made those look mediocre by comparison. Not to mention how every world end with a musical level is just spectacular.Story:The story is just as confusing as last time, you know what it hard to even gather a story. Who cares! Bad guys are doing bad things, platform your way to victory and stop them! It work for Mario after all.Gameplay:Fast pace platforming that goes from easy to insanely difficult. But despite that there will never be a point you just say enough. You want to keep trying for the better score or fastest time to complete a stage. With the addition of a daily/weekly challenges, you can compete against other people for the fastest times or biggest score.Sound:Some of the best music I heard in a game. Honestly I could listen to all the songs from the musical levels of each world all day long.This games does what a sequel should do, top the prequel. In fact it relish in it by letting you go back and play the classic stage from each world in Origin.

This game and all of the wunderful characters bring me back and make me feel nostalgic though I'm only in my early twenties :p. There is loads to do and lots and lots of characters to play as you unlock more and the levels get harder as you progress sometimes annoyingly hard but it makes it great once you master a way to beat the level.  The game works with controllers aswell like I play with an Xbox controller and it works great. I've only played 3.5 hours or so but I am loving it so far.

It refines the way Rayman Origins handled, resulting in a much more satisfying game to play than the occasionally slippery original. Honestly, there's little to criticize - Rayman, as a series, has an infectious optimism and joy, and Rayman Legends has it in spades; the music, characters, collectables - everything contributes to an atmosphere of happiness and fun. The only problem is that it's a game developed for the Wii U. And, nothing against the Wii U, the unique control system that influenced a lot gimmicky levels in this installment does not translate well to PC. Neither does Ubisoft's proprietary Uplay system, which is insultingly tacked on and is required to be open to play.Rayman Legends is, thankfully, a game awesome enough to overcome being a Wii U ex-pat and a Uplay software.

The platforming itself is pretty tight, and a lot of the later levels don't allow much room for error.The game gives you a lot to do, including invaded (read: speedrun) versions of every level, daily and weekly challenges (for online bragging rights, mainly) and rankings on both lums and teensies collected. However, with a reasonable amount of skill I was able to 100% the game in about 20 hours."

I really recommend a controller.That out of the way: WOWEasy to pick up and play -  had a stressful day? Play one or two of the music levels and you'll feel releaxed and calm.Want a challenge? My controller has toothmarks from some of the time trial levels which get unlocked later on.But still the game is never unfair or discourages you so you just keep coming back until you get that sweet sensation of finally beating the level. And when you have you can go to the daily challenges and compete against other players.One thing I like to point out is the level design. Especially in the music levels but also in every other, theres a certain flow. You're almost playing yourself into meditation. Rayman Origins, I felt, had to much backtracking so that you get all the lums and unlocked more stuff. Here you have much less lums you have to collect to get a gold medal, so you can just play the game. Even finding the caged Teensies isn't pulling you out of the flow.On top: The visuals are just.... happy. Nothing against dark and gritty games, I love them, but this game is radiating with happiness and joy. In the animations, the background, the enemys. Everything just says: Have a good time - and you definitly will. Solo or with friends.If you have doubt: Play the demo, but I can't find a reason why not to like this game."

Awesome platform that always caught my attention. I'm glad to see Rayman has been remade for the PC.This game has no graphic options at all but it doesn't need it because its a 2D platform with amazing graphics and art design. It's very well programmed and the colors are eye catching and beautiful.The characters in the game of course is Rayman and now you can unlock Hero's to play which feels slightly different then playing Rayman. Each hero has many skins to unlock as well.The enemys are well desgined and some look really epic and deadly.The controls are simple. I use a USB 360 controller of course and the game's physics and mechanics are not difficult to figure out and is actually programmed rather well. The movement is simple and basic but yet one wrong move equals instant death. Game is playable to a 5 year old but becomes difficult enough for an adult while a child can still enjoy the difficulty as the game progresses.The platforms are awesome and the levels are super creative its almost genius. Lots of hidden secrets in every level.There are so many levels to play and unlock its insane how much work was put into the length of the game. You simply cannot get bored but many breaks will be taken.The sound effects are neat. While the music really sells it for me. There is also an online type challenge everyday and one that lasts 7 days. You compete for the Bronze, Silver or Gold cup. Which is great if you like a good challenge.I'm running this game on an AMD ASUS Sabertooth 990 FX, AMD 8-Core, 16gb Ram, Nvidia GT 750 2gb LP. Windows 7no issues at all running this game or any crashes.Yes this game does require Uplay which I wasnt a fan of awhile back but who cares it doesnt hurt anything having it installed just don't use it as a main client. Keep using Steam. Uplay only launches when you launch a game that requires Uplay. After you done playing close it. Steam still records your hours played however Uplay is where your achievments are unlocked and recorded unfortunatly. This shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game though. It's worth the time and effort.I purchased during the Steam Summer sale for 12$ org price was $29.99. It also included Rayman Orgins for 3$ I believe which was an absolute steal. Highly recommend buying this game. If you can wait buy it during a steam event.Overall 10/10Look up some gameplay on youtube just to see the greatness Rayman has to offer. :)"

The music is phenomenal, with a wide variety of excellent tracks, including some that are reditions of songs you may be familiar with.What really got me was the well defined worlds and the sheer variety of gameplay mechanics. It seemed at times like every level was introducing a new mechanic, that may or may not be used in further levels - the path of the game is largely non-linear, with difficulty from level to level having little to do with its place in ""order"".It's most definately not a difficult game, it's a very easy to approach platformer, and you'll quickly learn the ins and outs of what they expect from you. Checkpoints are generally numerous, though the game does spice things up as you progress, there's even levels that have no checkpoints whatsoever and are just a long string of potential deaths - this initially was a source of frustration, but after completing my first level like this I couldnt deny that the sense of satisfaction gained by beating the whole thing flawlessly was well worth it, and I'm glad they had it.It's quite hard to really convey what's really best about this game, and that's the experience of playing it.It's just... fun!If there's a demo out, I'd reccomend giving it a go and seeing what you think. I cant imagine you not finding it worth your time and money though.For long term enjoyment, they have 2 daily and 2 weekly challenges, that are varied in type and setting. While I dont particularily like all of the challenges, they're mostly very enjoyable - the distance based ones, where you're falling down an infinate pit, running up an infinately falling tower, or running across a seemingly infinate level are my favourites, and you'll find yourself rated based on where you stand vs everyone else playing the challenges. You can see the ghost players of other people who have played the challenge who are close to your score, see the markers where they bite it, and generally it just feels solid...Oh yeah, and this game seems to include all the levels from the previous game, Rayman Origins, within the game, so you get 2 games for 1!As for negatives... hmmm... well there's one level left that I havent finished that's hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ though I dont think that counts...Oh I've got one - there's a ""creature"" system, where you collect creatures occasionally when you beat a level, and they all go into a special room and once a day give out lums (the currency - which are these delightful little smiling bug things)  - and the system seems... pointless... you only get the monsters by beating levels, so you've basically beaten the game when you get them all, and the amount of lums they give is negligible compared to even just doing a normal level or challenge.Also the large number of alternate skins for barabara, the female character, are... a bit weird if not downright creepy or offensive at times. Barabara is the character I played as most due to the incredible character design, she's just brimming with a joyful michevious character that really fits the game, and she swings a mean axe... and rayman's kind of silly. But every world you enter has 2 alternate skins for barbara - the first one's pretty tame, but from then on it gets... odd.... There's barabara's that are sexualized (pronounced curves and cleavage) in appearance, and weirder still, when you die in this game you expand and then pop like a baloon - barbara's regular death is fairly normal... but there's 2 skins for her where you get a weirdass panty shot when she dies... it's... weird, man.But whatever, lets just blame it on them being french canadian. The game is absolutely phenomenal and any negatives I've encoutered, which are few, are greatly balanced out by the awesome.So yeah, try demo, get game, enjoy."

A good analogy I've heard is classic Sonic games - everything is exactly placed so that when you're running, jumping, and punching at a full-speed run, you can chain together all kinds of movements.

(A good cluster♥♥♥♥.)It just feels so good to pull off sweet flips while getting mad air. Running up walls onto ceilings and then preforming a sweet ground pound on an enemy below to have an explosion of lums fly into your collection. The art is so appealing, the theming is ♥♥♥♥ing perfect, the music to go along with it makes it feel so cinematic and the bosses are ♥♥♥♥ing EPIC and the game is just so polished that there are so many tiny things added in with the extra effort that just brings the world to life! There is tons of trial and error at times, but I didn't find myself getting too annoyed, or at all, actually. It's a really fair game. It honestly reminds me of the classic Donkey Kong Country series with the toughness of the game. It's pretty brutal at times, but DAMN I need to keep playing until I beat it and get a great score (which by the way, feels so damn rewarding.) You don't have to just play as Rayman, but you can choose other characters as well and as well as different costume sets (oly if you have collected enough lums.)

The music levels never get old and the game has tons of replayability, especially if you're a completionist. It also looks just as beautiful, if not better than Origins.I personally prefer this version over the Wii U, since the Murphy (the green dude you control w/ the gamepad) exclusive levels are a nightmare to play alone, as the secondary character is incredibly slow and is controlled by some awful AI.Keep in mind that there's also a large collection of remastered versions of the levels from Origins. With that being said, if you're deciding between the two games, I would get Legends for sure (personally I would get both, but deciding b/w one or the other is perfectly reasonable)."

He doesn't have a neck or limbs, but that doesn't prevent him from being a platform household name. His first game back in 1995 was full of original gameplay concepts that kept you hooked, despite the game's brutal difficulty. The game was such as succes that sequels followed after a few years. As great as those were, they were subject to the '3D rule' that departed from the classic side-scrolling worlds of old and offered 3D worlds instead.After the succes of games like New Super Mario Bros. in recent years, many platformer series started to explore the good old realm of 2D platforming again, a realm lost somewhere in the late 90s. Rayman did it with the fantastic Rayman Origins (also on Steam, check it out if you have not already). Origins was a welcome game in 2011, as we hadn't really seen Ubisoft's mascot in a while. It was an old-fashioned 2D platformer like the 1995 classic, but also brought in elements from the 3D sequels. What Origins did better than many games in the new generation of sidescrollers, though, was that it also had new additions to the series of its own.Other genre icons often kept innovation limited to 3D games, using the 2D entries to provide a nostalgic feel of familiarity. Origins was different. It was quirkier, more experimental, more anarchic in both gameplay and visuals, while also remaining true to its 90s roots.Building from the same engine as Origins, Legends controls and feels very similar to its predecessor, yet somehow it also manages to feel fresh. What makes it so fun is that each level feels different and new gameplay elements are contstantly added, adding additional depth to the cleverly designed levels. At one point you're jumping through the desert along the beat of 'Eye of the Tiger' while later you might find yourself running vertically along a wall being chased by dragons. For a true fun fest you can gather some friends around and play cooperatively. Too bad there's still no online mode for this.This is especially painful when you notice how big and robust of a package Legends otherwise is. There's plenty of  unlockable characters, which unfortunately have very little variation in both appearance and gameplay. More interesting are the levels you can unlock. Additional levels are unlocked if you collect more fairies and free more Teensies (your friends). The game has new weekly challenges to satisfy even ardent platform fans. The game even throws in a selection of the best levels from Origins as an unlockable extra. These are tweaked just so that you don't quite get the same experience as in the previous game.The presentation is even better than in Origins. While I found that game to be one of the prettiest I ever played, Legends is even more detailed and dynamic than its predecessor, without changing much in terms of Rayman's distinct style. I could not have imagined a 2D game even more stunning than Origins, but Legends somehow manages it. Legends truly shows that there's really no limit to what can be achieved with today's 2D graphics in HD resolutions. The musical score is gorgeous and fully orchestrated. The tunes are a little similar, even when compared with Origins. There could have been a little more variety. Still, this is a soundtrack with a level of quality that most platformers don't have, just like in 1995.Rayman Legends is just sheer fun, especially with friends. While not a drastic departure from the already impressive Origins, Legends still manages to provide a bigger, more polished package. If you can look past the lack of variety in characters or the lack of an online coop mode, there's is simply no better side-scrolling platformer available at the moment. This is the combination of art direction, gameplay and creativity that is rare in the genre these days. Rayman could just have taken the easy route and use the 'retro IS the appeal' mantra so common these days. Instead, Rayman Legends is also a modern game at the same time. Don't waste your time and money on the latest same old New Super Mario Bros. Rayman is where it's really at right now. Sorry, Nintendo, but Ubisoft beats you where you used to excel.9,5/10"

The levels are challenging but not impossible, and makes the right choice to have there be varying rewards based on how well you do, rather than make every level a pass/fail.One of the best parts of it is that there's no real penalty for dying.  Other players can just shoot you, and you're back.  This means that I can play it with my 5 year old and 7 year old, and we all have fun.  Sure, I'm getting most of the lums, but they're having a blast, too.I'm not as big a fan of the challenges.  They're repetitive, and I felt like I was grinding out my million lums by the end.  There's also the problem that there are so many cheaters that a platinum result in the challenges is basically impossible, so it makes it an even longer grind.By far the biggest problem, though, is the lack of multiple saves.  I couldn't play my own game, and then start over again with my kids.  If you want to start over, you need to delete your entire save.  That means multiple people can't really have their own games.

It's such a beautiful game, that looks even better in motion! The world around you feels very much alive, and a lot of sceneries really left me in awe.With its online feature, the challenge maps, there really is no point in ever putting this game down, because new content is delivered on a daily basis!11/10, would waste precious hours of my life againPS: Didn't proof read lol"

It can be rather difficult at times, but always fair at lets you win in the end when you get the hang of a level. And in addition you can play it in local co-op with a kid... Just be prepared to be pwned by the younger one because she'll soon get very good at it (as seen with my 9-10 years old daughter)."

I have currently clocked somewhere around 50 hours and heres why: Over fifty different levels, with epic bosses and fun music levels where your actions must flow with the beat, then they have 8-bit versions of those music levels later WHICH ARE REALLY HARD, dont get me wrong. NO, all in all, this game deserves every bit of gaming love the critcs give it. This game, though short (not as short as sonic generations) was an amazing experience for me."

The whole game is a testimony on how a good platformer should be.The level design, the bright colors, the awesome music and the gameplay are all top notch.If platforming is even a faint interest, get this game!Oh and the music levels that end each 'chapter' are amazing!"
,Recommended,242550,33761974,Posted: 24 July,all,jpsf91,"Rayman Legends is a great 2D platformer that sticks to the roots of the genre, and that's probably the best thing about it: a simple but well executed game. The modern visuals are also great, making the game beautiful to look at, with cool music to boost. There isn't much of a story here, but for me that wasn't a problem. There isn't really something bad that i can say about this game, except that it's a bit short. There's also 40 recycled levels from Rayman Origins, which adds some lenght, even if it's a bit cheap. What i really didn't like was Uplay, because the first Uplay Action was bugged, and i needed to contact support for them to unlock it manually. That shouldn't happen. But overall, it's a nice balanced game if you enjoy old school 2D platformers."

,Recommended,242550,33937976,Posted: 31 July,all,Brianny Bananny,"Played this on xBox and repurchased when I found out it was on Steam. Classic adventure game with cute characters and a lot of material. You can get hours of gameplay out of this. It's not too difficult of a game. I'd say it's easy enough to relax you, but challenging enough to keep you interested. It's a good game when you need a break from being brutally murdered in Dark Souls and want to re-establish your confidence as a competent gamer again. 10/10 would play to recover from being  relentlessly ass♥♥♥♥ed by Knight Artorias.**Also, if uPlay is having issues and you can't launch the game, uninstall uPlay individually from your system (don't uninstall Rayman, uPlay should be a separate application) and download uPlay from their DIRECT website. It's a pain in the butt, but it's easier than trying to troubleshoot via Steam or calling uPlay customer service.**"

Your skills will be tested in a variety of ways that require excellent timing, rhythm, and quick reflexes.Highly recommended."
