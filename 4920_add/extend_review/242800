Keep in mind, I have bought Shaq Fu, Duke Nukem Forever, and even though I  don't like Call of Duty I still bought them to try them out. BUT THIS! This is by far the worst game I've played. I understand that it's being worked on, but more work should have been done before being put up for purchase. The combat is broken, I have no clue what I'm doing or where I'm going, the puzzles that I do find are too easy. You can take damage if you fall from a height slightly higher than your jump. Your gun...is not a gun. Guns kill people when you shoot them and the bullet hits the person. Here, it just mildly annoys them. But you! Oh you die really easily. You can take damage even if your hurting the enemy. You'll see them react to getting hit, they look like they can't attack you, but you still get hurt somehow!The game is unplayable as it is. You get attack often giving you no time to heal and figure out what to do. Some could say this adds a chalenge, but I say if that is the case then it's an unfair one. I'm just glad that it has steam cards so I can get some of my money back.Somewhere under all of the bugs, glitches and poor design choices, there is a good game. A game that can live up to the description the game gives you (the reason I bought this game thinking it might be good) but right now, unless the develepor can get some help, this game is not going to go anywhere."

There are some good puzzles but the game is horribly optimized and runs incredibly slowly on my machine while any other newer game (such as Bioshock Infinite) runs very well.  It was also full of nasty bugs, like never being able to pull a needed lever and pick up key items.  I got it on sale before it came out ($15 instead of $20) and I still feel like I overpaid/was ripped off.  The gameplay was very linear and the ""survival"" aspect ended up just being plain annoying/non existant.

Ilikelovebeards.Long version:Alright, so as you've seen from the reviews, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I honestly bought this game because I thought I could find genuine interest for it, but I wasso wrong. Even for $0.99, this game isn't worth it. This game literally is competing for bottom place with Bad Rats- it's THAT bad. Allow me to go into further detail-Music- There is little to none throughout this game. I started the game and noticed it from the get-go. There is a GIANT lack of music and it really ruins the mood for the game and ruins the playthrough for me because it's not nearly as dramatic as they wanted it to be. For instance, you'll start the game and soon after the temple you are in will start to collapse, but instead of crumbling noises from debris, it's just dead silence as you only hear you own footsteps. It's so lack luster and I think the game would be more enjoyable with more music in it.Frame rates- This game is just horrible with it. Max settings on a GTX 950 doesn't even manage to get 60 FPS when I'm outside that temple....thing....whatever it is.... It's just so horrible. Low settings still struggles to keep a steady framerate, especially when outside and combat is involved. Combat is also clunky as hell, but so are the frame rates. Heh. This game is just so unoptimized, like, it's not even funny. There have been several updates claiming to have ""optimized"" the game, but those patch notes are lies. These developers lied to my face by saying they optimized their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for my sexy hardware. Bottom line, the framerates are bad/borderline unbearable even if you have a gaming computer.Animations- Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the animations are HORRIBLE in this game. Animations really don't flow at all, for example, at the start of the game you're introduced to our character (actually, you aren't, he's just shown sitting in his chair with no introduction whatsoever) and he appears to be pulling a ""Max Payne"" and has drugs, beer, pills, etc around his desk. He then proceeds to pick up his beer bottle and he (I think) starts to bring it to his mouth, but ultimately fails and tips the bottle upside down (without spilling ANY beer) and putting it to his chin. No drinking sound effects or anything, he just sets the bottle down and the game transitions into the next place- which is what I'm going to talk about next.Transitions- my literal reaction to various transitions: ""Wait, what?""   ""Ummmmm, how does that even work?""  They're so out of place and don't work at all with the story line. Going back to that whole ""Beer bottle that he drinks from his chin"" part in the introduction, the transition to the next scene is absolutely hilarious. So, he's drinking (?) his bottle from his chin and he gets some sort of transmission from his radio and it mentions something about his warehouse. Soon after, the camera zooms into the window and then severely cuts to a random shot of our protagonist in a plane to which a volcano explodes- sending him hurdling towards the ground with a blown engine. Soon after the volcano explodes and he's hurdling towards the ground, a box in the back of the plane starts to glow a blue glow and it makes a portal to which Garry (the protagonist) goes through forcefully. This begins the storyline, where he wakes up in the middle of a forest; being dragged by some tribal natives to some place. He faints and wakes up again in a temple; hearing a native with a sword sing some ritual and plans on stabbing him for some sacrifice or something. THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO GET INTO, BECAUSE THIS STORY MAKES NO ♥♥♥♥ING SENCE AT ALL. So as you can see, the transitions make 0 (zero) sence.Conclusion- If you thought about buying this game- don't, please, save you money. Even if it's for $0.99, don't buy it. These developers don't need to be supported and get more money to make another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for us. Even if you're going to buy it ""for the lulz"" please, just please, help some starving kid in Africa instead. It's more beneficial than this cancerous game.Review is STILL accurate as of 3/25/2016"

Then i got to the point where there was enemys and then all hell broke loose. i had great FPS but the AI were effing impossible to kill. i died hundreds of times trying to kill 1 ai. Also the game was so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy that i would glitch out when i was in any kind of building. i could be point blank with an ai and not hit them with the sword. I thought this would all be fixed because well it was a new game at the time and normally they release big patches and stuff gets fixed. INSTEAD the devs were like f*** it lets release patches that mess up the game even more. About 3 patches later my game completly stopped working  like the game would crash on launch it would crash when i hit play. it wasnt fun and then the best part was that it deleted my save file. ALL hours i spent playing this game were wasted i lost that time in my life and it wasnt even good time spent. Great games such as any of the ARMA games rock and i dont mind playing it whatso ever. now there is ONE good thing about this game. the whole story of the game (the concept of gary flying his plane into a deserted island was cool) this game was more like a massivly suckier single player version of the tv series Lost. all in all this game should be pulled off of steam and please never buy this game. you will regret it.

I was very interested in trying out this game the concept is great; the final product, not so much.Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst games I've ever played, the opening cutscene; the part that is meant to encapture the interest of the player is riddled with glitches. It begins with the protagonist blubbering like a baby to some guy who didn't know if he wanted to stand up or sit down, stand on the desk or stand IN the desk. I was willing to overlook the awful animation and unforgivable glithy-ness if the gameplay was at least half decent.But unfortunatley the gameplay turned out to be so dull that it makes smashing your face into a wall seem like entertainment. Don't be fooled by the trailer, the combat is... how can I put this... glitchy, no that's not it... terrible? Nope, that's not it either. I suppose the only real way to describe it would be ""S**T!"".  The game begins with the player being dragged off to some temple to be sacrificed by some locals who are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that your helicopter crash landed into their friends, killing EVERYONE involved (other that you of course), you are then thrown into the worst combat that I've ever seen in any game, ever. Enemies seem to be able to attack you even though they clearly have a bad case of advanced rigormortism, I thought that they were zombies at first but alas, no, it's just more awful animation.My advice is to save your money and play something else. At least until the developers can admit their mistakes and put some effort into making this game playable."

So, what's on the menu with this comedy of errors then? Well, floating half-naked tribesman/woman, monkeys that appear to be on acid running aimlessly round and round in circles, cut-scenes that look 15 years old, voice acting that sounds like it was recorded by the most boring man on earth and combat so poor you'll actually laugh when you kill something. (trust me you will). One minute you're alive the next minute you're dead and often with no explantion at all as to why.Even if this game wasn't bug infested, it would still be fit only to cheer you up after a bad day at the office, because it will make you laugh at least, sadly for all the wrong reasons.

The crafting and survival system is about as in depth as farcry 3. The combat is terrible, guns don't sound anything like they should and melee is clumsy. Day one looks and plays like a game released 7 or 8 years ago. The story from the beginning cutscene is almost non existant, read the plot on the product page to have any idea what is going on. As for variety of enemies we have panthers, evil tribals and monkeys throwing rocks, avoiding spoilers there is on more type but nothing exciting.

One day, whilst out flying my light airplane, a, er...I think it was a volcanic eruption or something...causes my plane to crash in an apparently uncharted - though presumably close to home - jungle. I wake up from unconsciousness to find myself being dragged by ""savages""/cannibals/guys in fancy dress to an unknown destination. I again fall unconscious and awaken once more to find myself tied down to a sacrificial altar, with some joker about to stab me in the heart with what I guess, given the circumstances, must qualify as a ""sacrificial"" knife.Not tied down very WELL, fortunately, as I easily break my bonds, grab a weapon and enter into a brief but awkward (but swiftly victorious) ""combat"" with my would-be murderer. There is a native girl nearby in chains...my character briefly ponders aloud in a Duke Nukem-esque voice whether he should save her - thereby perhaps further risking himself - or leave her to her fate. I choose to split the difference, and murder her in cold blood with a swift slash of my knife. Garry has no time for sentimentality, he has some serious drinking to get back to...but first, he must of course return to civilisation.I begin to search around the huge temple area, and find two fruit-like objects on the ground...I attempt to pick them up. Wondering why I do not seem to be having any success, I suddenly realise that they have been inside a BARREL all this time - or did the barrel just come crashing from out of the thin air above to magically envelop them? It certainly seemed that way. No bother. Garry will not be hampered by any mere barrel, so he smashes it to smithereens and ""obtains"" the mangos. The Gods can do their best to hide mangoes from Garry, but Garry laughs at the Gods and their petty whims...if Garry wants mangoes, so Garry shall HAVE mangoes.And so I continue searching about the grand sacrificial hall, and find only a pair of double doors which not only refuse to open, but indeed refuse to even be acknowledged in any noticeable way, shape or form. Just decorative, then. So be it. There must, however, be a way out of this wretched place, with its high ceiling and burning braziers and cleaved-in-two bodies casually scattered across the floor like so much spilled milk in a share-house full of slackers.But what is this curious writing upon the walls? No, not writing...cave drawings...telling me I must cut some chains on some suspended braziers in order to get two eyes to light up on an Easter Island-style stone head. Of course! Why had I not thought of this before!! Foolish, stupid Garry. Two broken chains later, another Easter Island refugee slides aside and a way out is revealed. Garry can practically TASTE the freedom in the air! We press on...There is another savage up ahead, with his back fortunately turned to me. I am informed by the on-screen gaming Gods that I can perform a sneak attack by pressing ""CTRL"" and edging forward, then pressing ""E"" when I reach my quarry. I accomplish this, effortlessly but bloodily, by apparently placing my knife to the front of his throat and pushing inward (no ""slashing"" or ""slitting"" required). Who are these strange men, with throats as soft as butter? I have not the time to ponder, as I must press on as always...A room, with three buttons with symbols on them. There are large amounts of intricate ""writing"" on the walls about them. A time-consuming puzzle, perhaps, for Garry to decipher? No heed, I shall simply press the three buttons, left to right...SUCCESS! No devious puzzle shall prove a hindrance to Garry. And what is this? A strange object has appeared on a nearby stone, near to where I have recently picked up a flintlock-style pistol. It is a magical armband, which Garry, having no need for trial nor error, is extremely quick to realise; so of course, he tries it on. It glows with an ethereal energy! A new weapon, it seems...But no rest for the wicked, as the whole temple begins to crash down around Garry's feet! Alas, I am too slow, and soon enough find myself trapped within a multitude of fallen stone blocks which, in spite of failing to kill me, have effectively trapped me to the point where I have no choice but to restart from the last save point. Such is life.The second time around, Garry manages to avoid being trapped or crushed by falling debris, and even manages to casually shoot a fleeing savage in the back as he, like Garry, can do little but helplessly run for dear life. We emerge, at last, into the open air of the jungle! Not home and hosed yet, Garry. Indeed, it is only seconds later that, erm, SOMETHING occurs - there is some vague semblance of a scuffle, and now there seems to be a savage running away in front of us - ah! The on-screen gaming Gods inform us that she has stolen Garry's all-important FLASK, and as Garry is quick to observe out aloud, he can get by without ""the women"" but he cannot survive without his regular alcohol intake. The chase is on, then, to reclaim Garry's flask!Fortunately, the savage leaves a highly visible trail of stardust we can follow, even when she runs out of our sight. At some point she decides the game is up - Garry is clearly too much of a match for her - and she stops and turns, patiently awaiting the fate which must surely become all who dare come between Garry and his demon drink. The dastardly pickpocket duly dies for her sins, without so much as a fight. She knows what she has done is wrong.This is what befalls all who do not embrace the moral purity of Capitalism and choose instead to run around in wildernesses wearing loincloths. Bet she didn't even know what ""AFK"" means, the brutish savage. No doubt she would be vote-kicked from a bout of Left 4 Dead 2 Versus within two flaps of a butterfly's wings. But fear not, Garry is here now in the land of the savages, and he will cleanse them all with not only the might of his magical armband, but drive his point home with the boisterous cut and thrust of a well-placed and witty one-liner.Alas, it is here that we shall - for now, at least - end our tale of the wondrous adventures of Garry, lost in the land of the savages. Is there more to come? We shall have to wait and see if I could, in all honesty, be ♥♥♥♥ed with this game any further.Verdict: 4/10 (6 out of 10 for sheer amusement value; 2 out of 10 for actual game quality...averaging out to 4. See, Garry's pretty good at math, too...)"

Granted this doesn't work for any of the animals as they look as flat and devoid of any fur detail as your average PS1 game.Disregarding the now infamous events surrounding the game, expectations should be tempered considering it is an independent game title from a studio you've never heard of. Even then, it disappoints.You can do stealth kills on the amazon women... with the same death roar as the men you kill. You can kill every animal in the game with a single pistol bullet (even from the awful double barrel ""old pistol"") yet it takes 3 pistol rounds or 2 M9 rounds to kill a completely unarmored person. Nearly all interaction animations end up throwing the camera underground, zooming in the camera so much you can't see the animations, or having the model clip through the camera. Most crafting is trial and error as even when there are recipies oddly drawn on some rock, half the ingredients are ""helpfully"" displayed as scribbles. Granted all you ever need are bandages and the leather water jug anyway. Lighting is all sorts of wrong and broken... but then again it is an Unreal Engine 3 game.There was a $50k kickstarter for this game, which failed, and I think that explains the game. The kickstarter failed, so the developer probably just gave up and put the unfinished beta into Greenlight. With the absolute zero quality control there of course it got accepted. I hear all but one guy left the company some time after release, which explains the tiny insignificant update made two years after release.Also, optimization/performance is unacceptably poor. I may not have the toppest of the line rig, but an overclocked i5-3570k, GTX780 Lightning, and enough RAM to run a large server should not be struggling to keep above 30 while running Crysis 3 on Max hovers around 45-60 and keeps games with similar-yet-better graphical fidelity to this one like Dead Island and Far Cry 2 well above 100 FPS."

Instant kill, you're fine, it's deadThe reason why I can't recommend this game above all is because of a game breaking glitch that doesn't make any sense to me. When I tried drinking out of a water source my game froze for a couple seconds and I was teleported back to the temple you leave when you first start the game. All i had on me was the wooden sword you get at the beginning of the game. If something in the code caused this (if it's supposed to happen) then that's total bs and makes no sense.

After all the frustration, I decided to come back to the store page to see if there were any updates listed or any dates on when it would come out of ""Early Access"" alpha or beta stage it was in.  Then I realized... this wasn't an early access game.  The developers actually think this is a finished production quality piece of work.  Wow.  That is sad.Collision detection doesn't work.  Damage seems to be broken.  Weapons are unbalanced.  The special weapons you see in the movie are basically one shot items for the most part because they have to be recharged and there is no recharger point.  The blue glowing magic rocks embedded in your arm weapon?  I got it... but I have no idea how to use it and it is not in the weapons list when I scroll through.  I saved the amazon queen only to have her stand up and immediately disappear which froze my screen.  I waited about 15 seconds and then I got control back and it told me that I had cooked some meat.

The sound is cheap and so is the voice acting. The graphics use a lot of performance and heat up the system. The menu overlay is quirky, slow and unresponsive. The combat system is dull. You can kill one of the friendly NPCs and noone notices or get hostile. Everything looks like they stopped developing half way.I'm willing to accept minor quirks when the concept is good and when it was developed thoroughly.

Gun accuracy should be tweaked a bit since I sometimes miss while aiming right for the chest. Other than that seems like a good idea for a game.

Aber Grafik ist eben nicht alles; da ist das Spiel das Paradebeispiel:- Unglaublich schlechte Animationen- Unsichtbare Wände überall- Kampfsystem = einfach draufhauen- Gegner teils viel zu stark wenn sie einen überraschen (aber nicht realistisch)- Wirklich abertausende Bugs- Völlig unrealistische AI- Miserable FramerateMan merkt zwar, dass die Entwickler ein klares Konzept vor Augen hatten, das ganze aber einfach nicht auf die Reihe bekommen haben.

,Not Recommended,242800,14128312,"Posted: 23 January, 2015",all,Goo,"I saw the reviews and thought to myself that this game can't be as bad as people say. The game starts off with a nice intro sequence making you think that it was worth the money you spent on this, but when you get in game, the lack of effort put into this is phenomenal.Pros:- Okay graphics, I'm being modest. It kinda looks pretty.- Crafting, the crafting minigame is 10x better than the game itself. (it gets annoying after the first time though)- There's food. If that makes a change. I guess it's a nice feature.Cons:-Missing sounds, lots of audio bugs.-Missing textures, lots of graphical bugs.-The most threatening enemy are monkies.-AI for the human enemies are not intellegent at all. No pathfinding skills and has an area of awareness around them, making stealth impossible.-The weapons are the following: Bone Machete, Old Pistol (Flintlock pistol), Modern Pistol and a goddamned Alien Wristrocket. The bone machete doesn't do crap, the old pistol is a two hit kill and the modern pistol and wristrocket are 1 shot kills. You are way too OP in this game against the tribe people.-Lack of Explanation. Why did your plane crash and why the hell are the monkies OP and kill you slowly and silently? ( This would probably be explained if I finished the game, I just couldn't bring myself to do it)-Saving is trash. If you're saving to quit and play again another day, you'll be lucky to not find your save file corrupt. You have to play through Garry's Accident in one sitting.-The puzzles are annoying, extremley simple yet take forever to solve.- You have a hunger and Thirst bar but don't worry about getting food and water, they don't decrease because it's broken like this game overall.Don't buy this. I wanted to laugh at how bad this is but I can never get my money back, sadly. I even bought it on sale for $1 and it still wasn't even worth it. Seems like they spent a lot of their budget in the intro sequence because it's just a downward spiral from there."

The deluge of derision this game has received is legendary and I don't want to be party to thosekindsof criticisms.Does that mean Day One: Garry's Incident is a great game? Absolutely not. It's a severely mediocre game but certainly not as bad as other tried-and-truebadgames.It feels more like a demo for something bigger but cut short by lack of funds or time (or both).Moreover, Day One feels like the developers couldn't settle on what kind of game they wanted to make.Is it a survival sim? No. It has a loose bit of ""survival-lite"" mechanics but that's about it. The survival aspect feels completely tacked on and has very little to do with the overall game or story. The survival mechanics are just a surrogate for more traditional ways of healing in other first-person adventures.Is it an FPS? Barely. As FPS goes Day One is clunky, slow and awkward. The weapons are uninspired and only the pistol and the alien blaster-thingy are any good. The other weapons are pretty useless. The enemies areIt is a rip-roaring Indiana Jones-esque adventure? Maybe but the puzzles and traps are poorly designed as to suck any fun the game might have. The traps throughout are tedious trial-and-error speed bumps that force you to save often. The puzzles are dull and equally tedious; the temple complex in the second act, for example, forces the player to hunt down a half-dozen switches to open up the way to the next level, spread out over a ginormous Mayan temple that dwarfs the player that even running non-stop feels slow.Garry's Incident should be a lesson to its developers: develop a focus; fine tune your gameplay; make sure it's fun. This is where Garry's Incident fails. I can't help think if the developers had just made the effort they could have had a decent game on their hands but instead opted to make a quick buck and release it in a shoddy state."

There are slowdowns (for seemingly no reason), long loading times, and this all spells a bad experience without even getting into the poor graphic quality and poor audio quality (yes, I know it's indie, I took that into account).Trying to exit the game after my 47 minutes of buggy playtime was an experience in itself. My system hung on a black screen for around 10 minutes (couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DEL), and my computer was slow for another 10 or so minutes after that with the harddrive being hammered the whole time.

Also, why do dead HUMAN enemies respawn after reloading?Then, the girl you can rescue, which doesn't do anything at all?? And I could kill her the first time. And her corpse was screaming as I attacked her dead body, which..I should blame voodoo for..?So, another big problem with this game is, that when you just want to heal yourself, you have to mash buttons, and the right buttons, and that's annoying as hell. Did it try to be realistic there? Because in real life, you have all time of the world to just bandage your damn arm.Then there was this scene, where you have to duck and attack someone from behind, and you'd assume, he dies with one hit, just like in other games like that, but he didn't even seem to get more damage or anything. He survived as much as the first enemy. And again, why do they respawn, when you reload?!?So, you have to press 3 stone buttons and a shiny glove appears, which makes the building collapse. You take a lot of damage from being hit by whatever falls down at you. And when you want to heal yourself, you...need to do that♥♥♥♥♥♥with the button triggers again.. So, it's hard to get out.I saved right after I took the glove, and..kinda before the cutscene that makes the building collapse.When I reload, I have the glove, but the building isn't collapsing, and I can't get out.I wonder, if there's anything good about this game. In general, it feels like a rip-off mix."

,Not Recommended,242800,9257309,"Posted: 25 February, 2014",all,The Queen and her Corgis,"This game has had so many chances to be updated to a better game, scene as though it was made in september last year, but it's possibly the worst game I have played in a while, and that includes Ride to Hell...Please note that I have only got passed the bit where you get out of the temple and the guy steals your flask but I had to stop playing as it was giving me a headache.  The game starts with you in a temple where you have to fight a man that looks like he was made out of cardboard by a three year old. The fighting is literally F to block and click the mouse buttons to kill the guy.  However, when you kill him, he disappears somewhere (I would probably find out where if I carried on playing).  The fighting in this game, to say it's a survival game, should be intense and exciting, but turns out to be a big pile of poop, pressing a button every now and then.Then you are posed with the question of, should I save this woman?  Because in the game, he says that it could kill him if he saves her, but if you do save her, nothing actually happens to you or her... she just sits where she was for the next year or so.The game tells you what to do but not where to do it, so either tell us what to do, or not at all.  It's really annoying having a survival game that tells you what to do after 2 minutes of exploration.  Then, when something actually happens, for example; you see someone, in a normal survival game, it starts to get really intense and exciting, but in this game, it zooms really weirdly taking all of the intensity out of it.Then we get onto the buugs... where do I start?First off, when I went down into the depth of the temple (a couple of feet down under ground), I found a gun and thought that this was a turning point for the game.  Maybe I could now choose whether to fight loud or go in really stealthy, but no, as soon as the next cut-scene comes, the gun was taken out of my inventory never to be seen again.Secondly, when things start to fall, things hover in the air (again, could be part of the game) but for me, you can't get close to the rocks without there being an invisable wall.  This makes the 'survival' game really restrictive.   When I was trying to do a simple task of walking down the stairs, I couldn't as there was a rock above me.  I tried to crouch, thinking that maybe I needed to, but nope, that didn't work either.This game is terrible and I wouldn't even wish it onto my worst enemy.Whatever you do, do not waste £15 on this game.  I wouldn't even spend 50p on it, this game should be free, heck, they should pay us to play it.How can I get my money back?"

I got this because i genuinely love survival games, even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones. But this is bad. I'll talk about the things i hated first.First off is the framerate. It's atrocious. The settings are not user friendly, and even on the lowest settings, it still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Second is the animations, they look absolutely glorious. Honestly, if you want a laugh, swing your machete around a bit. it al looks like a dead body being controlled by a mass of wrigling fish inside them. Third, is the gameplay. This is how you kill everything. Swing machete, swing machete, and repeat until they comically fall over.  The only unique enemy is the panther. It jumps on you out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and you do an incredibly easy quick time event to jam your machete into its throat. Also, the crafting is also ran by quicktime events, and even they are minimalistc. Finally, its filled to the brim with game breaking bugs. Also the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard.BUT, there are things i liked. The setting is great, and not done nearly enough. A greenery filled jungle is a great place to have a game! The concept itself is quite sound, if not 100% original. Basically, you crash your plane and now have to survive in a jungle full of unfriendly almost naked brown people! of course it is. And the music (the main menu music at least), i have to admit, is actually reallly great!In the end, this is Far Cry 3 if you made it not fun, and added a food  meter. unless it's literally 1 dollar, don't get it. A great concept doesn't excuse it from bein a great game. There are redeeming factors about this game, but they're buried under♥♥♥♥♥♥ Monkey♥♥♥♥♥♥ That kills you. 3/10"

An information that *might* be useful in learning how to play via pop ups, which tend to trigger about half a minute after they would've been of use.  Combat elements are simple enough, but the lack of telegraphing tends to make melee fights a matter of luck more than skill...  And the game in general seems prone to various bugs.I bought this for roughly $1 USD while it was for 90% off... and I'm not sure I got my money's worth. :/"

There are criticizers good and bad. Listen to both. Take action to what they say, meaning improve. You are only running away from something that's faster. I would have enjoyed the game if you didn't so desperately post fake reviews and such and sugar coated it all. Now, you may ban me but you know that I am correct and here is legitimate evidence of my truth.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfgoDDh4kE0Read this and if you want your respect back apologize to the whole community to release a game that didn't need to be over hyped, which inturn proved to be an atroscity to what it was shown to be.

My $7,000,000,000 computer over at NASA can run this game at a smooth 20fps. The combat and stealth systems are completely flawless. I believe that they worked very hard on these stealth and combat controls. The combat is very fast paced and definitaly puts your life on the line. The tactic that always works for me personally, is to crouch as soon as I can low health. This way, the enemies can't hit me. I can then easily run away to the camp. When I do decide to fight, its very difficult and makes my heart race. As long as I keep hitting the enemy, they won't move. At all.Overall, this is a great game.

Its not as bad as the reviews put out. Game only crashed once, and i got stuck under the rocks at the very beginning after i picked up the arm weapon because i did not move right away, and i did not die. but so far quite smooth. hopefully it was just a hiccup.I will complete garry's incident, i just got it despite all those terrible reviews and will give a detailed truth be told opinion of this game from an old school gamer. Downloading now.......i have been playing video games since calecovision and atari 2600, my first computer was a tandy, took 10 hours to program hangman to play for 5 min.And now... On my 360, have been and was the all time gears of war #1 ranked in all ranked matches for 3 years solid. Hope my review helps.ok So far, I have journeyed into the wilderness into some unknown amazon, with crazy lil monkeys and panthers that race out of no where at you. Paint faced tribunal men that look like cannibals, and the freindly villiage people. Garrys Incident is not that bad, I am still going to finish this game, may take me a while as i play mulitiple games, but i will.So far its not bad. I am not sure where the developer was going with this as it is like other games, just an amateur version.Its a wonder that unreal engine is not being used to its fullest potential as i know from personal experience that unreal engine is sleek, with very fast elements for certain games, like Unreal tournament.I could say this would be a great first timer game getting into these types of games i guess as it seems quite hard, But to support a developer for 2 bucks is ok by me, so essentially i just bought a coffee.So far the game is actually quite hard, the crazy cannibals keep freaking me out i tried to sneak up on one but i can not seem to sneak attack, as soon as he knows your there its game on, its like the dude has just gone on insane mode, the reviews about garry's incident should be re-evaluated as i am not sure if people just have a hate on for the developer or not but i am sure these people are hatin cause they die, just like i have been, So if you think your getting ripped off, really your not as i have seen poopier games cost way more, when you think of the time, budget allowed, coding, animations, how many are working on it plus the payout of developers time really when you think about it, its change that he is making in the end of all the costs, If you enjoy games and story lines then i am 80% sure you will see what i see. But for overall grafic's its ok, but not great. i play on the highest settings but still does not really affect the game that much other than clear everything up but still pixels. I hope the devs really appreciate my review, I am quite a critic in life and can not say its as bad as everyone is saying, it just needs a little TLC and maybe some good freinds for moral support. You have a great engine to use there dev, so please use it. I am sure you did not get your education to be ridiculed over a game, personally i got this game because of all the bad reviews, it was almost forcing me to buy it as i wanted to make sure a hidden gem was not being disgruntled for no reason, It may not be a diamond, but it does shine, just needs some polish, plus you devs should also have youtube videos to support this game. I honestly could give donation coding to you if you like as i also used to do this for a hobby, and would even sign a waiver that you have all rights to the coding i give ya, i know legals and do not mind helping out behind the lines with no need for credit in any way other than the fact i could tell my grandkids about it. just not professionally but could have as i did get an interview with epic in toronto years ago when i applied through my xbox360, had no where to live after i got there, plus knew no one so i did not bother, i just kept on lobster fishing and working for a domain name provider.  I did catch the bottle of jack daniels at the beginning clearly labled as it used to be my favorite drink. So cheers, lets make some boiler makers... or apple jacksIf you do not know what a boiler maker is ill tell ya...2 Oz of jack daniels1 Bottle of beer.1 large enough glass to hold all of the beer and the shot glass.Fill glass with cold beer.ready yourself...drop the shot in the glass of beer.as soon as you see the shot glass is on the bottom, takes 1 secchug your glass as fast as you can to empty.....apple jacksyour favorite ice cold apple juice or cidermix with jack #7 to taste mmmmlet me know how many you could handle if you try it...."

Because it's so bad, it's hilarious. It's all in good fun if you don't take it seriously.Now let's get down to business (A.K.A. the first five minutes of the game):You play as Garry, some middle-aged man who flies a plane over this inconspicious island. He's going to deliver some wooden crates. To where? No one knows. A volcano erupts, causing the island to explode, and a crate glows, creating a portal that somehow saves Garry's life. And now Garry is captured by male island natives, and they bring him to this temple. Garry is binded in rope. He gets himself free. He has himself a battle with a male islander that thinks he's a worthy opponent against Garry's bone machete. The islander dies a fabulous death. Garry saves a tribal female. Thus, you begin your journey as Garry.What was the incident that occurred that involved Garry? Who the hell knows?There are trading cards. That means you can craft a badge. That means you can get a Garry-rific background for your profile. That means you can get a few cents for your wallet funds.Chances are you'll get the Garry card for all three card drops.

,Recommended,242800,10045999,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,BergMerk,"After finishing this game, I have to say, that I cannot agree with ANY of the reviews I have seen for this game. Truthfully, I originally only purchased this game so that I could 'experience' it myself, as everyone said it was absolutely terrible and that I should ""Buy a sandwich instead"" (I got it on sale for 1.89 euro), but upon actually playing it myself, I enjoyed it and wanted to go back and play it again as soon as I got home from school. Sure, Healing was a pain as it took about 20 seconds to do, and at one point about 30 monkeys spawned at once and drove me insane, but the game as a whole was enjoyable.There's stealth (Not very realistic stealth mind you, but it felt good to sneak up behind an enemy and watch him/her tumble to the ground), Puzzles, exploration, crafting, food and water meters and large maps to make you really feel like you're lost in the jungle. The fighting wasn't the most exciting thing ever, but it wasn't hard or frustrating either. Once you get the M9, 2 shots and you've killed a guy. One shot for the animals. It allowed me to go through the levels without ever feeling stressed or annoyed, which, to me, is a good thing.Maybe I just got lucky, but the game only crashed once, and there were little to no bugs that I encountered throughout the whole game. I got out of the map at one point, but that can happen in any game (Skyrim being one) and doesn't make the game any worse (Better if anything! Getting out of the map is fun). The game also ran at full fps with near max settings for me so that wasn't a problem either.I know how hard it is to develop a game (I am a developer myself), and so I think they did a really good job considering they're just a small indie company, and it's terrible to see just how rude, disrespectful and heartless people are when it comes to this game. Sure, I found them funny when I first saw them, as I had never seen what the game was really like, but those comments prevent others from wanting to try the game (Myself included), which is unfair to both the developers and the people who are missing out.Is it worth 19 euro? Not at all. Was it worth the 1.89 euro that I bought it for? Every last cent. Heck, I'd pay 10 euro for this game and not feel dissapointed! Again, maybe I got lucky, but I really do recommend you try this game yourself next time it's on sale and see if YOU think it's as bad as everyone has stated.If I were to give this a proper rating, I'd give it about a 8/10 (Keeping in mind that it is only an indie game). It was very enjoyable and challenging at times, with good platforming parts, interesting puzzles, hidden secrets and easy but satisfying combat, but it's unnecessary crafting, long healing times, quick-time events, short game length (I finished it in less than 3hrs) and high asking price (Buy it when it's one sale) hold it back from being any higher of a score. However, I still highly recommend you give it a go yourself when you get a chance."

Sure, it is not perfect, but nothing truly is. I see this to be like another Bubsy 3D, a gem that is simply thrown into the trash by people with unrealistic standards. Not everyone can create a Triple A budget title, and have to make do with the tools available to them. And in this regard, I see Day One: Garry's Incident as a rather fine title. If I were to change only one thing, it would be  to have multiple areas which would load separately, so not to stress the system too much. This simple fix could turn this B- game into an A for me.Don't fall victim to this blackhole of negativity. This is hardly one of the worst games ever, like so many claim. I mean, if it were that bad, it'd have been taken off Steam by now, like so many other titles. Such as Ride to Hell and War Z.To conclude my report, this game is a fine deal for the low price it is at. Just do not expect it to be on par with something like the Nathan Drake series, which I feel this is very comparable to in terms of setting, themes, and characters.Thank you for reading, and I hope anyone who decides to purchase this title will see the positives to it. Such as a nice variety of weapons, a crafting system, and survival mode which I feel surpasses that of Rust, Garry's other project."

Imho this game should have been marketed as early access or released on Desura first (for a low price) instead of Steam.This being said, the game is fun to play despite its roughness.The crafting is actually quite good and it is well integrated into the survival element.The graphics and sound are rough but not horrible, they do the job.The combat could have used some balance and tweaking and just like the rest of the game...its rough around the edges but its passable, it does the job and you know what? I have seen worse combat than this in some very popular games that i will refrain from naming.Maybe because of the interesting setting and very good base idea, the game feels better than the sum of its parts.Given the reviews it got, i bought it mostly out of curiosity to see how horrible it could actually be and to my surprise it ended up being not so bad at all.Its definitely worth the $2 it sells for right now.If i was to rate it based on execution and presentation i would have to give it a 4 or 5.But if i was to rate it based on the fun i had playing it, it would be an easy 7.I chose to ""recommend"" this game for two reasons: it got too many unfairly negative reviews and for $2 it is indeed recommendable."

,Not Recommended,242800,10225685,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,DSK Xiphon,"Scores are at the bottom.Setting:You are Garry; an alcoholic mourning the loss of his family.  One afternoon, you go for a plane ride on business to deliver a few things.  All of a sudden, a volcano erupts, and the turbulence bring you down.  Even though you were certain to die, a strange package activates an ancient power in an attempt to save you.  You wake up, about to be sacrificed to an aboriginee tribe's deity.  You notice that there was something even stranger about these people.  You free yourself, kill your opposition, and solve an ancient puzzle that hides an ancient weapon.  The temple caves in, and you just barely escape death for the second time.  This is where the game begins.Review:Usually, when I see a game with such negative reviews, I'm ever tempted to buy it, just so I can confirm the reviews are honest.  I had just gotten a USD $50 gift card for Steam.  I bought the games I wanted, and had USD $4 remaining or so.  I'm very impatient when I have money, so I had to find something to spend it on.  This game, along with Takedown: Red Sabre, came on sale for USD $1.49 each.  I caved, and bought both.  I will tell you, the time I have in this game was real play time; not just letting it run for cards.  That was just compensation for the time I wasted in this game.I usually appologize or beg to be heard out for giving a negative review, but I feel it's not necessary here.  As soon as you load the game, you notice your framerate drop tremendously, even on higher performance PCs.  After you find a way to stablize your framerate, you begin the game.  You see a dream of your character's wife calling to him.  The dream ends, and you see your character.  It's obvious that cutscenes were a last minute idea for the game.  I've seen more stable animation in Garry's Mod.  Why, oh why do you share this man's name, Garry?  The voice acting is less than pleasent, and the graphics are horrendous on all but the highest performance PCs.  The story is not well put together, but passable.  The inventory system is interesting, and is good in concept, but severely lacking in implementation.  The bad combat system and bountiful amount of bugs almost rival that of Aquaman: Battle For Atlantis.  Almost.  Oh, who am I kidding; nothing is worse than that.  The plus, however, is that the game does have a good soundtrack.  That alone may save it from getting eternally condemned to the less than 4/10 zone.Scores:Story: 5/10Stability (Lack of Bugs): 2/10Stability (Performance): 2/10Combat System: 3/10Soundtrack: 8/10Replay Value: Undecided...Final Score: 4/10.Recomended buy price:  Undecided...Final Thoughts:That was honestly unintended.  I consider a game ""condemned to death"" if their overall score goes below 4/10 (even if it's 3.9999999999999999999999999999999) which is generous, considering most people say that about 6/10 games and sometimes even higher rated games.  I cannot recommend this game.  I will play it again, if at least just to complete the story mode and establish the score for replay value.  If you genuinely want to judge this game for yourself, I won't (and can't) stop you from buying it.  I do, however, recommend that you AT LEAST buy it when it's on sale for USD $1.49."

As soon as I am done killing the last one, another spawns directly on top of me, so I have to kill him too. For some reason, I am still losing health - and I realize a monkey is throwing rocks at me. What the??? OK ... so I kill it too. Seeing a pattern? Finished with my massacre, I save my progress and heal myself. I see a glinting net on the ground and I try to pick it up, but the loot button won't appear. I try with several other glinting objects, but nothing can be looted in this village. I go to the nearby pond to get a drink, and when I turn around, the village is flooded and the houses are blurred and stretch up into the sky like cliff walls. I exit, reload the game to my recent save, and guess what - all those people I killed? - they're alive again (so is the murder-monkey), and I have kill them all over again, except now I run out of ammo.

,Not Recommended,242800,11977570,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,chompmonster,"I had some really high expectations of this game at first, the graphics are beautiful and the UI is stunningly minimalist and modern. I expected an experience similar to 'The Forest', but with more variety and a story-driven plot.As soon as the game starts, things start to go downhill. From the beginning scenes in the tutorial we are shown an almost offensively problematic portrayal south american natives through a very white colonialist lens and rather than attempting the pretence of mocking and subverting damaging stereotypes (A la Far Cry 3, whose claims of the writers are dubious but visible) we are sincerely subjected to scenes of mystique sacrificial ritual and what I can only assume is supposed to be a portrayal of some kind of ""Voodoo""/Black Magic (Y'know given my experience of the game so far I'm actually going to go ahead and say 'Aliens'. I haven't ventured far enough into the game to learn if I'm right and if there's a god or some kind of benevolent demon I can sell my soul to I never will).Being an obviously superior drunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, of course you overpower your captors (THROUGH A SERIES OF QUICK TIME EVENTS 0^0 SPOILER ALERT QUICK TIME EVENTS ARE USED FOR ALMOST EVERY ACTION IN THE GAME, IF YOU HAVEN'T READ LITERALLY ANY OTHER REVIEW HERE TO LEARN THIS ALREADY) and escape into the rainforest using your superpower of hardened-drunk-white-guy-who-needs-a-drink (It's almost a little noir. Almost. Imagine Max Payne as a bush pilot, except without the writing and characterisation). The first thing that happens as you enter this apparently undiscovered world? A native steals your flask! You must give chase, the end to which is a stretched skin canvas with vague pictorial instructions drawn on it. The native who stole your flask is willing to trade it back to you if you find her... something? It was forgettable and largely irrelevant. I don't even care any more but I would sure love some of whatever was in that flask, I need to purge my memories of having tried this. I can't even be bothered writing anymore of this review. Oh my god it's awful. It is so bad, the crafting is pointless, the plot is lurid, the voice acting hammy with little to no characterisation to speak of in addition to the game largely just being offensive.I thought at ~$1.00 on sale I would receive a game that was playable, maybe a little fun and the bad reviews were hyperbole, but it is just tortuous and incredibly poor taste. The positives? The visuals really are quite good, like AAA quality, the games artists and visual designers should be applauded; it's such a shame they were wasted on such an incredibly poor title. Seriously, if the technical gameplay faults outlined in the other reviews aren't enough to steer you as far away from this title as possible then let these warnings guide you instead.Maybe next time I black out drunk I'll revisit this for some laughs and be able to pass out thinking that Day One is a metaphor for how every shiny promising thing that happens in life somehow turns to♥♥♥♥♥♥Now I must get back to writing my thesis, I can't even bear to use this for procrastination material."

In fact it's so good that if you play it you'll kill yourself from want of something more in your life due to how terrible the greatness of Garrry makes it all feel in comparison. This game gives you enlightenment on a cosmic level and shows you the very essence of the universe. But take heed, stare too long into the void and the void begins to stare back. The Lovecraftian horrors that this game brings to life are far worse than any mans vision of hell and the only thing that will awknowledge you in the end is your own bitter soul. In the end the universe will make you it's plaything like a cat with a mouse. Everyday will be a waking nightmare and the only serenity will be the brief hours you are allowed to sleep. Eventually you either give in to the madness and let your actions reflect the derelict state of your withered psyche or let it all slowly eat away at your soul. The things I've done do not deserve forgiveness nor will those who I've hurt even think of me as anything more than the monster that I am. I yearn for death but it will not come. I am in my own hell and every day is another chunk of my hollow humanity left to rot in my undying carcass. Death will not come to me, I do not deserve it's sweet release.Avoid this game. Avoid the siren's call!10/10"
