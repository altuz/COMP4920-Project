,Recommended,242820,9739959,"Posted: 5 April, 2014",all,YellowLab,"So, what is 140? It is a minimal, abstract platform game. Aside from that, it is a really cool platform rhythm game. The levels start out ""simple"" the music isn't too complicated. As you get to checkpoints, more complex rhythms are put into the soundtrack and these make other things happen: blocks appear and disappear, shapes grow and shrink, static fields jump, bouncy floors activate, gravity shifts. Paying attention to the music and how it affects the level is crucial to finishing. At the end of each level there is a boss fight. Each level the boss fights get more complex.Once you have finished the game three mirror levels open up. One wrong move and you fail - you must complete the entire level without dying. And all the patterns are backwards. Yeah right.Fun but short platform game."

The mirror levels brings the right challenge to extend the life of the game and you will feel rewarded once to complete all the levels :).

But it's a solid experience with some good platforming and unique, and sometimes even annoying, boss fights.The current price is still a bit on the high side, but if it were a few USD/Euro's less it would be a fantastic deal.[Rating: 72/100]"

If you appreciate the pure gameplay focus and retro minimalist aesthetic of Terry Cavanagh (VVVVVV, Super Hexagon), you will love this. I think it has a stronger use of synesthesia than Rez on the DC for those that remember it, and it has immensely satisfying platforming coming from very careful use of extreme spare level design and timing. The game does depend a little bit on your ability to appreciate or at least tolerate the musical style, since I imagine its a quite different experience if you have to mute it.Really one of the best and games I have played in a long time.

The platforming gameplay is as shallow as one can imagine, your only actions consisting of jumping and moving (always at a fixed speed). Since the whole game revolves around stage hazards following musical rhythms, you always progress at the pace of the levels, waiting for the right time to advance. Boss fights are a little more interesting for deviating from the main game in different ways, though you are still a ""slave"" to the game's music-based mechanics in those.Oh, and you can beat the main game in around 1 hour. It's like, three stages long, and after the end you can replay mirrored versions of those same stages without checkpoints (you can't get much lazier than that with hard modes). That's about the entire game for you.There's nothing broken about 140. It's just that it's extremely short, unfullfiling and has as much content as miss south carolina's skull. For the price it charges, you can get way more interesting games around gabe's funhouse.EDIT: so a fourth stage has been added recently, which is nice, though my critique still stands. It's a bit of a shame I can't attempt it in hard mode until I beat the third stage with that total bs of a boss."

,Recommended,242820,32793107,Posted: 25 June,all,Zaneclodon,"140 is best described as a rhythm platformer. Controls are extremely simple: all you can do is jump and move left and right. However, platforms and hazards will move in a predictable, rhythmic way, requiring you to move with the rhythm to get through. Mechanics are introduced intuitively, with orbs filled with colors moving around in ways that hint at the mechanic they introduce when brought to the hole they must be placed in. As more mechanics are introduced in a stage, the world gets more complex, but never chaotic. Bosses are also connected to the rhythm, and neatly finish off their stages. Checkpoints are placed far enough apart to make getting through stages with sheer luck rare, but common enough to prevent the stages from being too hard. All four stages are well-made, and each has a unique feel. The second half of the game also offers a nice challenge, removing all checkpoints to require complete mastery of each stage. Overall, 140 uses rhythm to create a platfromer that is challenging without feeling cheap."
76561198093919303,Recommended,242820,32800293,Posted: 25 June,all,Master Cube,"140 is a cute little rhythm platformer with absolutely no story. And yet, it's kind of endearing. The music is really the key here: everything obeys the rules of rhythm, so that you can generally predict what's going to happen when. But that doesn't make it any less hard (especially when you get to the no respawn levels).The soundtrack for this one is obviously a huge plus, as is the minimalistic gameplay. I can't really find anything to gripe about, except how hard it is in the later levels with no respawns, so I might as well just say it's good and move on.Overall, good game. Would definitely recommend it but just remember that it is very short, probably completable in less than an hour if you're good, so make sure to consider that when buying!"

It had some nice ideas and really couldn't be faulted from a design point of view but personally I found the whole thing a bit boring.This, from the Limbo director however is right up my street. It is in many ways like a remix on the idea of Limbo in that you are a thing, it's a minimilistic platformer, and you have no real abilities to speak of as such, just moving and jumping, but I found it to be an immersive experience with good tunes which brilliantly play an integral part in the gameplay and not only good design but a new idea or mechanic in almost every little section.Admittedly it shouldn't take you more than an hour or so to complete and there's no real replay value there other than the challenge of trying to go through the game without dying atall, but if you like brilliantly designed, short, challenging and immersive games then go for it.

,Recommended,242820,33748435,Posted: 23 July,all,S S Absolution,"Most Recommended Game in My Library!(For now)!This is a beautiful beat platformer that sat in my library uninstalled for 3 years, now... I feel like a complete idiot. After completing Mirror Level 4 I can say that this game is just downright amazing. Levels that move and change to a beat and rhythm. Time your jumps and movement per the rhythm and move with solid tight controls. There is one issue with this game but it doesn't crop up until the very end of the game so unless you're a completionist this may seem like a perfect game in the end.I will get to the single issue I found in this later, as I cannot express enough how well literally EVERYTHING else was done in this game. There is no artificial difficulty, but the challenges will keep you engaged throughout the entire experience. The level design is spot on, allowing the beat and level actions to blend in a seamless way. The minimalist graphics is a near perfect experience allowing you to really get lost in the music. Then you have the music... YES! It is fantastic, for a beat platformer this had to have been one of the most crucial design points, and this delivers in all the levels. As stated before the controls are super, super tight. I never had an experience where the controls didn't respond to what I was putting in.The One Issue: The hit box of your shape is always that... a box. You will shift between 3 forms, a circle, a triangle, and a square. It's kinda cool the first few times you look at it. Unfortunately, though, if you try for Mirror World Level 3 or higher this is going to screw you over plenty of times. Mirror 4 is the greatest example of this, in that you'll need to play some obstacles real close to make them easier, jumping or falling into high precision areas with perfect required timing. As you fall your triangle appears, but the whole square around you is still hittable. So, there are two equal right angled triangles that you can't see on either side of ONE of the points that can still kill you.Wow, looking at it that seems like a long paragraph, but it's really the minimalist of issues. I still beat all the levels and had fun doing it the whole time. Like I said as well, you will run through 75% of the game and never even notice this is a thing, like complete obliviousness. I just want you to be aware of it before you have that confused look on your face like I did.9/10 for this game. Get a potential 20+ hours out of it."

76561198112059304,Recommended,242820,13219801,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Pannacone,"140 is a cataclysmically colorful platformer where you play as a black shape advancing through a set of three pulsating, undulatingly cheerful yet frustrating levels. The game requires you to jump and roll your way through a series of timing-based challenges, all of which are set to the throbbing, toe-tap-worthy beat of the game's Electronic Super Joy-esque soundtrack.Your goal throughout each level is to collect dual-colored orbs and then return them to various checkpoints. Each returned orb causes the level to fluctuate, activating moving panels and changing the game's color scheme. To collect each orb, you'll be faced with moving blocks, grey-matter platforms that kill you on contact, and tricky tests of your ability to time impressively challenging jumps. However, the levels provide plenty of checkpoints, saving your progress before each threat you face.The end of each level features, like most games, a boss. The boss levels of 140 are the only times when your otherwise peaceful shape is armed with a weapon: a beam that shoots out of your shape automatically in time to the music's beat. Boss levels are long, creatively designed levels that require you to avoid projectiles while also correctly timing your attacks, making them often frustrating (but, in the end, rewarding) moments of the game.The only noticeable downside to 140 is its astonishing lack of true save points. While there are several checkpoints within each level that you can return to when you die, exiting out of the game entirely will cause your progress in each level to be lost. Therefore, each level must be beat in one sitting, otherwise you'll simply have to start completely over next time you come back to the game.Despite this, the game is both fun and challenging and, if you manage to make it through all three levels, the end will unlock three extra bonus levels that allow you to play the first three levels backwards without checkpoints. This added challenge adds a few extra hours of gameplay—I have to assume, since I've never been skilled enough to play the bonus levels!"

I've always wanted to play something like this after New Super Mario Bros. had the enemies dancing to the music. I thought for sure that an entire game could be built around this concept, and here's one at last.So how is it? ... Well, it's a brilliant proof-of-concept, with interesting and satisfying puzzles and mechanics, but it's way too short. You can breeze through Normal mode in about 30 minutes, and the difficulty is smooth sailing all the way until the second half of level 3. If you like tension and frustration, you can give Hard mode a shot, which removes all checkpoints and gives you one life.But still, this really needs to be a full-length game with dozens more levels and ideas. As it is, it's probably not worth the $5. So unless you're really into quirky innovative indie platformers, better to wait for a good sale or an Indie bundle."

I find it truly a great game and one you should pick up if you feel like getting a semi-nostalgic feeling to old school platformers (but that may just be me being weird). Be wary of the bosses for they show no mercy to all players of 140.

This really breaks the flow of the game.

With no other objective other than moving a ""shape-shifting"" geometric figure (a circle while moving, a triangle while jumping and a square while standing still) through rhythm-based obstacles, it can still be quite a challenge. Although the game's learning curve is pretty smooth, it crosses a rather wide spectrum of difficulty: starting stages are pretty basic, but the ""boss battles"" border theNintendo hard! Added to that is the special mode, unlocked after beating the main game, which requires you to beat the stages in a single take -- failing takes you back to the beginning, regardless of the checkpoints you may have reached during your run. To compensate for that, the soundtrack is a pretty driving mix of ambient electronic music and dubstep, getting you pumped up to not give up.In fewer words,140is a clever side-scrolling platform puzzle with elements of rhythm-based games and even a hint ofSpace Invaders-like gameplay; an odd combination that works impressively well."

In fact, it has the appearance of a passion project coded over a few weeks' work in XNA, and that's exactly why you should love it. (That's about the right origin story too, it was made by one of Playdead (Limbo)'s coders afterhours.)More importantly than any of that fluff however, and the core of this game's experience: its audio design. It won that IGF award for good reason; the music is great, the sounds are entrancing, and everything audio is well-implemented. Collecting items, landing on platforms, and nearing the game's checkpoint-like floating objects are all incredibly unique, rewarding, and expertly-crafted. The game plays well - as someone else suggested, its similarity to Bit.Trip Runner ends at the conceptual: this game gives you more control, and feeds back more information to you. You really do have more control, to take things at your pace, to screw up as you will.The game is short and sweet and well worth the $2.50 I paid. I figured it was going to be quite short, but I've already spent quite a decent amount of time with it (more than my short attention span tends to spend on games) - if you like electronic soundscapes and platformers, you'll like this one.It is very minimalistic/barebones however.

Every single voice in the soundtrack has a corresponding physical manifestation in the game world. This tightly woven relationship is the core of 140, and what makes it so brilliant and euphoric to play.Levels are split into layers or sections, and their progression reminds me a bit of Rez. The anticipation while one layer of the world peels away and another, more complex layer, is put on top. I love that transition!The graphics are simple by design. They are often called ""ugly"", but I find the palettes were chosen with care and nothing grates. Your primary focus is on listening to the world and figuring out how to traverse it using the auditory hints.If you love brutal/precision platforming, this is for you.

The boss battles in this game is also truly amazing. Had a blast with all of them, and I spend most of the time replaying it over and over because I can't get it over with.

Instead of just doing things in rhythm, you need to really grasp how everything going on around you ties in with the music, then move through obstacles using that understanding.  Sometimes it seems like you're not going to make it, but if you've listened well, things will fall into place right as you need them to.  140's minimalism really puts the focus on the music and gameplay as well.  You're never left wondering if you need to pay attention to something.The only downside, as others have noted, is that it's a pretty short game. There are six levels, and the last three are the same as the first three, just less forgiving.  It almost makes the game feel like a proof of concept, though a very enjoyable and well-executed one.  If there is ever a more developed follow-up released, I'll buy it as soon as I find out about it.Overall, I'm glad I bought it, and recommend it even at full price ($5 as of this writing).

,Recommended,242820,7921469,"Posted: 4 December, 2013",all,chromadrive,"140, where to begin... This game is brilliant in just about every regard. It involves jumpy shapes and procedurally generated music.Music - 25/10: Yes, it's that good. The entire game revolves around the music. All the puzzles in this game are based on the fluctuations the music is going through. Everything is really seamless; if you're just listening to the audio and you die somehow, it honestly sounds like part of the song even though it's very harsh static. The music also only progresses when you do, which in my opinion is one of the best things about the game - and it always sounds so seamless when it does. And besides, the ""drop"" that happens when you progress to the next sequence of a stage is one of the most amazing sounds I've heard so far.Art - 6/10: The art style is a bit like Thomas Was Alone, but not quite as nice. It's basically just a bunch of rectangles and circles and triangles. Nothing much. However, there are some really tiny details, like the jump and the level progression sequence. It does have a sort of odd charm to it though, which is why I'm giving it a 6 and not something lowerGameplay - 8/10: You're essentially just trying to navigate your way through a series of obstacles and static-y square things. Nothing too special when considered by itself, but when you add the music to the equation, it's phenomenal. Everything changes based on what's going on in the music, for example, platforms will start moving as a new sequence is added to the ever-changing song. Really, the only negative is that the boss battles are a bit more trial-and-error than actually puzzle based, but honestly that's not a bad thing.Price - 10/10: At $5, this game is a steal. Hell, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay $15 for it; it's just that good. If you're still not convinced, get it on sale when it's somewhere hovering around the $3/$4 range. You'll be glad you did.Overall Rating - 9.5/10: This isn't so much of a game as it is an experience. The music is so much more than brilliant, and the gameplay and art style works fantastically well with the concepts it's working towards. The only downside I would say would be the shortness of it all - it only has three ""stages"", but they're all intuitively designed and great fun to play."

You proceed through three stages, each one a test of your platforming skills with hazards that jump around and change to the beat of the very cool EDM-style music in the background. Each stage finishes with a unique and challenging boss fight, taking advantage of the game's mechanics.You should be able to get the full value of your money here. It'll probably take you about an hour and a half or two hours to get through the three initial stages, as with infinite lives you can get through it by perserverance.

But it turns out you dont need those things if you got good music and a game worth playing. I think some of the negative reviews might be from the games simplicity but the programmers werent lazy, they just knew what the game needed and what it didn't. The gameplay is based off obstacles that are in sync with the beat of the music. The more ""in the zone"" you are the better you'll be able to time your jumps and your movements. The music really makes the game and is best listened to loud enough to properly enjoy it, or at least use headphones because the music really is half the game.

,Recommended,242820,18557098,"Posted: 18 October, 2015",all,Trafox,"Music is often used to set the feeling for a game. In horror games you can rarely be sure if what you hear is harmless ambience or the playable character's sanity (or your own) going nuts. In action games, the battle music vary from epic choirs to hard rock, but the goal is to make the player FEEL the battle - with intense and up-lifting sounds, as if something large is behind the sounds.Rarely music is made for other reasons than that. 140 seeks to experiment other variations, and that it has definitely done well.140 is a rhythmic platformer game where the music guides you. It tells you how the environment warps, either for your favor or to kill you. Every time you catch one of those fleeing, round music machines and drag them to a check point, the world changes. The color theme changes, and the music gets a new addition while enhancing the already existing soundtrack. An another part of the level has now been unlocked, either by formerly static objects starting to move or you suddenly going all anti-gravity. Whatever happens, the new instrument in the concert that is 140's changing soundtrack tells you how do they work. Just don't forget that the music doesn't tell you when to jump!140 was mainly developed by a person also involved in LIMBO. While playing the game, I could really feel the fact when failing the outwardly simple yet mind-bending timing requiring platforming.The game includes three stages with one boss for each. The boss fights are the moments where you REALLY get tested! And if after clearing the game once you still seek a challenge, you might want to try the mirror worlds, where you get only one attempt to clearing each level.In other words and in short, despite the game being short and looking simple both graphically and gameplay-wise, it still manages to bring in fresh experiences with well thought-out design. It's a kind of a game that you have to play to understand its worth.However, as much as I want to blurt out fancy phrases to describe 140's greatness, it's still a short game. One can easily finish this game in one to two hours. But is that such a bad thing? I got the feeling that this game was experimental, and a well thought-out one, if I may be so shameful as to re-use my early wording. The price is also a good measurement of the game's length: the full price is a meekly $5, and every now and then I spot that it's on sale with 80 % off the price.In short:- Simple yet challenging, but still doesn't make it seem like it's impossible- Fun boss fights that differ from usual platforming, even within this game itself- Graphically fluid and simple- The music, along with being used in a new way, is also pretty good 'n catchy!If you thought platformers can not have anything new to offer, that everything has already been done, this game proves that there is still a lot to be done to reach that point."
,Recommended,242820,9652408,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Lyrit,"To simplify what I think of this game, I'm splitting it into two major paragraphs: the first about the game and its first half, the second about specifically the second half of the game.140 is definitely a simple yet charming platformer, and although some may be turned off by such simplicity, I personally find it nice. The graphics, although minimalistic, represent the playing field and hitboxes well (so you don't have any ""that shouldn't of hit me"" moments) and have a nice colorful vibe. 140's graphics are like abstract art, and you'll either love it or hate it. As far as sound goes, the music was very enjoyable and fit the game very well -- up-beat with a strong rhythm. After playing the game, I legitimately wanted to find loops of some of the game's music online. In gameplay, 140 is as simple as its graphics, which again may either be a plus or minus to individuals. As a straight-up platformer, I personally find 140 great: it's not too hard, but it's not too easy, either. 140's platforming definitely takes some practice, but it's nothing impossible, and you really feel like you master it as you play it. The only bit of simplicity in 140's nature that I find disappointing is its shortness; discluding the second half of the game, which will be spoken about in a moment, there are only three stages, and they can be beaten in 1 to 2 hours. Although they're long and unique from another, I still feel like there could have been more stages.The second half of the game is, again, a major deciding factor for what people think of this game. For those who aren't in the know: after beating the first three stages in 140, you can play the ""mirror"" stages. These mirror stages are literally just the first stages again except inverted (you go left instead of right, which makes no actual gameplay difference) and with no checkpoints (meaning you must do the entire stage and boss without dying once). I've always been picky about adding difficulty by simply removing checkpoints, and I feel that this second half of the game is directly on the line of what qualifies as good or bad in regards to this. I stand by my point that repeating sections of a stage that you've clearly mastered is only a time waste, and the mirror stages are definitely guilty of this; however, I have to admit that, upon beating the last mirror stage, I felt genuine excitement and achievement (Get it? Because there's an achievement...?). From the first half to the second, the game spikes in difficulty only due to the lack of checkpoints, and although it can be repetitious to redo the whole stage if you die, it is also incredibly rewarding to beat it. Even after beating all of the mirror stages, I still feel like having more unique stages would be far more enjoyable than just repeating what was already given without checkpoints; however, those with a strong urge to master the game might get some extra time and enjoyability out of the game via these stages. Otherwise, the mirror stages may feel unnecessary as an element to the game.In total, after having beaten all of the game, I recommend 140. The only gameplay I would question is the second half of the game because of its easily repetitious gameplay (from restarting a whole stage over if you die). The overall atmosphere and style of 140 can only be praised or spited, and I, for one, fall into praising it. It was short, admittedly, but it was also sweet."

In Bit.Trip Runner (1&2), music is made by you dodging things in a static fashion. You are making the music the game wants you to make, by playing a ""dodge the obstacles"" running game. In BeatBuddy, the music dictates your movement, and the sound just happens around you. It's just part of the environment.But in 140, the music doesn't force you to do anything. You don't need to listen to it to play the game, and you can move how you want. All of the obstacles, though, follow specific rhythms, set up by specific instruments throughout the music. You don't need to listen to it, or pay attention to it, or count the measures as you play. But if you hope to win, you're going to want to.140 doesn't force you into a game of Simon with a metronome. It presents to you the music, and you'll need to be deeply in touch with it to get through the game. It shows you that the bond between player and music has enormous benefits, and rather than building that connection for you, it gives you the tools to build it for yourself.140 is the firsttruerhythm game in a long time.

76561198141911001,Not Recommended,242820,28966534,Posted: 2 January,all,AlexLoeher,"140 has a lot going for it, however it's let down by a few consequential flaws. But first, to be fair, I will outline 140's principal strengths.140 is a minimalistic platform game where you move your little shape across classic platform challenges. For what resources it has available to it, 140 is remarkably well-designed. You are a square and take the form of a circle while moving and a triangle while jumping. A good deal of the challenges are timed and give you audio cues via the retro, electronic-like soundtrack. The game does a good job of showing without telling, where every challenge's solution is made apparent to you with enough of your own analysis. To this end, I believe 140 is a great game for instruction on game design; every aspect is intuitive and rewards the player without fanfare. However, this point introduces 140's central flaw: as a game.140 is so insubstantial that it harkens more of a tech demo or as I said above, merely a tool for instruction. The minimalistic style is not the crux of this problem either. While such a game made in the early 2000s would have likely been a free Flash game, I could have excused that if the release had a decent level of content, but alas, 140 really only has three levels. Solid levels mind you, but from my perspective, charging $5 for three levels strikes me as a poor investment. The game indulges in fake longevity by giving you three more levels at the end of the game, but they are just mirrors of the first three levels, but without checkpoints. This means that the game's only replay value is just asking you to completely master its 1 hour of gametime.I would recommend 140 if you want to demonstrate to your friends an example of tightly crafted game design or if you can get it on sale, but otherwise, I can't in good conscience recommend a game with such limited content when there exists games on Steam for the same price that boast hundreds of hours of playtime."

A world of stark beauty and remarkable simplicity; the player exists as a transforming piece of geometry - a square, triangle and circle altogether.The geography of this flatland is not inert though. Environments comes to life in synergy with the music - music that is dependent on the player's progress in each of the three vistas. Can't make that jump? Well, the backing-track is probably missing an instrument; escorting a mysterious, floating orb to a docking station will add it to the soundtrack. Obstacles that were previously laying stubbornly static will come to life, rhythmically shifting all the way.Glide, jump, roll, and shoot - 140 is an auditory and visual delicacy."

I have no idea why they named it ""140"". It seems to be just a random number, because they couldn't find anything to discribe their game with. And that's the point. There is no existing word they could've described ""140"" with. Neither I can. But no matter what ""140"" means, important is what it meansto me. And that's where things get interesting.""140"" could be ""arhythm based platformer"", if it wasarhythm based platformer"". But that's not the case. ""140"" istherhythm based platformer. Basically, 140redefinedthe meaning of ""rhythm platformer"". I know that's hard to understand, but putting an indirect pronoun before the description of this game wouldn't be just fair. The game's mechanic isn't any unique, but that doesn't mean the game in it's entirety isn't. ""140"" isn't the only minimalistic platformer, it wasn't the first rythm platformer, neither ""140"" features anything never seen before. Instead the strenghth of ""140"" is combining all those in the best way possible. ""140"" doesn't do much, but the few things it does are done with perfection. That's what I found impressive. ""140"" isn't ""anumber"" anymore, ""140"" isthe expressionfor an entire new sort of game, only ""140"" can define.As I said, ""140"" can hardly be described. You have to try it on your own and by saying ""you have to"" I mean it. There'd be no excuse for you not to think similiar about ""140"". I won't force you to like it, but you need to agree:""140"" is for ""unique"". And ""unique"" is for ""phantastic in it's own way."" And ""phantastic in it's own way"" is for ""must have played-tiltle.""I know this one is a weird of a review.

Hell, if you know nothing about this game you'll probably enjoy it, but at the end of the day you'll be stuck with 3 (or 5, after the sale) bucks out of your pocket and a completed game that has no replayability.

The rest of my gameplay time has been for the mirror levels. The mirror levels are literally the same as the ones you have already completed, except they are mirrored from right to left.And further, the mirror levels do not allow for checkpoints, which is why my gameplay time is much higher than 30 minutes. Playing those levels without checkpoints is infinitely more frustrating than just playing them the first time around.

However, I don't believe I've taken the time to write a negative review of any steam game before this, so take all that into consideration when reading this review.DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEForgive the caps lock but I had to be clear, this game is a very good example of what people mean when they call a game ""indie"" as a pejorative. Is it lazy? Yep. Is it self congradulatory? Yep. Is it overpriced and exploitative in design such that it takes a lot of time to beat just because of bad game design choices? Yep.Think what you will about ""miminalism"" but time and time again the indie community has shown that they believe it to mean ""getting away with being lazy by calling it an artistic choice"". This game uses solid colors like crazy, they aren't ""beautifully rendered"" solid colors, they are just solid colors. In every area of game design aside from the music (which is decent) this game cuts corners on production.First of all the mechanics consist of little more than basic ""avoid hazards, time jumps"". The hazards are a lazy static design. Honestly, this game looks a whole lot like what a game would look like if you set out with the idea of ""making the game requiring the least amount of effort to make and charging the most money you could get away with"". And you might suggest this is cynical or baseless, but think of this: This game does not have an options screen. You can adjust window size before playing but once you are in, you are in. Why doesn't this game have an options screen? Pretty much every game in the past 20 years has had an options screen, but for some reason this game is ""above having an options screen"".What nerve the developer must have to think so highly of this game. And now, for the coding, this game could be coded by most decent coders in a week or two. That's it! Compare that to a game like ""The Binding of Isaac"" a game with so much more depth and variety that most programmers couldn't even code or imagine. And take note, both games cost the same amount. That's the biggest insult is the price point. This game has THREE LEVELS. That's it, and how does the developer pad out the game with ""additional content""? He adds THE SAME THREE LEVELS again but with the X axis inverted on the level.""Mirror mode"" is acknowledged as incredibly easy to do, it's one line of code most of the time, inverting a level can be done in under a minute, it is absurdly easy, that's why some games have it as a ""cheat code"". Here, the almighty genius of a developer thinks so much of his game that he thinks these 3 inverted levels without checkpoints constitute ""new levels"".What really irks me though is that somehow some people seem to be buying into this game. Read the reviews, I can't wrap my head around it, are we really such sheep that this passes as a quality 5 dollar game? I can't imagine all those reviews are real, I don't want to believe I live in a world where so many people could be such suckers. This guy is selling the video game equivalent of snake oil and people are gobbling it up.To everybody who loves this game, I have a suggestion: You can play games of superior quality like this online FOR FREE, google kongregate or newgrounds, or google some game jam like ludum dare where people make games in literally 3 days and the top 200 entries for any game jam will be better (and less lazy) than this game. AND they will be free. I know for a fact that this developer has made more than enough money scamming people with ""minimalist"" game design. The least he could do if he was going to be a lazy game designer is make it pretty. LIMBO is a pretty unremarkable game gameplay-wise, but at least it looked like the art took more that 2 seconds to make.By this point I'd estimate most people have tuned out this review because it's quite long, but I had to make it and I had to make it long because I feel that passionately. Most of the indie game design community are very kind and selfless people they want their audience to enjoy their game. Here is the most damning thing about this game, and I truly believe it:I don't think the developer cares if you like their game, only if you buy it.I truly believe that, I got this game on some hefty sale and I still feel like I was ripped off. There are so many games of this and better quality online for free, this game has no art production value, very little innovation, and ONLY 3 LEVELS. It's a platformer with no art assets and only 3 levels that costs 5 bucks. Do you think a developer so selfish as to try to peddle such a scam of a game deserves any of your money?Please do not buy this game, if for no other reason than to teach developers that they should care about their audience and not take advantage of them. Keep the indie community a better place by supporting good developers and not giving money to lazy exploitative developers such as this one."

An offset of beat or timing will cause you to have to start back at your last spawn point, and after the first part of the game you can try to do the levels flawless and reverse.140 has good game design when it comes to learning how to play the game, and they ease you into it. There tutorial level where it teaches you how to jump and what does what, you just kind of get a vibe of what you need to do, and every time one completes a section of the level, they throw a new element at the player but show them in a nearly safe environment,  (you could still fail), how to the new element functions.The game is simple and is easy to understand.

If you ever see this game on sale, you might as well get it. But I'm not convinced I would spend over 8 cents a minute to play this again.I like rhythm games a lot, and the idea of a rhythm platformer is very attractive to me. One major con of140is that, although the trailer tells a different tale, there isminimal emphasis on rhythm.Though it seems odd to say that about a rhythm game, it's true; the designers spent more time on style, and not enough on functionality and creativity. The second boss, for instance, not only had no rhythm, itwas easier without the music. This should never be true for any rhythm game: there should be an emphasis on rhythm.Gameplay is fun at times, tedious at others. It's quite easy, most of the time. To be honest, it's quite forgettable. The third boss is amazing, and the first one isn't that bad, but anything in between failed to excite me.The appearance of the game, holistically, is nice! I really like the minimalist feel. The controls, as well, were simple and nice.The designer probably considers the three secret achievements, which can be gotten by going through a mirror-mode version of the levels without dying ever, as ""replay value"". I have absolutely no incentive to play it this way, and neither did almost anybody else. There's no denying that the game is too short, and it has no replay value whatsoever.If you're looking for a good way to spend an hour, money isn't an object, and you like platformers, look no further:140is for you. If you're anybody else - you want to spend a longer time, you like rhythm games, and you want to get your money's worth? Don't buy it."

Platforms will appear, grow, shrink, move, blink out of existence, or become deadly to touch at the beat. Walls and hazards will rhythmically turn on and off. It's really very cool. You are an entrepid little monochromatic shape braving the dangers of the three levels and overcoming the bosses at the end of each. If you manage to beat them all, you will be granted an even more challenging adventure (and seriously, the last boss is a huge jerk. Like, really really mean.) I just beat the entire game (and unlocked all achievements, which was nice), and it took me about 6 hours, which is impressive considering if done perfectly, you could probably do the whole game in less than 15 minutes.

Graphics are simple as a design choice, being somewhat reminiscent of the earlist of television games (but still a bit more advanced than the old 2600 could truly have offered).  The games real hook is how the music ties in with the motion of the game elements and builds in complexity and depth as the player makes progress through the level.  The main levels offer about 1.5-2.5 hours of play and then are presented in a mirror image challenge mode with no respawn checkpoints (any player death means starting the level completely over).

Generally these features come in the form of timed jumps and moving to specific beats given by the background tracks.I personally found these concepts unique and enjoyable but what let the game down for me was its lack of content. There are only three 10-20 minute levels (six, if you include the inverted levels) and there is a disturbing lack of instructions or information about anything going on when you begin the game (to be fair though the goal is easy to pick up once you get started).In terms of story, well... there is none... but the gameplay and audio are the two aspects in which this game shines. You can tell that the musician that produced the upbeat soundtracks and catchy sound effects spent a lot of time perfecting it for the game.The controls are quite smooth and handle well, this makes the difficult parts of levels somewhat more tolerable (especially the bosses).In terms of replay value, you have the opportunity to play the three original levels again without checkpoints for a real challenge but apart from that there isn't really anything else to do in the game.I would suggest getting this game if you feel like something different from your average platform game and have a decent hour or two to spare but apart from that I would give it a miss. I feel bad about rating this game negatively but I felt it didn't live up to the expectations I got from reading about the game before I installed it.Rating:Story = N / AGameplay & Controls= 3/5Graphics = 3/5Audio = 4/5Replay Value = 2/5Difficulty = 3/5"

When it gets into the first boss battle it starts to fade. The stuff shooting out of the first boss has a pattern but you need the reaction time of a coked up squirrel to be in time. Once that boss is complete you go onto the sencond level. Slightly harder nothing too bad, then there's the second boss battle where you say ""What... why is this so easy?"" Once you finish that boss battle go you into the third level. Oh dear god is this where the game lost it. So, one puzzle has squares that would go all static on you and grow/shrink at the same time. unfortunately, there is no audio to help you find the timing so to get passed this puzzle you hold down the escape key and go play something else.4/10 At least the first levels were kind of fun and the music was funky."

Your movements and the movement of the world objects are perfectly in step with the music, and the music deepends and evolves as you progress through each stage of a world.  When I saw the trailer I thought you had to switch between the different shapes (circle, triangle, square) but that's actually done automatically as you move, thankfully. The main game (3 ""worlds"") is short. Probably only take 1-2 hours to complete. But there's 3 mirror/shadow worlds that are much harder that aren't factored into the 1-2 hour completion stat.

Each main section of the game (there are 3) ends with a boss fight type experience, and they're quite enjoyable (and reasonably difficult).Lacks a couple features, like checkpoint saves within levels (so if you accidentally quit the game by holding the esc button too long, you have to redo the entire level).

,Recommended,242820,30858899,Posted: 31 March,all,LogicalFrank,"1. There are lots of indie platformers w/ minimal abstract graphics coupled w/ electronic music these. This is one of them and it's good.2. This is a single serving game, at least the main three levels of it. I have been enjoying this type of thing more and more. You don't have to fret over weather or not to finish a game once you deem it mediocre halfway through. Sit down w/ a tall drink of your choosing and you'll probably beat this before you have to go to the bathroom.3.140's gimmick is tight incorporation of its music into gameplay. Jumps and other actions must be timed w/ the beat of the music and reaching checkpoints in stages adds layers to its adaptive soundtrack. It's a pretty cool affect.4. The music is not just well incorporated, it is essential. Every time I tried to trial-and-error my way through tough situations, I found it just didn't work. You need the beat. Still, this is a platformer first and a rhythm game second. I feel this detail makes it stand out from many other similar games.5. Unfortunately, what drives point 4 home is a few sections of the game where the beat is not particularly strong and gameplay suffers a bit as a result. *shrugs*6. Yes, of course the music is good! The interactive nature of it means you can't download a soundtrack or anything which is a major bummer if you ask me.7. Overall, this is not too tough. There are some tricky bits but checkpoints are abound so no big deal if you die or whatever it is that happens when a white square touches a field of static happens to you.8. This only applies to playing through the three levels normally. There is also a mode where you play through a mirrored version of the original levels w/ no checkpoints at all even before the boss battles. This give you some old school NES-style toughness if you want it.9. Re-playing through a second time makes you realize just how much getting through each section is dependent on knowing the correct rhythm. Parts that seemed really hard at first are really easy once you've got your head wrapped around how to do them.10. The default controller setup maps movement to the left analog stick on an Xbox controller and the d-pad does nothing. For the most part, this is comfortable but there were a few sections that I found myself wishing for more accurate controls and this might have been the reason. I was too lazy to see if remapping controls helped. I got things to do, people.11.140autosaves your progress but only after completing an entire level. Also, holding down the start button is what makes you exit the game so you might accidentally quit when you are trying to pause. Guess who found this out the hard way?12. One thing I'm glad to this is actual boss battles. Lots of these minimal graphics sort of games seem to leave this aspect of classic platforming out. It's not my favorite part of the game but I'm glad to see it at all.13. End of the day, I think Carlsen Games did what they set out to do w/140. They took a concept, implemented it w/ only very minor problems and didn't feel the need to drive it into the ground w/ a hundred levels. Sure, this game doesn't take long to finish but it doesn't need to take long. It doesn't feel incomplete or unfinished but like it's meant to get its point across quickly. I'm into it."

The dynamicism of of the music is also notable - certain objects in the game trigger certain musical layersI also admire the minimal art styleMy criticism... there are too many checkpoints - dying is not very negative. The boss levels are of perfect difficulty however. More levels would be nice too

Vibrant colors, killer beats, driving synths, fun challenges that are usually easy to figure out. Good for multiple playthroughs over time.

The game starts off really easy, has some basic slides and clicks for twice as fast as the game's entire bpm - 140. It's a fun experience to discover how all the beats mash together.Enter level two. The first beat is noticably faster, and the rest of the level centers around it until the very end, when something completely different happens.Enter level three. It's climactic and there's a noticable static buildup - it's also noticably harder than the first two.The end sequence plays here.Now there's a level four, which is by far the fastest and most complex out of all of them. Some parts are maddening with your head and some parts feel trap music-esque, so maybe there's a statement behind the level.Once you finish the third level, you unlock four more levels which are the same as the first four but mirrored in color, mirrored along the y-axis, and finally, have no checkpoints.That's the whole game. However, the $5 is not for the gameplay, which is short - it's for the astounding sound design throught the entire game. It's an experince that excites a feeling inside you to be hearing a new rythym added to the world which you plugged in just then.140 is a sound masterpiece and the soundtrack being worth the same price as the game should say something."
,Recommended,242820,24497767,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,joedight,"This is a brilliant, horrible game. The levels are just hard, and long, enough to take quite some time, with occasional, but not over frequent, saves, and end in a multi-stage boss battle. There are no saves in these, and they are incredibly hard (but possible, with a lot of trying). But the level checkpoints don't persist over playthroughs, so if you quit, you've just lost a whole load of progress. This isn't a bad thing, but it does make the game take some persistence to beat. Overall, this makes this one of the most enjoyable platformers that I've played; although there are only four levels, they are each quite different, and hard enough to give you quite a sense of triumph to have beaten each."

76561198113621988,Recommended,242820,32631085,Posted: 21 June,all,NathanBCrazy,"140 is a challenging, but a fantasic platforming game. The game starts simple enough but gets more complex as you progress through the levels. The enviroment will also change around you to the beat of the music. At the end of each level there is a boss battle. All of the boss battles get harder the farther you get into them but are still all very possible. The biggest downside to this game though is that there are only 4 levels and they are all pretty short. To be honest, I've only beaten the first three, but it took me less than an hour. Overall a great game.8.2/10"

However, there is rather rare experience to it, which is music that helps you pass its levels (there were three in total, I guess). A rhythm of songs playing in background helps you understand when to perform certain actions.Also, I'm very glad that it has a checkpointing system, because of the bosses that introduced anguish to my life. I wouldn't have managed to beat 140 without it."

I've played rythm games, rythm plateformers and puzzle plateformers before, but this is the first time that I play a mix of all this genres and I enjoyed it a lot. The music is great and satisfying, and the devs managed to make the game just hard enough to make a challenge without making it frustrating. Highly recommend it, unless you want a high longevity/price ratio."
,Recommended,242820,33063352,Posted: 30 June,all,Jake Chudnow :P,"#Discussions_QuoteBlock_Author140 is a challenging minimalistic platformer with abstract colorful graphics. Rhythmic awareness is required to overcome obstacles controlled by an energetic, yet melancholic electronic soundtrack.Well that was an experience to say the least.Honestly, if I were to sum up this game in ten words or less, it would be: ""The best and hardest minimalist game I have ever played."" Because, my GOD this game is amazing. But my GOD this game is abnormally difficult as well. That's not to say the difficulty curve is bad, but that is to say that this game is very high in difficulty at some points and very low in difficulty in others. And, surprisingly, the bossfights were actually REWARDING when I finished them, because it took a while to finally finish justONEof the four bossfights.The level design is minimalistic, and that's a good thing. I think that if the levels were more detailed, it would ruin the fun that this game gives to us. I love how smooth the transitions are, and how this game doesn't lag up the computer that I use for playing games. And the computer that I use is mostdefinitelynot what people consider a ""Gaming PC"" to say the least.The fact that this game is low-spec and fun to play repeatedly is what makes this game a masterpiece of work. There's no doubt about it, Carlsen Games, you have done good with this game. And I think that if you want to keep this game like it is, here's a suggestion: HAVE. EXTRA. LEVEL. PACK. DLC. Seriously, though, DLC with extra level packs would not only keep the original game short for the people who don't want the DLC, but also keep the game going for as long as Steam exists.In the 1.2 hours that I have played on record (at the time of writing this review), that's all that I need from the game. I can keep playing it, sure, but having a game this short is what people should need from games with this style. Take Super Hexagon, for example. It's similar in style, being a minimalist music-based game, but also doesn't take more than 2 hours with practice. That's what this game is. It takes less than two hours, even without practice, and is still very, VERY fun.So if you do make a fifth level, just remember what I said: DLC can- oh, wait, let me quote that:#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorDLC can take you a long way!Thank you for making this game, and I hope that you continue to have success with this game in the future.~Cubelovd59 // Cubey~P.S. Thanks for making the game $1.69 for the Steam Summer Sale!Side note, Carlsen Games: I wound up putting this game on my YouTube channel. The link to the video is right here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKcVf9sUXNc(Seem familiar?)Anyways, I just wanted to say that I am doing this with no profit. I never intend my videos to have any profit, just want to make them for fun. I got really nervous when I saw that you were claiming the music, but then saw that it was all okay. Thank you.Best regards for your company,Cubey // Jack ""supercookie20"""
