It's an RPG with great characters, plot deveopment and both outrageous and sophisticated humor. It leads you on from one story development to another, and just when you think you have a handle on what's going to happen it throws a curve and you're off on another tangent. I guess you could call it a role playing, film noir satire and space opera. This 12 year old  game looks great.The attention to visual detail is admirable. The music as well is inspired and puts a spin on each level. Don't forget side quests and areas to explore. It's quite possible you'll find things (or characters) on a subsequent playthrough you missed the first time which will add to the experience."

It's like they actually used everything they could from the engine to tone up the atmosphere and details.Heck, the game's even got modding support. Too bad not much is done with it.One downside is that the game's a little slow at the beginning. And for some odd reason the camera pans out extremely slow when changing locations or switching combat turns.But the story's really worth it. Crazy characters, good dose of humour, and interesting places to explore."

Gorgeous use of shape and colour coupled with such attention to detail that surpases the technical limitations and speaks directly to the imagination, making you forget how many polygons there are. Beautiful, epic, truly mindblowing story with vivid lovable characters and unforgettable twists. From every random NPC you can chat up to the major quests, it's infallibly fun and charming. It's a true masterpiece. Do yourself a favour and play it."
,Recommended,242940,12576398,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,ej,"Anachronox is a cool console-style RPG, made with Quake 2 engine. Borrows heavily from classic JRPGs, such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6 and 7, etc. It is very good, but hard to recommend. Here's why:Pros:Great story, lots of awesome cutscenes, weird, but loveable characters, decent voice acting, good writing and sense of humor.Cons:BUGS! I don't believe you could even finish it after the initial release. Even after several patches, official and fan-made, it is still riddled with bugs. When playing for the first time I got permanently stuck in scenery soon after watching intro animation. Had to restart and watch it again (it is unskippable).Hyperactive, nauseating camera can be very annoying.Battles are nearly broken - very awkward interface, long repetitive animations, camera so busy flying around, you can't see what you are going to do. Only hardest skill level is somewhat challenging.Lots of backtracking. Just to switch characters in your party you have to literally leave the planet, by running through empty locations, going through several elevator animations, many loading screens, and then go back.The game was obviously rushed, some locations still have crude, unfinished look, some animations don't work. The graphics did not age really well and frequently looks dated even for 2001.Music is average. Moody, atmosheric synth stuff. Some tunes are good, most are bland and repetitive.My advice for those who still plan to play:Launch the game through ""Anachronox GCT setup"" app(already present in installation folder), DO NOT launch through Steam, otherwise most animations will be broken. Basically, the game will be unplayable.Use fast-forward button, it is '\' by default, I think. Or you'll go mad. Rebind to more accessible key.Enable ""save anywhere"" option and use it. It is not game-breaking and can potentially save you some more time.Make notes. The game is not able to track side-quests, only the main ones. Remembering side quests, hints and secret locations is up to you."

Ya, it's old as♥♥♥♥♥♥ the camera gets jerky, the combat anit too hot, and there's some bugs like falling through the world in this specific spot that was never fixed in patches, but everything else about the game is fantastic. Great world, great characters, and great ost.The written dialogue in this game is on another level though. Not many games have as much charm, attention to detail and self awareness in its dialogue like this game. Plus, it's dynamic. Talk to most npcs with each of your party members. Not only will you get a different response, but they are treated as a different character all together. Many lines had me laughing which is rare in an rpg. It's just the game really throws some curveballs at you with its delivery. You will run into some weird random dialogue, and it will come at the perfect time. It's just unpredictable, and it's refreshing because of it.How does the game play outside the combat? It honestly plays like an adventure game where you explore the world with your party members. You pick up items, interact with npcs, and use your party members to interact with certain world objects. Each party member has a world skill and can be only used when you have the member in your party. Most of the interactions are mainly minigames. Some of them are simple like picking a lock which becomes a game of hot and cold or opening a hidden lock by throwing a coin at it, and the mini game is lining up the coin with the switch x amount of times (not my personal favorite). There's some other ones that are goofy, but I won't spoil them or the other party members you get because that's one of the best parts!Here comes the biggest flaw this game has: Some times you'll come across a world interaction such as a computer screen or a terminal lock, and you'll not be able to interact with it unless you have that party member. While most aren't mandatory, you will always run into them one way or another. So what do you do? You have to go all the way back to your base of operations and pick up that party member and backtrack all the way back to the interaction. It's a common problem that the metroidvania genre faces, but it adds a lot of depth and replayability incase you miss them. The backtracking becomes tiresome. However, luckly one of the programmers for the game added a speed hack button to speed up running everywhere in one of the patches. It makes things less tedious.Oh, and you will miss stuff in this game. Completionist be damned, because there's no way you'll find all of it without a guide (especially the PAL items). Even certain cutscenes, and areas because one section of the game has three distinct branching paths. It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to side quests at all. Once you find out that there are two npcs that work together it becomes a little easier, but early on you will have no clue who the hell some of these named characters are. The names in this game are completely out there, and some of them you wouldn't dare try and pronounce. Thankfully the side quest directions that are given are pretty clear so it's not some cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you will bang your head on a desk over and over for. Also, there's items you can only get after certain parts of the game. So the game encourages you to retread ground and retalk to every npc hoping you get some new item or some new side quest. None of the optional stuff is required of you, but you will be get much more powerful battle skills, and other equipment if you do so.Last but not least there's one mechanic of the game I didn't quite get. The Elementor system. It's supposed to be a way to customize your MysTech to be more powerful, but it's very complicated. You need different color beetles, flower petals, cobalt crawlers, and function hosts. You insert beetles on grids while given it a flower petal to level your beetle up, and using different color beetles to offset opposing elementals. Or something like that... I don't know, I just don't know! I don't even know what cobalt crawlers or function hosts do, but you need them! I did some small reading on it, and it involved math, and some other explanations on other things like grid layouts that made me go ""right....."" I didn't quite comprehend any of it. I ultimately gave up on the mechanic simply because the game gave such a small explanation, and that's it. You can beat the game without ever using it. However, it's power for your party that you'll never be able to access.This game came out in 2001. Obviously overshadowed because that was the year where so many great games came out. This one was buried among them all. Which is ashame because it's somewhat forgotten, and only really discussed among rpg enthusiasts (which is how I learned about it). There isn't anything quite like this game to this date. I know some of the things I mention might sound pretty cumbersome, but they are minor issues at best, and never really hold the game back. It's both bizarre, strange, compelling, and a lot of fun. It's the second best Ion storm game, and if a sequel (which was planned at some point) was kickstarted, it would be quite the task to make a game quite as crazy as this one.Give it a shot. It's pretty great."

The combat does run a bit long at times, but gets better when they introduce a certain system later on. 'Hard' difficulty is not that hard, but there are some challenges here and there. However, you don't really play this game for the combat. The game has great characters that you won't soon forget, a very well-directed cinematic story that keeps you wanting to explore  and overall it's on a level of charm that not many games will ever reach. It's just got so much character, and overall it's a very good, if somewhat 'basic', RPG all around. I say basic because it doesn't offer a ton of roleplaying like some other classic CRPGs do, nor does it offer a very deep level of character customization and that sort of thing, but what it does offer it does very well, enough to be considered a cult classic and enough for me to call it a must-play RPG as well.If you're interested in sci-fi, space opera or just want a somewhat-silly-yet-adult-humor RPG to play with good characters and a fun story, play this game.

Think of Blade Runner mixed with KOTOR but without Lightsaber and religious nonsense.The game isn't very serious and most of the time leaning more towards comedic approach. And it works.Gameplay is separated into two categories, exploration and spelunking.1. When in exploration parts of the game there is almost no battles involved.Mainly running around the cities looking for clues.It runs very similar with KOTOR but with more interactions.+Story is great. Interstellar detective in action? Count me in.+Bizzare and yet unique characters. (A PLANET!!)+Dialogue are witty but sadly most of them aren't voiced (except cutscenes).+There is some degree of customizations. Espescially around the middle of the game when you found a certain ""magic.""+Cutscenes are a bit lacking for an RPG, though all of them are very well made and satisfying. (some really made me laugh so hard)-Lots of missable stuff. Reading walkthrough is recommended.-Steam overlay not working.-Some areas are too dark. So you will be playing with full gamma setting most of the time. It's annoying.-The camera is bad.When interacting with stuffs most of the time there will be a short cutcsene with camera panning around giving a cinematic feels.Unfortunately, this coupled with how small the areas you explore (forcing you to move around the camera lots of time) can easily cause motion sickness to some people (like me). This can be remedied with playing in short session.2. The spelunking part is your typical dungeon run in RPGs. Here you will be battling most of the time.+Enemies are placed on spesific parts on the map and you can see them so you can prepare yourself before battles.And they'll only respawn when you leaves the dungeon. The dev's are pretty generous with exp and item drops too.+Battle is your standard turn based JRPG style with ATB like in Final Fantasy titles.-Sadly the flow of battles are very slow thanks to the camera panning around whenever anyone doing something. And you'll have to wait until the camera slowly back to the default position before the game continue with the next set of commands. Oh and skill animations are pretty long too.Thankfully this version has the fast forward button implemented. It's like playing emulator with the throttle on.-The game is one hell of a BUGFEST. So save often in different save slots.Okay so overall this is a solid RPG. The only issues i have is the camera and the bugs.It's a bit sad actually that not much people knows about this game existence back in the day.It's even tops KOTOR in some aspect IMO.-------Score 8/10--------"

,Recommended,242940,30805218,Posted: 28 March,all,Baphomet,"An inter-galactic evil threatens to destroy the multiverse and only this universe’s B-Team stands in its way in Anachronox, a sci-fi RPG with an unlikely cast of characters including a washed up detective, a snarky robot, a miniaturized planet, and a former superhero. Their adventures take place inside Sender One, a humongous space sphere containing numerous planets inside of it and which is also the means of transport between them using FTL devices called sender spikes.One of the things I really liked about this game was how it didn’t take itself too seriously. Many other space-opera games like Mass Effect typically have a constantly sobering or depressing doom hanging over everyone’s head and light moments of humor often come off as sarcastic. Instead, Anachronox presents a theme that could have been pulled straight out of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, rife with random quirky and satirical humor.  Even your crew is ridiculously assembled with each member getting their own unique mini-game ranging from telling miniature council members to shut up or pressing the right buttons to fill a character’s lungs with air so they can move people aside via long-winded arguments.Combat in this game features a Chrono Trigger style encounter system where you see the baddies in exploration mode before you encounter them at which time everyone moves into place for turn-based combat. Speaking of placement, you can move freely across empty grid points to get line of sight to a target or to close the distance for a melee attack. There are also sometimes environmental switches that players can activate as a means of blocking routes or damaging enemies. Eventually you unlock a kind of equip-able magic similar to Final Fantasy 7’s material system except with each character having a unique affinity allowing them to cast higher levels of specific elements while still being able to use lesser-attuned magic if desired, albeit at lower levels.Of course even an AAA production like Anachronox has its faults. At its release date in 2001 the graphics were a bit dated with blocky character design that has gotten even worse with age. The music is often repetitive and level design feels empty with many long vacant hallways and sparsely populated cityscapes. Thankfully, most of the annoyances are mitigated by a patched-in taxi system and fast forward option. Pressing the backslash key at any point in time produces an effect similar to increasing speed in a console emulator on PC. Boring long corridors? Fast forward. Slow Elevator? Fast forward. Spell animation taking too long? Fast forward. The ability to fast forward at almost any time allows you to cut out all the “filler content” in this game so you can get right to the good stuff, something I wish I could do in many other PC games.Anachronox is a welcome change from your typical cookie-cutter RPG and despite its age I still found myself enjoying brief moments of amazement and amusement. My only real gripe is that the game’s ending leaves it open for a sequel that was never made due to the dev team closing shop before it could be completed. One can only hope that this would-be series catches the eye of a new developer capable of treating the IP with the respect it deserves."

ZOMGFBBQWMJRPG?Whatever you wanna call it, this game is absolutely fantastic, it was made by ION Storm (the Deus Ex team, not the Daikatana team), the story is both depressing and incredibly funny and optimistic at the same time, you meet tons of whacky and unforgettable characters along your journey, for example, your mouse pointer is a small ship housing the AI of your sarcastic dead secretary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.Keep in mind though, mechanically speaking, it has quite a few problems that are more outdated stuff than anything.The graphics is the first thing that comes to mind, personally I don't mind a classic looking 3D game from the late 90's / early 2000's, especially if antialiasing is added through the drivers, but these might be a massive turn off for some, also there's no easy way to run this in widescreen aspect, so unless you look how to unlock widescreen resolutions*cough*, you're mostly stuck with 4:3 aspect resolutions.This being a JRPG style game, means that the battles are naturally turn based with your party of characters and that's great really, especially because there can be a surprising amount of strategy to kill certain enemies and bosses. The only thing that it could've improved over it's japanese counterparts, is the overly long animation sequences, those can get under your skin if you see the same long animations over and over for a long game like this.Outside the battes though, it's just a wonderful fully realized massive 3D sci-fi world(s) to explore, it kinda reminds me a lot of Mass Effect for the many friendly (and non-friendly) alien races you get to meet, it also reminds me of a traditional point n' click adventure games, there's a lot of stuff to see, tons of people to talk to, tons of places to explore, it's just good stuff.So yeah, in conclusion, this is quite a fun west made JRPG with a few problems, but overall, I highly recommend it."

Until one day he decides to get his♥♥♥♥♥in gear and actually take a job from someone, that person being grumpos, a crazy old coot with an obsession with mystech. From there, they follow the mysteries of mystech and gain a number of weird companions along the way as they try to solve its meaning, all while space time itself begins to distort and warp around them.Gameplay is split into two parts, combat and exploration. The exploration is simple enough, you can only have three characters in the party at any given time, each one being able to have unique interactions with the world and use special abilities which allow them to access items and areas otherwise impossible to get to. You mainly run around areas talking to NPC's until you move on with the story. While exploring, its possible to unlock your characters personal abilities by doing certain actions, or obtaining certain objects. You can also shop for mystech and other items, or try to collect random items for a completion bonus.Combat is similar to the final fantasy series in that every character has a gauge which fills up, eventually allowing them to take one of several actions.  Attack (which is modifed not only in damage, but range, depending on the weapon equipped), use item (pretty obvious), use ability (each character having access to several unique ones which use bars of a special gauge, which fills over the course of the battle), move and use mystech (each mystech has a special effect and can be cast as if you were using a spell, with upgraded versions of the same spell costing more power to cast. power is a static number, only recharged by sleeping or using an item).Each battle takes place on a grid, with nodes on it that can only be occupied by one unit at a time. This allows you to position units between another and an enemy, preventing that enemy from targeting them, at the risk of putting the one inbetween in danger and so on. However, moving is a single action, so you could waste a chance to get a good hit in.Now, this game is deeply flawed, on many levels. It runs perfectly fine, but everything is so slow, not due to the engine or performance, just because of how it was designed. Battles take an extremely long time, even short ones, to the point where you will be spending about two or three minutes just going through one encounter, with very little actually happening. Walking around the world is also painfully slow, it takes forever to get anywhere at all, making a simple trip to the shops, from one area over, a real pain. There are also needlessly long cutscenes, not like metal gear solid where its all talking, just long pauses of silence as you go up and down a lift, or through a door, and they happen every time you use them. The only reason i didn't put this game down was because i found a mod that allowed me to speed everything up by holding down a button, which makes the game bearable.It also has an extremely confusing system with mystech. At first you just get simple lumps, which are fine, but later on you get these multi mystech objects that require you to slot bugs into grooves, feed these bugs flower petals and try to figure out a good combination. It does try to explain this system, but it was so utterly confusing that i had to look up how to even get it to work properly. The mechanic isn't broken, just very badly designed. The thing is, if you do crack it, you've won the game, its very easy to make really powerful mystech spells with this system and spam them repeatedly, just by stocking up on items to restore your power.Then there is the side quests and collecting random objects for a big reward near the end. alot of them are very easy to miss, as are the items that grant your characters new powers, unless you have a walkthrough, you are not going to be able to get half of the abilities and weapons in this game, because some of these could only be found by talking to every NPC as every character and stumbling upon the things. You also cannot go back to many areas in the game, meaning that if you missed that one ability earlier on, you can never get it again, even if you do return to the area, it'll have changed, so that NPC you needed to meet is now gone.The game is also meant to be very funny, but i can only think of one or two times where i actually laughed. Its humor is really simple and often times just really weak, alot of the time its too childish for my tastes as well, and at its worst, totally brings me out of the game and just makes me want to do anything else but keep listening.The game looks nice enough for the time when it came out, and with the mod that allows you to speed things up, its an enjoyable sit, but there are many other titles that are far better than this, each one worth your time more than anachronox. If you are a fan of Ion storm and its very off the wall humor, you may like this, and final fantasy fans might find something to enjoy from the battle system, but beyond that i can't see too many people getting through this without a guide."

I just got done playing Deus Ex which I consider to be one of the best FPS RPG of its time and considering this game was made by the same company I was excited to start playing it.I was pleasantly surprised by this game..The story has a unique sci-fi story as well as hilarious character interaction. ""Sly Boots"" is the down and out bumbling detective looking for work and stumbles upon a series of events that threaten the universe.Playing this title now in 2014 definitely shows its age because of its graphics, but not really a dealbreaker because it's artistically done well with a top notch music score.I would still recommend this game overall because the developers definitely took the time to craft a unique creative experience, but this game is mostly for people who have the nostalgia for old school story driven games. It is much more of a cerebral experience with hilarious character interaction. Otherwise you're just going to get bored after a few hours of play and move on."

The last boss was very fun because he actually required strategy - something very rare these days in games.  Also, there is no way of skipping cutscenes or exiting battles.  Most times force quitting a game ever.  This was a must when you get to the final boss and realize your party is horribly equipped for the battle.  Sylvester ""Sly"" Boots carried the group throughout nearly the entire game.  Is that a sign of bad game design or good gaming skills?  Only Buddha knows."

That explains my low playtime, but I did at least 1 full playthrough.This game needs (and deserves) a remake, plain and simple.Maybe Nathan Fillion should do voice acting for Sly Boots, since his Firefly character was obviously inspired by this game. Heck, he even looks like him. Add a little bit of Lexx and Andromeda and you get the humour and artstyle. Only that this game does it MUCH better than the aforementioned three.Want an example?The mousepointer in this game is a real ingame object. It is a flying saucer containing a hologram of your former secretary that died because of one of your many mistakes. So the game starts with your mousepointer reminding you what a worthless bum you are.I always gripe about the ridiculously predictable plots in modern RPG games...Well this will certainly not happen in this game! There is NO WAY you will anticipate whats coming next, trust me!!! This plot has no twists, it has black holes sucking you in and spitting you out on the other side of the galaxy. And this is no spoiler, black holes are beneath the weirdness of this game.I always gripe about the ridiculously superficial stereotypes posing as real people in modern RPG games...Not in this game, you and your allies ""stick out"" of the masses, so to say. Well I really don't want to spoil all the fun, but you never found allies like that in any other game, and never will afterwards, GUARANTEED!Everything else is shoddy, sadly.Graphics may be just bearable for old-school gamers like me, but the combat scares away even me. Combat is an obstacle you will have to take to reach the cutscenes, dialogs and the puzzles.If I could interest you in this flawed gem of a game, maybe you should check out some youtube vids concerning gameplay. If you can live with it, than get it. And if you are an experienced modder, maybe write a mod to tweak combat somehow? There is a SDK out there..."

A sci-fi noir that feels like Deus Ex written by Douglas Adams. and indeed Anachronox was developed at Ion Storm Austin.  As you can see from the pictures it's not just Sly's hair that's late 90's and it is built on a modded Quake 2 engine which was pretty old even in 2001.Technical Issues - Bizzarely 5 minutes into the game getting trained to fight I experienced a glitch which causes me to drop through the world while going through a repeat of the second cutscene from a minute earlier.  I had to find the noclip cheat and fiddle my way back in (it wasn't even that easy with noclip) and drop down to the training arena thing.  It was odd, I was using a machine with a XP OS, but it was the only single technical issue I had (apart from some of faces which were downright ugly).Setting - Despite the aforementioned ugly, the setting was pretty varied and pretty fun.  Another late 90's-early 00's thing was the reward for (and desire to) talking to everyone and snuffling around every alley and corner.  It was a golden age for persistent people-poking and cupboard raiding.  This includes weapons, cash and TACO's (Totally Arbitrary Collectible Objects).  I laughed, I totally got the tongue-in-cheek meta irony....I went on hunting them regardless.Combat is semi-turn based, where the cooldown between actions makes it turn based but if you hang about eating a sandwich the enemy will keep taking turns.  This style of combat suffered from getting a bit tedious early on before having a party, then slid (over many hours) to too easy before a sudden notch up of difficulty requiring collected objects at the end.  The little cutscenes for dramatic weapon actions were nice, but I could have done with being able to press space and skip them after 200 times or something.The story world is immersive and as you can only have three party members at a time, there are things that happen and dialogue that only happens (and even a special short level for one character which depends one a character taken along somewhere earlier) depending on your choices.  None of them are epic or world breaking, but if you like a character and keep them around you get to see/hear more of them.  Different characters also had powers accessed through minigames, which broke up fights/wandering and it (of course) opened up new areas in places you had been before.  But the story did make me laugh in quite a few places and was engaging.Overall if you like your RPG singleplayer, not taking themselves too seriously but still with a world to get stuck into, I recommend this game.  Despite my comments on combat for every minute spent being slightly mildly irked there was an hour of exploring and laughing.  So go for it.  Especially given it's only a fiver."

I never downvote a game for graphical glitches because I always entertain the possibility that it might be my graphics card or some kind of compatibility issue.  The bugs I'm talking about here are massive game breaking bugs.  Here are 3 examples:1.

The game has a fairly small but utterly devoted following among fans of the sci-fi RPG genre. These people seem to really be the only ones talking about Anachronox in 2017, which is probably why I could find nothing but abundant praise for the game on various message boards and gaming sites. The combat offers no fun whatsoever, and the exploration is both unrewarding and very limited. The main characters are quite likeable, but the minor NPCs often seem to just be a vehicle for the writers' comedy.  The cutscenes are generally entertaining, and I think they're my favourite part of Anachronox. They're too thinly-spread to motivate me to persist with it, though.

Anachronox is a stressor to the Nth degree.  However well the developers made the game they wanted to, however well the outcome came for them, however on time and on budget it was; the game still will kill someone with certain somatic disorders because of its execution.In Anachronox you move a few characters around to interact different ways with the 3rd person explorable world.   This world you move in is guaranteed to give a heart condition to someone who already has a marginally stressful job.  While exploring you will be met with transition event after transition event, and a quest every step of the way that will bring you back through every event you saw while getting to the point you were supposed to be at.  Does the way I explain it sound confusing?  It is and it isn't.  You will remember how to get around, but will you like getting around? Maybe if you're a kid without any problems in the world or someone who was able to retire sitting on enough money to never worry about being a member of the working poor you would be such a person to like venturing around in Anachronox.  When it comes to someone like me (and most likely someone like you) “no” you will not like venturing around the city planet that is Anachronox despite it having all charm of 90s cartoonary or a JRPG interface with many colorful party members.Skip this game and save your blood pressure medication for something else more important in life than a videogame.

I can't say I'd played a turn based RPG on the PC before, so that was interesting to see. As a guy who loves games filled with narrative this was right up my street. Talking to every NPC around gives you loads of bits to explore, stories to hear and more items to acquire. The humour is a key factor in this, and it really brings the game to life. Although the story takes a while to take off, once it's going it really sucked me in. The only let down really was the combat, even with the ability to speed up camera changes, it didn't feel like it had a massive impact on the story. I know that sounds ridiculous, but the majority of the battles didn't feel as impacting as the puzzle solving you had to do. Well worth getting though, there's alot of gameplay here!"
