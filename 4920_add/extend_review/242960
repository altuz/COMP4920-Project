,Recommended,242960,8107359,"Posted: 18 December, 2013",all,Ov3RT4K3R,"Blood Omen 2 is the sequel to Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the PlayStation game that launched the series back in 1996.The sequel focuses on the early days of Kain's travails. Kain awakens hundreds of years after the events of the first Blood Omen, in a world occupied by both magic and technology. He reluctantly joins with a vampire resistance to restore rule over the world to the vampires.Unlike in Soul Reaver, which emphasized puzzle solving over action elements, Blood Omen 2 is primarily an action game. As Kain, you will have to slaughter countless human and inhuman foes with either your claws or a number of different melee weapons. Combat is pretty simple at the touch of a button, you turn to face the nearest foe, at which point you can either attack or block.Overall, Blood Omen 2 sounds great because of Simon Templeman, but the rest of the audio is not remarkable. There is not enough music in Blood Omen 2, and what little can be heard is mostly quiet and ambient. Later in the game, an effective, percussion-heavy battle theme starts up when you raise your claws for the attack. There should have been more like it.The battle system is fairly easy to learn and the puzzles are not mind-blowing. Blood Omen 2 is completely linear and will take you only a few hours to finish. Once you have reached the end, there is no real reason to revisit the game, since none of the sequences in it are particularly memorable and since all of the gameplay mechanics are used repeatedly throughout.Sounds 7/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA"

Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain featured unprecedented voice acting and unthinkable amounts of content. This formula was expanded upon in its 3D sequel Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver. Soul Reaver reinvented platforming, combat, and puzzles. This would spawn 3 more sequels.Over 12 years ago, I discovered this gem known as Blood Omen 2. I wasn't familiar with the series at the time but instantly became hooked by the role of being a killer vampire who fed on the blood of the living. Even at that young age, I knew Kain's voice was unlike any other.This game strays away from the formula created by the Soul Reaver games. Less puzzles and platforming, more violence and gore. This is often seen as a hinderance to the Legacy we call Kain, but I disagree. I commend Eidos for changing things up a beat, sometimes you just want to kill stuff and not worry about breaking your mind on a puzzle.The best part of this game is something that is constant throughout the series, and that is the voice acting. Simon Templemen fully embraces and succumbs to the role of Kain. He IS Kain.I recommend this game for fans of The Legacy of Kain games, vampire fans, or just fans of good story telling and great voice acting."

And ofc Simon Templeman (voice of Kain) is truly the greatest voice actor for me!I soooo love to see a game where the lead role is played by the evil ruthless guy and not some good guy as usual...This is the type of game that if you redo it with todays graphic it would be a hit once again simply because... it's AWESOME!!!V A E   V I C T U S ! ! !"

Still fun to play in 2014 if you can accept that this is far primitive ( on technical side ) than game's released nowadays.

,Recommended,242960,32158575,Posted: 3 June,all,Midnight Messiah,"Blood Omen 2, that game... Yeah, the game from Legacy of Kain which I like to call it the most legit fan fiction to ever be implemented as canon storyline continuation from Soul Reaver 2.Joke aside, there's many things to love and very few things to hate about BO2. For a sole excuse to patch up the convulsing timeline of LoK, BO2 does exactly that and even more. Not only does it give us a more personal insight on Kain's very personality and growth but it also gives us that very thing which we loved about Blood Omen 1.At the end of the day, BO2 is very well a 3D version of BO1. In BO1 Kain's inner monologue( thank you Simon Templeman) completed every dull 2D corner of the world with mystical secrecy along with the great character encounters and cutscenes.  BO2 takes you along Meridian and south Nosgoth keeping the very old BO1 feeling of progressing very alive and pleasant, making Blood Omen 2 an adequate name for this game.While the combat system is a bit more challenging, it is by no means difficult. It can't be denied it can also be unpleasant. Another detail to be added is the wonky animations, which pale easily under the weight of the good voice acting and character interaction in the story.Overall, I consider Blood Omen 2 to be a proper LoK game and I would EVEN recommend it as a first time playthrough for new LoK fans out there who use Win 7 or Win XP, as it offers a casual overview of the great world of Nosgoth and much more with not very difficult puzzles or fights.Enjoy!"

,Recommended,242960,9709638,"Posted: 2 April, 2014",all,squirrel_killer-,"Love this game. Very good. Default controls are less than ideal, and saddly the game does not have offical controller support. However I found after taking a minute to map the keys to a controller myself it played fine.Some people complain about not supporting the xbox 360 controller, I mostly feel that while it would be nice I don't have much right to expect it because really, this game is old. It doesn't need more than 7 buttons and a pair of joysticks to bind EVERYTHING.You can quickly bind your own controls for a controller if you need to, however a slight shift of a few keys on the keyboard also worked fine. Personally I set the ABXY buttons to jump, feed/grapple, action, and dark use darkgift respectively. Set up your control sticks as L for movement and R for my mouse functionality, you could even set it up with a southpaw style if you prefer. Then I set LT and LB both to lock on and RT and RB to block with RS button to the dark gift menu.But if you judge this game only by it's controls or it high end (for it's time) not so great graphics than it is not for you. The mechanics are older, and the puzzles are simple. I have found no way to caption the game, which makes this a game I can't expect my deaf GF to play and still enjoy fully without having a headset on. However these are all results from it being over 12 years old. It does not have the luxuries gamers are spoiled with now.However it is still fun. It has well written story. Kain's personality feels dark, but real. He feels flawed in his personality, but at the same time he simple is too powerful for those flaws to slow him down. The combat is simple, but the vampires feel like vampires, not like something from a bad teen romance novel. Dark, powerful, but not purely evil. Fans of the series know that Kain veiws his vampirism as a curse as much as a dark gift. He hates what he is, and lashes against the world which wronged him viciously in revenge for it. He hates what and who he is. This is not shown enough in this installment of the series, but if you know the story, you see the results of it.The combat of the game is simple, you lock onto enemies and block their attacks, hit them back, use your abilities as needed. You find or salvage weapons as you go to use in battle to turn the odds even more in your favor. However eventually they weapons break so you always need a new one. THe only other feature in combat is grasping your enemy and attacking them as you hold them by their throat about a foot off the ground effortlessly.The world and progression is liniar. Exploration can help you find chests that enchant your weapon for a time or give you more ""lore"" which is basically experience. Get enough lore and you get some more health. A simple leveling system really. The other way to get lore is to feed on the blood of your victims. Which also heals you. The one danger of this game is you are ever growing hungry. Don't feed, and eventually you will die. Ultimately however, everything is basically liniar with short tangents to take. Nothing ground breaking. Focus is on the story of the game.Graphics are actually really good for it's age, however any computer newer than about 8 years should be able to play it fine. Their is little happening in the graphics or mechanics department. A clear sign of the games age. However this isn't so bad since graphics should not be the priority of any game.The game does have simple puzzles, which can be solved quickly without over thinking it. Often you will see the solution after moving somethings around. The game often basically hands you a situation where you flip a switch and you get a result. Then has a puzzle shortly after to make you need to find a way to mimic said result in the next area. It is very much an action adventure game in that respect. The puzzles often feel like something from a Legend of Zelda game.Despite it's flaws this game is still absolutely amazing. Unless you feel that a game needs state of the art graphics or new features like xbox 360 controller support (which is actually really new to PC gaming if you think about it) which will not happen due to the fact the developers of the company seem to have abandoned the frachise saddly, than you are bound to enjoy this game if you give it the time to play it. A games age does not determine it's worth, only the quality of the gameplay and story. And this game shows that by still having a story that few games seem to have been able to maintain as the years gone by and graphics became priority. So do yourself a favour and play this game. It isn't long and the gameplay is still relavent. The story is perfect, and the characters feel real."

This game has so many positive points, but I'm sure I will only remeber the bad ones. First of all, it crashes a lot. I mean, really a lot. You have to use compatibility mode, and change the CPU affinity to make it work, and it will still crash sometimes, so you have to save pretty much after every savepoint. Oh, and the savepoints don't actually save the game, if you didn't save manually after those, when you quit the game those savepoints simply lost, have to replay everything again. So yeah guys, save a lot! But unfortunately, if you change the affinity, the cinematics will be bugged, they will be spiky, the sound will be delayed, etc. But none of these matter, they are nothing compared to the most annoying gameplay bug I have ever encountered in my gaming life: the charm bug. When you use your charm, the target will just scream, and the game is still. And you can't do anything about it, you have to quit, reload the game, and hope it will work next time. Most of the time, it won't. And the more you progress, the more you need to use charm. The last quarter of this game is basically playing around the crashes and glitches instead of playing around the puzzles and bosses. Very disappointing.Because the game itself is good! The atmosphere, the ambience is great, I really liked playing when everything worked fine. I could lost myself in the game and spend 5-6 hours straight without realizing the time. The characters are fine, the conversations are a little forced sometimes, but nothing really unusual to be honest. I played with keyboard+mouse, and the controlling was a bit unusual at first but after a couple hours of playing it felt completely fine. The story is great I think, pretty much the only thing that kept me playing until the end.I will play the other games for sure, and I didn't regret buying this in the 5-game pack on a sale, but I can hardly recommend this to anyone. Even if you fix everything, it will probably still be a pain in the back."

A story-driven dark fantasy, which makes you feel right at home in its nihilistic world. Here are the positives, negatives and neutrals:Positives:1. Great atmosphere. Really nails the vampire/assassin feel. The world is dark and depressing, but it's perfect for you.2. The abilities are nice and cool. All of them are useful.3. The games is self-contained. You don't need to play the other games in order to understand this one.4. Great characters. Well written considering it's made in 2002.5. Interesting conspiracy-styled story. It will keep you hooked until the end.6. A bunch of different ways to kill enemies with cool and satisfying finishers.7. You can pause cutscenes.8. Kain!Negatives:1. Combat is rather basic. Once you learn it there is nothing more.2. Unskippable cutscenes. This will be a problem if you die a couple of times before a cutscene.3. Technical problems with modern hardware and software. Better play it on a single core.Neutrals:1. The games is linear. I think this is not bad, but for some people it might be.2. It's more action oriented than other LoK games. Again I like it, but it might be a problem for some because the puzzels are rather basic. After all this is an ACTION-adventure game.As a side note I'll say that the length of the game differs depending on the difficulty. In the Options->Block there is ""Assisted"" and ""Skilled"". I recommed to try them both and see that there is a big difference between them. The combat will be more engaging (or mundane) if Skilled is chosen and very easy otherwise (and thus faster game progression).And for a final note I'll say that Blood Omen 2: Legacy of Kain made me feel like an assassin/vampire unlike any other modern game. Although dark the world feels just right for you, again things that current games fail to do."

Blood Omen 2 is itself a fairly straightforward action adventure game,only with a lot more blood than you'd normally find in such a game. Kain is the main character of Blood Omen 2, but he's not the hero, and ""antihero"" isn't the right way to describe him either. In Blood Omen 2, Kain is not heroic in the least. He's one of the only main characters in gaming who comes across as purely evil--he is not only a vampire, but also a savage killer. Interestingly, he still represents the moral center of Blood Omen 2--unlike his foes, Kain is thoroughly sincere and never minces his words, and in doing so, he remains a very intriguing protagonist. He is brought to life by the voice of Simon Templeman, who's portrayed him in all four Legacy of Kain games. Here, Templeman hams it up as good as ever, smoothly delivering Kain's lines in perfectly sinister fashion. With a couple of exceptions, the rest of the game's voice actors don't stand out as much, and the dialogue in Blood Omen 2--which is as long-winded as ever--generally isn't quite as engaging as that of the Soul Reaver games. The plot itself isn't particularly inspired either. Kain awakens hundreds of years after the events of the first Blood Omen, in a world occupied by both magic and technology. He reluctantly joins with a vampire resistance to restore rule over the world to the vampires."

This, this alone should've been warning enough to stay away from this abomination.Blood Omen and Soul Reaver are known for their amazing plot, somehow entertaining puzzles and BEAUTIFUL voice-acting. The three of which Blood Omen 2 lacks.The puzzles are gone. I dare not call pushing levers a puzzle. People complained about the block puzzles of Soul Reaver 1, well, here the puzzles are nothing BUT levers. Ten thousand levers. There is a little variation now and then, but most of the game consist of moving one lever, going another place, moving another, then going back and so forth and so on.The amazing plot? Forget it. Here, all the characters acts completely different from the other games in the series. COMPLETELY. Kain has become more close to Vegeta than from Kain himself, shouting arrogant drivel throgh the entire game. Vorador has become the leader of a vampire resistence, the same tiresome plot of ""rebels versus empire"" that have been done to death ever since Star Wars, and shows little of the arrogant, self-centered and calm Vorador that aided Kain through Blood Omen 1. Janos appears later in the games and, although his personality wasn't exactly explored in the other games, here he has the same problem all the other characters got: A massive idiot characterization.And I mean MASSIVE. Each and every character take such stupidity and idiotic behavior that sometimes you just want to forget about all this affair.It's important to draw attention that the problem with voice-acting by no means the responsability of the voice-actors. Kain, Vorador and Janos retain their original voices from the other games, however, I believe the voice directing and the script are the ones to blame.This is the absolute proof that the quality in all the other Soul Reaver games, especially in their story, is thanks to the amazing work of Amy Hennig. It's unfortunate that she's now working for EA and probably won't come back for the series. One can only hope Square and Eidos do all they can do to get her back, I have little faith this series will be back to their former glory without her."

The fighting mechanics are pretty decent (still better than Witcher1), good voice acting, movement could be better (it's a pain sometimes trying to go up ladders), music is generic, and the graphics are dated of course.  My truly major complaint was I felt the levels were too long sometimes with the story being much of the time go here/do that, long and tedious; one point in the story cinematic Kain even mentions that he is running around like a lap dog.

It does suffer from random crashes, though far between each other. I must have had atleast 4 crashes in a 16 hour gameplay length that happen randomly after an animation of your character ends (ei: picking up a weapon, climbing a ladder)The mechanics are pretty reliable except for the Movement. There's no strafing possible as long as you're not in combat move, and since there's a bit of platforming involved, it can be tricky with certain spots. Combat is fairly decent for an early PS2 game. Guard, Attack, Dodge, Grabs and throws are implimented, and later in the game, you get Ragebar skills, though the last skill I beleive is a bit of a game breaker since it 1-shots any enemy. The game also relies on simple puzzles to progress through a map with decent checkpoint placing(It does not Auto-save with these checkpoints, so save before you quit the game).So as long as you know what many early PS2 games are like and you don't mind the older graphics, it's a great game, bits of lore, dialog and narration from the protagonist, Kain."

,Not Recommended,242960,30259923,Posted: 1 March,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Blood Omen 2 doesn't hold up well and has nearly no redeeming qualities in 2017 outside of it's vampire theme and it's voice acting. The Blood Omen series is possibly the most well known Vampire game, but unfortunately is clunky and not fun to play. If you're interested in the Blood Omen series, I recommend watching playthroughs on Youtube. I'm hoping Defiance and the Soul Reaver series (I enjoyed the first one ages ago) hold up better. The Blood Omen series needs a serious remake or overhaul to be worth playing in my eyes. Lastly, I usually make a list of things I like/don't like, but everything I listed was a laundry list of negatives, which I have listed below.Review notes:Clunky tank Movement- The ""agile vampire"" Kain is ironically less agile than Lara Croft since he can't quick hop or flip around like she does. He can't strafe, but only can pivot in gameplay.Mostly exploitable combat- Easy to spam attacks at the right moments to make many enemies a push over.Semi-random Guard breaks- Sometimes, enemies attack with three hit combos. Sometimes, the same combo will end with a 4th guard breaking or unblockable. If you're already blocking, then you won't be able to dodge fast enough.Archaic menu based powers- select powers from a menu to use on a button, instead of dedicated buttons for each action or context sensitive actionsLong jump mostly only works on same height plane- you can't pounce on an enemy from above unless they are on the same ""floor"" as you arePointless disguise- Kain is one of few (or only) vampires that can disguise himself amongs human, by wearing some black and gold Edgelord armore that still shows his obvious Vampire faceNo excuse to not kill everybody- Unless you're speedrunning, its best to kill everybody for XP (lore as the game calls it)Bad save system- Game uses manual saves and checkpoints, but if you don't manual save after a check point, you will loose progress until your last manual save. There are no autosaves (which was probably ""invented"" after this game honestly)Saving only matters after checkpoints- whatever progess you made after a checkpoint is null if you quit/crash after the checkpoint (provided you save). There was no checkpoint after the 2nd boss battle for a long time, so I had to redo it.Bad sound design choices- menu select is a shrill blade clash effect. Sometimes, ambience or music will nearly drown out spoken dialogueNo subtitles- a bigger problem when there are sound issues as mention aboveUnskippable cutscenes- especially irritating if you die at a spot after a cutscene.No ambient sound slider- just sound and music. You can turn down all audio and still have loud ambiene. Turning down sound will reduce shrill noises, but also voice dialogue - arguably the most important factor of the gameLedge knockoffs only work on KainYou can easily fall of ledges during combat, but you rarely can knock enemies off them.All enemies respawn after death?- I missed a jump going from one part of a level to another, so I had to retrace my steps. I died before this jump and this seemed to have brought back the same enemies and NPCs I've already killed after passing checkpoints and saves.Bug can cancel Beserk attack-The Beserk dark gift can ""one shot"" enemies, but if you use it on an incline, it might interfere and cancel the animation, ending the attack and wasting meter.Kain performed an ""awesome escape"" from a crumbling cavern- nearby NPC's didn't notice. A smuggler in the previous area was not surprised that I was able to long jump a chasm she made by cutting down a bridge."

The overall dialogue was also not quite on par with the other games.However, I do like the overall atmosphere of Blood Omen 2 and I had a lot of fun playing it. It has a nice gothic feel to it and there's something to be said for playing the “evil vampire”. I tend to treat it as a separate game and not judge it as part of the Legacy of Kain series.

,Not Recommended,242960,10256450,"Posted: 27 May, 2014",all,geøstigma,"Let me start by saying that im a huge fan of LoK series for a very long time and that i have played every one of this amazing series titles countless times... except for this one. I finished this game right before writing this and i must say that i now fully understand why BO2 was the only title in the series that i was evading during all of my series replays.This is, in my oppinion, the only title from LoK series that is bad and here is why:TL;DR VersionCons:-Scarce and crude story, unworthy of LoK titles.-Boring, repetative combat with bad mechanics, little to no enemy/weapon variation and useless abilities.-Easy level progress with boring, repetative encounters and puzzles.-Progression system is barely useful, not fun and it feels forced.Pros:-Kain(and his voice actor)-Simple yet fun boss encounters for the most of the time-Story, though deficient, is a part of one of the greatest stories ever told-Story and Acting:While in previuos LoK games naration is plentyful throughout all of the game, BO2 seems to be missing that, and story is barely worth following untill chapter 7 where it kinda starts to develop. Story telling is scarce and crude, every character except for Kain sounds like it has absolutely no written dialogue and is improvising on the spot, while in every other LoK game, every single dialogue sounds absolutely eargasmic. Plot is plain and simple, story develops as expected with no twists or surprises that LoK series are known for. Also, levels have close to no narated cut scenes or dialogues except for the occasional level introduction and conclusion.-Character Progress:In BO1 we were exploring caves, collecting armors and weapons with different properties, learning new spells and sacrificing our blood for more powerfull items, in SR titles, exploring was the key for progress, rewarding those who take alternate routs, climb high places, shift between realms and dive deep, etc... In BO2, the only aspect of character improvement is HP increasing and you do this by draining dry the enemies that you kill and syphon ancient containers of vampiric lore which are neither hidden nor hard to reach and you will probably get them all on your first run without even trying. Also, the thing with enemy draining is really boring, tottaly unnecessary and time consuming, considering that u need to completely drain your victim which can take up to, roughly, 5 seconds and if you want to get as much as possible you will need to kill every single civilian you encounter.-Gear:Kain has no weapon of his own except for his claws and every other weapon that you can pickup is exactly the same and differs from other weapons only by the light and heavy attack on grabbed enemy and, ofc, attack animations while damage, speed and integrity are the same for all weapons(not sure about this but it definitely feels like that, no distinguishable difference). Kains armors(tho purely cosmetic) look absolutely amazing tho, and many enemies are well designed and fit into the world perfectly.Combat:Combat is realy bad in my oppinion, its the same for every enemy and rly slow and easy. Even tho Kain can dodge, parry, grab and ""combo"", all of this is poorly executed and tottaly no LoK-ish. BO1 combat felt more engaging and dynamic.While enemies do hit pretty hard, even the worst average players will have a hard time with dying in this game cause attack patterns that enemies use are all alike and consist of 3-5 light attacks with either a power attack(yellow/blockable) or unblockable finisher move(red/unblockable). Good thing is that almost every fight can be avoided or escaped from if player chooses to do so.If however, player would rather fight and rely on his vampiric prowess and supernatural powers, he would shortly realize that he is limited to a 3-hit combo with ""no-matter-what"" he wields and a set of a nearly useless, so called, Dark Gifts, that can only be used if Kain parrys enough blows and are basicaly the same thing with a 3 levels of strength(the ones that matter for combat at least).Boss battles:Thesse are pretty good and true to the LoK series and old school boss battles but there are few bosses with some very monotone stages that require you to do certain things many, many, many times before they let you proceed to the next battle stage, but overall, this aspect is probably this titles strongest aspect.Bosses are pretty much battle puzzles that you need to solve using your abilities while simultaneously staying alive and fighting back.Level Progression and Puzzles:Levels are long, filled with monotone enemy encouters and full of repetative, super easy puzzles that can barely be called puzzles. Now, some may think that these are easy for me cause i already played the game once but i assure you, these puzzles barely classify as puzzles and, my memmory of this game was very vague when i started my last(2nd) playthrough and i last played it roughly 8 years ago. Basically, if you are not pulling a box, you are mind controlling a human through a glass window to pull a lever for you and shooting a sigil every now and then with a TK power.Im pretty sure i named it all so far.I would also like to say that, while i do think that this is a terrible LoK game, it could still pass as an playable adventure game with a cool main character and would probably be a successful title for younger ages if it was not so violent.2/10 as LoK title5/10 as an action/adventure game"

It is instead a ""filler"", that resurrects key characters and take away the medieval-gothic setting to an industrial ""victorian england""-like time. Which makes no sense since this is supposed to take place before Soul Reaver 1. So everything that happens in this game is pure bulls***, nowhere being close to ""official"".Secondly, the game is ugly and the controls are a joke. The simplicity and linearity of this game makes me feel like I'm playing a Tomb Raider for the Playstation 1, while this is ""supposedly"" a PS2 game.

76561198179946294,Recommended,242960,14666066,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,Zee_Cupcake,"As a fan of the Legacy of Kain series from Soul Reaver 2 and Defiance, I had heard the majority of other fans dread this game as a ""trial run"", more or less. Though I can see where they are coming from- I don't think this makes the game a ""Bad"" one, per se. I'll be trying my best to compare it to it's predecessor Soul Reaver as it is the only other one I've played on PC.First things first is the gameplay- which is a little wonky compared to Soul Reaver. You still use Autoface to aim at enemies, but you have to hold it down to attack anything, so you can't run in claws-a-snarin' to get past your obstacles. Another thing different from Soul Reaver is that Blood Omen 2 takes advantage of the mouse. My advice; don't. Camera troubles aren't quite as bad from Soul Reaver, so using the WASD set-up alone gets you around just fine normally. All the mouse really seems to do is muck up where you are walking. In fact- If you have a Playstation controler port; I think this would be a most opperotune time to use it... If not, then you CAN go in and change the controls at your whimsy, but something tells me that the original controler would work much better.Another thing that bothered me, maybe more than it should have, was the fact that if you die whilst holding a weapon, you spawn without it. Weapons, as with Soul Reaver aren't entirely necessary; but they're still pretty useful- and it's a little dissapointing if you loose it; especially if you power it up.Now onto the story- the thing the entire series is Famous for. Blood Omen 2 was made after Soul Reaver but before Soul Reaver 2. Chronologically it happens after the original Blood Omen before Raziel and the Lieutenants were raised. This entire game is made to expand on Kain's character, and how he rose to power in the Vampire race, and eventually his own empire. The game starts in an interesting location. Kain's army had hit a snag in their conquest, and Kain himself is defeated by the Sarafan leader. Kain goes into a slumber for 200 years, and wakes up barely remembering what happened- just knowing that he was defeated and.... Well. Being Kain... Is more than a little miffed by that fact. So Kain teams up with the remaining Vampires unnoppressed by the Sarafan Order, known as the Kabal, and sets out to recover his strength and come back into power.In all seriousness, though, Blood Omen 2 isn't very pertinent in the rest of the lore. You can scrap this game and the rest of the story from the other games will still make sense without it- and I'm afraid the ONLY thing this game does story-wise is give a little bit more insight into our anti-hero Kain. Granted; this was no secret, and was why I wanted to play the game in the first place. To a regular player, however, it might not be worth the trouble.I certainly get kicks from not being able to run through timed doors, calling Kain a wrinkly old angry prune, and having to  look up walkthroughs. I get even more laughs when my family becomes emotionally involved in my progress. This game was everything I expected and I am looking forward to playing it the rest of the way though, even with it's faults it's still a gem. I would suggest it to anyone who's played anything else in the Legacy, and HIGHLY recommend it to any legacy of Kain affictionado."

,Recommended,242960,21453196,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,Joshua_the_Bard,"The long and short of itTHE GOOD: Simon Templeton reprising his voice acting role as Kain; the story (kinda)THE BAD: Humdrum combat, repetitive gameplay and monotonous ""puzzles""; bugs and crashes present.VERDICT:Recommended *ONLY* for Legacy of Kain fanswho want to experience what little it adds to the story and lore of the series, and even then, it's a lukewarm recommendation at best.Longer Review - I will concentrate mostly on gameplay aspects, since touching on the story would only spoil what is, in my opinion, the only real point to play the game, so if you can endure the razor-sharp rough edges, then you might want to try the game out.COMBAT -give 'em the ol' 1-2-3 and not much else.If this the meat of the game, then it's a slab of undercocked beef at best. You lock on to your chosen target (the interaction and attack button are the same, so you can't punch otherwise) and can attack with your claws or with various other weapons found in the game, but regardless of what you use to whack your enemies with, you have one (effin' 1) measly 3 punch ""combo"" to deal damage which cannot be altered or combined to change things up, and believe you me when I tell you, it gets old, fast. You can also block your opponent's attacks but beware, as your blows can just as easily be blocked, and they will. Often. Making your weapons break with use... fun.Combat is therefore reduced to block a bunch of enemy attacks so you can dodge their stronger, sometimes unblockable move which leaves them open for you to whack 'em to the floor -that 3-punch combo always knocks them down- and then wait for them to get up and repeat the process again. Sometimes there are 2 baddies at the same time, but they rarely if ever backstab (real honorable folks for vampire-hating fanatics) so you're left tag-teaming them until they stop moving enough for you to drink their blood, a process with feels less satisfying than in Blood Omen 1 due to the sucking sound effect, which sounds disconcertingly like a brat blowing bubbles into their milkshake. Oh and you gotta drink them tasty bloodshakes, always, since your health meter increases when enough of the red stuff is sucked, so every kill slows you down even more and thus feels like a chore.Blocking enemy attacks fills an energy bar used to perform some special moves of your own, unlocked during story progression, and some of them can be fun if clunky to use, like a strong, unblockable punch or a combo, a long distance leap or a one-hit-kill incineration spell, but you will rarely use them since most of them will drain your energy bar in 1 or 2 uses at most and filling that thing up for every enemy would double the time you spend on combat.PUZZLES -Or ""Herp what the developer was derp-ing"".There are 2 types of puzzles in the game: the insultingly simple, or the infuriatingly abstract, either way, the majority feel monotonous and pointless. As per LOK tradition, most revolve around you using a recently acquired skill, like the long distance leap or the mind control spell, and often require little more than dragging a thing into a floor switch thing, or possess the mind of conveniently placed non-combatant to flip a switch for you, or (my favorite): laboriously using a crane to pick up a rock and depositing it on a conveyor belt, then disabling a crusher before activating said conveyor so the rock can pass through safely, and then just as laboriously as before use another crane to pick up the damned rock to drop it into a magic battery thing so it can explode and thus a wall that was a good 7 meters from the explosion can collapse and you can continue on your merry way. No, you can't just pick up the battery thing with the crane and then just drop it, because game design. (BTW, you may think this was unnecessary but thrust me, you'll thank me for giving you the solution to this crap).BUGS AND CRASHESThere are, thankfully, not that many in most of the game, however, as with many old games, if you're running Win. Vista, 7, 8 or 10 and depending on your rig is quite possible that you'll need to limit the number of cores used for the game (alt+tab while running the game, ctrl+alt+del to open task manager, right click on BO2.exe and go to details, locate again BO2.exe, right click again and go to set affinity and make sure ONLY CPU 0 is ticked. You might want to set the game to compatibility mode just to be safe).Still, I was experiencing game crashes by the last 2 chapters, forcing me to keep the paranoid habit of saving after every checkpoint.So, as I said at the beginning, I would only recommend to fans of the series who, like me, feel compelled to experience the whole story to completion, since there are some good things about it: The voice acting ranges from pretty good (courtesy of Kain and some of your allies) to tolerable. The combat, despite the crap I gave it, there is some definite weight to the punches thrown, and it's overall serviceable,Hell, the whole game can be summed up by that word, so I'll leave it at that; Blood Omen 2 is serviceable, but it's definitely the worst entry in the Legacy of Kain series."

At first, it is interesting. The feeling of controlling a vampire, having suppreme powers and tactics. But of course there are cons. This game uses gore to represent many situations and although it should, it tires the eye after spending enough time killing and drinking your foes' blood.Puzzles, it gives you the idea that this game will have some awesome mechanics and having you spending time trying to solve riddles or even open a door. It actually does, but using some premade patterns which makes your experience a bit dull in the process.Areas, filled with nice effects, for it's age of course, it tries to create an atmosphere according to the story bound to the place you visit. After mid game progress though, patterns appear more often, making your gameplay more like going straight without even thinking.Bossfights, one thing I love about this game is it's bosses as each of them gives you a unique challenge.Bugs, I don't know if others experienced this as well, but it kept crashing at the last stages of the game, mostly when ghosts or something with heavy animated effects appeared.Coming to a conclusion, this game was made more programmed rather than playable, meaning that there are no random occurences, everything is either obvious or predictable. I greatly recommend playing the next chapter: LoK Defiance as it fixes many of these issues.Thank you for taking your time to read this."

It follows the story of Kain, once the vampire ruler of Nosgoth, now believed to be dead at the hands of the leader of the church. Instead some dubious allies spirited his corpse away and he eventually woke up weak and decidedly cranky about the entire situation. The persecuted vampires want him to save them. Kain doesn't give a damn and just wants revenge and his original station back.It's nice playing a game where you are an unapologetic villain. Humans mean nothing to you (and the game arguably penalises you for sparing them; that tiny amount of blood DOES add up). People in power are a means to an end. Snark abounds. Despite this Kain does respect loyalty and feels more like a person with a goal than a general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Vampires are slowly being erased from the world by their ennemies. Kain will then have to join a group of resisting vampire...The gameplay is simple. You can attack/block/grab. After killing someone, you can drink his blood to restore HP and gain EXP. On ""leveling up"", your maximum HP goes up which force you to drink the blood of EVERYONE you see. The drinking is nice but after a thousand time, you'll grow tired of its animation. After killing boss, you also gain special abilities to jump huge gaps, hit harder,  etc. Overall, it all get pretty redundant.The game also has some puzzle to resolve. However, most of them just break the momentum without being very interesting nor difficult.Despite those flaws, the game is still interesting. If most secondary characters don't stand out much, the main character, Kain is intriguing and charismatic enough to keep your interest.However, it's not a game you'll revisit once passed since the gameplay gets repetitive. Anyway, it's a game that should keep you occupied for about 18 hours.I won't talk much about the visuals. They are good enough considering the age of the game (2002). They won't ""burn"" your eyes.Personnal Enjoyment : 7.5/10At about 5$ its a game that is good enough to buy. If you like old games, dark fantasy and action games, you will probably enjoy this one."

,Not Recommended,242960,35409435,Posted: 2 October,all,Psycho Predator,"This game is an incredibly fun game that can be enjoyed time and time again, unfortunately, this is also a very broken game that has a certain point in the game which simply cannot be passed making the completion of this game impossible.In the game you will eventually come across a boss fight against another vampire named Sebastian, the boss fight has 3 stages, on the 3rd stage you need to use one of your vampire abilities to charm (take control of via mind control) of one of the unarmed npc's in the control room, you then need to force the npc to use a lever which damages the enemy boss. However during my time in this fight on the 3rd stage whenever i tried to charm the guy in the control room he simply stood still and shouted for help and would not move at all. Since the enemy npc woulnd't move it was simply impossible to complete the boss fight and therefore making me unable to progress any further.This is just an example of 1 of the many many bugs in the game, such as enemies being able to use their most powerful red attack over and over again instantly, Also getting stuck in certain areas due to invisible walls being where there should not be invisible walls.I wish this game would recieve a patch to fix the bugs, if it did this could easily become an excellent game, unfortunately the game has not been patched and the bugs in the game make it impossible to enjoy fully."
