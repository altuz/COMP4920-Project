,Recommended,242980,17959772,"Posted: 9 September, 2015",all,Murikov,"«Daikatana will be the greatest game of all time!»- John RomeroWell, is it? I'd rather say it's definitely one the most controversial if not most disappointing titles at the time of its release. It was released three years too late, with ugly, outdated graphics and nerve-wracking sidekick AI. Furthermore it was accompanied by questionable marketing strategies and shattering critics.Is it therefore a bad game? Do the disastrous critics and reviews do justice toDaikatana? Is it an ignoble FPS experience?I tend to disagree.It was such an ambitious project that brought tons of good ideas to the table - many of them were poorly implemented, some of them brilliantly. But at the end the game suffered from the huge hype it built up before the actual release date - too high were the anticipations and too good-sounding the promises.Let us look at some of these mishaps and crowning moments. For instance, some voice actor performances in the singleplayer campaign are just utter garbage, the animations were even ugly by the time of its release and the «Save Gems» system is a total abomination - but the fast and gory gameplay, artwork, story, characters and even in most parts the music really do stand out on their own. Some sections like the «Lemnos Isle» part of the Greece episode are dilettantly designed - while some time later the general level design like in «Lair of Medusa» shows itself at its best again.It also needs to be said that I played the game with the unofficial Patch 1.3 and Unlimited Saves, so I was left spared by some of the horrors that players faced back then in 2000. I therefore do not share the same frustrating experiences or opinions aboutDaikatanaas many others might have.But what I've seen and played impressed me. It is certainly not aHalf Life,Deus Ex,System Shock 2nor aThief: The Dark Project- but it sure entertained me for about 12 hours. I go even further and point my finger at current developers and game designers. Ion Storm Dallas surely did some damn fine design choices in many parts ofDaikatana. Why were some of these ideas not further developed or readopted by other studios? The pseudo JRPG elements, the feature of sharing ammo and supplies with bot companions, the weird weapon ballistics, the classic, fastfeelof a BUILD engine first person shooter with lots of hidden secrets and easter eggs? It may sound ridiculous, but I enjoyedDaikatanaway better than many so called AAA games from nowadays...The Good:+ Dark and gloomy cyberpunk atmosphere+ Atmospheric and catchy soundtrack in the most part+ Huge levels with many secrets and interesting design choices+ Original story about time traveling and 90's action+ Blood and guts+Thatjump sound effect!+ Fast and intense gameplay+ Excellent CoOp experience+ Hey, Multiplayer!+ Weird guns, in terms of originalityThe Bad:- Horrible «Save Gems» system (but fortunately resolved by Unlimited Saves)- Really unconvincing introduction and first impression- Clunky character models and poor animations- Disappointing and boring level design choices at some parts- Disappointing final boss fight- Weird guns, in terms of pointlessnessThe Ugly:-- Terrifying sidekick AIWhat's left to say? For once ignore the naysayers and haters and give this one a chance. Get thenewest patchand absolutely read throughDekonega's helpful guidebefore getting intoDaikatana. If you're done with the first playthrough, why not giving it a second go together with a willing companion in CoOp mode? This time in Shogun difficulty?7/10And again, how many other video games share the samejump sound effectfrom the «Six Million Dollar Man» and «Bionic Woman»?..."

,Recommended,242980,14680544,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,ghenoroc,"Surprisingly ok. Act one was the worst. It began boringly and confusing and got enraging. Babysitting two AI companions who just love to throw themselves in your way and have no self preservation instinct, thigh corridors, and highly explosive weapons are not a good mix. However, having gotten through the first part of the game acts two, three and even four where very engaging and fun. Personally, I find act two to have a very “Serious Sam” kind of vibe. There are still some small nitpicks to have, but act two was amazing compared to act one. The game continues to be fun right until the fight with Mishima at the end. This fight was a letdown. It took me many, many tries, for this Boss is a bullet sponge unlike anything else in the game. The story is just a mess of mumbo jumbo fantasy tropes in way too long cutscenes. How does some random guy just forge a sword capable of cutting through time and space and how does sticking it into a reactor charge its power? Well, it was written in the 90s. This game could have been good, it mainly lacks polish. For all its faults I do not regret having played it all the way through. If you have an interest in Daikatana and the game is on sale, maybe you won’t regret it too."

Because I havent come across any issues that this game infamously has. Maybe the friendly AI can still surprise though, haven't got quite that far yet.Game is reasonably challenging, you run out of ammo easily, but only if you don't explore. Strafe jumping is possible, so it should be a good game for speedrunning as well.Story is a bit cringeworthy, but nothing more or less you'd expect from it's era. So far I like it on par with Quake 1 and 2 single player and I feel like every time I complete a level, I become a tiny bit more Romero's b*tch.It may have not been the best game ever (as advertised), but it sure as hell beats a f*ck ton of other commercial games even released today imo."
,Not Recommended,242980,27397949,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Berix,"This game is, in a bizarre way, a kind of guilty ""pleasure"". HOWEVER, unlike other guilty pleasures of mine, where I geniunely enjoy them despite other people's opinions, I fully know this is game is awful. The reason I enjoy Daikatana the way I do is that I find it to be the textbook example of how good or interesting concepts don't always result in a good product.On paper, the game seems like it SHOULD have been one the best shooters of the late 90's/early 2000's. Old school FPS gameplay, four periods in history to fight in that each have a unique set of weapons and enemies to keep things fresh, RPG-style leveling up mechanics, AI-controlled sidekicks that fight along side you, an in-depth storyline(Well, more in-depth than Doom and Quake at least) AND it was being spearheaded by the John FREAKIN Romero of iD Software fame! What could go wrong?EXECUTION. That, and lots of mismanagement during the development, but mostly the execution. Remember all the concepts I metioned above? All of them turned to crap in some way.-The AI sidekicks? They're horribly programmed, which means most the time they'll get themselves stuck on random level geometery all the time they're not running right into enemy fire and getting themselves killed.-The RPG mechanics? They're... extremely simplistic, but okay. The only upgrades that really matter are the damage and HP increases.-The storyline? It serves it's purpose of giving an excuse why you're traveling through time, but none of the characters are interesting in the slightest. Pretty bad considering Ion Storm (the developers of this title) released DEUS EX only a month later the year this came out. (Before you say anything, I know it was a different studio that made Deus Ex than Daikatana)However, it's not ENTIRELY a write-off. Like I said in the beginning, the concepts behind this game seem like they would make a great game if they were put into the hands of a better team. I also think the soundtrack is pretty decent, too. Each time period has a different style of music to fit the mood. My personal favorite tracks are from the first and final episodes.If you're interested in how NOT to make a first person shooter, or you're interested in so-bad-it's-good games, Daikatana is a must play! Otherwise, I would just buy Deus Ex, a much superior game from Ion Storm."

Nice to switch off from the world of today and go around gibbing enemies for your sick pleasure. Brought back memories of when i played it as a kid. However a word of warning, patience will be required with the AI at times, whether it be friend or foe. 7/10"
,Recommended,242980,22801744,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,TheManko,"Unlike most bad games, I didn’t find Daikatana boring to play through. Around the time the game came out, the bar was being raised every year at an unprecedented rate. Both technology and game design was making incredible leaps, unlike today when things are relatively stable. So when I say Daikatana feels like a game from 1997, that was a bigger deal in 2000 than it would be today to play something three years old. The animation system, combat feel, the philosophies guiding the level design felt like relics when it came out. Even though parts of the game feel competent, displaying the skills you’d expect from an experienced team, the result is something that just wasn’t fated for success when it came out. The world had moved on.On the face of it, Daikatana isn’t a bad idea. It was inspired by Chrono Trigger, blending FPS and RPG elements, like almost every game does today. Even Doom 4 has RPG elements. It’s a time travel story, where the people of the future discover that their reality is the product of a tyrant who rewrote time the way he liked it. So you travel through Ancient Greece, Medieval Europe, future San Fransisco, and even further in the future Japan to stop him. Every setting has different enemies and weapons, and uses different styles of level design, showcasing a broad range of “level design vocabulary”. This is the most successful aspect of the game, as it shows that you can have both linear levels in the style of Quake or Doom, in combination with hub style areas of Hexen 2 in the same game without any feeling of inconsistency. This might be the last of the truly old school FPS that was released. The way you move, and the way areas are designed feels nothing like modern “old school” shooters like Shadow Warrior, Serious Sam 3 or Hard Reset. They’re of a different school of design, while Daikatana feels exactly like the same tree of evolution as Doom, Quake, Hexen and Heretic.There’s no doubt Daikatana is a bad game. But it feels like it could’ve been good, had it somehow retained staff for long enough to polish the animations and AI to make fights have some semblance of strategy. But because of circumstances like changing engines to keep up with modern tech, and the scope of the project, it was delayed immensely. Did the people working on it see how other games were moving on, while they worked on something that felt retro, and lose faith in it? Is that why the entire staff changed multiple times? There were periods when John Romero was working on the game all alone at the office. It’s still a fascinating story of mismanagement. And because of the ideas guiding the design still feeling like good ones, I have a lot more respect for Daikatana than something like Aliens Colonial Marines or Duke Nukem Forever, which are bad in a way that’s more loathsome than this. 16 years later, I’m still rooting for John Romero to make a comeback."

(I could feel some Quake and Wolfenstein).During the game i met two partners (sidekicks) who came with me and fighted at my side. But because of the socalled ""unsafe leveldesign"" they got easily stuck at detail parts in the world.

I haven't played the game as it is (1.2). If the A.I isn't great with the 1.3 patch then it must be atrocious without it. Link below to 1.3 patch.What I liked about the gameInteresting story. I like the concept behind the game; travelling to different time periods; trying to get to the right one. Episode 2 reminded me of Clash of the titans (1981) and Jason and the Argonauts. I especially liked the boss in episode 2; thought that was pretty cool.Each time period has its own weapons.Impressive level design. Plenty of secrets to be found throughout the game.I like how the game has a similar hud to doom; where you can see the characters face and general information (ammo and character stats).You can level up and it isn't too complex, although you will have to bind the keys before you start the game (might be just with the 1.3 patch), so you can upgrade a specific ability.There's an option at the start of the game that removes the sidekicks; I highly recommend it.Brilliant ending.What I disliked or was disappointed withYou will find that throughout the game, sidekicks are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(unless you ticked the box at the start of the game that removes sidekicks); despite my game being updated to the 1.3 community patch. Your sidekicks can get in the way, especially when you are crawling in vents; which causes them to repeat the same sentences over and over again. Sidekicks and enemies can get stuck on objects easily; it's especially annoying with sidekicks because they need to be with you when you reach the next checkpoint. You can sometimes lose your sidekicks; which again you need to find them to progress to the next part of level. Sidekicks sometimes struggle to understand the concept of levers, doors and sometimes have trouble jumping; which sometimes puts you in a situation where you have to start that part of the level all over again. I wish sidekicks would make more of an effort to join you in combat; it fells like you are doing all the work. It would be better if your sidekick teleported to you when you reach the next checkpoint; it would cause less frustration. It would have been a good idea as well to show how much ammo the sidekicks have for the weapon that they are currently using. It's a shame there's no command which tells your sidekicks to ♥♥♥♥ off.Would have been nice to have a flash light, torch, lantern, or any portable light.You can't block with the Daikatana.Episode 1 is a ♥♥♥♥♥, especially after when you team up with your first sidekick; the difficultly just sky rockets in that first episode, but fortunately it calms down when you go into the next time period.Would have been good if you could play as the other two sidekicks.The game went on a bit too long for me; gets a bit boring at the end.Boss fights are a bit too easy.Didn't make me John Romero's ♥♥♥♥♥.ConclusionA good game that has been overshadowed by bad AI; luckily you get the option to not have sidekicks, which I recommend to first time players. Did the game really deserve the amount of negativity and controversy it got; no it didn't. I've played worse; wouldn't like to play the game without the 1.3 patch. If I where you I would play it safe like I did and buy this game at a discount. The game is sort of similar to Quake and Unreal.6/10 (with 1.3 patch)Link  (1.3 patch)https://bitbucket.org/daikatana13/daikatana/wiki/Downloads"

You will find yourself in Cyberpunk Japan, ancient Greece, medival Norway, and near-future San Francisco during your journey through Daikatana despite its file size only being about 600 measly megabytes.The story itself is interesting to say the least, but don't expect it to be on par with Deus Ex or Metal Gear Solid. To put it simply, the main protagonist along with his buddies, Superfly and Mikiko must battle through time to stop Mishima's tyrannical rule over Earth and bring back balance to the thin fabric of time. Sounds pretty deep at first, but you'll probably lose interest as soon as you watch the exasperatingly slow intro cutscene that's almost a whopping 10 minutes long.The narrative is considered laughable by some, plain awful by others. My opinion sits somewhere in between. Let's talk about the buddies you spend the majority of the game with. Superfly is a hilarious and likable character. His arguably stereotypical reactions to the story and environment are genuinely funny and always add a bit of comedic relief to the sometimes grimdark world of Daikatana. Mikiko is a cold hearted husk of a human being with no emotion whatsoever. She wouldn't even think twice about forsaking her friends if it meant she could benefit in any way. At least Superfly cries or screams if you die.Last, but not least, let's talk about the gameplay of Daikatana. There's a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of weapons and enemies. Every few minutes, you will encounter a shiny, new gun or a unique enemy of some kind. You can't really get bored if you keep playing, but you'll have to bear with the incredibly stupid friendly A.I.. The whole experience of Daikatana's buddy A.I. is akin to leading two lanky♥♥♥♥♥toddlers through the pits of hell as they constantly try to kill themselves on things as simple as doors or ledges. Believe me, it gets exasperating after a while.All in all, Daikatana is probably one of the most important shooters of all time. Despite garnering the reputation of being a complete and total disaster, I actually thought it was pretty sweet. Give it a try. You'll probably hate it at first, but it might grow on you the way it grew on me. I guess John Romero made me his ♥♥♥♥♥ after all."

The main problem I am not playing is that it stutters horribly with jerky movement when playing. It is so bad that it is unplayable, which doesn't matter anyway since this easily is one of the top 5 worst games ever made.This game was a flop and lost Ion Storm millions of dollars, forcing them to close down even though they had other hit games like Anachronox. John Romero screwed up bad on this. He delayed the game a number of years and kept demanding more money all the time. His level design for Doom games and Quake 1 is genius, but this entire game is the opposite of genius. This is maybe a 3/10 at best. The sad thing is that they had it right at one point, the first ever demo of the game that had 1 deathmatch map. At that time the game engine was good because it felt just like Quake 1. Then they kept working and changed the game engine making it feel completely different and showcased it in the same demo, this time calling it ""DDM2"". They changed the game engine to the Quake 2 engine and it felt awful compared to how it first was. Even though Quake 2 is one of the all-time greats in pc gaming, the engine just did not work at all for this game and really no other engine would've worked either. Then the full game of Daikatana came out and was a disaster.This game deserves to be hailed as one of the worst games of all time. Awful cringe-worthy gameplay, horrible AI sidekicks, awful graphics for its time, some of the most uninspired uncreative enemies ever, God awful horrible torturously bad level design, forgettable sound, and every other possible detail you can think of sucks as well.Why did I buy it on Steam? I never played past maybe 50% of it and wanted to finish it. That's literally the only reason: my OCD can't let unfinished business go. But due to there not being a good enough resolution to use and horrible, unplayable stutter/jerkiness, it is quickly forgotten. Again. ♥♥♥♥ steam for allowing technically unsound garbage like this to be sold.Edit: After an insane amount of research I put into fixing the stuttering, I found some third party exe file or program or something, I can't remember exactly, and I got it to run smooth. It is just too bad that even running perfectly, this is still one of the worst games of all time."

And I liked it back then and had no idea why people were trashing this game. The only bad point about it is the friendly AI. It is bad, I agree. (and maybe the ill-chosen marketing campaign for the game at the time...) But, apart from that, the game is a firm memory in my gaming experience. It is an old-school retro shooter which can be brutal for modern players.At the time when Daikatana was released it was one of the few shooters to have RPG elements in it. But those were simple enough and easy to grasp to keep the game a shooter and not an RPG game. It even offered a choice in the playstyle where the player could focus on improving either the player's abilities or improving the game's main weapon or go for a mix of both.Daikatana doesn't feel stretched and repetitive: it takes the player through 4 episodes each with it's distinct theme and each with it's own enemies and its own set of weapons.The game has a great soundtrack - I still have it in my playlist to this very day.I have recently replayed the game and, even after having played many modern shooters, - I still have very much enjoyed Daikatana for a second time.If you are a fan of retro shooters - don't let the biased bad reviews keep you from trying out this great game. But make sure to set the difficulty to the highest ;)"

It doesn't matter what he can do: deserves the respect because of Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake. So I decided to play this game besides all the warnings of people saying that is a really bad one. It doesn't seem so for me. Yes, it has a lot of bad things but it isn't that bad.I will just mention a few things to consider for those who are thinking about playing it.Positive:- History-strong. I like FPS with a strong history background. I even like the voice acting.- Setting/level design. Four different epochs with different scenarios, enemies, weapons. Those variations makes the game deeper I believe. You have something new to find out, new enemies to know, more weapons to play with.Negative:- The worst part of the game are the two sidewinder because the lack of polished AI. You feel relief each part of the game when you don't have to babysit your friends.- Not so intuitive puzzles. This is the negative side for level design. Levels are great but some of them has really anoying and hard-to-find puzzles.- First episode. I don't know specifically why is so bad but I don't like any of this episode. Even it was the most difficult one (I played it in ""medium"").In general the game has several frustrating parts. That is why has lot of negative reviews, and that is ok too: if you consider frustration as a no-go then you don't have to play this game. In my case I needed to search over the Internet for some help because I wanted to avoid the level stress.If you don't mind frustration then you can play this game and enjoy several parts.The game might have been a really good one if they had handled well. With several AI fixes and some puzzle redesign... I don't know. Think about it. Creating a game is really hard and I believe there was some issues during the developing time. Yes, maybe Romero had lot of resources to manage it but I don't know, nobody is perfect."
