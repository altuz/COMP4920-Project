The puzzles make little to no sense, the overall story is convoluted and easily forgotten after random npcs inform the player of nothing.  This game tries so hard to make an immersive world full of its own languages, history, lore and other cultural aspects but they all make no sense and don't even sound cool, all the parts of the world have the worst sounding names that try to sound so mystical.  Lastly the gameplay this game has is just....my gosh so terrible, it's not optimized for any set of controls and this game literally mixes in Tekken style fighting mechanics (which don't work well at all and the AI is pro level on all difficulties at random fights) and FPS moments that just make the game even worse.

So when I finally saw it on Steam and got the money I looked forward to it. The first time it worked. The second time it did not.Pros1. Game world is mapped out and planned like a real active city.2. Characters, while rushed a little have genuine human-like reactions to events.3. Power in events but mystery to their true nature, leading to a good story.Cons1. Steam's version of this game does not work.Yes it is only a single con, but not being able to play the game you paid for is kind of a big one thing. I spent $10 on a game I had wanted to finish for years and the interface doesn't work. Oh it will the first time you turn it on but the second time through the twentieth time, ""Video Card Error"". All other games work fine and I checked around to see what might have gone wrong, as it turned out many of the people who downloaded this on Steam got the same problem. As of February 2017 there is no fix for it, not on Steam anyway.Please, BUYER BEWARE! The game is not bad but on Steam it is a waste of money, you are being sold a fundamentally broken product."

It's really a shame, because on top of it having both Quantic Dream and David Bowie attached to it, it has some pretty interesting ideas, like being an open-world adventure game that combines multiple combat genres and a neat resurrection mechanic where during certain parts of the game your death will result in your soul (described in the game as being your own, real-world soul, transferred into the game as a trap) moving into a different character with new stats.Unfortunately, the game was just too ahead of its time, and as such almost every aspect of the game is flawed in some way. The standard adventure mode plays out like an extremely clunky version of Quantic Dream's later games (like Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain), but the cities are terribly designed and the signs are written in a font that I can only assume was designed to be incomprehensible until you stare at it for several minutes, and as such the only way to reliably travel is by taxi, which essentially defeats the purpose of a open world, let alone the issues I had later on where addresses I had read wouldn't show up as destinations at all. The FPS segments are arguably the only part of the game that works the way you'd expect, but they still feel sluggish and the controls aren't that great. The fighting game portions are the real nightmare, since those are usually the parts where you can be truly ""killed""; they play out as if the developers got completely trash-face wasted and then played tekken until they passed out and used that as their inspirational focus, and while there does seem to be some form of a combo system in the game, it doesn't tell you how to use it, and the controls are slow enough that I probably couldn't manage them anyways, so every fight is really just a test to see how quickly you can successfully do a downward leg sweep to known the enemy off their feet and then keep doing it over and over in a stunlock until they die.I would love to finish this game, because even though he barely seems to appear in the game outside of concerts I would love to listen to more of David Bowie's acting, and the story seems legitimately interesting, but the game is just practically unplayable, and even though I make it a little bit further each time I pick it back up I doubt I'll ever manage to finish it without giving up. This is the sort of game that I would love to see remade by Quantic Dream now that they have the tech, but I doubt they ever will. Ultimately, if you want to remember David Bowie, you're better off rewatching Labyrinth instead of playing this game."

Controls are unplayable in 2014, can be kinda mitigated by Xpadder (check the Community Guides) but even then they handle awkwardly, it shouldn't be such a chore just to walk around effectively. Save system is terrible, but its annoyingness can be fixed by downloading an Omikron save editor. Inventory system feels clunky.Conclusion: when is David Cage going to remake this game with modern controls and a non-masochistic save system?? Thanks."
,Not Recommended,243000,29857846,Posted: 11 February,all,Ratanak,"Interesting premise, but the execution fell short.First part was decent with an indepth story surrounding you as Kay'l, a police officer. You look for clues and follow leads like a detective. Very cool. The events that followed after Kay'l were underwhelming in comparison. You are straight up given tasks that are a whole lot less complex than before.Controls were unusual and took a while to get used to. It was annoying to strafe during shooting sections because you end up drifting and screwing up your aim (made the final battle very difficult). The brawling system would've been nice with its wealth of combo moves, but it's very easy to cheese it with the same combo over and over (a lot of games have this problem, so maybe not a fair criticism).The reincarnation mechanism was nifty. You can find certain characters and force your soul into their bodies. Unfortunately, it's pointless to do so because you are frequently forced to reincarnate into another character's body to progress the story.Not recommended for general play, but might be worth playing as a video game study."

The graphics have that 90`s Quake/UT Engine charm, likewise the music. Gameplaywise it divides into an Adventure/Open World part sprinkled with FPS and Tekken-like (or whatever) fighting style sections.The open world part is interesting, you get to run around varied locales altho its really pretty linear, no sidequests to speak of (you can get keys to houses and theres semihidden fights around the maps, both give stuff but thats about it).The FPS parts are ok, feel abit floaty but eh. Now as for the fighting stuff : Doesnt feel responsive and theres dropped frames or sync errors or whatever you would call that where you get hit but you dont see the opponent actually doing the animation hitting you. Other times you do a move and just ""bump"" off the other dude without anybody getting hit because hes in the middle of a move himself. Played my share of brawlers/fighting games and im somewhat positive it wasnt on my end but that this gameplay element is just technically crude or put blunty,♥♥♥♥♥Its not that long but maybe thats a good thing because it starts really strong with a kinda Bladerunner setting and somewhat easy but varied and fun puzzles whereas towards the end it drags itself along with samey puzzles all centered around translating symbols or interpreting symbols.Id recommend it for the oddball experience it provides, not so much the gameplay.And now i wanna play Anachronox or Outcast for some reason..."

At the start of the game you meet Kay'l who tells you that you are not actually playing a video game and you are transferring your soul into your computer and traveling to an actual place called omikron which is being taken over by demons. Your job is to save your soul and omikron from the demons. This game is a combination of Adventure/FPS/RPG/puzzle/fighting game. This game has a brilliant soundtrack(with help from David Bowie), brilliant atmosphere and a great story. I think this game is one of the best ever made, but maybe that's because I played it at such a young age. I have heard people say that this is the best game ever made. I have also heard people say it is one of the worst so I think i just depends on what you like in a game. This game was made in 1999 so you cant expect much with the graphics and it can be glitchy, but if you can look past that then I think that you will probably love this game."

76561197980913997,Recommended,243000,19306635,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,Ghetto_D,"First let me start off by saying that Omikron is quite a unique game.  It is quite a trippy game.  The atmosphere of the Omikron world is something of uglyness and beauty at the same time.  The graphics are dated, but even when this game first came out the graphics looked a bit dated anyway.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing though.  The way the camera angles flow and just the general movement and weird textures and sounds in the game really kind of blend together to make Omikron stand out as a very unique looking game.  So instead of thinking ""God these graphics suck!"", I end up thinking ""What a crazy artistic look this game has!"".Omikron is also a very unique playing game as well.  It has a relatively large set of city maps to explore somewhat sandbox style.  The story itself plays out pretty linear from what I can tell, but there are alot of different areas to explore and site see.  There are plenty of interactions to be had with random people on the streets and whatnot just for the hell of it.  Some of these people you may end up becomming if you die complete with that person's attributes (which can be either a good or a bad thing depending on who you come back as, however you can ""level up"" your character somewhat anyway).  If you don't like who you come back to life as, you can find another person to be too.  You can hail a cab to get around or just run around instead.  There are a few things to do around the cities like watching an Omikron David Bowei do an underground show at a club (again, just for the hell of it).  Another thing you can do around the city is go fight in a tournament semi-Tekken style (although don't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as Tekken).   And if going from playing an almost GTA3 style feel of an adventure game to Tekken style tournament fighting wasn't enough, Omikron also has you fight some of the main combat situations in the game as a first person shooter (although a very crappy and hard to control fps).  Luckily, there aren't too many fps situations to worry about from what I've played.  Most of the game is adventure story driven playing instead of being a ton of combat situations.  The adventure story parts of the game are what I like about Omikron by far the most anyway.Would I recomment this game?  Yes I would.  This game has it's faults no doubt, but if you can get past the awkward controls, bad camera angles, limited numbers of saves system, the hard to read fonts in the game, and all the other little quirks about the game, then you might find yourself liking this game at the same time.  So yeah Omikron definately tried to experiment with a new flavor of gameplay (some elements favorable, some elements  not so favorable), but overall I like their ideas they put into the different aspects of the game.  Catch it on sale for like $2.50 on Steam like I did."

Graphically the fidelity has not held up well over the years, but taking in the voracity of its design, here is a piece of art that will leave a lasting impression in the hearts and minds of players for generations. There's no question that the purity of vision afforded by the influence of the incomprable David Bowie is a driving force in the emotional tangibility of this world.Bowie provides several songs which serve as set pieces for the digital stage, and also cameos as a guiding character with the peculiarity and vision we expect from the creative visionary. Always a leader in many frontiers, the digital in particular, one might easily forgive the less than fluid manner in which different game styles are meshed in ways later perfected, but rarely with such passion.A screenshot has the presense of a painted work of art, a feat rare when this game was released. It is unflinchingly challenging, with themes sexual and moral that will bring the jaded player pause. What are you doing and why? For whom?

In the current development atmosphere where games must be marketed to reach the most absolute mindless of the massess to get the greatest return, this game hails from a time when developers were trying all sorts of things to break the mold. Keep in mind that this was released 2 years prior to the legendary open world RPG Morrowind, yet managed to accomplish having an engaging open world built off fairly interesting and new concept. All of the dialog is voiced, and the world is huge- to a point where it really starts to be a detriment, a mistake Morrowind did not learn from either.Omikron is not without it's flaws. It is simultaneously an open world RPG, a fighter, a shooter, and maybe something else thrown in there as well.  It does all of these things fairly mediocrely, but combined, it holds up fairly well- particularly for it's age. The story was very dark and very interesting when I had played it in 9th grade. Looking back and revisiting it, it is still very interesting, although is not immune to some cliches that I may not have picked up when I was younger.Definitely pick the game up on sale just to experience a different time in game development, a developer who took chances with mechanics and genres, had a terrific new IP, and also managed to get robot David Bowie in their game."

Its amazing 3D representation are really point by point, and its masses looks particular, however Omikron's breathtaking vision warrants an incomprehensibly upgraded treatment. The greater part of the city takes after your standard postindustrial sci-fi cityscape - it has nothing you haven't seen before in some other sci-fi redirection or film.Omikron's just loads of tremendous structures, gleaming autos, floating standard people, and flying watercrafts, and every one of these things rapidly begin to resemble the other alike and do essentially decrease your edge rate to a slither at whatever point you're outside. Moreover, the character activity is by and large stilted and improbable, and the beguilement's hand-to-hand battle movements look senseless, particularly separated and the 3D doing fighting preoccupations Omikron tries to copy.Luckily, there isn't an over the top measure of taking part in Omikron; all the more routinely, you'll be taking a gander at the city and talking with its occupants. These examination groupings, which cut from the enjoyment's standard third-particular point of view to first-solitary close-up shots, highlight uncovered crucial 3D characters that look better than anything ordinary. They bear on sensibly and really appear to act their parts, while their unblinking eyes and moving facial portions credit a momentous puppetlike appearance that isn't revolting.Marvelous voice acting comparably restores Omikron's key characters. Regardless, the redirection's gigantically ballyhooed soundtrack gave by capricious skilled worker David Bowie and accomplice Reeves Gabrels isn't in an indistinct class from you may anticipate. It needs course of action and matches the city's unremarkable cutting edge appearance with in like way forgettable techno. A few new Bowie tunes are likewise a package of Omikron's score and are down to earth if unessential as Bowie's in-redirection change mental self view performs them in show up, in-preoccupation. Heartbreakingly, Omikron doesn't sound remarkable at all despite its discernible soundtrack. Its sound impacts are either over-surveyed, as with the key character's likewise rowdy strides, or extremely checked, as with the stimulation's bothering first-particular shooter strategies.Shockingly, that they sound frightful isn't the most troublesome issue with these required activity scenes. Omikron will by chance change to a first-particular view and welcome you to weapon down various powerless yet annoyingly rectify foes as you explore some mazelike environment.While the stimulation's representation motor doesn't make a loathsome showing up worried of rendering the foes, weapon impacts, and working of these movements, they notwithstanding feel unpleasant and totally confounded. They're dull, too long, and all around not very impressive. In addition, character moves bit by bit, and it's difficult to point your weapons. In like manner, these shooter scenes appear, from every angle, to be much similar to the battling groupings, in that they feel unwieldy and thoroughly wrong inside what's in a general sense a direct paced undertaking redirection.In spite of whether it's reasonable for a redirection to join a few sorts is unimportant; Omikron's utilization of three totally withdrew sorts of gameplay is deficient and completely self-confident. It's pretty much as the originators consolidated these sorts for no other elucidation than that some individual up top happened to like every one of the three. As needs be, Omikron take after three ordinary beguilements moved into one: The doing fighting and shooting movements drew the coordinators' idea from whatever is left of the distraction, and along these lines, even the indispensable experience parts are inadequate.Omikron tries to contrast by keeping when and also the measure of times you can spare your beguilement; it in like way requests that you get used to utilizing an enchanting stock framework that confines the entirety you can go on for no detectable reason. In addition, regardless of the way that you can investigate two or three reactions amidst talks with the redirection's different characters, you'll see that these decisions are frequently insignificant. Regardless of controlling your character is troublesome, as vital moves like turns and back strides are nonsensically move to let you adequately examine the city's little rooms and thin back ways.Omikron has an enthralling reason - while it should be a puzzle, even the back of the container gives away your capacity to incarnate a broad assortment of characters inside the city. In any case, even this segment is never put to magnificent use, as each and every character you can control has every one of the reserves of being unequivocally practically identical paying little regard to what he or she takes after. What's more, the problems in the redirection are irrelevant or tedious and join arrange arranging, coordinate number juggling, weakening errands, and some confuse. The riddles are never troublesome, however your objectives are habitually ambiguous, which is the reason you'll routinely wind up circling the city with nothing to do.Omikron is a long amusement, yet none of its play parts are fulfilling, and rather they all vibe like they've been executed to give helping from each other, as when Omikron's deceptive exchange offers approach to manage winding, and when the meandering forms into shooting, and when the overlong gunfight at long last comes down to a reasonable one-on-one fight.Regardless of the way that Omikron impeccably moves between its differing play styles, these grungy play mechanics are as moved as they are unenjoyable. In the event that you like experience redirections, first-particular shooters, and doing fighting beguilements, then you'll number various cases inside every sort that beat Omikron supportively. Similarly, in the event that you don't incline toward these sorts of beguilements, you'll see that Omikron's development groupings smash the pacing of and raise the mistake with what may have been exceptional off as a more customary issue distraction. In either occasion, you'll see that Omikron's deduced progression and ingenuity connote just the silly blend of insignificant yet to an awesome degree without a doubt comprehended play styles.

The story has a fairly silly premise, but is executed fairly well, and is fully voice-acted. David Bowie's cameos are fantastic, but the concerts will drag if you're not into his stuff. Even when he's not involved, the music is still fairly well composed. The controls haven't aged poorly, and the only complaint is that it's built for a gamepad, however, the controls are rebindable, so that's not a big deal. The shooting segments are somewhat awkward, but it may just be personal experience, since I haven't played the game for over 10 years. Puzzles are sometimes cryptic, but the solution generally presents itself in some format, as long as the player's been diligent about picking up EVERYTHING. The lip-sync gets pretty laughable, but it's impressive for a game this old, considering it animates the entire face.The open world is interesting to explore, though it can get a bit tedious since there isn't much to do outside the main story. Variation between the multiple characters is great, and players can always find someone who is fully capable, or at the very least, looks like a badass.I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves classic adventure games or David Bowie."

I had this bug and on top of that it was immediatly followed by a rotating platform not being where it was supposed to be but being offset by some meters/feet, rotating in the air, thus making the level impossible, forcing me to reload my last save, wich led to me rage-quitting and writing this probably biased review.So I own the european boxed copy since my early pubescence and until now, I was not able to finish this game due to bugginess/incompatibility.

In addition the ability to switch your character (the you that you're playing as) between various characters (of different genders and races) in the setting provides an intersting way to explore those identities within the culture.

He will start to turn around, like a weirdo.  Shoot him in that little blue oval between his shoulder blades.  This will take various tries, he can wriggle out of this, but whatever.  This is FAR easier/actually possible, as compared to the circel/strafe crap everyone else feeds you.  Largely because his jump attack is apparently triggered mostly by being stunned, and this doesn't require stunning.  Also, he's in a glitch trying to, I dunno, turn around to leave? and so he never jumps.  So you can just shoot away.  It's great.  Unless you love annoying boss battles, just do this."

Even after rebinding most of the keys to make the terrible controls bearable, half of them don't work properly. Rebinding Run to Left Shift so it works with WASD for some reason breaks it. Minutes past the overlong and offputting opening sequence and I'm struggling to actually work the game. I may revisit it at some point in the future but for now it's simply a disappointment after all these years waiting to have a go."

The exploration part plays just like a Resident Evil game(tank controls), the shooting and fighting sections while somewhat clunky, they are manageable with the right strategy. The story could be a bit more subtle with all the ""videogame"" thing, but it's understandable since in that time they were trying meta narratives.Yeah, good game."

I should have known that something was wrong the moment that I was unable to take screenshots of the game with Steam. I don't know who thought having four different sets of controls that needed to be rebinded individually was a good idea, but I sure hope that they've since moved on from game design. The game dumps you into a really bad sci-fi setting with pretty much zero context and practically no explanation on how to do anything. Tank controls were the order of the day back when this was made but I imagine that even back then Omikron would have been awful. This whole game is proof that videogames were a mistake, Omikron was a mistake.I couldn't even enjoy David Bowie."

The gameplay flips (often without notice) between third person exploration, first person shooting, and complex fighting sequences. It's weird and inconsistent in every way, but the overall story and experience is unique enough to warrant a purchase."

The story starts as an eerie investigation into a dangerous conspiracy operating at the top levels of an authoritarian power that controls all aspects of the dark city you find yourself in. Later, it suddenly branches out into an Islamic mysticism inspired alien/demon fantasy.David Bowie's involvement goes beyond the animated performance of original songs, he clearly had input into the lore and worked alongside David Cage at least to some degree.Fledgling Quantic Dream + David Bowie branching out = A flawed game, but creative gold!Ignore the #hours played on Steam, I experienced this on the Dreamcast over 15 years ago."
