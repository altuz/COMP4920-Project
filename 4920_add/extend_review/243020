It runs at a set resolution of slightly smaller than this text box, has missing music and incorrect textures.Now Pandemonium is a game from my childhood, and one that I still adore today. I still don't think I've played another platformer like it likely because it was awkward as hell if you did not know the level layout, with slides launching you at incredible speeds through networks of death traps which could only be dodged by trial and error. That had however made replaying this over and over extremely fun, which cemented this as one of my favourite ps1 games.This port however is garbage. Don't buy it.Here's the ""100% legal"" way to play this game on your computer with no major bugs, correct music, a gamepad and a high resolution:Go onto ebay and pickup a genuine Playstation copy of Pandemonium! as well as a Playstation of your choice.Copy the bios of the Playstation and run the CD with an emulator such as EPSXE.This is all totally necessary to not harm Square Enix or whoever owns the Pandemonium IP now.This one hundred percent genuine and legal emulation is all you need to run the significantly better Playstation version of this game."

It's nice that I can have it on Steam because the old disk is now practically done for, after almost 2 decades of service!While this is almost the exact same game on PC as it is on PSX, there's the different music (one track I do not recognize because it wasn't from the PSX version), the different controls that took some time getting used to (wish I could remap the controls to something more favorable), and lack of an options menu in the main menu also threw me off.But there's the levels themselves, still beautiful in my eyes thanks to nostalgia. The fun of becoming a frog that belly-slams weird mushroom guys, a rhino that teaches those desert-bull things a lesson, even becoming a fire-breathing dragon that toasts flying shark-torpedos!So don't like the recorded hours fool you, I've played this game in upwards of hundreds of hours, possibly even a thousand by now!

This might not sound like a big deal, but as for me personally it compeltly kills the game. When graphics werent as specutaculr as today games got away without the best by keeping the player engaged through the music. I loved playing this game on playstation and bought it knowing the game inside out. Without the music it feels like its had its soul ripped out by the publishers - and as you progress through the game and the levels get longer and longer the music thing becomes a much bigger problem. Theres also the issue of 'fade ins' and 'fadeouts' that I dont think I ever experienced on the orignal. IE after about 2 mins of music it stops and fades in. This also happens when you die.Also they decided to rebind the keys. I have no clue why. Im playing on a PS3 controller, using software that maps the buttons. What was the jump button is now Square, the fire weapons is now Cross. Whats really annoying is that the pause button isnt mapped at all. So if you enter the wrong level you cant get out. Pressing 'esc' on the keyboard closes the game.On the plus side - load times dont exsist and frame rate is much better than the oringal. Id say the game runs slightly faster than the orignal.Really lame borked version of a fantastically fun game."

(1996 and brought to you by Crystal Dynamics)We embark on an adventure caused by the mishaps of Fargus the Joker and Nikki, a young sorceress. She singlehandedly caused the destruction of their local town by casting a spell from a tome. They quest to reach something known as the Wishing Engine to restore the town to its previous condition.We have ourselves a ""not quite 3D"" deal, here. The gameplay itself is 2D, but you can expect the ""typical for its time"" 3D rendering. There's a wide variety of stages to challenge, here. Fortresses, forests, deserts, mystical temples... (Even sawmills?!?!) and each house their own cast of troublesome foes, acrobatics and platforming scenarios. The music has a very unique fusion going on, as composed by Burke Trieschmann, instilling feelings of adventure and mysticism along the way. (Dungeon Tower... great example.).  The controls are simple, but don't harbour forgiveness for you - precision is the name of the game. Fargus and Nikki each have their own special ability for you to use at your leisure throughout the adventure. Fargus provides an offensive spin, whilst Nikki has the perks of double jumping. You also have the joy of selecting whoever you wish for every level.Overall? I'd recommend it. It's challenging, it's an adventure and offers players an acrobatic, fantasy fuelled twist on platforming with a superb soundtrack to accompany your escapades."

It was the original soundtrack - and you'd better believe I still was able to recognize and hum along more than a piece. I loved it the first time I heard it and I loved it now replaying it on my PC. I've had levels playing in the background just to listen to the track.- The colours. Graphics were old and not at all updated - but colours and scenery in this game are to die for. I've loved especially the last set of levels, with their airy and bright feeling changing slowly into nightmarish, dark backgrounds.- The credits level. No, really. It was almost worth it just to play that level - it's SO SATISFYING.- The degree of difficulty. Yes, it's a difficult game. Yes, you'll die a lot of times. So nice having to try hard and do your best.The CONs:- The low resolution. It's a 640x480 and it shows. On the bright side, your PC will be barely able to notice the work going on.- The sound level. You've to exit the game and lower/raise the sound like this (or to use the ESC button, your choice). That's annoying - especially if you're playing in the middle of the night and you've forgotten to regulate the sound before going in Pandemonium mode.- The clear laziness of the port - yeah, sorry. It was clearly simply exported from PS to PC without breaking a sweat.- The degree of difficulty. Yes, it's a difficult game. You'll want to throw away your keyboard. Don't do it. Keyboards are pricey.I was able to find 4 on 5 Hearts Container without any help - the fifth one, hidden in one of the first levels, I discovered by searching online, I'll admit. All of my blessing to the players whom were able to find it by their own strenght: you're gods and I'll worship you.Going back from time to time to recharge your lives by playing the first levels will help with the hardest steps. To pause - that was one of my fears born by reading other reviews - you just have to press ESC. The same goes for changing controls on your keyboard; you can literally personalize everything.7.5/10Suggested if you've time, patience and flexibility and if you don't need perfect graphics to have fun."

Why can't I? Well because this is an incredibly lazy port of it. The controls aren't even wasd, until you find out that there is sort of an options menu, but only in-game. Apparently even the PS1 game had a sound menu, but we don't get one. That is a huge problem because of the constantly looping background music, that is INCREDIBLY LOUD.EDIT: It is possible to find the options, though they are only available in-game, as previously stated. What's worse than the game not having a sound option? Well, a lot of things, specifically Hitler, and that said sound options in the menu DO NOT EVEN WORK. You have the slider to turn the music off, but it's just as loud no matter what you do. I reccommend plugging in your headphones, and just not wearing them at all.By far though, the game's biggest sin is laziness. It has a password system. Some of you might be a little nostalgic for passwords, but no. It's a port to the PC, we have internal storage, there's no reason for this game to require passwords anymore, but there they are... Again, you have to look in the menu for them, and you can't copy/paste the passwords either, which means writing them all down! You get the passwords in a little window that says ""Message from programmer dude."" So that basically sums it up, they just made one guy sit down at his desk for 45 minutes and port this game so they could put it out on Steam. Not worth your money unless you are extremely nostalgic for this game, and if you have it on your Play Station, that's probably the way you should play it."

You bought this game in the mid-90s for your grey slab and you loved it. I know this well because I was you, and I still am.The only reason you're here is because you saw your childhood (or adolescenthood w/e) was put up in the shopfront and ported to your shiney game tower format. So did I. But do not let its looks deceive you! This version of the game is a straight, low reolution, low-poly, lo-fi, exact replica of the Playstation classic. This is why it is bad. This is why you shouldn't buy it. You already have the disc, and you probably have at least a PS2 you can run it on. Go do that. Or rip your BIOS from your console and emulate the game. But do not buy this. not for £2, not for £1. Not even for the £0.69 I was on sale for last month.The main problem with this game is control. PCs have 1000000000000000000000000000's of options for controllers. you can use anything from an 8 button fightstick to a 109 key Keyboard, with pads, joysticks, flightsticks, lightguns, keyboards (MIDI this time) etc in between. Although the game received my Motioninjoy xbox360 pad input OK, the button mappings were way off, all over the place! UNACCEPTABLE! This problem is joined onto the next; buttonpresses and keystrokes are not always registered. Being a game with doublejump, only registering a doublejump every third of fourth try is no good. no good at all. Although it brings back cheery memories of being bad at this game when I was 7, I'm only bad at this game now because the game doesn't respond,Very Fustrating.There are also no options in game for sound levels. no master, no music, no SFX. nada. If you want pandemonium to be quiet you have to (sacrifice a small goat and pray to your God) alt-tab, and then alter the levels in the windows sound manager. And then (sacrafice another goat...) alt-tab back.Now let's talk about the glorious retro graphics. Being a bad port the game is available in one of four very small, very strange resolutions. three of which will crash the DirectDraw application the software goes through. The one that works, and it is very shaky, will look bad. I am the kind of guy who complains about a 960p upscale resolution, and some people will cast that comment aside. But imagine upscaling an analog monitor's grainy, pixelly, 700px wide display onto a screen almost 3x the size. please take a moment to think about how this looks. it's like watching a 240p film on youtube. vbad.This writing has caused me to start losing good grammar so the rest will just be pros and cons.pros+fast way to waste excess money+you can own pandemonium on your PC+retro nostalgiacons-fast way to waste excess money-you can buy CSGO keys instead of this-buggy DirectDraw launcher and DX handler-poor controller compatibility-no config menus for anything-bad button response-nothing is remastered-shaky alt-tabbingIn summary, go just get your old PSX, PS1 or PS2 and this disc and play it, or use your BIOS and epsxe to emulate your PS1 with some GFX upgrades, like smoothed textures, extended rendering and 1080p resolutions.
