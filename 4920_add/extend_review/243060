Well now you can!Urban Chaos is a fun semi-sandbox-ish action-adventure with guns, melee, vehicles (that are horrible) and a nightclub where you can dance. Sounds like something you've seen before? Sure you have, but this blew my mind back in 1999, and I still think it holds up."

,Recommended,243060,31598752,Posted: 7 May,all,Whiteswart,"Bet you know the deal already, right? Catchy product name, the female protagonist, tough police woman with the duty to clear the city from punks, mobsters and even demons eventually? A semi-open world game in a 3d, from the time when the games were looking much better in the 2d? A game where you running through the streets and climbing over the rooftops, driving cars, kicking punks in the balls, arresting them afterwards?Oh, c'mon, either you've come there by some nostalgia link, like a video talking about noticeable 3d open world projects before GTA 3... Or you just liked the name of the game, right?Well, in that second case, I urge you to look the other way, please. Yeah, sure, Urban Chaos looks not bad for a 1998 year product. There are surely the whole lot of a fun gameplay, with completing police missions, occasional beating & arresting simple pedestrians ""just in case"", et cetera, et cetera. 2 buttons combat is actually working, almost the same as in the Sleeping dogs. Same with the driving - with an exception that you can't change the car you're driving while you're in it. ""Tanner, you're a slow pluck"" - we all heard that thousands of times, but believe me, our heroine here, Darci Stern, is slower and clumsier.Now, we're finally coming to the actual question: is it worth any actual gameplay interest now? Well, hardly. Being one of the first doesn't make you the best, obviously. While there are surely a lot of fun around, all is going to waste, as the controls just really bad and irresponsive. At least they were for me, and when I was trying to perform something fast, holding 3-4 buttons at the same time, the game just got stuck. Guess I'm not that manly anymore, striving through the really bad controls to see the good out of the game. But, Oni, a Bungie underrated gem, was blamed for the bad controls as well by some people, and how they were wrong! Maybe it's only my whining, if you're really into old games, maybe you'll like it. Don't look at videos, try the controls for yourself!Me? I'll stick with Heavy Metal FAKK 2, Oni and Rune. And GTA 3, as it certainly better in all but the fact you're need to play for a criminal. But, I have True Crime Streets of LA, and that's already another league. Too bad so many of those named games were deleted from Steam...Mark 5/10."

I spent countless hours playing and replaying this game, and it was the greatest!I remember coming home from school many times and asking to play this game, I was legitimately excited to play this. So when I discovered earlier today that this game is on sale for £1.24, how could I refuse?!In the many hours playing this game as a child I eventually found some pretty game breaking bugs like being immune to fire with a pistol equipped. Or when you back to a wall, tap forward, back to the wall again without moving forward or back, tap forward again and suddenly you're at the top of the building. Can legit finish the jumper mission in about less than 30 seconds using that glitch. And can't figure out how to get to that enemy on the top of the building? Have no fear! The backing-into-a-wall-to-get-to-the-top-of-the-building bug is here!Bugs aside, the game still runs like a dream, for its time the combat is really smooth, movement handles well on both foot and vehicle (once you adjust to the unorthidox control scheme). The max resolution however is only 1024 x 768~, which is fine for a 16 year old game, it meant that when I tried to stream it I just had to capture the game via monitor recording, rather than window/game capture, but it was no biggy. The voice acting is superb for its time too, there are a lot of old games with awful voice acting *cough* Resident Evil *cough* that make you cringe at every scene with dialogue, but not with this game.So to conclude:Urban Chaos, a hidden gem that time forgot, sadly ahead of its time, I have still yet to meet a person who has actually heard, let alone played this game (it was released a full 2 years before the likes of GTA 3). Dated graphics and sound but great voice acting.So that aside I give this game a solid 8/10, would definitely recommend - especially with it being £1.24 for the next couple days."
,Recommended,243060,10656309,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Sarah,"Consider this more of a ""first impressions"" type thing.This game is surprisingly quite neat! It's levels are large and to a degree, partially non-liniar which makes them fun to explore as you do the various missions in each level, and the sound design is decent. The graphics are extremely dated, but by no means are they ugly. AND the game stars an interesting woman of colour as it's protagonist so yay for inclusiveness!The biggest issues are going to be it's lack of native support for higher resolutions & wide screen, and it's clunky and tricky to get used to controls. You CAN fix the resolution issues if you google search it, but you need to download an alternate executable for the game, so make sure you're happy to do that or live with the default limitations. The controls on the other hand have no easy fix. The keyboard is ill suited to it, and the 360 controller seems to have troubles mapping correctly and registering it's analogue sticks. I have found reasonable success with my PS2 controller, but your milage may vary. Suffice it to say, as awkward as the controls are, they are not inpenetrable, and if you can find your groove with them, the game plays very smoothly.If you're looking for ""the origional open world game"", this is not what you're looking for. You select a map, pick a mission, and go do that mission. If I had to liken it to something, it would be Super Mario 64 with it's painting worlds. But if you're willing to learn to grapple with a clunky control scheme, then there's actually a lot to like about this one!"

I haven't played it in 15 years.. and I have to say restarting it, it STILL was how I remember. I'm glad I picked it back up. I love it! Yeah there's a couple frustrating bits for PC (Windows 8, play 24bit; no current issues) combat wise. However, all around I still love it years later."

I reccomend to play it with a PS1 Controller, you can buy such an USB adapter for about 3€(Yep, really that cheap)And such a controller should everyone own if not, they are cheap too(ofc. they are, they are 22 years old)Well anyway, great game, for only 6€~$Yeah buy it, play it, love it!"

,Recommended,243060,7894915,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,Opt1mystyq,Bought for nostalgia reasons. The game runs fine on my sytem Windows 8 64bit. There's no controller or mouse support but game works fine with the keyboard. Game crashed after 15 minutes i wasnt able to beat the first tutorial as the controls are not very smooth and the time limit was pretty tight. May try again later but too many other games to get through without having to deal with poor controls and crashing.

After around ten minutes the game becomes extremely laggy for no apparent reason, and even the main menu seems unresponsive at times. It also doesn't handle the 360 controller very well, but I hardly expected it to. My generic joypad works fine with the game, however.I honestly can't recommend this version, but if you're lucky enough to run it without any issues or you can find an old PS1 copy of the game, give it a chance. It's an immensely underappreciated game. Open world (to a limited degree) driving, fighting, shooting, platforming and the like -- how can you go wrong? And this was long before the overused ""GTA clone"" label was applied to almost every similar style of game beyond the release Grand Theft Auto III."

When the controls were ""working"", they were sloppy and awful, with really poor collision detection.Pass on this, even as a curiousity!"

,Not Recommended,243060,13243909,"Posted: 5 December, 2014",all,Dillinger,"Speaking as someone who had never played this game before, I really can't find anything to recommend about it. Maybe it played better on consoles back when it first came out, but unless you have some deep nostalgia for it, I suggest you give it a pass. Any enjoyment I might have derived from this game was lost in the numerous design and control issues.I've never been a fan of tank controls, but in conjunction with an unruly camera with no mouse support and combat that demands immediate reaction it becomes extremely frustrating. The melee system allows you to perform combos, but you never will, because it's faster to just grapple the enemy and cuff him while he's on the ground. Guns have to be locked onto an enemy to hit, and trying to get locked onto the right enemy in the heat of battle while having to keep constantly on the move to evade enemies' bullets is no easy task. There are just too many annoyances in the combat to delve into all of them; getting caught in 'melee mode' so it becomes impossible to flee, enemies constantly sliding to knock you down the instant they get close, the list goes on.On top of the combat issues, some of the game's mechanics only serve to compound the problem. There's no map, so it becomes an ordeal to navigate to several of your objectives, especially when the only way there is via a convoluted route across the rooftops that starts nowhere near the objective itself. There are no checkpoints and no way to save mid-mission, but many missions are way too long for such a handicap, especially considering that you'll also have to redo any side events or collectibles you got if you die. The story is pretty bare bones and towards the end takes on a supernatural element that goes completely unexplained.Unless you've got a history with this game it's really not worth your time or money, even if it's dirt cheap."
