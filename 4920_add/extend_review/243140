If you like games with modern graphics and oldschool platform mechanics, you can´t go wrong getting this one! Good music, too! Unfortunately, it´s short (you can beat it in 3 ~ 4 hours)."
,Recommended,243140,13156937,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,internisus,"When I began playing Glare, my initial impression was of a competent and polished platformer that, while pleasant, was unremarkable.  However, the more I played, the more my expectations were defied—not suddenly, all at once, but gradually as the game continued to add new moves to my repertoire and gently ramped up the complexity of the challenges to which I needed to apply them.  In the end, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game.The action here is kinetic as you fly down ziplines and hurl yourself between floating launchers while avoiding brambles, spikes, and lava.  You regularly stop to fight off enemies, but later in the game you often have to deal with them on the move or while in a precarious position, like in the middle of a delicate wall cling maneuver.  You come to navigate obstacles while moving with great speed, intuiting what you need to do next on the fly.  It feels good.The stages do not simply progress from side to side but lead you in all directions through intricately crafted, occasionally clever level design, facilitated by a camera that pans and angles around the pretty 2.5D environment with careful scripting.  Although your path sometimes loops back across itself pleasingly after you gain a new ability, this is a thoroughly linear game, not a Metroid descendant.Every time I expected Glare to do something lazy, it surprised me and did something fun instead.  After passing a few rock barriers that were colored differently from the ones that I could break with my bomb attack, I was prepared to find a simple upgrade to that move; instead, an effect was added to my slide, which meant that I had to find the right way to use terrain if I wanted to smash through those rocks.  Then I found situations in which I was required to chain my slide to break multiple barriers, and soon I was burning through sloped corridors filled with ineffectual enemies that were there just so that I could enjoy tearing through them with this screw attack analogue.  Instead of just giving me the key to this lock, the game added a wrinkle that affected everything.That's what it's like.  It does the fun thing.  Glare is not some amazing, must-play game, but it also never meant to be; it just wants to be a good platformer.  And it really is.(Note: Steam failed to record my play time.  I completed Glare in one sitting over the course of about 2 1/2 hours, so disregard the stated play time.)"

,Not Recommended,243140,14537682,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,"""Bob"" the Space Cadet","Glare is a pretty neat little platformer with some interesting and fun game mechanics, the controls are pretty tight, and it has fairly nice graphics, but it somehow still manages to be somewhat bland. Glare doesn't offer much incentive to clean the planet of the darkness, the character shows no emotion (to be fair it is just light in a suit of armor, but still!), and the game really could have used some sort of narration to make the player care more about the planet they are sent to rescue.The main issue I have with the game-play is that the boss fights are uninspired. Each boss is essentially the same, only with increasing numbers of standard enemies floating around the central thing you're trying to destroy in a small circular area where you just float about shooting. If you're going to make a platformer with clever platforming mechanics like snapping to lantern-like objects by using your light glaring power on them or zip-lining on beams of light, then why not use those cool platforming mechanics in a boss fight?Another beef I had with this game was that you are supposed to look for hidden artifacts as a kind of bonus treasure hunt where you need to look at areas off the set path, however while doing this I accidentally ended up going back a much earlier area which I could not return from, and thus had to re-run the whole area... with all the enemies respawned. If you're going to make players search for hidden objects, don't make it so painful; it's meant to be a pleasure to run around looking for those things, not a tedious chore which could punish you for looking in the wrong spot.I really wanted to like this game, but it just felt a little soulless and not enough incentive was given to push forward. You're supposed to be ridding the world of darkness, but all enemies respawn, and when you do get to a kind of a darkness-infected pool-thing, control is taken away from you and the game does the work for you. Comparatively, in ""Waking Mars"" I felt like I was doing meaningful work by terraforming Mars and making it habitable by planting alien plant-like lifeforms to create a stable ecosystem. Glare totally missed the mark on this front by not letting the player feel that they are making a difference by cleaning the darkness from the planet.The final word?If you want to save a planet, play ""Waking Mars"". If you want to play a pretty 3D-like platformer, play ""Trine"".5/10 Would not illuminate."

The platforming is fun and fluid, but with a maximum of 3 hours for a single playthrough I honestly can't say I'd recommend it for that price. If you're the type of person that wants to refine their run times to get the achievements, then perhaps it's worth for you. Unfortunatly I'm not that person and I can't recommend this for the price."

I've only beaten the first 3 levels of the game so far but it's quite enjoyable and well done.  The controls are great, the gameplay is familiar but unique, the graphics are solid and the concept is cool.  There really isn't a story that develops so really don't download this if you want a deep experience.  But if you want something fun, unique and well put together and you enjoy platformers, then I think you'll enjoy Glare."

,Not Recommended,243140,23659767,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Zet,"There are far worse games on Steam and compared to some Early Access trash that has a place in the store, this game is actually very playable. Gamepaly wise, it's certainly not outstanding, it's like a twinstick platformer that plays alright with a controller. I've seen better controls but they do their job. So the first impression would be, this is an average platformer game that brings you some fun.However, where this game fails is consistency. The logic of how the game is ordered doesn't make a lot sense to me. When I played through it, I was wondering the whole time what the game actually wants to be. First it gave the impression of a puzzle platformer like Trine, then it became more like a Run and Gun like a soft version of Contra, the next level it suddenly seemed to be more like a Sonic-esque speed game and in the end neither of these passages didn't feel extraordinarily polished. It would've been way better if this game focused on one gameplay type and made that one a solid mechanic. These gameplay inconsitencies bring a very steep difficulty curve with them, especially towards the end. Especially the final stage felt rather unfair to me, since many parts of the level required many trial and error runs. However, these trial and errors were broken down by an unusal long respawn time (compared to other games of the trial and error concept, e.g. Super Meat Boy) and a fade out and fade in of the music, what totally stopped the pacing every single time. Good luck to those going for the no death achievement...All of this is really sad, as the game could have been so much better and beared some potential, but the lack of focus in design ultimately broke it for me."

,Recommended,243140,13606428,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,Cyril,"On some fronts, this is a very good game. The graphics are fantastic and the level design is consistently great and enjoyable. On other fronts, there are some huuuuge problems that tarnish the experience a little.The biggest problem is the level length; I think this game would've been much better suited to shorter levels, say, 3 per world, rather than having these massive monstrosities of levels. It makes it more tedious to go back and explore for artifacts, and much more frustrating to speedrun. The 4th stage has an 18 minute time limit for the speedrun achievement, for crying out loud. The levels just drag on, though the obstacles and challenges that make them up are on the whole enjoyable.There's also some cases of enemy spam; a section in the 5th level is particularly notable for this but it's a problem a lot of the game faces. The final stage also has minor RNG that can add to enemy spam, too, which is less than fun. All 5 main stages have essentially the same boss battle, with just a few more things flying about each time; wait for boss to be vulenrable, shoot a lot, repeat two more times, don't die. The bosses being fought different from how the rest of the game is played don't help matters at all. They're not great bosses, though, I would say.A few lesser gripes are that the background can be too busy sometimes, making it hard to tell where things are (or too zoomed out, in a few cases). The 5th stage is also a bit too dark, I feel. The music is kind of repetitive and bland, as well, nothing memorable about it and considering how long the stages are it's not hard to get sick of it quick. As well, the double jump mechanic sometimes fails to work properly, plenty of cases where I should've had a double jump but it didn't activate for some reason.Anyways that's the negatives. Looking past them, you have a solid, enjoyable platformery romp of a game. The character movement is by default pretty swift and you get powerups to make it even more so. The combat is generally enjoyable, giving you several ways to go about fighting and keeping things fast paced without being overly difficult. And the level designs are pretty varied, each world is unique in its own way and they squeeze a lot of potential out of the game mechanics and game engine. I definitely enjoy how the game plays, on a basic level. It's not especially original but it's refined well enough that it doesn't need to be, because it does what it does very well. I do like this game a lot, it has its issues but they're not enough to ruin the core gameplay being very fun and tricky but never overly challenging."

,Recommended,243140,13677001,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,digivampire,"Very solid platformer that does not have much original, but it does what it does good. This is purely action based platformer, where you will be repelling, shooting, jumping, sliding and climbing. The combination of all those makes for a speedy game especially in the later stages. Levels are large but typically save points are close enough to respawn should you trip. Difficulty goes up but so do your powers, as the game tries to exploit all of them to the max as you acquire them.Pros:- Great graphics and animation, fluid movements, speedy gameplay- Solid music, nothing to write home about- AddictiveNeutral:- No story, that's ok, just get to the end, shoot and watch out for spikes- Going back for artifacts forces you to replay whole level, sadness ensuesCons:- Bosses on first 5 levels suck, they are all basically the same with a few additions added in every level. They can be challenging but fairly dull after you get through 2 of them.- Last (6th) level is tough and can be very unfair in the way it spawns critters. This is further made difficult by the fact there is only a single save point for the whole level roughly half way, which will result in many many repeats unless you are a platform god. Artifical difficulty much? Still its doable and with little persistence...7/10 Very solid, some flaws but worth the afternoon."

From the starry sky in the background to the levels, everything looks nice. Overall, I liked the level design. Every level introduces new mechanics or changes old ones. Though the mechanics are simple, they were used in intersting and novel ways. Every level had a moment where I thought, ""Oh wow, this is really cool."" The platforming reminded me of Raymond 2, which I think it was one of the best platforming games.That being said, the game certaintly has its flaws. The levels are pretty empty. I don't know why I'm going saving these planets because there doesn't seem to be anyone to save. The levels ended up being empty and lonely. Altough, I think this does work in the Ice level.The boss fights, barring the last one, are the all the same. Though they grow progressively more complex, they all end up being flying around shooting a giant blob. I wish they were more like the final boss and incoprated the mechanics of the specific world.Is this game worth 10$? I don't know. I got on it on sale, and it was definintely worth the price I paid. I did enjoy it. I just wish there were interaction and life."
