76561198099704746,Not Recommended,243160,18704721,"Posted: 26 October, 2015",all,Terrahex,"Mushroom 11 is an incredibly unique game, and I love it. it's unique style and gameplay make it stand out from any other game I've ever played. The fungal ooze you play as is awesome as is the mechanics of erasing to get the fungus thing to grow in other places in order to move is genius, and the first few levels are an absolute blast to play.Then, all the game's flaws are pushed to the forefront after the first level or two.See, while you can erase parts of the fungus to make it grow in other directions, you have absolutely no control over where else it grows. while this isn't a problem while moving forward, during delicate tasks like riding rockes or moving up cliffs or cielings is an absolute chore and extremely frustrating experience.Several times, the game asks you to cut your fungus in half in order for you to move on, and, since you have no control over what grows where, you'll find yourself moving smaller and smaller pieces while the half you're not touching grows bigger and bigger.Moving in water is finicky and sometimes the developers ask you to 'jump' out of the water, which I could never figure out how to do with any reliability, and it took me about 10 minutes just to get past the first air vent in the 7th chapter (the chapter I am still on as I write this)I spent about a minute fighting the boss of episode 6 only to spend about 20 minutes trying to get across the gap that he occupied.Honestly, this game is a frustrating mess and I wouldn't suggest anyone buys it unless it's five bucks on sale."

In a marketplace full of rigid game genres, annualized franchises, and me-too clones, It's a very rare occurance when I can say that a game is 100% unique. If novelty is your thing, look no further than Mushroom 11.I truly have never played or even seen a game like this one before. Mushroom 11 is based on the surprisingly simple mechanic of forcing your ""mushroom"" (it looks more like a green mass) to grow by destroying parts of it. Basically, it grows opposite of where you prune so if you want it to grow left, you cut the right side of it and vice-versa. Using this mechanic, you must navigate the desolate wasteland of a post-appocalyptic Earth. If this is difficult to understand, you're probably better off watching a video of this game in motion.Where you are takeing your mushroom, I don't know. What the overall goal is, I don't know that either, but so far I have played the first chapter and I'm having a blast.Pros:+ Genuinely100% unique.+ Long, intersting level design+ Fantastic artwork+ Challenging, especially if you try for 100% and absorb everything+ The Mushroom is a treat to control+ I have no idea what to expect next+ Uniquely suited to the PC+ Fun boss fightsCons:- Can't use a controller (probably for the better, I don't even know how this would work, but some may see this as a con)"

,Recommended,243160,25506577,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Browniemixx,"I feel attention is due to this unique puzzle game I've come across. My verdict is:It is definitely worth checking outBut if you are looking for something more in depth then read away...Ever since I saw the first teaser for this in 2013 I was ecstatic for something this strange and intriguing for a physics-puzzle title set in some strange overgrown apocalyptic world. The artist who did the music created an eerie atmosphere with each world, 7 in total that had there own characteristics and enemy types that add to a DNA based score system when you have the 'bacteria' you control consume it.Within moments of it starting the game tells you everything that is needed, You don't control the green entity yourself you mearly control its growth with the two mouse buttons(I stritckly use a keyboard and mouse when playing so I don't know the specifics for controllers) by erasing parts letting it grow outwards whichever way works. The two buttons have a different size based on whether or not you want to finely erase with the right mouse button or take out a decent chunk with the left. Many mechanics are introduced throughout the levels with wildly varying types sometimes only shown once other times in many formats through the game.each level is roughly the same in execution: Go through the level introduced to new mechanics that progressively become more complex the further in, come across some alter form of ultra bacteria killer, learn a thing or two about what went wrong with civilizatoin and where things began to sway from what we're used to, and fight a particular boss that may pertain to some relative history of that place.Now for the gritty part, this game has an EXTREME escallation in it's difficulty probably somewhere between Chapter 5 and the start of six I ended up spending more and more time on single puzzles than I do the entire game. Certain physics are introduced that require precision and timing with erasing the bacteria and by the time I got to the final chapter I was taking long breaks because of how long I spent on it. This was mostly due to having a hard time figuring out the way it was supposed to be solved because occasionally I would spend more time solving it one way that ends up taking longer than the desired approach since the game doesn't exactly tell you HOW it gets done just that it can be done in any way desirable.Now you don't need to play them all the way through as you can exit at any time and come back to the same puzzle though in doing so it will stop tracking the time at which you played.Now all these issues could easily have been fixed by now since I played it before they added the cloud saving which is something I am grateful for since it is important to be able to save that progress to other systems or when something happens that erases your data. Another thing that might've been fixed since playing were some of the puzzles so any serious gripes I may have had with the difficulty spike may have been fixed although it is hard to say without going all the way through that stuff again.I think I've said my piece on how I feel about this whole thing so what's the verdict on MY reccomendation and pricing? I will say YES, if a unique physics based puzzle platformer is what you are looking for then by all means try it out. I will say the price may be a bit much as I originally was able to beat the whole thing within 8 hours so you might want to wait for a slight sale before paying top dollar."

Some parts of it are done really, really well, while other not so much.Good things first:1.  Control scheme. Your play as a hive-mind fungi colony. And it has a pretty unique way of moving - you must grow to move. However, you cannot grow out of thin air; you are a living form, so you need fuel to do that. You must sacrifice parts of your colony, to make another part grow. Here comes the tricky part - you can't control the exact part of colony which will grow, you can only rely on it being on the opposite side of the destroyed part. You can also divide your colony, if you need to, but remember - the smaller part will die. Basically, to succeed you must think as hive-mind fungi colony.2. Level design. The authors decided to go with visual narration for their story, so the levels and backgrounds will tell you what happened. Wander through traps and debris of the abandoned world and absorb the history of a now-dead civilization. There are also hazards waiting for you, but they are generic: toxic liquids, spikes, fire, etc.3. Physics. It brings at least half of the fun. Let me give you an example. There is a puzzle in the game, where you attach your colony to a rotating gear, and then detach a tiny part of the fungi at a right moment, so it will reach a higher place, and then you do your best in destroying the main body (which is still on a rotating gear mind you), so the colony's small part can make it. It's pretty fun.4. Challenge. To overcome every obstacle and reach the ending, you'll need an agile mind along with good reflexes to back it up.5. Have you ever tried to defeat a level boss, playing as a fungi colony?6. Music. Developers went with electronic ambient music. Not a bad choice at all. It sets the mood and highlights some tones of crumbling world.And last two things that are not that great:1. The game is pretty short, just seven levels. It's kinda classic, but inevitably leads to next point.2. The difficulty curve rises very, very quick.Nevertheless, it's very interesting to play.So be prepared! The world of Mushroom11 is forsaken by good and is full of evil.Have fun, though!P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the steamCRIMINALLY Low Salescurator."

This is an extremely unique and smart game which is a joy to play until approximately 70-80% of the way through the puzzles take a sharp turn from ones demanding thought and innovation in order to succeed to utterly finicky nightmares where the solution is obvious but hitting microscopic timing windows while getting the janky physics to play along required me to repeat some sections close to 100 times.Still a reccomend, as it is still worth the asking price, but with some game design consultation and broader playtesting this could have been so much more.  As it is, only a very small fraction of players will have the skill and patience to finish the game - and that number will dwindle to zero for the less skilled casual audience."

Although it is a bit short, I think it is certainly worth the time to play.One of the things i like the most is the acheivement of figuring out how to do something. There is no text explaining what to do, or parts on bosses blinking to show you that they are important.  You figure all of this out your own because of the way the levels and bosses are designed to teach visually.  Finishing eacch level in my opinion was a very satisfying feat.Unfortunately a few puzzles kinda repeat themselves and others are more luck based that anything else, but I don't mind that all that much since the whole gameplay deviates from anything you've played before."

,Recommended,243160,19792537,"Posted: 19 December, 2015",all,Starstriker1,"Mushroom 11 is a beautiful, focused and elegantly designed physics puzzler with an extremely novel movement system. It has fresh ideas all the way to the end, is polished to a mirror shine, and never feels like it has extraneous bits that weren't needed. It's a tight experience that knows exactly what it is and executes with style and artistry.It's also got a gorgeous aesthetic. Seeing your blob slip through and around the beautiful apocalyptic level geometry is satisfying and cool to watch, especially when it absorbs other plants (or poison!) along the way and the foreign element spreads and diffuses into the larger structure. The boss fights at the end of each level are expertly designed and felt like novel, interesting uses of the mechanics.This recommendation comes with a severe caveat; while the physics puzzles you solves are often clever and interesting, they often demand speed and precision, especially in the later levels. The game's central mechanic is often openly hostile to these demands as it is random, touchy, and inexact. Since you only control where the mushroom is destroyed and not where it grows, puzzles that require you to spread your mushroom thin (or avoid spreading into dangerous areas) can be tedious and frustrating. It's easy to accidentally cut off too much of a mushroom, or accidentally destroy a piece you needed and flub an obnoxiously precise physics challenge. This all becomes especially apparent when you need to interact with physics objects in the game, or fling your mushroom into the air.None of this is too onerous in the first few levels of the game (and you might feel you've gotten your money's worth just from there), but by the end the difficulty curve starts to feel actively malevolent, especially when a particularily long and precise platforming segment decides to be stingy on checkpoints. This game is also not great if you have wrist problems, with lots of repetitive mouse interaction. The combination of frustrating difficulty and mounting wrist pain drove me from the game several times.If you want a beautiful and utterly unique puzzle game and don't mind that later levels of the game might be deeply frustrating, then I encourage giving Mushroom 11 a shot. As far as the core gameplay mechanic, there's nothing else out there like it, and the game is thoughtfully and elegantly designed throughout."

The puzzles tend to be tough but fair.However, the largest downside is that there should of been more check points, or atleast better placement of them. Too often a check point will have you go through something tedious to get back to a hard puzzle. So you spend 30 seconds just to get back to where you are having problems at.So yeah, check points need to be increased in number, or placed in more conveint places to avoid tedium.Edit: So the later levels gets a lot harder.

Its relatively easy to find solutions to puzzles, the real challenge is in actually executing them and unfourtunately that can be too difficult to accomplish. Since only a really hardcore player would be able to finish this game, I can't recommend it to the general gaming population. This is a good example of why it is important to have a group of testers play through a game and see if they enjoy it before actually releasing itt.

As I read further and realized the emphasis would be more about puzzles, I supposed it might be a little more like Nihilumbra, meaning slow-paced + puzzles. After actually playing for a little more than an hour, I can say for sure that Mushroom 11 is much more a puzzle game than a platformer.Is that good or bad? I don't know, depends on which of those genres you like better. Personally, I'm usually not into complex puzzle games. I often find them tedious and generally uninteresting. This one, however, just like Nihilumbra, has a unique feel to it, that got me curious enough to keep going.When I first launched the game, I picked up my Xbox controller and was expecting to play with it. When the game wasn't responding to the controller, I checked the options menu, expecting to find there an option to activate it... except there was no such option. I imagined Grumpy Cat look at me and say ""No controller for you, dumbass! Deal with it!"". So I went on and started playing with the mouse. The control felt really awkward for me at first. It took me a while to figure it out, but I have been learning along the way. Also, the game is quite challenging. Most of the puzzles got me thinking for a while before I could find the solution. Same for the bosses, and I'm only at chapter 3 (out of 7).The game looks and sounds well, the level designs are really cool, and maybe most importantly, it runs smoothly and quickly. Nothing too fancy about it - no extra weight.Ugh... what now? Oh, right - the bottom line!Well, the bottom line is, that this game is mainly about patience, creativity and solving problems. You don't need fast reflexes or a good eye-hand coordination to play, but you do need to be patient and think. If you think that's for you - Mushroom 11 will definitely be a lot of fun for you.

I should have realized that when gravity is the dominant challenging factor that it was going to hurt. Once the organism starts rolling, there's precious little to be done about it; Even while regenerating it doesn't lose any momentum. I'm not sure about the physics of that. I just wish that the puzzles could exist more like a lab experiment, something you can think about and less of tests of agility and timing. Time is spent carefully paring the organism to make it reach a ledge. But I kept forgetting to let go of the button and I'd accidentally bisect the thing and lose my work. I think that the game design has a fundamental flaw: As you kill cells the organism regrows in random directions, away from your cursor. And there are spills of separated cells that you need to clean-up or else they could become something greater. Because it is random, you can't control what you're getting. So it becomes a cycle of kill, groom, klll, groom, kill, groom, etc. And your effectiveness at being able to do this and keep the thing reasonably under control will determine whether you succeed or fail."

In some puzzles you through an area like a crazed psychopath hacking away at yourself with a chainsaw, and other times you are slicing tiny bits off with the precision of a surgeon. Both were satisfying.+ Difficult puzzles towards the end, sometimes this was frustrating, and sometimes I had to rethink my entire approach to the game, and gravity, and life, in order to solve them. One of these puzzles I swear made me a better person.- I'm a fan of post-apocalypic art styles, but this one was a bit... unpolished and overdone.- Some aspects of the game design are also not quite polished, eg. in one of the later puzzles (surgical, not chainsaw), the camera kept moving inappropriately, causing me to cut myself in half and have to start again."
,Recommended,243160,24176815,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Noven,"This is a somewhat hesitant recommendation. A handful of the later puzzles require extremely precise, methodical work, which is great until you realize the factors that combine into my 1 major issue with the game:1. The delete cursor exerts slight force on the blob.2. The random regrowth of the blob adds slight mass to a random edge of the blob and can unpredictably alter its balance.3. The camera moves based on the position of the blob (and other factors sometimes) even during these puzzles, and cannot be locked.Situations arise where these factors combine to ruin minutes of work on a puzzle and force you to reset. The worst part is that resetting these puzzles requires you to painstakingly remold the blob to the perfect, specific configuration by deleting randomly regrowing spots until they happen into the spaces you actually need them. When you need to utilize almost every single piece of the blob in precisely the right configuration, this can be pretty damn annoying to reset, work on for minutes, and then have ruined by the camera AGAIN.Now that the bad is out of the way, Mushroom 11 is otherwise a standout puzzle game. It has an innovative, cool mechanic as its foundation. The physics are tight. Guiding the blob quickly comes to feel very fluid, natural, and intuitive as you build a skill unique to this game. Best of all, with few exceptions the level design teaches you how to use this core mechanic in new ways; it rarely adds a new ""gimmick of the level"" to shake up the gameplay as mediocre puzzle games do - the progression feels quite organic.If a Camera Lock toggle was added to this game, its only significant weakness would be much improved. As is, Mushroom 11 becomes pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times. An otherwise singularly smooth, innovative puzzle game is worth that (significant) frustration."
,Recommended,243160,22830777,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,nova,"9/10Patience is the name of this game and when the art and music are as beautiful as they are in Mushroom 11, patience definitely pays off.Mushroom 11 is the most inventive puzzle platformer I've ever played. You have to evolve and adapt by 'erasing' or destroying parts of your own organism, which then grow back - but not in an order you'd expect.This allegory carries through to the game's post-nuclear plot. An organism that evolved to survive nuclear fallout would definitely have to be a highly adaptable and quickly-regenerating one.Beyond that though, my own interpretation of this game is that it also has personal and political implications. When facing a tough challenge (and believe me, the challenges in this game are tough), be flexible and adaptable enough to erase your own outmoded ideologies. You will regenerate and in the process adapt around even the most daunting challenges.This game is a work of art."

If you try to collect all of the food, be aware that some of them are placed in really cheap spots. I ignored them and moved on cause I knew it'd just be a hassle.I recommend waiting for a steam sale to buy this game."
,Recommended,243160,20579665,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,Pirateguybrush,"This is a game with a single mechanic.  Erase part of your fungus self, and you'll instantly regrow to maintain the same volume.  From that one mechanic, the developer manages to create an extremely impressive variety of gameplay, using it in different ways to manipulate the environment so you can proceed.  The difficulty can be a little uneven to the point of frustration in a few parts, and you'll need a combination of reflexes, timing, luck and puzzle solving to reach the end, but I found it to be a very enjoyable titlem, with some surprisingly good boss fights."
