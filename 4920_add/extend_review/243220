FRACT does not go out of its way to tell you what you're meant to be doing or how you're meant to do it, and indeed my first hour was spent utterly lost and wandering around the (admittedly very pretty) landscape, accomplishing absolutely nothing. That frustration led me to put it aside for a few months. But if you stick with it, you'll eventually begin to figure out this game's secrets. By the end of my playtime with FRACT I could start it up knowing exactly what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, and how I was going to do it.In FRACT, you're plunged into the trippy, Tron-like world of a gigantic yet dormant synthesizer. As you progress further and further, you'll gradually begin to bring the beast online, unlocking more and more of its features that can ultimately be put to use in an actual sequencer (your studio, as the game calls it) which you can visit at any time. This is a game where completing all the puzzles presents you with an actual reward - a fully functional digital audio workstation that is simple to play with, yet deceptively powerful under the hood.If you liked Portal's method of first-person-puzzling, and in particular if you enjoyed the dynamic nature of Portal 2's music which adapted to your progression through the puzzles, you'll likely enjoy this game. It does require a bit of initial time and patience, but it pays off in spades."

I love the music-machine feel to the game.* The puzzles do not give any sort of instruction, and give little indication of whether or not you're getting closer to the proposed solution.  You are given a toy that is 100x more complex than a Rubik's Cube™.  With no instructions and no idea what the winning conditions are.  Good luck.* The developers tell you to explore this vast world in order to activate the machine totally... but give you no map.  I recommend Youtube walkthroughs if you're a completist.  The Steam achievements for this game are not very clear, either.* The game, with its Tron-like feel, at times resembles Las Vegas.  Everything is lit up like an arcade and you have no idea where you are supposed to go next, or what is activated and what is not.  The lack of communication (e.g., score, progress, direction) with the player is terrible.Unfortunately, while the game scores great originality points with me, there was far too much else that I found lacking or frustrating so I cannot recommend it.  I hope to see a sequel or expansion with some of these issues addressed."

,Recommended,243220,12656627,"Posted: 27 October, 2014",all,Endothlyne,A highly original audio visual puzzle experience for the thinkers among us. The game plunges you into bowels of some weird alien musical instrument. Its starts out pretty lifeless with a little colour but as soon as you start solving various puzzles it starts to come to life with synth sounds and bright colours. Its like a cross between the Tron world and close encounters of the third kind mixed in with some very John Carpenter type sounds. Some of the puzzles can really leave you scratching your head. Back in the main hub as you unlock different areas you gain access to some very cool sound controls. The environment surrounding the hub comes to life as it plays your musical creations.10/10 Recommended for puzzlers looking for something different.

76561197990672230,Recommended,243220,16936397,"Posted: 7 July, 2015",all,NineByNine,"I love chillout games. I love Flower on the PS3 and Journey as well (though that's less chillout, more heartrending/warming adventure, though it is beautiful). I also have a fondness for exploration games, hence why I really enjoyed Gone Home and I quite liked Proteus. It's part of why I like ARK Survival Evolved and also why I liked Minecraft too. There was this great exploration element, as you discovered cool little neat things and such.The problem I find though is if there's nothing else but exploration, it gets really, really dull, really really fast. Proteus has this problem. It's beautiful and relaxing and charming but there's ♥♥♥♥all to DO whilst you explore. You might as well load up some ambient music and put on a few random visualisations on Winamp or WMP or something. Much the same experience.Here's where FRACT OSC gets it right though. IT GIVES YOU♥♥♥♥♥♥TO DO. Oh my god it gives you♥♥♥♥♥♥to do. It's an exploration game at heart, and a music game. It's both, and its married perfectly together. The world is made up of, controlled by, and explored through music. The music the game creates for you, the music YOU can later create with the synthesiser part of the game. But here's the thing, you can't DO that until you get some instruments. How do you get instruments? you unlock them in game. How? by rebuilding the broken down and out of order sound based tech in these ruins you find yourself in.How do you do that? by SOLVING PUZZLES WITH YOUR AWESOME INTERACTO-PUZZLEVISION :DThere's no enemies, no real threats. You can ""die"" but that boots you immediately back to the nearest checkpoint you got to. Handy, convenient, and if you don't ""die"" when you fall off something, chances are you are meant to get there or there's a way back out of it. Fall damage doesn't seem to exist, there doesn't appear to be a way to get irreversably trapped (and if there is you can always press ESC and boot back to last station again, always possible), you can fast travel between stations...Everything is done through symbols and holographic screens, no words, no voiceover expositing things to you. You gotta work it out yourself, and that's where the game truly shines, not just through the beautiful soundscapes that unlock as you solve puzzles, but because this is at once a fiendish and rewarding first person puzzler, but also a fantastic way to relax and chill out.I have worked out puzzles and whilst I would be fist pumping and cheering about how I feel like a genius, I'm too chilled the hell out to do so. I merely smile to myself, nod in time to the awesome music, and get started on FINDING the next puzzle, which in itself could be a puzzle!This is the perfect exploration/ ""walking simulator"" -puzzle game combination. You won't regret it. It's challenging, it's difficult, it's often obtuse, it is however both super relaxing, super fun, and super cunning. Get it."

You interact with a world at your own pace, and music follows your footsteps.If you have any interest in this kind of music (watch the trailer), and have a little bit of understanding of rhythm, you can play this game and enjoy it. I only played about 8 hours before solving the final puzzle, but it was easily one of my favorite games I have played in recent times. This game made me happier than any game I have played all year.It is short and minimalistic. There are few instructions, no directions, and no words. You solve puzzles, and get very little from it. But what you do get is everything that you need, perfected. There's a wonderful feeling when the bass suddenly kicks in, because you solved a puzzle, with an added kick of enjoyment from hearing *your* music incorporated into it. Exploration is rewarded by finding little crystals that sing when you get near them, or the faint sound of a puzzle in the distance as you look over a world constructed with little more than basic blocks yet is still beautiful and intriguing.The puzzles are impressive. The first puzzles you will encounter for each area are simple, preparing you for future puzzles without obvious tutorials, building to the final puzzles which can be incredibly complicated. Each puzzle is two parts - an approach puzzle, and then an ostensibly musical puzzle - yet despite what many on the internet think, each one can be solved with only logic, no brute forcing needed. There are not nearly enough puzzle games in the world that hit the right balance of solvable and difficult.tl;dr: You like music? You like puzzles? You like creating instead of destroying? Pick this up. It's worth it."

Nothing quite compares to the chilling feeling of wandering around these massive alien ruins with nothing but soundscapes of your own creation as company.It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're the kind of person that would enjoy the feeling of exploring the complex, defunct structures, wracking your brains trying to figure out the infuriatingly vague - yet very satisfying to beat - sound-based puzzles to power them up again, then I think this is for you.Or if you're a massive sound design nerd.

,Recommended,243220,28194212,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Scar,"I've owned this game for well over a year. Purchased it due to the “Tron” look it seemed to have. As you progress through the puzzles and terrain, its gets harder and harder, almost exponentially. Sorta' like if you take a penny, and double it every day, by the end of the month, you will be astronomically rich. Fract OSC is a lot like that. You'll get through a handful of the early puzzles before you start pulling your hair out. Finishing the game without either looking up puzzle resolves, or some kind of cheating, its pretty much impossible. May very well be I'm not real good at this kind of game.The game concept, visuals, music puzzle theme, is amazing and gets you hooked. Its odd feeling of being boring because you have no interaction with any AI, other characters, or any kind of dialog, doesn't seem to matter. It can be fun and entertaining without the need of familiar NPC's or character interactions. It would probably get in your way while playing. The lack of in game assistance can be pretty frustrating, for some of the puzzles are literary way over your head, and easily missed. Even if you pay attention, and make notes, sometimes the puzzle logic can be outside most players grasp. Its almost a savants delight, for every day logic may not apply unless you think way outside the box, have a photographic memory, or simply live inside the game for the rest of your life.All I can say is the developers for this concept, this game, are nothing short of genius. When you do find resolves for puzzles, whether you find them by cheating, or stumble on them by yourself, you'll sit in amazement while wondering how they designed that puzzle, and actually made it work out. These kinds of puzzles with graphics and sound, take a ton of imagination to make work right. There are puzzles that will keep you scratching your head for hundreds if not thousands of hours, and entertain you at the same time."

If you were a big fan of the MYST series, like I was, then this is perfect for you.There is no real story behind this game, and it invites you to use your imagination, to explain why everything is what it is. From the visual and aural feasts you are given, you draw your own conclusions as to what the civilization was like. There is virtually no text within the actual game, instead relying on pictures and diagrams to relay information. Music is heavily used for artistic effect, though many of the puzzlesdo not require music to solve. Instead, having an iPod or Phone handy to take quick pictures of diagrams is useful.This game requires an awful lot of backtracking, so be prepared.Beware, to run this at a constant framerate you need a decent rig, or to turn down the view distance. However, your mileage may vary. The options menu is rather sparse, lacking even a rebind keys option, which forces you to use the default bindings.This game uses flat textures and polygonal shapes to create the terrain and buildings, and personally, I think it pulls off the look quite well. For such a simple design, it is quite beautiful.The music creation tool is not something I have experimented with, but if you have any experience with music editing programs, you may find use in some of its synths. Again, your mileage may vary.In my opinion, this game does not neccesarily warrant more than one playthrough, but if you have the patience to finish the game, you should have the patience to find and collect the achievements. I'm going to be searching for them myself, as I haven't perfected the game yet.In conclusion, this game is beautiful. The art style is wonderful, but the puzzles are not for the impatient. Many of them require fine tuning and experimentation, and some of the later ones require backtracking. The options menu could do with more, but it is forgivable by a game so pretty."

I never really got stuck; the most stuck I got was trying to find the next station or something. Despite the puzzles not being challenging, they were still extremely satisfying to solve, because the music gradually builds up as you're solving it, and once the final piece clicks into place, it all comes together and sounds amazing.The visual style was very cool. The materials were bland, but the glowing lights made up for that.And of course the sound design was excellent. My only complaint would be not giving the player more freedom with the music on game, but that would probably ruin the atmosphere if the player doesn't know music. Keeping everything in the same scale/chord was a good idea.Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Not my favorite, but still a good adventure puzzle game."

That isn't to say this game isn't challenging, as some of the puzzles, especially the later ones, will likely have you scratching your head and pushing you closer and closer to the temptation of steam guides. Rather, the puzzles of the game are overshadowed by the overall atmosphere. This is a game that really does deserve to be played with the lights down, the volume up and no distractions. The world and the art style is simply beautiful which, coupled with the superb analog-sounding synths provides both a relaxing and an empowering experience. Each puzzle solved reastores areas of the world back to life, turning a cold, lifeless wasteland into a thing of beauty.How much you enjoy FRACT OSC will depend on how much you enjoy synthesizers. If you're the kind of person who can tell your VCO from your VCA, use an envelope for things besides posting letters and consider a delay to be a desirable thing, the puzzles will only be part of the attraction. FRACT also provides a feature-rich studio that produces some amazingly warm sounds which will keep you busy for some time. And if you're not a synthesizer fan? Well, perhaps the easy to use interface (which can be toggled between basic, abstract controls to something that wouldn't look out of place in the Death Star's control room) will convince you otherwise.All in all, it's a great game with a beautiful art style, brilliant sound and a fantastic atmosphere.

There is a feeling of an omniscient thing watching you. I dont know whether or not to be scared or happy at times. This game has yet to show any traits of other games I've played in the past. I see it on its own level. The beautiful and submersive enviorment allows the player to alter the area to escape. The music and sounds add to the game tremendously. Just out of beauty and originality I'd give this a 10/10. I don't see this game exploding throughout steam and being in everyones library. But I'd like that. Seeing that I've bought 80+ games and maybe reviewed 1-2 should tell you what I think of this game. 10/10

They make up for it with a whole lot of original synth music. So, Myst - art - story + synth = Fract OSC. If you're looking for a story, forget it, this is all puzzle, all the time. The reward is listening to synth music that you sort of created yourself as a side effect of solving the puzzles.The puzzles are mostly well tuned, but there are one or two that will force you to go ask around for the solution or look it up. Most of it can be played without resorting to a walkthrough. In this day of youtube and internet, you can't make things too hard or the game becomes simply one big walkthrough lookup. They seemed to have gotten that message.At the end you get a basic synth composer which you can futz with if so inclined."

,Recommended,243220,10013896,"Posted: 3 May, 2014",all,UberMarklar,"FRACT OSC can be described as a combination of Tron (look and feel), Myst (puzzles) and Audiosurf (all about the music). If you like those kind of things you'll most likely enjoy this game.Pros:* Graphics are great and definitely create a Tron-esque environment. The world is dark and mysterious at first but when you're done it's full of light and sound.* The game world is pretty open and explorable. You aren't penalized for falling off things or ""dying"" as the game just resets you to the latest hub/checkpoint.* The puzzles are challenging and varied enough to constantly be interesting. Each of the three main areas has different types of puzzles to solve with their own set of difficulties. My favorite is probably the Red area with Blue being a close second.* The music is awesome and the endgame is basically: ""Here's a sound mixer, go nuts!""* The single best thing about the game is the level of satisfaction you get upon solving a puzzle. The *ding* of completion is immediately followed by a full lights and sound show that never failed to make me smile and listen to the new song I'd created.Cons:* Selfishly, I want more. More puzzles, more music. It's so much fun that I hate that I've solved everything. I finished the puzzles in about 7 hours which is pretty good for 15$ and I haven't finished all the achievements or worn out the sound mixer yet.* The amount of instruction in the game is almost none and while this is actually a nice challenge I got stuck once or twice simply cause I was missing a component of the puzzle altogether. After awhile I figured it out but I can see how some people will get frustrated.Overall FRACT OSC is awesome, you should buy it, play it and enjoy the heck out of it. The joy and feeling of ""I got it! I got it! This is amazing!"" that solving the puzzles provide is something I haven't felt from a game in a long time and man is it worth it."

The music and visuals are really atmospheric but aren't really necessary for the puzzles; This is not a music-puzzle game.You start out in a virtual synth studio where you can lay down tracks using the basic instruments: Synth lead, bass and pad. Most of the controls are locked at first, and there's a door leading to what appears to be the tron-like insides of the synth. As you delve deeper into the synth world and solve puzzles, more and more controls unlock. This is a clever way of avoiding the paralysis of being in front of a full-advanced-synth control panel.The music and visual are amazing if you don't hate synth music and abstract neon visuals. I loved it. The puzzles are simple and get progressively harder. Nothing is really explained and you're left to discover and experiment and explore.This is also actual synth software, meaning you can (irreversibly) skip the puzzle-solving-and-unlocking and just unlock everything from the get-go. You'd be missing out though. The game's originality and atmosphere comes from being inside the synthesizer.This is a really unique game that is greater than the sum of its parts.Highly recommended if you're into synth music."

I will say that while playing this game, you will spend a considerable amount of time scratching your head. It will often fool you into thinking you've solved the puzzle before you realize you're trapped and you have to disassemble the entire thing to escape or move on to the next level. This is good though, because it forces you to rethink everything so that you can separate yourself from the obstacles and move on to the next task.If you're a ""first-person adventure"" fan, the first thing that you will find troubling is the fact that you cannot jump. I don't know why they didn't add the feature, but in a world with various shapes and horizontal planes sitting at different levels, you'll find yourself wanting to skip walking around everything and hit spacebar to jump -- only to find it isn't working. I'm kinda hoping they'll include it in a later patch. ;)There's also various (already obvious) bugs that will probably be fixed later on. You will notice yourself falling through platforms, sometimes at random. Luckily you'll respawn back at the puzzle you were last at or pathway you were last exploring, but I think it has something to do with the mis-interaction with different solid planes. You can also accidentally stumble upon further levels while exploring, but you can't interact with them until you advance far enough with the ones before it.All in all, it's a stunning addition to the adventure game collection and I can't wait to get further into it, perhaps playing around the the music studio feature more."

FRACT is a first person puzzle game with music roots and complex puzzles. It's an often, harsh mistress that teaches you almost nothing (beyond the standard controls).As you progress through 1 of 3 different puzzle trees, you unlock music creation tools for your hub world that allow you to chill out away from the puzzles and create a tune that is characteristically you.The game, while a fantastic voyage via puzzles does a great job of explaining nothing, it also hits you with so much colour that the next step that you could or should be going isn't always clear. While this is clearly to allow you the freedom to explore wherever you want to go, it is at times more overwhelming instead of the freedom of exploration. As you're limited to very few actions that you can perform beyond simple movement.It's well worth a look in for people that are interested in a colourful, egaging and challenging journey that is incredibly distinctive from the gritty palettes of war and death that we've come to expect from most games. I know I'll be playing more of this title, to better understand and uncover more of what FRACT has to offer."

Just do that two more times, and then the game is over.The visuals and sound are gorgeous, I can't deny that. But what's the point in exploring and sucking up the atmosphere of this strange landscape when everything looks the same?Not worth your time or your money, even on sale.The in-game sythesiser is pretty nice and suprisingly complex, but it's just an extra feature and doesn't save the game at all.Keep in mind that I don't just say this because I want to be a funny little troll and hate on a game just because lots of other people like it. I really, really wanted to enjoy this game, and came into it with a very positive and optimistic attitude."

Its a fun game- a rare breed where you can say that the gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack are all good- but here, all those words mean exactly the same thing.That's not to say its perfect: it doesn't break out of any genres or define a new one.  Almost all of the challenges you'll encounter in Fract are classic video game puzzlers (I won't describe any of them at the risk of spoiling how they work with music), and although they sometimes combine creatively with platforming in the world, its mostly just creative falling onto the next platform or stage.  Exploring the world is a big draw, but it also gets extremely frustrating when some of the icons don't match up meaningwise or there's absolutely no indication of where to go.But overall, FRACT is a game worth even the full price.

Check the forums to see if you may be affected before throwing down your cash)For me there's something entirely irresistible about the idea of playing a game that is ready to hand me the keys to a labyrinthine world slathered in elegant, minimalistic eye-candy, bolstered by a soundtrack that... well... is entirely unique.By messing around with the puzzles you invariably encounter through exploration around the world of FRACT OSC, you quickly pick up on the musical theme of the game, and - more importantly - an idea of how to progress.The puzzles smoothly ramp up in challenge, testing your ability to match the interface controls, with the visual stimulus in order to create the 'right music' to proceed. It's an ingeniously engaging concept that has immediate and tangible rewards.Things only get better as you layer your puzzled-masterpiece and bring the 'world' back to life, revealing all-new challenges.After all is said and done, you're left with a very functional, and extremely beautiful synthesiser. Compositions can be saved and nothing feels better than stepping back and watching the game's world flash and spin and shift with your music.However, there's no free-dinner with this game - you'll have to pay for the multi-functionality (as well as the very dynamic audio-scape) with an intense and significantly high CPU requirement. Despite the minimalistic visuals, it's easy to find yourself in areas that place a strain on the game, bringing the smooth framerate to a choppy crawl. Thankfully the puzzles are not dependant on a high framerate (at least, not as much as your average game), making the poor performance more of a disappointing shame than a frustrating game-breaking (and game-quitting) problem.For those with more than a twinge of an interest in exploration, puzzling and musical creativity, this game couldn't be better focused to your needs.

Exploration is a very important aspect of the game, and I guess that's the brunt of its charm.The game starts you off in a curious environment, something akin to a studio, where the player has to find his or her own way around. A quick, wordless tutorial is all you get to help you get acquainted with how the game functions, before you are taken into the main area of the game.Its expansiveness is mesmerising. A beautifully sculpted world will leave you wide-eyed as you stumble around until things make sense. The confusion can be disheartening at first. There's no explanation in words, no exposition. It can take a while before things start to click. But once they do, you'll feel very much in control. You feel like you have a purpose, like you know what you are doing and there's a healthy feeling of accomplishment that comes with it.It's a shame that the game isn't too long. But it's something I'd want to do again, and probably even more than twice. The game speaks to the player not in words, but in music. And that means it plays on your emotions. Mind you, it doesn't bring you rage or sadness, but instead it knows how to make you feel euphoric after completing a section.The end reward is something fun as well. After you've completed the exploration and puzzle sequences, you're left with a fully functional studio that allows you to mix and create your own songs. You can even use some of the puzzle solutions you've learned before in your songs if you so wish.Overall, I guess it comes down to that wordless connection it builds with the player. It doesn't feel harsh or unforgiving at all, but the world, while desolate, seems to be reaching out to the player somewhat. It tunes in and draws you in far more strongly than most games would, and that's a big chunk of its charm.I can recommend this to virtually anyone.

This auditory odyssy offers an Alice in Wonderland ride that, while it delights the senses, ultimately makes little sense from a traditional storytelling perspective. The only explanation the player receives about the story is before you ever buy the game or install. After that, the player is subjected to a variety of sights and sounds in what seems like an immense world, but how all of these pieces tie together leaves a player more puzzled than satisfied. But, if the player can suspend disbelief and the need for a strong narrative, the game does impress the senses.Offering a midi style toolbox (i.e., 'the studio') with which to build tracks, Fract pays homage to the demo scene of the 80s and 90s. Tools within the studio can be unlocked organically by making progress in the single player game, or a player can opt to bypass the story and unlock all components of the studio immediately.My only complaint is a compliment to the game-- I enjoyed it so much, I wish there was more to the single player story. (I only got 8 hours out of the game, using no walkthroughs.)I highly recommend Fract if the game is on sale.

This game, with it's focus on exploration, sounds, and visuals, is a rather breath of fresh care amongst the army of first person puzzle games the indie market has churned out. There's something eerie, yet comfortable about traveling through the dark, neon worlds of Fract OSC. Solving puzzles at your lesure with only a few audiable cues leaves you with a challenge that's not overbearing, but at the same time still asking to be completed. I think the main reason why that is, is because nothing is telling you to complete it. The game drops you right in the Fract world, where exploration is the draw, and the puzzles locking you away from exploring more.The droning, yet not harsh soundtrack adds even more to the relaxing atmosphere. My only gripe is that while the sound is there, it's a rather silent game, in which either more ambience or an actual musical soundtrack is needed at times.Fract OSC isn't an exploration game with a goal or story to tell, nor is it a puzzle game seeking to challenge you.

Beginning with a locked studio suite of instruments, you explore this living-synth-world, solving puzzles involving step sequencers and percussion, progressively unlocking elements of that studio, and bobbing your head to the wonderful and reactive soundtrack along the way.

It's like the world from Reboot except 15 times more mysterious, massive, and dark. and a lot like Myst except the puzzles are even more enjoyable, awarding, and unique. But my favorite part of the game is that the massive world around you changes as you fix and connect all sorts of titanic machinery. It's awesome to see turbines, generators and beams of energy moving, flowint, working, and connecting together as you repair this sleeping dimension. (and nothing in the game is behind the safety of invisible walls where the player may only assume that other things are out there. Every single thing that exists in the dimension from start to finish, for anyone who loves to explore). And I find that the minimalistic graphics help improve the immersion of trying to figure out what this world is and why you are in it. ""Am I standing on oddly shapped soil or 100% pure crystal? Are these temples or factories you're exploring, or titanic hand held tools built by alien gods??? If you have an imagination, you would love every second this game reveals to you. (and lots of exploration and secret areas. LOOOOTS of exploration and secret areas). my only regret is that I want a FRACT 2, which I'm almost positive will never happen :'("

I've played many of these abstract, atmospheric games on Steam, and this one is really channeling something from the creators on a level far above the rest. I really don't even want to describe it too much.So what to say. I will describe a single moment in my experience of the game:I had been roaming around, fiddling with things, and appreciating the environments for a while. I wondered off of a lit path into a long, low cave out of curiosity. I followed it for a while. As it began to open up, a soft warm glow came out of the shadows with the low wisps of a distant tune. I walked farther, approaching a strange object protruding from the cave floor and reaching nearly to the ceiling. This object was the source of the soft pink glow and the tune, now filling the air, mesmerizing and somber. It was so beautiful. I sat for nearly half an hour staring at the object and feeling the slow pace of its low melody.As I tried to finally leave, I found it difficult somehow. I knew the melody would fade, and this, strangely, made me sad. I tried again and the same feeling came to me. As it took me I realized the loneliness and sadness inherent in this object and in this place. That this beautiful setting and this melancholy tune would only exist together here, as they are, deep in this cave, inside this fractured world, only seen or heard by those few who venture here, guided by nothing.I could only think one thing ... ""thank you""."

It really feels like you have stumbled onto a lost silent world, and as you slowly start to piece together the dead technology, you add color and beauty to the world through music, light, and motion. With a distinct flavor I have not seen anywhere else, FRACT OSC is an awesome game that I would recommend to anyone with a palette for adventure or synth music.An additional and large feature is the synth studio, and I have yet to explore it to its full capacity. Having not much experiance in the creation of music nor the tools to do so, I cannot give an accurate description of how good or bad it is. All I know is that it's fun, enjoyable to mess with, and as far as I know pritty powerful for being in a game."
76561197988389555,Recommended,243220,12218922,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,Kayemef,"A unique take on the Myst-like puzzle-adventure-exploration genre, with a heavy dose of electronic music. The player lands on an alien world, populated only by a flora of luminescent polygons and strange contraptions. Tron comes to mind when thinking about what this whole world looks like, but there isn't a lot of well-known examples that rely heavily on neon lighting and simple geometric shapes. The trailer gives a good idea of what the game looks like.Similar to Myst's level design, each contraption is located on a seperate section of the map (islands, in Myst's case). So in a sense, it's non-linear. The player gets to choose where he heads out first, and the order in which the contraptions are tackled don't really affect how the game turns out.What's interesting about this game is that solving the puzzles creates music ""tracks"". One of the machines spits out a drum loop, another one some chords, and due to the nature of the puzzles, there are usually a few possible solutions for each one. At the end, you get to play around with your creation, remix it, put in some effects... it's actually a lot fun !There's even a surprisingly apt step-sequencer located at the map's main hub (your spawning spot, basically). Each puzzle solved unlocks a module in the step-sequencer (bass-line, lead synths, pad sounds, etc.), so one you've finished the game, you can give it a go and try to create your very own electronic jingle. Don't get me wrong, it's not a professional studio tool, but it's still a very nice way to finish off the game.ProsVery cool visualsA nice twist on the Myst-genre (if there is such a thing)Nice soundtrackCool synthesizer and step-sequencer at the end that rewards you for your hard work playing the game :PConsPuzzles are a little too simple, would have liked a larger arc that spans accross the entire mapPlaythrough is a little short"

Every single part of the game has had obvious work put into it, and the world reacts to your presence in increasingly surprising ways.  As you explore through the game and solve more puzzles, the areas around you evolve increasingly, giving a sense of progress and satisfaction that kept me motivated to continue.  The music builds gradually as you solve a puzzle and seeing the area that you just traversed light up and make a great song continues to be rewarding every time.I was afraid to buy this game for a while due to my computer not meeting the minimum system requirements, but it somehow ran the game just fine with only a few problems.  Even if the audio was interrupted in several places, Fract OSC was a wonderful experience regardless.Unfortunately because of how intricate the game is, it is also extremely confusing in certain places.  You will likely be spending a long time trying to find the correct path, and may need to watch video walkthroughs at certain points, as some of the paths are darker and less noticeable than the scenery, causing me to wander very far in the wrong direction.  This is especially inconvenient when backtracking through each level once the end has been reached.  The teleportation hubs mitigate this a bit, but they were sometimes located relatively out of the way and made travelling a bit inconvenient. The solutions to certain puzzles were also placed in very strange locations, and were sometimes presented in ways that were difficult to decipher.  The vibrant design of Fract OSC can be disorienting, but it still proves to be enjoyable for its mind-blowing architecture.Aside from that, there will likely be more than a few instances where you are so amazed by what's happening around you that you walk straight off ledges and fall to your death.  This is an unavoidable side effect of such a beautiful game.Ultimately, I'm very happy with what I got for my money, and if you like exploration games with maximum freedom, then I highly recommend that you buy this one."

The devs told people who experienced it to go into the options menu in-game and uncheck a box, and that got rid of about 70% of crackling for me, but 30% is still a lot for a sound based game.The devs told us that people with low end sound cards would experience the crackling, but even some people with high end setups also said they had audio problems. I would guess about 20% of players reported this audio issue.To my knowledge, the devs still haven't been able to pinpoint a commonality for why so many users across the spectrum have had crackles. and as a result, no patch has ever been released.But the game is very pleasing to the ear(when there's no crackling, of course), and it's puzzles are challenging. As you solve puzzles, you unlock elements of a synthesizer. Once you unlock everything, you can use it to make your own music in the game.If you get the game, I would buy the game on a sale and just hope that you're not one of the unlucky ones who experience the audio crackles."

There really is a bliss factor to the game.HOW TO BEST DESCRIBE THE GAME EXPERIENCE...I've tried several descriptions in this review before. None of them have felt appropriate enough; the best I can say for them is that they were not wrong, just notrightenough.But, that's both the trick and the beauty behind FRACT OSC! In order to discuss it, you have to explain how you've interacted with a series of interconnected, interrelated musical art installations in a virtual space ─ fairly abstract installations, at that.Getting blunt about it, the game/experience essentially is teaching you fundamentals [and a few finer points] of step sequenced electronic music. Imagine if the makers of the Roland MC 505 built an ancient city driven by this kind of sequential input to make stuff work.For me, there is a truly soothing quality to the game. It's also one of the very few puzzle games I'm willing to play.If you enjoy things like ambient electronica, I can't recommend this game enough."
