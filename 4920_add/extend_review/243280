,Recommended,243280,8584368,"Posted: 5 January, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Poof takes a bit of the tower defense titles and mixes it up with Mario Bros. styled gameplay (the first game with all the pipes, not the platformer). You control Poof, a dog that has to protect a cat hanging in the lower center of the level from getting attacked by all sorts of creatures. Kill enough enemies, create combos, and use your other abilities to complete objectives, score points and unlock extras, new weaponry and new abilities. The more you play, the more you'll unlock, like towers that shoot arrows or ice cubes that freeze enemies for a short while, allowing you to create even longer combos. The downside is that there's only one level. You'll unlock different backgrounds, outfits, et cetera later on to keep things a little bit interesting, though. You can even unlock an extra (still small) part of the level making things even more hectic.It's a game that keeps challenging you. Rounds can be short but never frustrating. You'll most likely want to keep trying to beat your old score and unlock new stuff, but after about 3 hours you've probably seen most of it already, even if you haven't unlocked all of it yet. It becomes too repetitive too soon. That doesn't make it a bad game, because there's always stuff to unlock, but it needs more than just one level.[Rating: 70/100]"
,Recommended,243280,9471398,"Posted: 14 March, 2014",all,Twistor,"Poöf is basically an action defense platformer. It's also a bit crazy: in it you are, after all, a hat-enthusiast doggy with a magic kitten that poops golden eggs. Monsters want the kitten too. The curse is that you will DIE if they get the kitten so, ironically, you need to defend it with your life.Basic idea is simple. Monsters come through doors that are scattered over the level, and you must kill them before they get to the kitten. You can jump on them like Mario or kill them with special items or defensive structures that can be placed in the assigned places. Being a dog you can also poop - yes, poop - golden poop that slows down anything that passes over or through it.Playing along, you get more items and abilities. There's just this one disappointing thing about the game: there's only one map. Granted, I do not think I spoil too much if I reveal that as you complete missions, you will eventually unlock new areas in the one map. These spawn new, usually more dangerous monster types. Also the style changes: you'll be wearing different hats and outfits, as is the kitty and the level's appearance will change randomly between games as well. It won't fool anyone, but is a nice change for the ever-repeating map.Besides the single map, the game is quite fun for a while, and it's rather cheap. If you really get into it, you can try to work your way up the global leaderboards.One last thing: At the time of the writing, Poof's cards are quite expensive. While the recent sale has lowered their price a bit, you can still get quite a large penny back just by selling the cards. Check the market for the current situation though.(Edit: Changed part that was no longer relevant)"

All other games work flawlessly so can't imagine it's a sound card issue. I would like to recommend game but until I get feedback and a fix from developers I'll say be very weary of purchasing this game. I'll keep you posted if I ever hear anything back.
,Recommended,243280,8050965,"Posted: 14 December, 2013",all,Rukey Greentail,"Poof is a fun addictive Action/Platformer thats puts you in the role of a dungeon hero dog protecting a golden laying kitten that attracts monsters. Weird right? Yep, though besides its weirdness this game fills that empty spot inside you that craves something different from all those other games of the now. You'll go from jumping, dodging, and throwing daggers To bashing heads in while wearing a Link constume. The game also does something else alot of games these days dont, it actually challenges you. You'll die! You'll die alot! This game challnges your speed and gamer reflexes. If you dont act fast then your pretty much dead. Humor is actually hilarious and not overdone while powerups and attacks feel like powerups and attacks. This game is a must have and at the price of only seven dollars. If you have the money and you think your good enough to survive then add this game to your library right now and prepare yourself for one of the most addictive and funnest times of your life. 10/10"

However, trying the Mac version of the game, the controls seemed a bit off, the sound cut out, and the game would randomly crash after a while. So I tried playing it on a PC in hopes of a better experience. It crashed immediately after startup, even after clearing the files and reinstalling.I can't recommend the game when I can't even play it myself."

,Not Recommended,243280,8599500,"Posted: 6 January, 2014",all,Gentle Dementia,"This is a game concept seen in countless flash games.  Simple gamplay centered around an upgrade system and meta-missions (i.e. 'survive for 1:30', 'get a combo of x10', etc).  The only differences are, It's probably the worst execution of the concept I've ever played, and I had to pay eight dollars to play it.  There's no free agency, you can only get the upgrades in a set order, you don't gather any sort of currency, you're just given three missions and when you complete the set you get an upgrade.  The gameplay itself is awful.  Shallow and clunky.  There's no real difficulty, just frustration from hits that shouldn't have happened and crap like that.  Don't get it.  Just go play one of the many, many better ones on Kongregate or something."

The little enemies are cute, the hero is cute and even the cursed kitty is cute.Sometimes I find it a bit of a challenge because I'm not very good at keeping track of my health but that's not the game's issue that is my own.It's simular to other games but yet completely different at the same time. It has a Mario V.S Donkey Kong feel to it, but yet it's a bit different all at once.I really do love this cute silly game and can play it all day."

Honestly, if you are looking for a nice mix of platform game and tower defense game... well, there is nothing else at the market at the moment, really. The game is easy to start and hard to master. The graphics, sounds and the the mechanics are just great (for such a little game). Difficult, but also very rewarding. I would buy it once again, it is worth it."
,Recommended,243280,9657548,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,drgonfire1,"Imagine a 2D tower defense platformer with no towers (effectively), an unending supply of enemies, and a cat to protect... who is tied up and can't escape and dies isntantly. Poof, at it's heart, is a strategic platformer, with just the right amount of difficulty to make strategy disappear within seconds and reaction dominate the course of gameplay. This makes what could be a simple game change into an addictive experience. The controls, like any good platformer are simple and manageable, and the objective (keep the cat from getting killed) is easily understood and increasingly hard to do.The Pros:Simple, solid, responsive controls.Progressive challenge system to change your gameplay style with every playTimeless look. Retro graphics can be good, but sometimes the more cartoon-y designs are more enjoyable to see.Visibly distinct enemies, allowing you to easily adapt to their strengths and weaknesses.The Cons:A repetative level design. Perhaps the biggest complaint for Poof is its level design. It is one level. This makes it easy to navigate and try to develope a strategy, but it also means you are always seeing the same ledges to jump on/to which can become old to look at or play on.While I reccomend this game, and emphatically tell friends to have this as a quick game to play, I recommend looking at this game more like a casual game. I play poof for a few rounds at a time. Each of the quests has three challenges to it which you can complete individually. This, coupled with the very quick nature of how often you will be overrun, make the game feel better if you are trying to beat a challenge or two at a time, playing for only a half hour or so, and then leave to do other things. The repetative nature of the game means it plays best in short measures, like a game to play while waiting for something to finish processing or to waste a few minutes of time.Play Poof for what it is: a fun, quick platformer that is a nice, casual time-waster. Don't play it hoping to find some epic story. Poof is meant to be for fun, and accessible to everyone."

Developed by the creators of Hell Yeah! Poof is a simpler game in comparison and I like it for that as Hell Yeah! tried to do too many things and had a complicated control scheme which was nearly impossible to play comfortably.Pros:- Fun action platformer tower defence mash up- Challenge scales as you unlock more items\tower types- Has a somewhat strategic flavour in late gameCons:- No options menu (If you're into that sort of thing)- Extremely repetitive as it has only 1 map- Controls sometimes feel imprecise- Sound effects glitch and mute themselves (Resolved by quitting to the main menu)Verdict:Poof is a fun action platformer tower defence mash up which gets both repetitive and challenging later on but doesn't overstay it welcome and is definitely worth the money."
