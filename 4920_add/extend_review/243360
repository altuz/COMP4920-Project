,Recommended,243360,7673470,"Posted: 16 November, 2013",all,isa,"+ Simple and fun gameplay which is easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.+ Very skill-based. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.+ Great graphics.+ User friendly track, car and replay editors.+ Lots of community created content.+ Tolerable community.- Ubisoft thought it'd be a good idea to split the environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. As a result, pretty much every server is empty and there's only around 3 populated ones at a time.- The car physics on dirt are overly sensitive and difficult to get used to. In fact, they don't really feel like TrackMania. Protip: Try to play on a keyboard if you're having problems with a controller.- 5min cooldown on official races. Was this really necessary?- You get only one environment. At a price tag of $20. I suggest buying it on a sale.TrackMania² Valley is also a solid racer, but it's not as alive as the other games thanks to Ubisoft's great idea of splitting the games into several titles.7/10"

I didn't play the Stadium games, but Trackmania Sunrise with the Addon pack was something to behold.+ Good graphics+ Nice driving dynamics- Doing in-game updates is very hubristic because the steam updater unreacheable in terms of reliability- Maniaplanet (which apparently is something) forgot my password- Ability to build own tracks FEELS more limited compared to the older game."
,Recommended,243360,13562821,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Zeream,"Stadium is better IMO because it has more population, more community generated content, and more persistent playerbase than this game.Racing gameplay here is largely based on rally racing. Note that the car steers very well, and can handle sharp turns.  But, it doesn't do so well at high speeds and will spin out at any attempt at braking.  As such, racing tends to be more technical than drifting related or fullspeed.This was the third of the TM2 series, and its the most graphically polished, however TM2 still excells in content.Note that environments are canyons, concrete roads, and stadium-like structures.  There is a fair balance of natural environment blocks and manmade blocks, but they cannot be mix and matched.  Road blocks are for road, and aesthetic blocks are for aesthetics.  It can also be very hard to create beautiful maps here, since good maps require smart placement of foliage, buildings, landscaping, and roads.However, this game is beautiful and its fun to play. It comes 2nd in my recommendations of the Trackmania 2 franchise.  Note this is the most graphically taxing of the TM2 franchise to this date."

Valley is obviously for a more experienced crowd, providing something less of a joyride than TM2 Canyon and more precise than the easily accessible TM2 Stadium.Stadium-like wide open spaces at least give you room to pilot your finnicky automobile, but things work out a lot worse once you attempt a rally track. The car handles easily enough on road with big, wide turns; dirt and rally sections of the track require impossibly accurate feats of countersteering that DEMAND the use of something more precise than a keyboard (all gaming pads that you can plug into your computer are completely compatible with TrackMania).If the idea of piloting a beast machine of a vehicle over rally roads and moonlit interstates is exciting to you, Valley delivers a compelling caricatured sensation of real racing, more so than any other TM game to date.It can cause equal parts frustration and satisfaction, so if you are looking for more of a joyride, I suggest you buy TM2 Canyon or TM2 Stadium first."

At max settings, this game is georgous. Everything from the lighting to the amount of detail on the courses is excellent. I sometimes found myself slamming into a tree or careening off the track simply because I was distracted by the enviornment. My only two gripes with the game's visual presentations is that water doesn't animate when your car moves through it and it can sometimes be difficult to tell where to go on dirt roads or courses that have fragmented roads due to the heavy amount of detail.Soundtrack:Trackmania 2 Valley has my favorite soundtrack out of the three packs available. It's rather groovy, consisting of electronic music that's easy on the ears. But thankfully, you are able to add your own music to the game if you grow tired of the limited soundtrack.Gameplay:Of the three packs available, Valley has the steepest learning curve and because of it, I don't think it's the most ideal selection for newcomers to the TrackMania series. Throughout your playthrough you will have to adapt to the stiff yet fluid control of the asphalt to the incredibly sensitive to the touch controls of the dirt. Thankfully the staff created tracks provide a great amount of variety with progressively challenging courses to test your driving skills without seeming unfair. The keyboard controls work, but a gamepad or wheel are much more favorable. When your done with singleplayer, you can dive right into the online multiplayer to test how your times compare to players from around the world on courses that are either staff created or custom.Where TrackMania shines is the Editors mode, where players can create tracks with an incredibly deep track creator or play the creations of another person.So in the end Valley is a phenominal improvement over its TM United counterpart and is worth every penny.But as stated before, if your new to the Trackmania series, I would reccommend either raising all flags in Stadium or Soaking up some sun in the Canyon. But besides that, this is a must buy for racing and Trackmania fans."
,Recommended,243360,10633831,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Kasoru,"Trackmania has always been a unique racing series and really fun to play in my opinion. However, it has always been overshadowed by more mainstream racing games (Need for Speed, Forza, Gran Tursimo, etc.). Trackmania² Valley specifically though is the most realistic of the Trackmania² line, but this doesn't mean it's bad. It still has your insane tricks and high-speed action, but it feels much more sensible from Trackmania² Canyon and Stadium, and in my opinion, more fun. It's much more grippy then Canyon, but still has enough power to easily drift unlike Stadium. It's an arcade game in a nutshell, so if you (for some reason) hate arcades, then you might want to sway from this, but if you want to try something unique, I highly reccomend this. The main attraction I'd say in Valley (and basically all Trackmanias) is its track creator, which makes the game have huge replay value, as well as the community tracks."

I've loved the original Trackmania since I've seen about it back in my middle school years. Played the demo of Trackmania Sunrise and enjoyed the series ever since. I met some really good people and friends and actually played competitively in this game, but it didn't last long.....sadlyNow here we are with the next Trackmania game, with improved visuals (which looked amazing) and a lot more options with editor (objects, scripting, etc.). Since I was a really into trackmaking, (and I still am!) I really enjoyed experimenting the new block that they offered. The replay editor is more of the same with some new features that I can't say but I know for sure that all of the old editing equipments are still there. I like the fact that now I can take a screenshot of the car moving without having to shoot a video and screen capture it from my computer. What I also like about what Nadeo did is that they added a simple editor to the replay editor for beginners and not just the editor mode. All the enviroments are very unique from the looks to the driving style. Canyon is more of a drifting enviroment whereas Valley is more of grip to slidy dirt sections. I like the fact that they didn't change any of the aspects that made Trackmania great and added new features. Manialink is back and from my experince it hasn't changed, but I never really looked at it often. I recently looked at the paint editor and Nadeo seemed to changed some the UI. I can't really tell since I didn't really put the time to mess around with it. I also really like the fact that Steam is intergrated with Maniaplanet, but the the negative side to is that most of my friends don't have Trackmania, so it's kind of pointless to me. Ok now lets talk about the three enviroments.CanyonCanyon was my first experince that I had with the the new engine that I played a year ago. I really enjoyed the handling and the drifting aspects of it. It's a great representation of the Arizona desert with large canyons and little plant life. I like the fact that it's easy to drive but hard to master because seeing how the competitors drive this car is utterly insane. I do have to say it's the least that I played so far, even though I put a lot of hours in it. The one thing that I do get annoyed is that the vehicle snaps when I'm counter-drifting. This only happens when the car was about to straighten itself out.StadiumStadium for me is the new remastered version of the previous Stadium. I do have to say that surprisingly they changed the physis in this enviroment. The vehicle seems a bit slower than the origanal enviroment and the handling is less stiff the the previous. I still enjoyed the enviroment regardless becuase this was the enviroment that I played the most from the last Trackmania (Nations ESWC and Forever being free). I really like the improved lighting effects in this game, it gives more of a beautiful look to the enviroment. There were also some new blocks added to this version!What I did feel dissapointed is that the bugs are still existant from the last game, but it doesn't interact often. Like for instance when landing on the dirt portion on all four tires causes the vehicle to slow down. Another bug is that when the tires touches the side road on the asphalt, the vehicle will randomly lift itself in the air. It might seem small but from a competitive standpoint it's annoying.This being a remastered version of the origanal Stadium, I'm glad that they sold this for 10 bucks.ValleyValley I have to say is an intersting track, to say for the least. And what I mean by it being interesting that dirt section. Not only it's hard to control since the car can easily oversteer if turned to much. For people that doesn't have a medium/high spec PC, it can give performance problems thus making it less enjoyable. I do have to say that this envioment is the most exqusite out of the two. It's a beautiful reference to the Euproean Nations and even thought it doesn't really have the ""valley"" in it, it's still somthing to look at everyonce in a while. After playing it for so many hours and trying to get the hang of the handling model, it becomes really enjoyable, making it my favorite enviroment.If you're a new player interested in this game or a old veteran trying out the next Trackmania game, please give it a go, try the demo. You wont be disapointed.TL;DR, It's a really good game that I would recommend playing!"

,Not Recommended,243360,10383993,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,Bob,"Maybe my opinion is coloured by nostalgia but didn't the older trackmania games use to be a lot more fun? The key gameplay mechanic on these games is to retry the tracks repeatedly to find the perfect line through the course and beat set times. This is fun when the cars are easy to control but in this game when driving off road the handling is so twitchy you just have to fight to keep the car on the track and you can't think about improving your line. This increased difficulty means there is a significant number of tracks that I will never be able to play. Even despite that this just features race events and none of the other types of event from previous games. With that in mind the price tag is quite hefty for what you get. In my opinion the pinnacle of the series was Trackmania Sunrise eXtreme but good luck finding a copy of that and getting it to work on Windows 7 so my recommendation is to get Trackmania United, it is much better value. The only positive this has over United is that the graphics are better."

It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe)."

You almost never see the same style of block placement twice, and there is always a new technique to master on these tracks. It combines sections where you have to be slow and technical with how you drive and fast sections with jumps and loops and really exciting and crazy stunts. It's all threaded together perfectly, and it never gets boring at any point within the gameplay.[/h] The Valley Car [/h1]Anyone who has played Trackmania in the past knows this well: all the different cars have their own handling characteristics and driving styles. For example, the Coast cars are slow and slippery, and have to be driven carefully, while the Stadium cars have loads of grip and can hit insanely fast speeds. The Valley cars are like none other, both in how they handle and how they look.It's not comparable to any production car I have ever seen before, making it a completely original and new style to me. The handling is amazing. It's easy to drive at high speeds, easy to predict, and easy to push into a powerslide, but it is impossible to master. Those simple mechanics are what keep all those online players playing: Because it never gets boring.[/h] The Verdict [/h1]Trackmania is just one of those games that never goes out of style. It's always fun to play, and you can always learn a new driving technique to use on any of the enormous number of tracks both contained within the singleplayer mode and the multiplayer mode.

Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a ""playlist"" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.Cons-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on ""Stadium"" from Steam, then decide to play ""Canyon"" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the ""Start Game"" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit ""more blue"" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42"" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use ""multiple profiles"" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say ""You must connect online to launch the game."" I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to ""take"" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.-- this Con is unique to Valley. In the other two games, we can begin a split screen game by selecting a playlist of tracks and the game starts, We can race each track until a player gets 30 points (3 wins) or whatever we set it to be. In Valley however, the playlists don't work - it dumps you into a script programming screen which is blank. I don't feel I need to spend time figuring how they screwed up programming the install of this game just so we can play multi-player playlists like the other two games. Frustrating.ConclusionThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise."
