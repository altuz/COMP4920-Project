It was super hard, yet entertaining in their use of physics with tight controls and well thought out maps and levels that were hard, but managable once you mastered the controls!Urban Trail Freestyle is just like that, if it was the same game with ugly textures, floaty controls, damn near impossible obsticles and your roommate kicking you in the beans periodically through game play.For $.99, I got 45 minutes to an hour of playtime out of it.  It's not unplayable yet it's not really enjoyable either.  They tried to spice it up with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trick system that you have absolutely no control over.   The controls are sloppy at best and will lead to much swearing and teeth gnashing.

This type of games have been very popular on Flash game sites since forever.Really nice graphics for this type of game, the developers have done a marvelous job.It is essentially a 2D game in a 3D world. You see your motocross bike from the side, basic controls to accelerate, decelerate and control your pitch (lean forwards/back).The goal is to drive through the course as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and performing certain tasks. Each level have a set of objectives where you get tested such as; ""Precise Aim"" where you need to jump as close at a target as possible, ""Highest Jump"" where you jump as high as possible, etc.Your records are uploaded and you can compare to other players online.On the levels there's moneybags, if you collect these you can buy new parts for your motocross bike and costumes for your character.There are 5 different ""worlds"" with ~8 levels on each, some levels seem to be reused or atleast portions of them are, but this is fine, they offer different challenges in the objectives instead.Once you've started making your way through the main levels, a series of challenges start to unlock which are wildly different from the main game. I strongly encourage you totry the challenge levels!I think it could be a fun element if they added tricks to it, for bonus points. There are a few places where you need to do flips to get bonus points, however I would imagine something more freely. Perhaps that goes into a different genre of motocross games tho.I can't really tell if the music is good or not, it's just ambiance. Full-focus on driving and trying to hit the jumps!"

UTF  is very arcade like; levels are either timed race to the line or high scores by complete tricks (flips, highest jumps, longest jumps). None of the levels are hard unlike Evo which gets pretty full on in some levels. There are limited power ups but choice of bike powerup does make a difference in the levels.The bike doesn't handle the same as Evo at all (which I spent many hours playing on xbox) but Evo is all about the level design and bike control. This game is about having fun so bike control not as important so I didn't mind - it still feels ok and isn't as bad as some people make out. The graphics actually make it entertaining with explosions and stuff falling all over the place. The challenges are quite a laugh although not many of them.Overall, I liked it. Finished run through after 4 hours (non-completionist about 75%). So for $1 an hour I got my moneys worth so I'm happy."

And that's exactly what I'll talk about in the next section.I am a completionist. I try to get 100% on every game I can, and finishing U.T.F. wasn't easy AT ALL. I needed guides for the hidden bags of money, I needed guides to learn how to get 5 stars on some stunt levels. And I still couldn't manage to pull off the required stunts for some of the later levels, even with the solution right in front of me.

In the end the constant/random crashing put me over the edge.Urban Trial Freestyle isn't too bad of a game. The core things are there. The physics, upgrading your bike and the tracks are all good.I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit and the games stability was marginal at best. Sometimes it would crash once and then play fine for an indefinite amount of time. Other times it would crash at random over and over again and I just had to give up that day.Not fun.It also crashed every single time I got a Steam card for the game while playing.I feel like the graphics engine wasn't optimized very well as I had to lower shadow settings and turn off AA. I have a GeForce GTX295. For the level of graphics in this game... it shouldn't be struggling at the max settings. I was able to get a constant 60FPS by lowering the shadow detail and turning off AA but i had to run it in 1920x1080.Speaking of resolution. I have two 1440p monitors and i seemed to get slightly better stability when i set my resolution to match what I’d launch the game at.It took me 10 hours to beat all the tracks, get all the cash bags and beat all the challenges.Pros-Nice looking graphics-Good physics-Entertaining levelsCons-Poorly optimized-Random/Constant crashes-Listening to the same, UNSKIPPABLE intro every time you start the gameIf you get this on sale for a dollar or two, it'll give you a bit of entertainment for your money.

The real issue is that the bike physics are garbage, the courses aren't well designed, doing well doesn't feel rewarding, and the player's character is a dope.

In my mind I thought ""Hmmmm how bad could this game actually be for only 99 cents?"" and man, is this game bad. I loved Trials Evolution, that game was a masterpiece, but this game is nowhere near sharing the name Trials.When launching the game and arriving at the title screen you see the hip rebelious biker dude and hear that the police are after him for tresspassing with his bike.(zZzZZZZzZZzZzz)The gameplay of this game is not fun. Repetative levels and annyoing characters that say the same lines over and over during the levels. ""FREEZE POLICE"" says the police officer as you cruise by the 10 different groups of them each level. But the funny thing is if you stop in front of the police, they dont do anything. They just roll around and act like they're going to do something as you are at a standstill.While playing the single player, the goal is to collect the stars from each level and using them to unlock the next level. BUT, you have to play the same level 2 or 3 times playing the different ""modes"" to gain the plentiful amount of stars needed.The handling of the bike is way too easy. This game has no challenge what so ever.I'm surprised that this game is being sold for $10 now (even at $15). If this game were still 99 cents, I would not recommend it to anyone.In the end, this game screams of a iOS or Android game for your cellular device. How did this game make it to consoles and even steam?"

Basically, I'm not quite a fan of any extreme sports games, well I am, but I don't play them too much. My last game was Gravity Defied I guess .-.So, this game pretty much delivers. I didn't expect it to be any good, but that game just dropped my expectations to tha ground.First of all, graphics is pretty decent. I did enjoy all these dystopian pictures that the developers showed in the game, classically, about the police, fire everywhere and some kind of nuclear war o3o, especially in the last partThe gameplay itself is pretty nicely done, physics is decent, and it's quite easy to play, since you need only 4 keys and within an hour you're gonna be pro at this game, of course of you aren't a lobster.Challenge in this game is pretty fun, getting points, and stuff. The easiest way to win is for sure time challenge, that I've won several times there lel. It's not too much of popular games these days so you do have a chance to get on top of board even not being pro at extreme sports games.The Challenge Mode isn't really too interesting...worth playing once or twice though.But I'll be sure to play story mode again and again to get mroe stars and earn more recordsSo, all in all, this is not yet perfect game, but rather decent, sometimes it's ♥♥♥♥ed up and you just don't understand how to do some sh*t at some points, but it really delivers, so8.8/10Recommended for fans."
,Recommended,243450,13215248,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,Serieus,"Loads of fun.  Good physics, not perfectly realistic, but good enough to make you feel like you truly have control of your bike.  The courses are challenging enough and offer enough variety to keep your interested.  The game pushes you to try harder and focus, but it's not hard enough that you'll pull your hair out.  The atmosphere is gritty in this version, but it doesn't take away from the fact that you are an acrobatic bike rider and running a course with either speed, or agilitiy, and sometimes both.  The challenges offer more replayability, and they can be very difficult.  For a good price, when on sale, this is a great game to pick up.  There's just nothing more fun than to watch how much you can beat up your driver, there are times where it really looks like that must have hurt.  :)"
,Recommended,243450,12341400,"Posted: 3 October, 2014",all,Toxic League,"I wasn't all that inspired initially with the gameplay of Urban Trial Freestyle. The overall motorcycle control certainly feels a little shallow and the game does its best to focus your attention on environmental animations to hide that lack of gameplay. I mean you essentially accelerate, brake, and lean forward or backward on your motorcycle--and that's it.The courses are short and there are time trials where you race against a ghost rider as well as stunt trials where you score points to achieve stars which unlock more levels. There are moneybags placed throughout the levels which after collected can be used to purchase bike upgrades or clothing. The game can be a little frustrating since some of the moneybags are located in areas that require bike upgrades so there can be a sense of having to backtrack to an earlier track to get the remaining moneybags after you acquire enough money to purchase the necessary upgrades.After giving the game a bit more play time, I do find it to be somewhat fun and enjoyable. The challenge courses are interesting. And getting maximum stars isn't all that easy so there is some challenge to the game as well. Overall, it's a game I would play again, albeit in moderation."

,Recommended,243450,10822193,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Bah,"I recommend this game hesitantly, and I say hesitantly b/c you should not pay much more than the current summer sale (Jun 2014) price ($0.99) .Let's start with the obvious. This game is an unabashed knock-off of Trials, the much heralded game which is literally the exact same thing. You're a motorbike rider trying to get through an obstacle course where the handling and physics of the bike are the crux to passing them. I look at this game as a cover version of a popular song. Rarely are cover versions better than the original, but once in a while an artist will do very well and have a hit of their own on their hands. This is not a hit, but it's at the very least curiously listenable.There is not a lot of customization in this game. There is basically one bike that you upgrade various parts of using money you collect on the various tracks.What I liked:- I liked the background effects of the tracks. The NPCs include cops, various passersby, and occasionally people will try to throw things at you. There's even some explosions.- It was $0.99 and it drops cards.- Relatively small (about 800 mb) download.- Its challenging.What I didn't like- It lacks depth. The tracks are repeated at the higher levels in places.- Occasionally the bike handling/physics is wonky.- The braking and reverse mechanic has to be used sometimes to get awkwardly placed money bags and can totally kill your time/momentum.You can do a lot worse than spending a buck on this game. It's an unapologetic knock-off of the brilliant Trials series (the latest game in that series is Trials: Fusion) and it succeeds in replicating the gameplay of that series to a point. However, at the end of the day, why play this when I can just play Trials? It does nothing that series does better.That being said, it's a buck, and with four card drops, you basically can get this game for $0.40 if you choose to sell those drops, even less if you get a foil.Don't expect anything great, but if you know what you're getting into, there's a bit of entertainment to be found with this game.If you do find that you like this game, or at the at the very least how it plays, do yourself a favor and pick up one of the entries in the Trials series."

It's certenly draws inspiration from Trials, some may say it's copying it and so what? It's good game.The game is console port and a great one. I even try playing with the keyboard. It's fine, but the prefered method is a controller. And with him playing is great. If you make mistake, it's entirly your fault.The game have limited video options – resolution, V-sync, Shadow quality and AA. The game is definitely not ugly, it just good, but not great. But so many things happen on screen and you won't notice textures or other things. You will be concentrated over the gameplay mostly. The game may not be the prettiest, but it have so many details on background and foreground. You see lake, big skyscrapers and so on.Urban Trial Freestyle is side-scroller racing game with a bike. You hate to get from point A to point B, avoiding tons of obstacles. That's it. The level design is great. You will ride through forest, slums, highway with a lot of crashed cars, on top of buildings, high in the sky, on a train, in a train depot, on a dam, through an office and so on. There are some level that feel like you are in a hollywood movie. Police is chasing you, explosions everywhere, highspeed and dangerous jumps. It's like Michael Bay was directing. The thing what I like a lot here is this – there is always something going on on the foreground and background. Worker doing his thing, exploding helicopter, even a train crash. They may distract you, so bear that in mind. Sometimes those events may cause an obsticale to apper or the ground to rise. What i'm trying to tell you is the developer put a lot of thoughts in the level design.When you finish a track you will be rated with stars and money. Sometimes only when you get 5 you will get cash. For unlocking new tracks you have to gather certain number of stars. Here there are two type of races – time attack and tricks. Tricks are more interesting. You don't race with a clock, although when you finish the race, the remaining time will count as points. Here you have to do highest jump, precise aim, highest speed or rotating the bike. Bigger the achievment, more points you'll get. There is  a green line to show you record for that track, so there is replay value.You have only one bike, but you can buy upgrades for him. They are pretty straight foreward and all have pluses and minuses. Buy a bigger engine, handling will decrease and so on. You can dress the biker, but i'm not in to this kind of thing.As far as the sound design, there isn't much to say. The effects are like exploisions, sirens, collapsing road, crashing or crumbling are okay, but I don't like engines. They are weak.Music is okay. Sometimes it's jazzy, other fast and electronic, but overall you may not notice it that much in the middle of this chaos. I think I won't listening it outside of the game.When you're done with the main game you can tackle the Challenges. I like the a lot. They are total of 5 and you have to do different things from the main game. Shoot the biker as far as you can, drive as far as possible with limited fuel, platforming with the bike to collect signs for points and my favourite – the track where you can change gravity. There have to be more tracks like this.The biggest sin here is the lacking of level editor. This is essential for the longevity of the game. It's such a shame. Other small problem is the weird 40-50 fps I get without recording. I have mid-range machine and I think should get more fps. I'm not sure if the problem is on my side or it's the games optimizations. But the fps stay mostly about 50 and they rarely go under 40.As a whole the game is great. I haven't played Trials and I can't compare them. I supose RedLynx games is superior, but this game is worth playing. If you don't want to deal with Uplay or Trials is pricey for you, jump on here. It took me around 7 h to beat it and here you have enough replay value. If solid controls, good graphics, great level design, and extra challenges sounds good to you, buy it. I definitely recommend it."

Worst is you can tell they cut corners with repeating levels, you do a time run in a level then 2 levels later it is the exact same but with a different task. The contorl of the bikes also feels a lot less challenging making the experience less fun. No custom level maker (that i could see) shortening the life span even more so.

This game subtly reminds me of one of those crappy ps2 games that you are so siked for and end up becoming disappointed after the first few levels.  First off the levels make no sense... you ride on a pipe and jump to a platform that launches you into a container that either A. ends up killing you, enabling you to hit the spacebar ( this becomes your friend ) or B. exit out of the game in a furious rage.  The upgrading abilities are far from satisfying.  You can upgrade your engine at  the price of having worse handling, or you can upgrade your chassis at the price of having slower speeds.  There is always something for something and there's only 3 upgrades per area.  Getting money to upgrade is far from ""fun"" ( not sure why fun is quoted ... maybe because that's more fun than getting money in this game ).  I digress ... the money is located in bags throughout each level.  You can only collect them once. That is the only way it is obtained.  You can spend your money on helmets and clothes, but then you won't have any for engines, tires, or chassis. Some areas of levels are impassable unless under some freak of nature miracle that you hit something a certain way to do something to get you passed it.  The constant reminder that someone online has trumped your score and that you keep getting either 3 stars or 4 stars average is also very demeaning and makes you feel like the whole game is an unsuccesful attempt to have fun.  It's almost like you are excited to go on vacation with your family and they end up just making you more miserable than your 9-5 job.  If you think I just don't like the game because I can't play it then try it for yourself.  You'll realize..."

This game is, if you hadn't already made the connection yourself, a poor mans Trials, which is why I felt comfortable reviwing this with so little play time. If you've played any Trials game, you've essentially played this.It's hard to really mention this game in it's own light without bringing up Trials, as Urban Trial really does nothing to differentiate itself from the game it so clearly apes. The main problem with UBF though, is that it doesn't do anything better than Trials, in fact it does everything worse. The bike controls are vastly inferior, with there being no subtletly in handling and balancing, and you will actually find it very hard to overbalance or even fall off your bike. The track designs are very simple, and repetitive, and do little to challenge anyone coming in from Trials, and I doubt they would even challenge anyone new to the games.Out of the first two worlds which I completed, (in 45 minutes of play, with there being 5 worlds overall), there were a lot of repeated tracks, which points to this games brevity. Yes, you can go back and replay levels, trying to beat your scores, or 5 star every track, but there is little incentive to do so, when the levels are barely that fun on the first play. There are also 5 challenge modes to unlock, again apeing Trials, but they are very short and not all that interesting.I state all this but I am still leaving this game a positive review, why? Firstly, no Uplay. Secondly, for the price I picked the game up, I can't say I am too disappointed. The game is cheap, and is very often on sale. At best it's a decent Trials knock off, at worst, a bit boring, definitetly not terrible. If you've played all the Trials games and are looking for more filler, this is worth a shout."

The visual effects and overall presentation are superb!  It has vehicular wrecks and explosions galore.  You will see amusement park horror shows under city streets and physics-based objects rolling around on every level.  You may think a lot of what happens is scripted, but from what I've played, a lot of it is actually different each time you play.

The voice acting is cringey, with the biker yelling appreciation or disappointment to the player depending on his performance. The sound design is none too great either, with the bike's engine sounding like it was recorded into an iPhone's mic in a bathroom and not always seeming to sync up with what the bike is actually doing.That being said, this is a worthwhile, fun game. The graphics might not be the best, but the level design is brilliant, both in scenery / surrounding events and the gameplay itself. As others have mentioned, it lacks some challenge; you're unlikely to spend 50 faults on one particular section of track like you would in a Trials game, for example. It nevertheless makes for a fun experience.Something Urban Trials Freestyle does differently to the Trials games is incorporating in-level challenges. For instance, midway through a level you may be asked to make the longest possible jump or do as many flips as possible. This adds a nice, additional bit of variety to the game. There are also some collectable moneybags throughout the levels which you use to upgrade your bike, though whether this is a help or a hindrance to your playstyle is up to you; typically, they are not too out of the way, and you are encouraged to make separate runs of the tracks for performance and money-collecting.Overall, I'd say this is a good game, but maybe get it on sale."

Sometimes the feel of each of the tracks seemed to mesh together so that it almost felt as though the same 3 tracks were repeated throughout the game. The controls are rather stiff and the physics don't seem consistent at all. If this had been DLC or a new mode for an actual Trials game with the Trials physics, UTF might be more enjoyable.

But these changes, in my opinion, are bad. In some tracks you are supposed to go for points by doing things like getting the highest jump. It changes things up which is nice. You do the next track and it's either getting points or a time trial. Then after that, you repeat the previous track doing a time trial this time. It's like the developers think you're three years old and can't notice you're playing the same track twice.You would expect the bike to control well. But it doesn't it's very hard to turn correctly. You can upgrade your bike but that just makes it even worse. Some obstacles in the game are incredibly hard to pass. Some of the obstacles hardly ever work. And sometimes a car that it supposed to stop in a certain spot wont stop there making you fall. Or a car will stop in the middle of the road when it's not supposed to. This is completely random and you have no way to control it. The hard obstacles combined with the horrible controlls make the game extremely frustrating to the point where you quit.The game doesn't let you progress very easily. Each track has 5 stars to get. The number of stars you get depends on your performance on the track. By the time I was halfway into world three I had three or more stars on every track. But I still didn't have enough stars to unlock more tracks. It is very hard for players who aren't good at the game to progress.I payed 99 cents for this game and I still feel like I was ripped off.

Cash is used to unlock the bike changes - so best to collect what you can early.Often on sale and well worth whatever you end up paying for it...What more praise can I give?P.S.Win 7 (64 bit) friendly in my experience - No Crashes"

I honestly didn't expect much, but it is quite enjoyable time killer. The levels are a bit similar with typical ""cool hard-core"" environment. Motorcycle is pretty easy to control and overall it's not that challenging like some other trial games out there. But, definitely worth the money."

I was looking for a game to play in a drunken state that wasn't too complicated and this game was the choice. All I had to press was the up, down, left, right arrow keys and at the end of each level, the enter or esc keys. It lasted half an hour until I got bored and quit it. Then I sold the trading card for 5 cents making this game only $0.79 cents.I mean... What can a drunk guy ask for? A lot of things you may say, but a drunk guy will never ask for boredom and this game cured that boredom for half an hour. Respect!"

Controlling the bike and rider is definitely a challenge, but a lot of fun (and sometimes frustraing)."
