,Recommended,243780,1547321,"Posted: 15 September, 2013",all,noibn,"PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate is a tower defense game that requires constant attention from the player. You play as a Tiki guy defending a hut from waves of monsters. On the surface, it seems like a cheerful casual game... but looks can be deceiving. There are almost never any lulls in the action, so you always have to be on the move, planning ahead. Resources (used to build towers) come in the form of coins dropped from enemies. However, you actually have to run around and collect the coins yourself before they disappear. Similarly, in order to build towers, you actually have to walk to where you want them first. Towers can also be upgraded by standing on them, a process that takes time. Enemies also sometimes drop crystals, which can be spent to quickly upgrade towers, or saved up to purchase other types of towers. So gameplay boils down to a test of multitasking skills - you have to balance anticipating what towers need to be built (and where), while simultaneously collecting dropped resources and upgrading. It gets pretty intense.Most levels can be completed easily enough in 1 or 2 tries, but the challenge comes in trying to do so perfectly (not letting even 1 enemy get to your hut). Perfect-scoring levels unlocks more levels to play, and so on. And that's where the challenge (and unfortunately, frustration) comes in. The main down-side to this game is that it can sometimes be very unfair. While there is an indicator that shows what types of enemies are coming up, it's not always clear enough (for example, a blinking red icon sometimes means ""weak to cannons"", and other times ""on fire and 3 times as fast""). Also, sometimes enemies take completely different paths with no warning. These types of things are frankly just bad game design and complete BS. The best TD games allow you to deduce the path enemies will take and plan ahead accordingly. This game doesn't always do that, which leads to having to sometimes rely on memorization rather than actual skill. Thankfully, it doesn't happen a lot, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating when it does. That said, this is a small complaint when compared to how good the rest of the game is, but it is a noteworthy enough issue that it needed to be mentioned.The main game consists of 47 levels, with an additional 24 challenge levels that can be unlocked. The challenges are levels that have to be cleared while also fulfilling some sort of special criteria (completing challenges unlocks concept art, videos, music and more). The game also has a 2-player co-op mode, which I haven't tried (but it seems like it would be really fun). All in all, between the main levels, challenges, and co-op, the amount of content available is pretty substantial. I've sunk around 60 hours in already (though technically, most of that was spent replaying levels over and over again trying to get perfect clears), but still, the fact that I put that much time into it speaks to how good the core gameplay is. Despite my rant above on the few down-sides that sometimes make it frustrating, overall, the game is solid, and lots of fun to play. If you like tower defense, this is a great one. The price seems a bit high, especially when the original version on PS3 was cheaper, but there is also more content in this version compared to the original release, plus the added multiplayer component... so I suppose it is probably justified. If you are into TD games, definitely pick it up in a sale at some point, if not at full price."

76561197997422173,Recommended,243780,12427917,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,zXBlooDXz,"I recommend this game, and here is why.PixelJunk™ (don't forget the ™, it's important)  Monsters is a Tower Defense game, with unique twists of its own.  Having to base off the fact that you can only build towers depending on the layout of the course makes for varying plans to prepare for the next wave. Purchasing new special towers each mission that do not forward to the next creates choices that as a player, or two, will have to make in order to protect the Tiki-men from waves of monsters with various attributes. Not just monsters who can fly, but even monsters that are resistant to fire damage or monsters that move faster but are even more vulnerable to slows when hit.The learning curve is well received by new and experienced players. Trial and error is less punishing until playing on the later and harder stages. WIth the addition of new towers and an island in the Ultimate mini-expansion, players who had the console version will find only a few reasons to go back to the game sadly.It's also multiplayer enabled, I had a satisfying time playing with my friend online, Speaking of which, there is nobody playing this online. It is justifiable, a game like this should not be enjoyed with just the public, having a friend to think through every single mission makes the game not feel repetitive some of the time. Another plus is the RNG area which generate random stages based on algorithm outside the quests by inputting a 5 digit code. (like minecraft's seed)Overall, I recommend this game but only to players who are looking forward to a Tower Defense game that plays different.To those that had played before, please put a second thought to this. This game came out a little less than 7 years ago, but the art style is truly of this date. Mechanics are still familiar, and with new towers it might bring you back to try new techniques to overcome the same or new missions. It may just be Monsters, but it is still the one you know and love.Also, 1080p!! (Like that matters)"

It has 2-player co-op and plenty of levels and challenges. The dancing mechanic to slowly upgrade towers and finding random goodies in trees will constantly keep you busy.

,Recommended,243780,8884139,"Posted: 27 January, 2014",all,arleas,"Ok so I've spent a little time playing this game, and so far, it's pretty good.  You have no idea what kind of game this is from the title though, right?  I mean, you know it's a PixelJunk game, you know it's got monsters, and it's apparently the ulitmate for some reason.  So what is it?  It's another Tower Defense game!So what makes this game different from any of the other thousand tower defense clone games out there?  Well for one thing, you've got a physical avatar/character to move around the map placing towers.  That's interesting I guess.  You're limited in what you can do by how fast your character moves.  That can be really challenging (and really annoying).Another feature is that the path is pretty much already laid out for you.  All you have to do is build towers out of the trees in the background on the maps.  If you were hoping for a more free-form tower defense game, that would be disappointing, but considering there's often just one optimal path anyway, I don't really mind.  You're really limited enough by the fact your character doesn't move that fast.  No need to make it even harder by allowing the monsters to rush straight for the base.Most tower defense games I've seen allow you to pay to upgrade your towers, but this game gives you three ways of upgrading.  1) Experience through kills 2) Paying ""gems"" to upgrade and 3) Your character does a little dance that gradually adds to the experience bar of the tower, eventually upgrading it.So these gems I've mentioned... when you kill a monster, it drops some coins (usually) and a green gem (rarely).  You use the coins to buy new towers and you use the gems to either upgrade your existing towers OR apply those gems to unlocking a NEW tower for the level.  Sometimes the new tower is more valuable than having upgraded towers and sometimes an upgraded tower means you actually survive the level.Oh and one other thing I forgot to mention: You have to pick the coins and gems up, however you're powerless against the monsters so you can't touch them at all or you get stunned and you drop some money that you have to pick back up (think sonic the hedgehog's rings).  I don't think it's possible for your main character to die but I haven't tried really hard.The graphics are what I would call ""quaint"".  Nothing super fancy but it seems to fit in with PixelJunk's style pretty well.  The music is OK, but kinda forgettable.  Nothing stuck in my head after I closed the game, so that's neither good nor bad.  The sound effects are passable too but again, nothing memorable about them.  You get some cannon boom sounds, crossbow ""thwack"" sounds, etc.   The sounds your character makes while upgrading a tower sounds like a native dance, but that totally fits because your character looks like a stereotypical  witch doctor.You can use a controller with the game, and in fact, that's all I've ever used.   I don't know if mouse/keyboard would be better since you're moving a character around on screen to do all the building and upgrading.  I haven't had any troubles using the controller so if you want to just kick back while you play then this game is good for that.Basically I'd say this game is just casual enough for someone to enjoy while still maintaining a level of challenge for people who get bored easily.  Otherwise if there's any flaw in this game is that it feels too generic in some ways, and ""offbeat"" in other ways.   It could have been so much better with more impressive sounds and music, but it's not a bad game by any means.Overall, if you're looking for a good tower defense game to spend some time on and you've already played Defense Grid, then get this."

PixelJunk Monsters can be hilarious yet still challenging (double the laughter in 2 player mode). Although Pixeljunk Monsters can be frustrating, it was never too much. It never made me want to stop playing. Anticipating what the next map will look like, the new stage's music, and if there will be any new monsters or tricks kept me coming back for more. Personally, the music has stuck with me and it really became a favorite of mine. I also enjoy how you dance on things to make them stronger. When it comes to tower defense games PixelJunk Monsters has a special charm to it that you won't find elsewhere.I did previously play through the PS3 version when it first came out but that was 5 years before picking this one up. I played both games with the same friend and it actually still felt fresh. The newly added island in this version was fantastic and really extended the game's life for me.Happy pixeling!"

Perhaps the monsters in the game are after Tiki man for overpopulating the forest with his spawn. Anyways, Monsters offers multiple modes and difficulties. Difficulties ranging from Casual, Regular, and Hard-core (once the game is beat on Regular) provide hours and hours of entertainment for anyone from the newbies to the veterans of tower defense games. There's single player, local co-op, and even online co-op. Complete levels in single player or co-op and unlock up to 24 Medal Challenges in the Tiki Hut, which upon completion of each level will net you an achievement if the challenges restrictions/rules were met. Completion of special levels will unlock various rewards like the Speed Potion, Bomb, and things that must be purchased during levels like addition towers or bonus interest between waves.Once one finishes with Tiki Island, Toki Island, and Gati Gati Island, there's Tum Tum Island which generates a random level based on an up to 5 character word, number or combination of letters & numbers.Monsters has high potential for replay value thanks to Tum Tum Island, but out of the dozen or so words I've tried I ended up with the same stages too often, most of them very easy.Highly recommended, even to those that have played the original release of Monsters as there is enough new content to keep the game feeling fresh."

So here goes.PixelJunk™ Monsters Ultimateis a tower defense game. Um. That's it. You play a Tikiman defending his offspring from wave after wave of nature monsters by transforming the surrounding trees into weaponized barrels. I couldn't say that there's anything particularly special about it as a tower defense game, if only because I don't play enough tower defense to make sweeping statements about the genre. I guess that's the thing. To me, this game IS the tower defense genre: it's an intuitively designed, visually and musically appealing, simple, challenging game. Easy to understand but hard to master. I haven't beaten all the levels, 70 hours in at the time of this review, but I definitely want to.I want to logic out a reason why this game and not other games in the genre has become my go-to when I do get the itch for tower defense but I don't think the logic is there. Just visceral enjoyment. It's just a fun and relaxing game. I mean, there's some annoyances, yeah. It's definitely not mapped with common PC users' standards in mind. People say, oh there's no fast forward but it wouldn't make a lot of sense when many levels require you to change up your towers on the fly. Though I do feel bad when I get up to the second to last wave and it's something that none of my towers can handle, speedy armored flaming bees or whatever. It's never the kind of frustration that stops me from playing though.I loved it when I originally played it on the PSP and I love it on Steam. Considering it continues to pop up for super cheap in so many bundles and so many sales, I feel like it's become kind of a standard, there's-no-reason-not-to-have-it Steam game.

I've played this for well over a hundred hours between PS3/Vita and PC versions.You play a little tiki guy (1 or 2 player) and you use trees to build towers on as ground units/flying units/shielded units/fast units/etc try to get to the end and eat your friends.  Your towers level up by killing monsters but you can dance on them to level them up faster.  Guessing: there are over 30 stages included in this game along w/ a bunch of challenges (stages with unique requirements to win).  When you complete the game a new island unlocks that is basically a random stage generator.  It will randomly generate a stage and monsters for you to play on.You should buy this.

The game's PC controls are wonky odd and annoying, it felt much better with a controller than with the mouse and keyboard, so if you do choose to buy it, it's better if you have one.The main issue with this game is randomness and lack of information. The paths the monsters follow are really not well defined and even will be different between waves as they go up and down in the lane. This means towers that worked for you perfectly might just not shoot anything the next wave. The ranges of the towers are circular, combine that with the strange monster pathing you'll see towers aiming to shoot a monster but never actually fire just because they didn't enter the range long enough. What do upgrades do exactly? What are the base damages of the towers? How much range is each? How much damage does the upgrade give? This information as well as the monster pathing itself I suppose you're just supposed to learn through a lot of trial and error, which in a tower defense game where you can't directly interact with the monsters a calcualted defense is all you have. Bloons gets away with this by simplifying the ""monster"" hp, everything dies in one hit, pop it and it will change color or turn into more. In this game the monster HP doesn't even have the decency to stay consistent, the same tower that just killed a monster might leave the next in the same wave at low hp. The mechanics that trees will randomly have coins or gems as well as dancing to slowly upgrade towers, and needing to collect the coins to get money. to give you something to do really just make the whole experience feel more drawn out.Just... yuck, there's very little redeeming this game, play ANY other tower defense, and likely it will be better than this.I really liked pixel junk eden, but this wasn't anywhere close."

,Not Recommended,243780,20177914,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,vetmode,"A very simplistic tower defense game with a few unique twists which unfortunately don't manage to make it any better.There are six basic towers, three of which you have to unlock again in every single game you play. Tower upgrades are done with speciality drops which then change the flag color on your tower and give it more damage (were the devs too lazy to create upgraded tower models?). Building is done with a builder guy and can in fact only be done that way. Your builder also dies on monster contact and can pick up some left over coins from killed monsters. This makes the game hectic and kind of annoying, because you have to pick up the coins and upgrade drops quickly before they vanish, at the same time you also need to keep track of your towers. It's not a bad idea, has been done before for sure, but it only turns out to be a chore.The game's graphics are ok, very simplistic but that has a slight charm to it. Same with the sound effects and music. The biggest shortcoming here is the lack of a speed up button though. Maps take forever to finish and given that you only have 3 or 6 towers with the upgrades doesn't make this any fun. Especially since you have to run around the map and frantically collect drops without touching the spawned monsters. You also can't call monster waves early nor are there any rewards to play in an ascetic style playing with as little coin spent as possible. This could be an ok flash game I guess, but even then it would be playing in the smaller leagues as there are plenty of better tower defense games around, even the free ones."

I keep expecting to find a cash shop.I was gonna attribute its degeneracy -- annoyingly simplisticeverything-- to ""phones"" but it turns out it's just good ol' ""consoles"" we have to blame for this.First of all, any TD game that doesn't have a ""speed up"" function .... you fail.But, themostfrustrating aspect for me is that you are expected to maneuver your little dude around to pick up your tower-building-and-upgrading-monies, but the guy has this terrible inertia thing going on with his movement. So, when you are trying to move close to your enemies to pick up those coins, it's far too easy to ""slip"" and get one-shotted by the creeps, most of whom seem to ""attack"" you with a simple sprite-like collision detection a la classic coin-op games.  So yeah, no room for error. But bad control implementationleads youto err.FWIW I played Pixeljunk Shooter before this and I was really impressed.  ""Simple yet slick"".  This, OTOH is ""simple yet someone-plz-put-me-out-of-my-misery"".Oh well, I commend the devs for trying something ""a little"" ""different"", but OTOH I can't believe there wasn't a moment during development when some visionary was like ""Team, you know the top 9 things that you/i/everyone finds aggravating about our game?  Let's try to eliminate, say ...6of them?""One of these days when I get tired of giving a pass to every game that meets the minimum requirement of ""congrats, it runs!"", maybe I'll revisit my reviews and change some of them to ""not recommended.""  But lucky for PixelJunk Monsters, today is not that day.  In the meantime just be aware there's gotta be at least 5-10 TD games on steam that are more fun and less abusive than this one; your time is almost certainly better spent elsewhere.P.S. what's with the company logo being on the screen the whole time?

In this game you don't have as much freedom (and time) to experiment due to the added features like balloon monsters, flaming monsters and crabs.The best way to enjoy the game is switch to casual beat the game and then play again on casual or normal. That way you have the two most useful items in the game (the Hive and the Land Mine), you will also unluck arguably the most powerful tower and gain a bonus to gold each wave. This will make the game slightly less difficult and more enjoyable in my opinion.Recommended for those fans of the original as well as new players for something difficult but more simplistic than other games."

You play as a gay couple defending your 20 kids from being abducted buy religious fundamentalists. You run around building towers that you can dance by to make them level up faster. You can however not actually do anything towards the hoards yourself. Except for collecting coins do build more towers you also collect gems to unlock more powerful ones.The co-op is great and works both couch and online.  The only complain I have is that you have to unlock towers (to even have the possibility to unlock them in each stage) by finishing certain levels. This takes away a lot of tactics from several levels where your options are severely limited. You basically have to finish every stage to unlock all options. THEN you can REPLAY everything with the options that where there in the original game... yey! Why do games that focus on tactics purposely take away tactical choices? This problem does not exist on the PS3 version so why here?

,Not Recommended,243780,12634766,"Posted: 25 October, 2014",all,GammaFoxTBG,"It's a neat little TD game once you start, but quickly turns sour once you play enough. I wanted to like it. I really do love a good TD game, and this one looked charming. However, the flaws in this game turned me away from playing much more than an hour.There are certain features that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, such as losing coins when touching enemies. The only purpose of the little guy you're controlling is to either build towers or slowly upgrade them manually. Other than that, it can't really do anything to the enemies, which then raises the question of why must I be punished for touching enemies then? It stops me from collecting valuable resources, and makes it even more difficult to get across to try and build more towers if there's a large swarm of enemies. This adds no strategic value, and only ends in frustration with the enemies.The enemies, from what I gathered from the little I played, are pretty bland. Your anti-air towers are basically useless except for a few instances later in a game when the enemies get a little harder. Others are just frustrating because of the game's lack of balancing for quantity vs. quality of towers. Spiders, for instance, are very fast and come in great swarms, but easily crushed by cannon towers. The problem is, they move so fast that you can only get one, maybe two shots in from the cannons, and are difficult to kill fast enough with arrows. Golems are pretty much invincible execpt for cannons, and although they're a bit rarer, these ones you're definitely going to need some heavy upgrades on your cannons. Air enemies are basically a joke because as long as you have a decent amount of arrows, which you're going to need from the start, they're easily taken down. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't exactly add to the challenge.So, as I said before, the design of the game really hurts the balance of quality vs. quantity, because you're either going to have to throw an enormous amount of cannons everywhere, which is difficult as it is because their range is so short, or pray that a few heavily upgraded ones and a few other towers will do the job. Because of the angled perspective of the game however, half of their range is nearly useless because it will be blocked by trees or other towers. So the one tower that is incredibly useful and powerful without needing massive upgrades is half useless because of the perspective and range. On top of that, and this is another major point, the enemy paths on this game are going to frustrate you to no end. You have little-to-no indication of where the enemies are going, nor even a small arrow at the beginning to give you an idea of where they'll start. You basically have to guess how close they're going to be in the middle of the paths, or if they hug the sides. Because the overall paths are so wide, it makes it hard to gauge where you should be placing certain towers, such as the cannons. This is severely debilitating, as it can force you to have to restart a level simply because of finding out your towers are far off from where the enemies are going, so all that happens is they fly by and leave you annoyed.I hate to review a game with so little play time, but with so many major flaws right out of the gate, I don't think curiousity really warrants trying more of it. Maybe if it has a major sale I'd say try picking it up to try, but other than that, I can't say I would recommend it. Considering it's a year old, I wouldn't expect it to get any better any time soon."

You get a large variety of bad-a$$ towers to choose from like fire towers, ice towers, laser towers, arrow towers, cannon towers, and much more to take down your enemies. Around half the towers you use are to be unlocked by beating other levels. A rewarding experience to unlock the new towers and watch at how powerfully you can blast through a previous level to try to obtain a perfect score, unlocking new levels to ultimately, unlock even more content. The amount of replayability to this game goes on a whole 'nother scale of ""awesome"". What Pixeljunk Monsters does, is it gives you a standard tower defense game layout, and create an enlightening charm, creative ideas, and personality that cannot easily be replicated.Just like I like to tell people about Serious Sam (very unrelated game) is that the enemies and sheer creativity given to them makes the game memorable. Another trait that both games have in common is that you learn to acknowledge the sound of your enemy. Whether it be knowing what's coming (Serious Sam) or knowing what you've just killed (PJ Monsters) hearing the sounds of your enemy is only accomplishing if you begin to love the characters you're decimating.This Steam release does feel rather lacking, now here's where things get more in-depth.PJ Monsters feels more like a Steam port than an ultimate HD re-master. There's a new map that ""randomly generates levels"", but this is actually nothing more than the game on ""shuffle"" as it gives you a random map from the game and changes few things like enemy spawns and location textures. The maps are exclusively the same otherwise.The game does look remarkable in HD on a monitor, and saying this without playing the original PS3 version, I feel as if it's probably not too different from how it looked on there. In fact, the game being in ""HD"" should be a given, and not an announcement. The game isn't old. Regardless of their showing off ""High Definition"", the game looks nice, plays nice, plays right, and plays fair.They do give you Steam trading cards, which is probably the best feature added to this Steam port. They include descriptions of what you're fighting, and if you collect them all you can share your love of the game to your friends by showing off your pride with your PJ Monsters badge.Did I mention co-op though? The co-op feature to this game on Steam is undenyably the best way to play. Get a friend to buy the game, or purchase the two-in-one bundle and blast through these baddies with strategic planning, mapping, and basically any other skill you can accomplish in a game of tower defense, with a friend! (I think the maximum was eight players at a time, but I don't have enough friends who play this and the Steam page doesn't explain co-op for the game too well as of this review, so I cannot say for certain).Overall, I feel like with this release there could have been a little more content (I think if they revised the randomly generated levels to actually be randomly generated that would be enough for me) would have been nice. The game delivers what you'd expect and the charm of this game is enough to play it alone. It's not scary, it's not hyper, it's not angry, it's just happy and fun.9.6/10"

I've stuck many hrs into the PS3 and PSP versions, and when I seen it for sale on Steam I knew I had to get it again. Pixeljunk Monsters is a tower defense game, but instead of just placing towers down and upgrading you have this little dude that runs around and puts towers down (in place of trees). Towers upgrade faster when you stand over them, and they also upgrade by killing enemies. Enemies also drop coins and gems when defeated and you must run over to them to pick them up. There are different towers, and more towers unlock as you progress. Use strategy to figure out what works best against what, and for tower placement. There are a lot of challenging stages, so if you enjoy TD games you're in for many, many hours of fun. The only TD game I prefer over PM is Defense Grid (also on Steam)."

I was addicted to this game on PS3, and I bought the VITA edition as well. I figured I'd try to get all the achievements in the steam edition too, but this version is a bit harder than the PS3 version due to some addtional content added.Ok, for this game the first thing you need to know is that it can be extremely difficult. You could be doing great on a level and then get destroyed by a wave out of nowhere. This game does require multiple retries to get a PERFECT CLEAR on a lot of the levels. When you retry, you start from the beginning of the level and there is no way to fast forward like some TD games let you do.I have some pretty basic advice for anyone who wants to do well:*Don't worry about getting a PERFECT CLEAR on every level before advancing to the next level. You'll unlock new towers and abilities thtoughout the game which will dramatically help you. Go back and get the PERFECT CLEARS when you have the extras unlocked.Main item here is the Mine ability. This will save you very frequently*Don't spam the Anti-Air towers. A single AA tower upgraded to max level is probably more effective than 10 AA towers at the lowest level. Plus it's ""free"" to upgrade rather than buy new towers (Free in the sense that it costs no gold)*The slow down (frost) towers are too expensive and are rarely needed. I can rainbow almost every level without them. HOWEVER -  Some enemies are animated as being on fire and they have insanely super speed. Using a frost tower will permanently remove their speed bonus with one hit (and the frost tower can have a big splash radius as well). There are a few waves in the game that are almost impossible without this tower, so keep that in mind if you're having a brutal time with the fire guys.Those would be the main 3 things I think everyone should be aware of. Everything else you can figure out. To summarize the 'review' aspect of this:-This is one of the best TD games ever made. It is extremely balanced and every level can be mastered with practice.-Two player co-op is a blast!-No IAPS or DLC. Everything is included here-Lots of levels and challenges and achievements. Loads of playtime and replayability"

If it weren't for this mechanic, I would probably only get 15 hours out of this game, but thanks to interest, I can reach for that fantasy of completely breaking a level to the point where the last 5 waves are nothing. And the boss? Well, the bosses are always weak. That's something I think could be improved. The bosses could be a bit stronger, particularly considering its the last wave and you can sell your used towers for extra cash. Would also love to have an item/level up system that could make your guy move faster, level up towers faster, or makes towers more powerful when you stand around them.

,Not Recommended,243780,35006941,Posted: 16 September,all,Mr. Matt,"I enjoy this game's visual aesthetic, and its sound effects are nice. I also like the towers themselves, for the most part. However, I don't think I've ever played a more stressful tower defense game in my life. Keep in mind that I love Sanctum 2, and it has you running all over the place and shooting at enemies while you're getting attacked, and alternating primary and secondary fire and different guns, worrying about reloading fast enough to kill enemies before they reach the core, etc. With PixelJunk Monsters, however, if you take even a second to try to strategize mid-game, you're probably already screwed. How so? Well, let's see...The mobs of enemies come in a few seconds after the map loads. You do not have time to look at it and decide where to put a tower. In fact, there are typically multiple spawn points on every map, and the game never tells you which point the next wave will be spawning from until they're already there, and by then, it's probably too late for you to build a tower that will be sufficient. While I'm reeling from seeing which side the enemy is already barreling down and I'm trying to play damage control to just barely stop them in time, the next wave is about to spawn, and by the time I finish dealing with the first wave, the second wave has already spawned. Which side(s) do they spawn on? Good luck guessing. Choose poorly and you're going to lose some lives. Building from the end outward will help, but only so much, due to the range and firing speeds of the towers.Well, at least you can just sit back and spend money like crazy, building towers fast and succeed, right? Haha, no. The whole time your towers are killing, you control a little Tiki guy who you have to run around to pick up coins the enemies drop. Don't go fast enough? The coins disappear, meaning you are permanently handicapped on that run in terms of how much you have to spend on towers. Gem stones also drop on occasion, and if you don't pick those up, you could miss them, too.Gem stones are used to unlock the superior towers a few minutes into each match, and not only do you have to make sure you grab them when enemies drop them, but there are also two trees in a literal small forest on every map which will pop out a gem stone each. If you don't find these, chances are you will be delayed in getting the superior towers, which will likely lead to more lives lost, because the inferior towers are worthless against certain enemies.On that note, enemies will spawn with a glow to them; a certain color. They might be green, blue, red, or not glow at all. The game doesn't tell you what this means. Each glow typically means the enemy is weak to a certain ""element"" from your towers. It's nothing super obvious and clear cut. You will need to either resort to trial and error, or look up a walkthrough to figure out what towers you need. If you don't get the right tower(s), chances are you're about to game over. All of the elemental towers are locked and require gem stones to unlock, so no, you can't just build one of everything to protect yourself, either, because you likely won't have enough gemstones to unlock more than one or two types of towers by the time these enemies pop up.Well, if you just keep wildly running around like mad, atleastyou can get into the groove of that quick motion and keep things happening, right? Pffft, no. The game also expects you to either stand next to a tower,notdoing the many other vital tasks, while waiting for a slowly-filling bar to fill up as your character dryly dances beside the tower to increase its stats. I could spend gem stones to level a tower faster, but then I don't have enough gem stones to unlock an elemental tower and the glowing enemies waltz by my non-elemental towers and give me a game over.So let's recap! The game wants you to run around searching trees for gem stoneswhilesetting up towers and having to physically have your character next to the build site to place them,whileknowing where to build which towers despite having no clue which of the multiple entrances the enemies will come from,whilecollecting the coins and gem stones they drop,whiledancing next to towers to level them up very slowly,whilewatching for the element(s) to unlock to deal with whatever color glow the enemies show up with. So much being demanded of the player simultaneously and immediately removes the ability to strategize, which, in my opinion, is one of the vital elements of a tower defense, instead calling for rapid, sloppy actions and an inability to ever feel satisfied with watching my towers kill enemies, because I'm overloaded with busy work the second the game starts.Like I said, Sanctum 2 is an exciting TD/FPS hybrid, and I loved it. Back in highschool, I thought ""eustress"" was a stupid vocabulary word. Who ever heard of ""good stress?"" No stress at all is better, or so I thought. Then I began looking deeper into things, and it finally clicked that there is such a thing as good stress. Having something to do every day, even if it isn't necessarily ""fun,"" that gets you out of bed is an important thing in life. You might have stressors, but all stress isn't bad. It can be good and makes life interesting and helps with honing skills and even getting better at a job to be ready for promotions or potentially managing, etc. However, if there is stress in your life that drives you to anger and frustration regularly, it's not eustress. It's just a thorn in your side that should be pulled out and discarded. PixelJunk Monsters has no qualities that can redeem it for me, as it drives me to anger without any positive fulfillment or satisfaction."
