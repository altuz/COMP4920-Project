,Not Recommended,244070,9463923,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Aussiedroid,"Bland, limited & repetitive gameplay is what you can expect from Sid's Ace Patrol. I really tried to enjoy this (I put in the time!), but it has none of the 'one-more-turn' addictiveness of his other games.So why is it so bad you ask?Each map looks almost identical, graphics look like direct port from mobile platform, the mission types you can count on one hand & the game itself is very short covering 24 missions across 4 campaigns. They can go quick too! You do not feel there is any progression as you go through as the game centres around your score; having little in the way of feeling like you are winning a war. There is no territory to defend or conquer instead you choose from 3 random missions then up to 4 pilots to progress through each level. Pilot & plane upgrades are rewarded as you proceed through your game, but only really make it easier to win & that isn't really a strong point when the 'Legend' difficulty is not really very challenging. Legend (besides boosting your score) just makes it more frustrating than anything else since the opposing pilots get big stats boosts making it take a painfully long time to shoot them down yet much easier for you to be shot down.Tactically you will find many dogfights are reduced to both of you flying around in circles for multiple moves until the AI decides to fly out giving you an opening to attack. You can try different tactics but it always comes back to 'circling' from my experience. Once you get behind someone it is very hard for them to get away (unless they're an Ace pilot), and likewise when the roles are reversed. It makes the first few turns of your engagment most important, but then very predictable after that. To add to this, I also couldn't play this on my old PC with ATI graphics as it wouldn't render the display, showing all white, so I have only been able to play recently since I got my new PC with NVidia graphics.All said & done, I can't help but to ask myself why Sid would put his name on such a sub-par game, let alone make a sequel! Also milking it further by charging almost twice as much locally in AU @ $8.99 instead of US @ $4.99 (still well overpriced for what you get if you ask me).Very disappointing! :(If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"
,Recommended,244070,20514923,"Posted: 13 January, 2016",all,ownosourus,"Back in the day, Ace of Aces was a book-based air combat game. Each player would select an aerial maneuver in an attempt to gain a positional advantage over their opponent. Based on the comparison of the maneuvers chosen, each player would be directed to turn to a page in their book that gave the view from their cockpit and another series of maneuvers from which to chosen. Sid Meier's Ace Patrol uses the power of the personal computer to do the same thing.Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is a simple one or two player game simulating air combat in World War I. The game avoids the immersive experience of a first-person flight simulator and the more complex physics that the experience brings. Instead, the game uses a hexagon based movement system with a view of action from the side, much like a board game. Flight physics is simplified by giving the player a selection of ""legal"" maneuvers so you don't have to worry about pushing your pilot or aircraft beyond its limits. Airspeed doesn't play a factor in the game and altitude is generalize to one of four levels (well, five if you count the ground). It was very easy to learn the game's mechanics despite the lack of documentation. There is a tutorial and hints are displayed at the beginning of each scenario.The game itself is set up in a campaign style. The player selects one of four nationalities (British, American, French or German) and a special skill for one of their pilots. During the game, players manage a squadron of four pilots, selecting skill upgrades as pilots increase in experience and aircraft upgrades as the squadron completes missions. The player has the option of switching aircraft types for each pilot between missions. Aircraft have five characteristics that they are rated from one to five to allow players a general understanding of each type's performance against other aircraft.Covering the years between 1916 and 1918, the player's squadron participates in four campaigns with six battles each. Each battle presents the player with 1 to 3 different missions with varying degrees of difficulty and reward. Missions are performed either over friendly territory or enemy territory. The location of the mission will determine what side of the map the objective is on. Landing behind enemy lines will result in your pilot being captured as a prisoner of war and unavailable for the remainder of the campaign. Crash landing in friendly territory will result in injuries that will keep the pilot out of battle for a number of missions. Missions available are randomly selected with the exception of the final battle which appears to always be a ""boss fight"" against an enemy zeppelin and its fighter escort.I found the game to be a highly enjoyable simulation of air combat with a small element of asset management. Missions are short and the entire game can be completed within few hours. The randomization of missions for each battle provides extended replayability. Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol is a simple game with a simple interface that is a delight to play."

Two months have passed, and today I finally realized it was time I tried it.... and damn! It's actually a fun game!Having Sid Meier's name in the title, I expected this game to be heavy, super-deep and difficult to learn, kinda like Civilization, but it's actually pretty simple, intuitive and easy to get into. I've only been playing for a few hours, and while I'm sure the more advanced missions and the harder difficulty levels can make the game very challenging and complex, it's very begginer-friendly on 'easy mode', so I'm quite happy that for once, I put my ego aside and started with the lowest difficulty level (I usually choose ""Normal"" or whatever the medium difficulty level is called).Ugh, not sure how to summarize this, so I'll just go grab something to eat.

This is a game that you can pick up and run with in a coffee break, but will still draw you in for the long sessions. Originally made for mobile devices, it's short sweet and simple. this is reflected in the price, so it's easy to buy with no regrets. The Graphics aren't amazing, but they don't leave your eyes bleeding. Things kinda look like the things they should look like, and the style reminded me of ""WINGS"" waaay back in my Amiga days. The controls are fairly straightforward, and the icons make it obvious. (a twisty arrow beside you means ""roll this way"" an arrow curling upwards means ""Climb"" etc) so there is no need for a long training mission, just enough to check you can click and tell how to shoot the enemy. The different factions and their planes are given special commands or abilities which fit in without intruding (some turn faster, some have better guns, etc)If you see it on sale, remember that you can download it faster than you read this review. I guarantee it'll make a train journey fly past, (especially in 2-player hotseat mode) or make a nice break between ""serious"" games on your rig at home."

Sid Meier's Ace Patrol sidesteps these stigmas to a fault, Designed for iOS devices originally, Ace Patrol is a dogfighting game set in WWI. With a series of manuevers to intense air combat is engaged over a battlefield of hexagonal grids. Using simple mouse commands,  players execute everything from strafing to swooping dives, hard banking, the Immelman turn and other expert maneuvers and that is it. My Pros and ConsPROSA: Simple easy tutorial, very streamlined tactic, you can name pilots, promote, and simply follow the action on different skill levels.B: Atfer a while it is more planning than executing as you start to recongnize patterns in the enemy.C: You feel like an ACE at times because of the simple dynamics of Ace Patrol. Even my 5 year old got it.D:  It does not try to do too much. Missions are straight forward and easy to pick upE: The look is simple, colors to customize your planes, and good solid sound effects and graphics. even if they are old school.CONSA; Its positive is it's negative. Not much of a challenge beyond the missions and goals. There is no strategy features like building up your squadron size, no real story mode of the pilots you select. It is too simple for its own goodB: The enemy is too redundant and not fun enough. Since you stay fighter pilots, you don't get to have fun being a bomber, or torpedo plane, execute full mission goals, like an actual stragey WW1. This is just flying and shooting, which may turn off players.C: The game quit on me a few times and then reloaded on its own, with the quick save, you never lose your place. However, annoyingD: Like many other Firaxis missed an opportunity to have a true ww1 strategy game. They could have doubled down and make a real neat WWI strategy turn based game like PTO, Instead chose one aspect and streamlined that. Their lossOVERALL: Ace Patrol does its job, perhaps too well to simplify things. I finished the game in several hours in easy mode, BUT found it more fun on higher level skills. Keep that in mind. Again, go to the discussion, see VIDEO of gameplay before you buy. For the price or a few dollars. Worth adding for some simple funOVERALL: 3 out of 5 stars"

A lot.It crashes at the end of a mission, which is about the worst place possible. It will let you play through the whole mission, and when you've won (or lost) it will just crash to desktop, and you have to reload and start that mission again. And then it might crash again anyway.It was crashing around every second mission or so.I enjoy this game.

76561198023319831,Recommended,244070,25484428,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,Shipwrecked,"Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is the first of two Ace Patrol games (the second being Pacific Skies), and is, to me at least, the better of the two games. To sum it up, Ace Patrol is a light strategy game where players control a 4 man squadron on the Western Front during the First World War. It's not a bad game, but it has it's quirks. Here's the details:Graphics - The first thing players see, and what gives the biggest impression because of it. Graphically speaking, the game is either sort of cool or really ugly depending on your preference. A lot of people say the graphics look like a Android ported game, and, from what I understand, it's because it is an Android port. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the game is more about tatics and strategy than graphics. I think the cartoon esque graphics are fine, and they seem to fit the game, even if they are somewhat glitchy at times.Rating: 3/5Gameplay - Gameplay is fairly good. I find myself having that one more turn addiction I get from other Sid games, although not to the same affect as I would from games like Civilization. Gameplay consists of cotrolling a squadron of up to four pilots in tatical air battles over the Western Front. The goal of each mission varies, with everything from balloon busting to escort duties being available.Squadron members can ""learn"" new maneuvers, which makes them more effective in combat. The same happens with enemy squadrons, which means the game gets progressively more challenging over time. Unfortunately, this means if you haven't been able to upgrade a squadron member, he\she becomes rather useless as they basically become cannon fodder. Overall though the replayability is fairly high, even if some missions are bit repetitive.Rating: 4/5Sound/Music - As can be expected with a game like this, music is basically non-exsistent. There's some at the beginning and end of each mission, and some for the menu and that's it. What's there isn't bad, and music isn't really needed. Sound on the other hand is really good. There's sounds for everything. From machine gun fire to explosions, it all sounds pretty good. There are a few bugs where the sound gets garbled, but this can be overlooked as it doesn't happen often.Rating: 4/5Overall, the game is good as long as your willing to overlook a few glitches and to some extent, depending on your taste, ugly graphics. Gameplay is solid, and the game serves it purpose of being a light strategy game. If your looking for a more casual gameplay experience, are just looking for a decent WWI game, or just want to try one of Sid Meier's gaming experiments, I recommend it. If, however, your turned off by cartoony graphics or shallow gameplay, then I would skip it.Overall rating: 6/10"

Graphics are not high quality, but the gameplay does make up for that a lot. This game has got the Sid Meier's feel of gameplay all over it. A lot of tiny variables you need to account for before making a move. The only thing that bugged me is that there is no option for changing the resolution. The resolution is quite low. I guess that stems from the origin of this game. It was originally created for the iPhone. Apparently changing the resolution may be possible with a config.xml in your User's appdata folder (C:/Users/[yourusername]/AppData/Local/AcePilot/config.xml). I read that in the description of a youtube screencast here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzyFdVxWA4I did have the folder, but not the xml file. I am too lazy to write something on a trial and error basis or to send an email to the devs, so I am playing it really low res. If the gameplay rocks I do not care about the graphics so for me it is not an issue. I do not know if the devs will implement a possiblity for changing it.

The game mechanic of trading altitude for speed and advanced maneuvers is breathtaking in its clarity, simplicity, and plausible authenticity.The early days of air combat lead to a game of jousting and attack runs, both sides clawing for altitude and position, weaving in and out of clouds and flak zones, trying to line up a shot or trick the enemy into lining themselves up for another pilot's power dive kill shot. Taking to the air knowing you're facing a supremely skilled enemy Ace is a daunting prospect as he dances his bird across the sky, crossing your engagement lines in a lightning sprint and performing daring aerobatics to bring himself up into your squadron's six, but even the best pilot can find himself hard pressed if he lets himself get caught at low altitude, exhausted by constant high-gee flying.It's a light, tight, satisfying game that shows its mobile roots on the surface but the underlying design shows an understanding of what makes a game work that dwarfs most AAA releases."

I particularly like the pilot portraits and the selectable colour schemes.The game isn't tactically very deep, nor will you be playing it for months, but it's not meant to be. A good value light weight strategy game, ideal as an introduction to the genre or for a quick strategy fix if you've only half an hour to spare.Playing through a single campaign (of which there are four) is easily done in an evening. There's good variety in the missions, considering the size of the game, and enough to keep you entertained through to the end."

While its successor tackles WW2, this takes on WW1 where the strategy involves maneuvering your plane into the best possible position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, nev maneuvers, planes and improvements become avaliable. The game is a casual one, but while you cannot expect much depth or complexity from it, you can expect it to be a fun pack-up-and-play game. And in all honesty, how many WW1 Air Combat TBS games are there out there? The originality of it alone deserves mention!Another thing that should be mentioned is that your squadron will have female combat pilots. While I applaud the inclusion of female pilots on the principle of it being awesome, I am puzzled why Firaxis neglected to include an option to disable them for those that want to preserve some historical accuracy.Pro:*Fun little TBS air-combat game.*Includes female pilots, yay!*Casual pick-up-and-play style.Con:*Lacking in depth and complexity.*No option to turn off female pilots for those wanting historical accuracy.*Not a lot of customization when it comes to graphics, etc.Summary:Ace Patrol is worth its asking price, so long as you do not expect a great amount of depth, complexity or historical accuracy. That being said, it is a fun game set in a very interesting era of aviation! 5/10 -Recomended.For more recomendations and reviews:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation"

A turn-based dogfighting game seemed a bit of a strange concept to me at first, and this game takes some getting used to, but it's actually quite fun so far.  It's proved to be harder than it seemed becasue there are so many moves the little planes can make (and I'm probably a lousy pilot too).  You also have to watch out for flak guns shooting up at you from the ground.  But as you gain victories and experience during the missions (strafing ground targets, shooting down balloons, dogfighting with enemy fighters, intercepting bombers, etc.) your pilots will get promoted and you can upgrade your aircraft.  I'm still learning the ropes, but it's an amusing little game so far.  Definitely worth buying, especially if it's on sale.  Have fun with it!  :)"

Some additionnal stuff is available if you succeed to finish nations campaigns. If you expect a simulator like game, pass your way, this one is more based on tactics and strategy. A mission  can be played  in less than 30mnShould you like previous boargames, you may wish that they had developped some add-ons with new planes, new WWI countries and more elaborate campaigns."

Game is Good and entertaining  but random and constant crash will frustrate you and force you to play same mission for multiple times. Finally I quit playing this Bugmeier Ace Patrol. Stay away

Should say mission and a half.  Everytime I complete the 2nd mission of intercepting the German reconnaissance aircraft the game crashes.  So far, I wouldn't recommend this game as it crashed on the second mission everytime.  I thought it could be fun maybe if this program is debugged."

However, there are graphic bugs, the game crashes and automaticlly closes.  Frustrating to say the least.  Don't buy if you want to spend money.  If it comes bundled, its your chace to see a Sid Meier's game that is not the same high standard as the rest.After a few more tries, and a couple of updates, it works well.  Perhaps it was the initial bugs but works well now.  Takes away all the dice rolling and calculations of turns and all.  Recommended for those who want a simple game, yet with the option of making this more challenging."
