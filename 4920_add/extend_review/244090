The premise is really interesting and I think the game mechanics are nicely executed. The planes each have a different feel, and the game does a good job of modeling ""energy fighting"" (e.g. trading altitude for speed and vice versa) and roll/turn rates (a P40 will roll left/right within a hex; a Zero doesn't roll so good but can sustain a turn to 120 degrees, etc.)Beyond that... it's a good thing this game is just $5 because it is woefully under-polished, especially for a Sid Meier title. The missions are very repetitive (180 are claimed, but they're really a variation on four or five missions with different enemy planes in them), the animations are clunky, and there are endless small boneheaded things that will annoy you.It's very good for a tablet game, but I can't give it my full recommendation."

But AP: PS is such a unique game, gameplay wise it's a great buy.  It's cheap to buy,  no fancy graphics or animations.  But the gameplay is quite complex and UNIQUE.  A strategy game that is even slightly unique hasnt been invented in like forever.  ALL OF THEM are the same♥♥♥♥♥♥.But I had never played a turn based, x,y,z axis, WW2 military airial combat RPG.  And when I did, I was glad.  This♥♥♥♥♥♥is FUN. And the missions only last like 8-10 minutes each.It takes turn based military to another level, each place has stats, each pilot has stats, and together they earn gear and movesets.  And by mid campaign you can pull off some SWEET tag teams with your planes.  Hiding in clouds, fly upside down over someone so they can't shoot you next turn.  The ways each move can play out once your in battle are insane.If it sounds good, get it.  I would LOOOVE to see more of this made just for PC.  Even though I don't care much about graphical fidelity."
,Recommended,244090,20536431,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,ownosourus,"The great strategy of Sid Meier's Ace Patrol returns with Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies. It's set during World War II; where players have the choice to play as the US Navy, US Army, Imperial Japanese Navy, and Imperial Japanese Army. It certainly has a familiar presentation for those who played the original, but it’s also more polished and enhanced. The mission set-up is different as players are given one mission instead of a choice between three. I also find the visuals to be more polished and likable, but that's probably because I love the old warbirds.Pacific Skies offers that same great strategy, though these aircraft are capable of additional moves and tighter turns. This means facing an enemy ace can be a daunting task. It’s always important to keep the enemy aircraft out in front. If not, players can lose position and fail to shake the enemy off their tail - eventually being shot down. I’m reminded of this often as I’ve made the mistake of going in heavy for an attack on multiple occasions. This led to an enemy aircraft getting in prime position to shoot down my plane. This is why the strategy of Ace Patrol is so much fun for aviation enthusiasts and strategy fans. It’s a game of chess that takes place in the skies above. If players make one wrong move, it could very easily be check-mate for their aircraft.There are multiple difficulty levels to choose from so it can be a very fun and causal experience for those who play on easy. The rest of us that like a challenge will enjoy the harder difficulties, even when things get impossible. It's exciting, and that means everything in a game like this.With each mission there is one objective, and once players complete it they can fly back to base or shoot down the remaining aircraft to finish the mission. Obviously, shooting down the remaining aircraft is perfect for getting high scores on the many available leaderboards, but sometimes that might not be the best idea when players have damage on their aircraft. It's still fun to bait an enemy aircraft with one plane while coming from behind with another. There are also endless chases where players wait for the remaining enemy to make one wrong turn so they can finally shoot it down.Pacific Skies is a wonderful enhancement on the original Ace Patrol, giving players even more strategic aerial greatness to enjoy. It's a fantastic strategy title with its simple controls and gameplay mixed with good objectives and tough difficulty levels. It really leads to some of the best strategy that can be found on the App Store. Plus, there is online multiplayer to keep players busy beyond the 180+ missions. Go fly over the Pacific, Ace Pilots!"

Who knew that could work.This really looked like iPad shovelware to me, but I tried it, because, you know, Sid Meier. Turns out, it's really fun. It models the performance of the planes really nicely, and the RPG elements work well.It could really use some larger scenarios, a scenario editor, and online multiplayer.

There really aren't that many historical air combat TBS games out there, so it is hard to compare it to anything else. It feels a bit like a smartphone-port, yet the controls work well so I cannot really say that this is a drawback in itself. The game IS casual, so do not expect it to have overly much complexity to it. The core of the game is assigning different maneuvers to your pilot(s), trying to put them in the best position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, you unlock new maneuvers and gain new planes and improvements.Pro:*Simple, engaging pick-up-and-play gameplay.*Both sides are balanced the same.*Has a certain charm to its style.Con:*Not that much depth to it.Summary:A fun little TBS game that will cater to your desire for a casual TBS experience, Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is worth its pricetag so long as you do not expect anything with too much depth and complexity to it. 6/10 - Recommended.For more recomendations and reviews:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation"

,Recommended,244090,8686822,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,DeadPoolX,"Sid Meier's Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is the sequel to Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. This is not a carbon copy, however, and more was done than simply swapping models and textures.So what's different? Primarily the setting, although quite a few game mechanics have been changed.As the name suggests, the game takes place in the pacific theatre of war. The only nations involved are the Empire of Japan and the United States of America. Unfortunately, this reduces the overall choice the player has, since they basically get the option of choosing Army or Navy for either nation. At least each branch has their own planes, so you'll only see a F6F Hellcat when playing the US Navy or a P38 Lightning when playing the US Army.I have to admit, it's somewhat disappointing the only two options are the USA and Japan. Granted, that's to be expected given the location the game takes place in, but I enjoyed having four different nations to play in Ace Patrol. I can understand the decision to take this route, as the war in Europe would've looked even more like a rehash of Ace Patrol. Even so, the multi-national feel of the first game held more appeal for me.Like the first Ace Patrol, you have four pilots. They can earn promotions, gain abilities, get callsigns (which give them a unique trait, such as becoming immune to anti-aircraft fire), become injured or captured by the enemy. There's also two new options available: you can make all pilots male or have both male and female (like the first Ace Patrol), and you can allow pilots to die.Unlike the first Ace Patrol, abilities are no longer tied to the pilot himself. Instead, these abilities are installed on the aircraft. That means each new aircraft you get has no upgrades, even if the plane itself is better in numerous categories. Fortunately, you can switch back and forth between all planes, so if you liked an older plane more than the newest one, you can fly that.One reason the ability to switch between planes is important because, unlike the first Ace Patrol, aircraft damage isn't repaired after every mission. Instead, damage persists until the campaign is over (admittedly, campaigns are only four missions each, so they don't take much time to complete) and then your plane is fully repaired.The only exception is the ""Grease Monkey"" callsign, which lets that pilot repair their plane in small increments after each mission. Callsigns are presented after shooting down seven enemy planes; however, which four callsigns you have to choose from (for each pilot) is selected at random, so you might not see ""Grease Monkey"" appear or all four pilots could be offered it.Another change is that you no longer get to select which mission you fly. In the first Ace Patrol, you could choose between three missions (sometimes only one was available, but in those missions the entire squadron flew), but in Pacific Skies, the mission is given to you. As each campaign consists of four missions, you could easily end up flying the same type of mission four times in a row.The game's graphics are no better (but no worse) than Ace Patrol, except for one area: the pilots themselves. This may be a personal preference, but I preferred the way the pilots look in Ace Patrol. In Pacific Skies, they look like deformed bobble-head dolls. Even more confusing is when pilots gain rank, their emblems or pins don't change, they just gain extra pieces of flight gear. Gain a rank and you'll get goggles, for instance. Sometimes medals don't even show up, despite the fact you were told that pilot was awarded one as well.Would I recommend Pacific Skies? Only if you really liked Ace Patrol and you've got a strong interest in World War II, particularly the pacific theatre. I don't think Pacific Skies is as ""fun"" as the original Ace Patrol, but I've always had a stronger interest in World War I than World War II, so perhaps that's my own personal bias getting in the way."

I like turn based hex games, I like the history of the Pacific Air War. Sounded like it might be worth a look and it certainly was. Basically a boardgame where the computer controls your opponent and handles all the dice rolls for you - if that is your thing, this is an enjoyable board game for you. You can upgrade your aircraft and pilots if you are succesful in battle. The game consists of many small rounds, so this is also a great game for when you have just a few minutes to spare - do a mission and save the next for later. Multiple skill levels allow you to have relatively easy to quite tricky missions to achieve. I've spent far more time playing this than I ever expected to!"

This can be very helpful to know which poilt is which on your side.  And you can upgarde the planes with add on mods you get after winning a battle. Sometimes the poilt will level up and you can train new skills to use.Overall rating inmo  7.5/10  if it succesfully works on your computer.[Important note: DO NOT buy if your using XP operating system it will NOT RUN.

It comes with most of the other features of the previous game (randomised pilots you can name that can earn RPG traits and manauvers through experince whilst fighting randomised missions between 1-4 AI pilots using hex combat in a turn based system) and it is especially worth it after playing Ace Patrol.Pacific Skies takes place the era of warfare where planes have shifted over to faster engines and single wings. Thus the turn based combat is slightly deadlier and quicker than in the prequal game but the aim is still the same (get on their six cover your own). The art assets of course are very very different and much more varied. Both the two American and Japanese factions do dog fighting over land and sea and there are a few new twists added (Instead of Offensives it is now eight famous WW2 battles of the campaign with six missions each to do) like a mission to shoot down a pilot or towers to save one of your crashed pilots from a POW camp. Plane customisation has improved, you can now paint five different part of your squadrons plans with a varied amount of WW2 flight insignia.While like Ace Patrol there are a few minor once in a blue moon issues with the tiles (I had a mission where an enemy pilot just few into a tile and vanished from the game, assumed crashed) it played a straight up solid indie title like previous game. So in total and in my genuide opinion getting this and the older WW1 themed brother together during a sale will entertaining you for a solid 22 hours in total for a first run on each game."

Would it be better to do a roll here or try a flat spin to make the opponent go by??? If you like stratagey games I can recommend this game. I have played for just a little while but I enjoyed it. Please remember that this is a older game so the graphics are not super. I got it in a bundle so I did not pay full price. I think at half off I would jump on it. Is less off than that than YES PLEASE.Good luck and don't fly straight.

It is enjoyable and like the earlier version it is easy to understand and play.(Note I Have Only Played On the Japanese Side At The Time Of This Posting)The Pacific Skies version does not allow selection of missions, in the previous game there was usually a selection of different reward values and dificulty. Planes in this game maintain mechanical improvements selected, so when a pilot moves to a newer plane model the enhancements earned stay with the older model. Repairs for a players squadron occur when new planes arrive. Damage to the squadron carring over to the next mission adds another layer of tactics, or caution,  to the game play. In one of my missions I had to select between an 81% damaged and a 40% damaged plane, means this plane will have to hang back and do finishing shots if possible. These notable changes or rules do not seem to be present anywhere in game but can be found in steam discussions and forums for the game. The fiery smoke from downed targets blocks alot of the shootdown cutsceens. The game is fun and slightly more challenging than the first release , but the graphics and cutsceens seem to be a little poorer or rushed perhaps.Thanks for your time."

It's fun but I wish there was more attacking of ground targets such as ships, vehicles, bases which the game really doesn't have any of.  So if you're buying it, you are buying it for a turn based dog fighting simulator."

Still simple, easy to understand and control and toonish, but as it's predesessor it delivers an ample challenge and a good portrait of small scale aerial combat. Simple and well-made along the principles of an old Sherman tank, I've never encountered any bugs and have had a decent amount of fun from this game. Recommended."
