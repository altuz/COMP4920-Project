The tech tree is good, battles are a little boring, but all in all, good. There is NO supply chain though. There is for your forces on the ground (local level), but not in the big picture (country level). When Germany needs more oil, it can just get it instantly from Mexico, or anyone else who will sell it to them. Like wise, the German U-boats serve no real purpose (the Battle for the Atlantic doesn't exist) as you can't sink cargo ships and attack convoys as they don't exist. There is no real point to having/building/researching any submarines as they pretty much ineffective in game. But this single point is a show stopper for me.Update to this from Battlegoat:""While Supreme Ruler 1936 simulates the wide span of WWII, like other games of the genre we have strengths and weaknesses to what we can simulate in high detail. Naval is currently not a ""specialty"" of SR1936, though we do have every intention of continuing to improve this area.-- George / BattleGoat.""From page 2 of the descusion from link:http://steamcommunity.com/app/244410/discussions/0/630802344410551969/UPDATE  OCT 20, 2016I realize this is way late and likely to not be read, but I wanted to write it anyway.It seems there is some serious issues with balance and economy in the game. Unemployment goes down and never comes back. (I know low unemployment is typicaly a good thing, but too low means you have no workforce to work if you build anything).I played a game as Brazil and after taking over most all of S. America by 1947, my UnEmpl. is 2.1% and never recovering despite growing in pop by over a million a day due to to immagration.Details on this here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/244410/discussions/0/333656722971687056/"

That version is the only one they've ever finished.  SR 1936 here was 'fully released and finished' just a couple months ago (summer 2014) and in many peoples opinions is far from finished.  Not to worry though, they've already got SR Ultimate on Early Release.. this'll be about the 5th iteration of the title and just as unlikely to be actually a finished game as the others."

The game is very In depth and is the type of game where you can do anything you want in the game. There is alot to it so take your time but you can learn it. Not everyone is goin to like it, but if you like strategy games, like C&C or othe planetary control type games this is what you have been waiting for, I mean everything from government control, resource management and development, diplomacy, trading, military, soical spending, space race, researching units and tech on huge tech tree of detail and scale and to top it off, you can be any country in the world from the small island nations to the USA, China, Russia, France, and England - and there resepcted colonies of the time, also there is many other small and medium sized countires which are independent and playable from a very unique perspective. Military production and personell are under your direct control or you can let the AI do the work, you have a load of options on how they approach through user controlled to cpu/minister control also there is options for how agressive and how many casualities you should sustain during battle. There  is setup-up options galore for the map, you can win by economic, military, sphere, complete and many more options so the game is playable at many angles and replayable (try being Ireland, Liberia, Haiti, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and more) Also the historically acurate points of hisotry will/should kick in i.e. 1939 invasion of Poland, Austrian takeover, Rhineland re-occupy, Invasion of france and Russia, now For military building and deployment there is a very thorough and detailed unit line up with historically accurate units of the period army, navy, airforce.check out my youtube intro video :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGyyWcdhjXk&feature=youtu.beIf you like hearts of iron 3 - this is a shoe in and I personally prefer it over HOIThis is a very detailed game - and it is not a resource hog untill mass units (keep fog of war on) -Great Value at $30.00It's in beta and this is just the beginning so Its only going to get better, with your constructive involvement with the fourms.Live Long, For give me 100,000 men and I shall conquer the world."

Having played the previous titles and almost 60 hours of 1936 I can say the game is great so far even with the current beta issues. The issues which are to be expected as the game is still in beta do render the game unplayable and require you to start over but when the issues’ happen you can report them and usually find a way to avoid it in the next game until a patch is released. I myself have reported a few issues and made a few suggestions all of which the developers took note of and added to their system. The gameplay in of itself can seem overwhelming to new players but if you spend the time learning to manage your economy, military, technology and diplomatic relations you will find the game very rewarding and challenging. My favorite aspects about the Supreme Ruler 1936 excluding the gameplay right now would have to be the ability to mod the game, the ability to communicate directly with the developers, the amazing community, and the lack of any anti-piracy system screwing up or limiting my ability to enjoy the game."

Cold War and 1936. Both of which seem to be unfinished versions of the same game they continue to re release every few years with a new and improved version. Ultimate being the newest version.Is the game bad? No... but it will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth when you realize the limitations of the game and the seemingly lack of desire of the devs to actually make the game work like it should.If you have never played a Supreme Ruler game then the newest version might not be too bad of an investment... but dont be bitter when they decide to make Super Ultimate version and leave your copy unfinished and unsatisfying.

So don't expect♥♥♥♥♥♥to change unless you buy the new game which may or may not carry all the bugs and crashes with it.- Ai is dumb.

Also, trading is unfair.- The speed meter thing is really bad. If you get like a year into the game the fastest speed lags and becomes really slow. Give it a few more years and it'll slow down to be unplayable. Even with a really good computer don't expect anything different.- Going back to the ai being dumb, don't expect them to be challanging.I can't recommend this game because it feels like an early access game. Also I feel jipped that they released this game gave it a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates then went off to make another game. I also own Supreme ruler 2020 and I do not recommend that either.

,Recommended,244410,10063438,"Posted: 9 May, 2014",all,ಠ_ಠ Exil,"The Supreme Ruler series is one of the best grand strategy games you can find on Steam.I started out with Supreme Ruler 2020 and played the hell out of it before and even after the Gold version came to Steam. With Supreme Ruler 1936 you not only get a better optimezed engine that can handle even more units and events than the previous one, but you get a time period that is extremely interesting to play in the Grand strategy scenario.While the game might not look like much (graphics wise), it makes up for it with its superb and in-depth gameplay. You are the ruler of a nation, you take all the important decisions and even command your troops into battle as you take the territory of your enemy bit by bit.What I like about this game compared to other Grand Strategy games is that while it is hex based, the style in which your units or the enemy units capture a territory is shown in a more interactive way making it feel like your actions truly have a great impact on the world.The tech tree is also something to be amazed of, each tech you unlock as you progress through the years has a significant impact on the game and how you play the game and if you are able to survive the onslaught of enemies.The economy is also complex and at times quite hard to manage, luckily the difficulty level can be adjusted to give new players an easier start on managing their resources. The buildings you can construct to help your economy range from simple wood managing complex to uranium mines. The economy also plays an important role on your armies, without petroleum your units will not move, without ammunition they will not fire, without construction materials you will not be able to build new structures and without food your population and army reservers will die.The game is a must own to all Grand Strategy players, the game not only offers a singleplayer campaign and different skirmish / scenarios to play but also a multiplayer mode where you can fight with other players that control their own nations in real time."

You can invade the world as the nazis, colonize Europe and manage to actually beat the USSR. You can beat the Americans to the nuclear bomb, be the first into space, make the internet and land on mars! You can also mod the game and have a modern world or a fictional one. {THIS IS THE SHORT REVIEW}{NOW TIME FOR THE BIG REVIEW}The AI has been improved A LOT compared to the 2020 AI and Cold War AI. Still has the bugs and Frame Rate problems, but eh, it's a good game.The military system is good and your ministers tend to send random units to Siberia, where they will stay there for the rest of the game, unsupplied. But if get far enough with tech and get some decent supply planes, then bobs your uncle. But the unit would be a T-26 and useless.The supply system isn't that great, I prefer the 2020 one. I don't have 2020 in my steam games, because I bought it off Amazon and I put over 500 hours into 2020 and I loved the supply system. The supply system in 2020 was really... well, just put a few supply depots around the country and build some roads and most of your country will be supplied really well. It's a different story in 1936, it doesn't spread as well as it did in 2020.Every game has their cons, even a game like this that I play a lot. The tutorial isn't really helpful, it's complicated, doesn't really explain much and just a mind boggle really. It's like they translated the tutorial from Russian to German to Arabic and then back to German and then English. So I suggest watching people play the game or you can just go exploring the game yourself.The game feels like it's not finished and the AI still isn't amazing. Battlegoat are trying tho and I hope they spend a few years on making the new Supreme Ruler so they can really improve the AI and improve the FPS and reduce the lag. (And I like the graphics the way they are)The economic system is meh, but I hate it when the ministers try lowering the taxes on the resources to 0%, so you have  lock them out of it and when you lock a minister from the resources, you lock them from trading. Yes, you can trade on the world market manually, but you have to keep an eye on the prices too see if they go down or up. And oil in this game, the production of oil is so small. You have to literally spam oil derricks until you get arthritis so you can be self-sufficent in petrol.Even with all the bugs this game has, it's still fun and good. Deserves more attention for it to be a great game. I already got 4 people into the game they got more people into the game.The game is good for wasting time, playing with friends and Role Playing. I suggest getting modes for it, because it can get boring playing the same scenario.I rate this game a 7/10 Please share the Supreme Ruler series with your friends and guide them to be world dominators so they can teach others."

In fact, this is my favorite time period so I was very happy you guys decided to start at 1936 :) I hope one day, and yes I am thinking far ahead but I can dream, that you make a world war 1 scenario or maybe a world war 1 expansion/dlc. Of course I understand that won't be for a year or more but I think the mechanics of this game would also work really well for world war 1. The OOB structuring for this game can be very complicated and I just wish you made the whole set up a bit easier. Maybe a whole new interface option to organize all of your units better. I would also like to see more scripted events and will you be adding anymore historical units such as the nkvd, imperial guard, ss, etc...?Another good idea would be giant infrasctucture projects like the five year plan that the soviets had with the farm collectivisation. This could add more economy to your nation before 1939 that otherwise you might not get right and screw up very easily and then have to start over. Most players will be new and even the old ones like me still are learning from this game. It would be nice to get a little help in the scenarios. The autobahn could be a major project that would cost a certain amount of money to build a unique road in germany that gives really fast movement for their troops that no other nation has. This will give them the advantage that they had back then. The giant steelworks projects and farm collecting the soviets did could also have an event that adds a lot of farms in ukraineand metal mines back by the urals. Also, Japan building the yamamoto. You can have an option to build it but it would put a big strain on the economy althought you would have the best and biggest battleship in the pacific til the end of the war practically. England can get the option to build an intelligence center which has the ability to crack german codes which would slow your overall tech research down to gain the best counterintelligence/espionage of any nation. It will also have options to boost your spying capabilities. Amrerica can obviously get massive industrial, consumer, and military supplies production. You can go to a lot of areas with this idea. I think it would really add more uniqueness to the major sides than it already has.My final say. THUMBS UP. It is in good working condition right now. Anything from here on out is just adding more to an already working game. So come join the community and play and help make it even better. They need new ideas like how I mentioned a ww1 scenario and also more scripted events that could add unique unit as well as certain PROJECTS that nations will be allowed to do :)"

Stay away. If you want large scale strategy based around modern/semi modern warfare, get Hearts of Iron 3. It is a better game in almost every way.The SR series of games are large scale stragey games based in the 20/21st centruries.You control the economy, diplomacy, government and military of any nation you choose.The problems with this game:1)There is no tutorial (or at least not a very good tutorial). Be prepared to spend plenty of time trying to figure out how the game works (The economy is especially convoluted)2)The territory system is a mess. conquering a country will often result in it being broken up and divided in the most nonsensical way possible.3)The AI is abysmal. For Example: As Canada, I helped France obliterate Germany, barely having to cede land at any point (Hard/Hard/Hard), not because of skill, but because the AI does not understand how to use their armies properly.4)As the game progresses, the performance gradually gets worse, until the game is unplayable. I have never been able to ""finish"" a game because of this, usually after 6 years the game runs so poorly that I have to quit.The only positive thing that I can say about this game is that once you figure it out, the economic system is somewhat entertaining. You aren't able to transform a fledgeling nation into a super power overnight, and resources have to be carefully managed and balanced.I like the concept of the SR series, but the games are not rewarding or challenging in a fun way. If you are thinking of getting this game, or any game in the SR series, make sure you try Hearts of Iron first. It is better in nearly every way imaginable."

The game is regularly updated as well so no need to worry about support. The economic portion of the game is very quick to learn, there is a slight learning curve at first but if you're used to the Genre or have played any of the other Supreme Ruler games (I haven't) you'll probably love it and ask for even more! The one thing that really bugs me sometimes is the troop movement and the supply lines...obviously if you have enemy troops cutting off supply lines that's one thing, but if you do have open supply lines and your troops still aren't getting the supplies you do have available it gets a bit tedious and annoying (you'll have ships or troops stranded in the ocean or enroute to take an opposing countries capital and just be completely stuck until another unit comes with supplies). Overall I'd give the game a 7 maybe 8 out of 10 with a strong reccomendation with more to come and several campaigns and only one scenario at the moment, multiplayer and much more in store for this game.

Playing as the USA means you also have to worry about making the people happy enough to vote for you at election time, otherwise, you can pull a coup and play as a dictator with total control. Military control, for a global-wide conflict can be difficult and winning the game can be impossible. Since the game can be open ended, be ready to rule the world if you take the 'Total Victory' option. I've played hundreds of hours - despite what the tag at the top of this says - and the most annoying thing is when China steamrolls the world. They couldn't hardly feed their own people in 1936 but the AI is given god-like powers and somehow is able to defeat Japan, the Soviet Union, and all of the Axis before 1940, while you can only watch because if you get involved, the game slaps you down with economic sanctions and ruins you.

,Recommended,244410,31020620,Posted: 8 April,all,Carniflex,"I have a bit mixed feelings about this game. Overall I would say my opinion is positive with slight mix of mild dissapointpent in later game. I did get about 30h out of this game which is pretty good number before I felt that I'm kind of losing interest. Thing is I was expecting more - the first impression of the game was very positive. There seemed to be enough wheels and buttons and complexity to keep one going for at least few hundred hours - first impression was that its even more complex than hearts of iron III with a better supply model.And it is good and challening game at the start. I started as Germany in '36 aiming to grab as much as I can without triggering the world war and then were looking forward to keep what I gain until about '66 while securing my borders and working on getting as self sufficient resources wise as I can. And it was all nice until about '39 when the first cracks of the AI started showing in the event and diplo system. Some of the events felt a bit forced, I opted to not fire the events for throwing an ultimatum to Poland. That in turn seemed to freeze the diplomatic AI of the allies who just got seemingly frozen up in some indecisive state ignoring me taking out balkan, greece, egypt and saudi arabia in short sucession until in the end Japan triggered some kind of scripted event at the end of '41 making US to get inolved in coflict. Gremany refusing to get involved with US and accepting a bunch of southern american puppets as valid war targets when defence packt with Japan triggered them made AI to go totally haywire with wars. At this point the game lost good bulk of its charm as things were no longer plausible anymore. There is no challenge to be able to declare war on Sweden and Norway without allies batting an eye and Poland sitting right nect to you doing its best to look the other way.Resrouce system and economic side is also interesting at first but the model breaks down relatively fast if you are increasing your GDP in a rapid manner by funneling majority of your resrouces into industrial expansion. There is no option to conserve manpower by using higher levels of automation or something so the demand for goods will increase faster than what the natural growth of your manpower pool (even with all the medical research you can do) is capable of coping with.I would say it is a bit simpler game than hearts of iron 3 its just that at first glance it manages to look more formidabble with higher learning curve than it actually is. I have not tried mods for this - perhaps I will return to it at a bit later date and give this thing another round if I stuble upon a promising mod. At this point it seems I'll be heading back to hearts of iron iii with historical plausibility mod to give another round of trying to get away what I described above.The combat AI - its a bit mixed bag. It's pretty competent with land units and can sort of work ok with air but it totally melts down as far as naval units go. Ships hang around solo, there is no merchant shipping to intercept so subs are sort of pointless in their traditional role. The commbat AI is capable of doing naval landings at least but unfortunately seems to be rather dumb in the way it handles it when there is opposition and it's losing transports at sea - it just ignores these losses and is happy to send your entire army against single enemy destroyer picking its nose somewhere enroute until you get involved and direct some combat ships to deal with it manually. Also - there is no naval bombers in the air section. So you cant just ignore the naval fleet side by opting instead to focus on keeping the enemy few hundred km away from your shores by building up large force of airplanes intended to attack ships. Naval balance wise - AI tends to focus on just building as many battleships as it can pretty much ignoring most other ships - cant really blame it as it stands as that seems to be the most effective tackic in this game for naval."

There's no strategy involved, simply drag a box around your units and order them to attack somewhere.    Every video posted is simply drag a box around everything and attack some country.   The series is in a bad need of a combat overhall, some hierarchy structure is needed and I'd suggest unit cards similiar to hearts of iron using either icon or nato symbols.  Can't recommend the game until the combat is overhauled, which I doubt we will see as BG keeps trying to milk the cow doing the same thing game after game.

It's so complex that it takes a while to figure out but it's worth it.  Players have complete control over every aspect of the game: industrialization, research, social investment, diplomacy, espionage, militarization, theater strategy, tactics, and more.  You can play as whichever country you want (Uruguay, New Zealand,...), however you want.  The game has an outstanding underlying economic model that's intricate, well balanced, and challenging to manage.  Nation development is throttled but in a realistic way rather than the ""you're just holding me back"" methods other games use to slow us down.  The enemy AIs are also fairly decent though I've not let my advisors have much control so I can't speak for the intelligence of your helpers.  With this level of complexity, the UI can be clumsy at times but Red Goat seems to be improving it with intelligent patches.  In the meantime, you'll want to save often because one mis-click can completely ruin a game and if you like to control every aspect of the game like I do, a game can take a very long time.

I mean, I needed 12 hrs. of playtime only for the Tutorial. *lol*Supreme Ruler 1936 is a global political-warfare simulation that begins in early 1936 and can be played into the 2070s. Yes, the 2070s. That is when the tech tree runs out. You can literally start the game with biplanes, and end up fighting with Mechs. You have the ability to play as any major or minor power, with thousands of possible unit designs to select from. Complex economic system and technology tree. You can choose between 54 different countries in the sandbox modus. World Ruler with Liberia? No problem in this game. xDGameplay is fairly simple; it is basically a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game. Controls are standard for most RTS games—the ability to select large numbers of units at once, and other basic RTS controls. Furthermore, selections can be screened for specific unit types (air, naval or land) allowing for mass movement of forces. Land units are further divided in general categories—artillery, infantry, transport, armor, etc. Technology is fairly straightforward. Some can be traded or bought from other countries, while some have to be researched by each country individually and are non-tradable. Diplomacy is fairly detailed, with a wide variety of agreements possible, but given the scope of the game can be somewhat odd at times.The combat system in SR36 is really the shining achievement of the game. “Chaos” perhaps describes it best—explosions, units advancing and retreating, the roar of naval gunfire, strafing aircraft, often at the same time. Units have detailed statistics outlining everything from their defense rating to weapons ranges.Supreme Ruler 1936 is an unique game and if you like detailed warfare strategy games then try it out!"

I let this run for almost 2 days now and the ticks are still fairly quick at the fastest setting. Unlike the old days of my SR2020 games where I'd alt tab it into the background for weeks on end and when you did go back to check, the ticks would take forever. sometimes 1-2 minutes per tick or more. There is a lot of work to do yet, that I can see. But for the most part I like it.Some things I've found:- When you play as a country that isn't a known tech powerhouse, you are limited. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but playing as Mexico, I have not been able to get tanks. I can't even trade for them.- I wish I could minimize the tool bars. I play on a 14"" alienware and with all the clutter I don't have much of a window to see things.- Somtimes things just seem to pause when building. Buildings, tech research, and unit building. They just freeze. I found if you pause, then unpause or save and then resume it fixes this.- A lot of pathing issues to resolve yet I see too. As Mexico I was invading Germany, then I invaded Romania. I was then attacked by France, so for some reason, my units decided to hit the coast near Constanta and turned into merchant vessels and just sat there spinning. I clicked on them and told them to unload at the port there and everything was fixed at that point.- The BG forums themselves are having problems these days too. I went to log in and it said there was no record of my account. So I made a new one. I never got the activation email after 12 hours so I clicked to send a new one. Again it says no record of account. So again I try to make a new one and now it says I can't cause an account already exists. It's a circle of frustration.- The next game, I'd like to see this SR format where you can go from a caveman society to future tech. With expanding influence/country borders like SR offers."

This isn't much strategy outside trying to stay technologically a head of everyone else and planning a war not actually commanding and fighting a war.It's just build armies, build up the economy, build factories, build more troops.I found myself bored after conquering my first two countries.   I see this game would of been much better as a Turn Based Strategy game, but sadly even then there are already better games out there which are Turn Based.Over all it's just pointlessly time consuming and not really all that entertaining.Though on the Plus side, I did enjoy how you captured territories, it was slightly entertaining at first watching my armies fight, rooting them on as I tried to reinforcements to them in time.

Its a game for goodness sake.  I want to feel in command, I want to organise my units as I see fit.  I want them to do as they are told (within reason).If the game is pretending to be strategic, with the AI controlling individual units (and by the way nobody has as yet produced a computer based wargame that can cope adequately with the AI involved in such a demanding task) then let the player order divisions/corps around and let the AI try and do the unit grunt work ( and good luck with the outcome) or lets control the units and their deployment and play at unit level( then the AI is not so important.As it is I find the game not only disapointing but very frustrating.And please, please give us NATO symblos instead of the silly little cartoon type icons ( they suck), or at least a choice.This purchase was money badly spent.

The game is running too slow, though you have the option to change the time cycle, but it is still not significatly helping the game's time frame. When it is running slow, it can make you bored at some point.2. You will find it hard to replenish or reinforce your current forces, as it takes a while to train and produce your war machines.It will be better to shorten the time needed to produce a unit.3. Battle could be pretty boring, since there is no option for you to have a detailed direct control of the units while battling the enemy.4. Relationships between countries could be tricky to maintain and I could say that it is not historically correct. For those who prefer their own stories, then it does not really matter, but if you are looking for something that historically accurate, then the game should have an option for that.In conclusion, the game is pretty good, though it has several weak points, but I still recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy game.Developer please improve the game wherever possible!

For long-time strategy players like me its just to arcade-like in its warfare part. But its easier to make a list anyway.PROs- the economic side is cool. You can built and reinforce your economic sectors in six categories and three manufactured goods. Plus you trade surplus and buy things you lack with ease.- the builtup for war is easy. Units are built with land-/naval-/aircraft-factories in different cities. Plus you can hold them in reserve so they don´t clutter the map and cost immense resources- I like the importance of recon units and the extra range of artillery. Makes the tactical combat fun.CONs- research is far reaching, but the easy way to trade it, destroys the fun. If you have researched the general tech, you can trade or buy unit-schemes from friends (or just anybody) for next to nothing. As Italy I ended up with advanced carriers of Japanese design and cool German recon units. Plus I think that there should be far more not tradeable research areas, so it´s more difficult to excel in research as a minor nation.- producing units is very cheap, so you end up piling up units in reserve. which leads to:- in my view your armies are far to vast to really control them properly in all theatres. So you end up losing small or prestigious units somewhere without even noticing it right away. Even units like carriers can be destroyed in seconds (which I did) or four submarine in a wolfpack are oblitarated in a glimpse. Its better in land and air combat, but naval combat just goes on to fast.- the AI is not useless, but not very clever either. For example: As Germany attacked Poland the Western front to France was unguarded. Later it tried an invasion of Britain only with (zillions) of transports risking a good portion of its army. Fortunatly for Germany the British navy drove around aimlessly.- the manual does not explain very much. So I looked in forums and learned much the ""hard way"" via losing.For me Supreme Ruler 1936 has many fun aspects, but it´s not properly balanced and too confusing in large scale combat. The AI is not clever enough to watch theatres for you (not mentioning your Allies) so you win mostly by sheer numbers."

The Steam community luckily is helpful to a point, however a game company can't just leave the responsibility of getting to know the basics of a game to the community.IMHO a game company delivers an incomplete product, when it doesn't give you an adequate manual or at least a decent tutorial with the full release of a game.

I am not alone in the long term community when I say, this may be the worst one yet. Sadly that would make this 2 in a row since Cold War was worse than 2020. It is still worth playing but nothing like the previous entries. It appears some of the tech is missing, not even sure if this game was really ready for release but here it is. If you do play, play one of the larger countries as you will find playing sandbox as a small nation a big let down. The tech trees only appear to be done for USA, Germany ect. If you want to be Peru or something, your out of luck. Controlling your battle has gotten much worse than previous titles. It is pretty much, click goto war button and then just let it play out and hope for the best. You can achieve some control by altering the theatre of war settings for the various locals but all that achieves is telling your AI to attack a general area. If you gather troops and send direct, it will almost always end in a disaster since the AI system has ZERO intelligence written into it. This leaves one last choice of controlling each unit individually, but who the hell wants to control thousands of units by hand???  The diplomacy system is still wacked. You can get just about anyone to sell you tech regardless of what it is. But a few things in this area has been improved with this title in this area. Basically this game over the past titles have gone the way certain developers have wanted, the community have been asking for things, the devs have ignored them. If you goto thier forums and post anything negative your banned. And one of the devs feels it is within his place to tell customers here on steam that our opinion(the customers) dont count. So this is the end result of what happens when devs build the game ""they"" want. Sometimes it doesn't turn out the way customers want. The game is worth about 20 bucks as that is about the amount of enjoyment you will get. Be prepared for patches during the next 2 years as at least this company generally continues to support the titles after release for awhile. 2020 would be scored 7 of 10, Cold War 6 of 10...I would score this game 5 of 10."
