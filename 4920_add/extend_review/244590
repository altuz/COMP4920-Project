,Recommended,244590,14959297,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,Professor Cupcake,"With an already fantastic concept for a game, the developers of this have put so much effort into polishing its mechanics to perfection. With tight and satisfying movement, wonderful controls and very focussed design, this has the potential to be at the top of any list of arena shooters. It has a few major flaws however, chief among which is that it is quite badly explained and it takes a very long time to work out what is actually going on. It also has the incredibly unfortunate issue of having almost nobody playing it any more, which is a darn shame considering how amazing this game can be. You can still play it with bots, but the AI is too stiff to last more than a few matches before becoming boring. That said, the feeling of movement alone is what compelled me to keep playing for quite a while longer than the bots deserved.Annoyingly, its only major flaw is something of a vicious cycle; there aren't enough people playing it, therefore nobody will play it, making the whole thing worse. At the time of writing, it is on sale for next to nothing; I urge anyone reading this to buy it, get a few friends to buy it too, try it out and share it as much as possible. Even if it isn't to your tastes, the best thing that can be done for this game right now is to be shared."

This is the Grifball standalone. But dont just think of this game as Grifball, this game has more potential than your mother ever thought you had. This game is early access so there are some bugs and some things to be improved such as including East and West US dedicated servers (This is being worked in but is hard as the game is based out of Europe). When people hear ""Early Access Game"" they think not ready or not enjoyable or possibly not even interesting. This proves those people wrong. The amasing thing about this game being Early Access is that it can only get better and go up from here."

But, I cannot.I became enamored with the game over a free weekend. The sparsely populated servers with people as new and clueless as me made the game seem fun and the three-something dollar price tag appealing. I bit.Over the course of the next week or two the population disappeared. But I was able to learn the nuances of the game and navigate the not-steep, but completely unexplained, learning curve thanks to spotty appearances of other players. This made the game seem fun all over again. Over the following weeks I became comfortable with the game and really enjoyed the few times another human was actually on a server. Some players were better, a lot were as lost as I previously was.But in the end, I never witnessed a game larger than 2v3. Morning, noon or night. Any day of the week. Any server from West to East to Europe to Asia. There just isn't people playing this game. Perhaps some games just shouldn't be open betas or 'Early Access'? People were done and bored before it had legs.Or perhaps other issues are really holding it back.The learning curve isn't hard but requires other players to actually learn. There's documentation of what items do or how to prime your two jumps. But nothing about the useful ways to use the items, tactics to employ, using momentum from items/jumps/enemy fire, etc. All things you can only learn with a live enemy. And I still feel like I only really learned how to play 1v1 and what tactics to use in that situation because that's all I ever got to regularly.The devs have an idea of what they believe gameplay *should* be like if you read around the web some. In the perfect world all the servers would be 5v5 and somebody would be playing ""goalie"" and people would pass the ball. Combine those Ideas with the game that really does feel smooth and man that sounds great!But the dead community means you'll rarely see 5v5 or in my case; never. I tried to play ""goalie"" in a 2v2 after I had read about the concept on a forum. But it's just not a logical choice to do when you aren't realistically going to stop many chances.And passing? That would make the game that much more interesting but the speed of the players (especially once powerups are planted) makes that a colossal undertaking to time correctly. And because of this, nobody ever expects a pass. I never witnessed anybody else even attempt one.I could go on and on. Its a great concept that is fairly polished and fun in theory. But has a dead community and suffers from a multitude of other problems. I could never recommend it even at the price I paid much less it's regular price. My twenty-plus hours of play consists of maybe five with other players and maybe three of those five hours was ""competitive"" play rather than goofing around. The vast majority of my play time was spent alone achievement hunting. The bots are awful.If it gets lots of people suddenly, better maps (another issue I didn't delve into), and one or two other things I forgot to whine about... And it's like $0.99USD. Consider it."

But that one time, when you find a server that has 1 or 2 other people on, and you join it, it is some of the best gameplay I ever had. The game has an interesting gamestyle, almost like  basketball, but with low gravity, and guns. Something great about this game is that the guns don't actually kill you, they just push you, causing you to fall off the edge. This face-paced game, despite the lack of players, is very fun. I'm almost always smiling, or laughing when playing this game, there just needs to be more people who play it."

The opponents will be trying the same thing, and using their weapons to try and knock you you off the platforms before you get there. While you are carrying the ball you can't shoot back, and have to rely on your teammates clearing your path, or maybe a lot of like and well timed dodges.The weapons in the game don't do damage they just push you, and there are a few variants - long range, medium range, and area/explosive types can be chosen at the start of each game, and you can switch between two modes for each as you like (in a more focused/powerful attack, or in more area affect but less impactful attack). You also have two different jump/jet pack modes - double jump and charged jump, that are attached to the weapon choices, although this could be annoying if your preferred weapon mode is attached to a jump mode that doesn't suit your playstyle).This leads to some fun and frantic gameplay where at any moment seemingly on the way to a certain score you can go flying into the air and have to try and spot a landing, or maybe quickly try and adjust your aim and launch a ""Hail Mary"" before you get too far from the basket before falling to your doom (and then respawning a few seconds later).Scoring a goal gives the scorer a seed to plant, which has three options to chose from, out of a selection of bonuses such as putting down a mortar or turret, a ramp making it easier to move towards the enemy basket, or a shield that covers most of the platform (possibly some more that I didn't notice). Each option also has a side effect of boosting the team stats a bit - making you jump higher, run slightly faster, or have more control while in the air. While an interesting addition that can significantly affect the later minutes of each game, it does seem like it makes games tend towards being more one sided as it means the team that starts well and scores early get more advantages, and are more likely to keep extending their lead."

They had this thing called Make Something Unreal 2012 where they invited people from universities to make games using the unreal engine. The finalists (there were four) were having demonstrations and they set about 16 gaming pcs up for us to test the game. It was in really early alpha at that stage and it still is alpha, but of the four games there was no doubt this was by far the best. I voted for this game by Dead Shark Triple Punch (awesome name) and it won the most votes in the end. If I were to explain it, it'd be something like, sport basketball of the future with low gravity, genetically engineered plants that give you bonuses the more goals you score, jetpacks, fast paced awesomeness and guns that don't harm but knockback. graphic style is kind of like super moday night combat, or team fortress 2."

Even though it is still in development and I only played it for a few hours on the free weekend event, I found it really fun and it gave me an amazing Quake feel. Do you remember those Quake maps filled with jump pads and death pits? Hell yes! The major problem I have with Epigenesis is with my ping, wich can be a pain in the *ss when I'm playing against people with 5 to 10 ping while mine is varying betwen 57 to 70. Besides that I can firmly say that every play you do in a match, whether it is a well timed jump, pushing somebody off of the platform, scoring for your team or whatever else you manage to do right, it is all super enjoyable and even when you do screw up it can be fun while not being heavily punished for it.

,Recommended,244590,10011029,"Posted: 3 May, 2014",all,Krafty_Karl,"Firstly, it's in fair shape for an early access, and it's had a good update history, so don't be scared away by that. It does start with some wonky graphics settings, but after adjusting them it looks and plays pretty well, and many of the astetics (like the hideous alpha-style menus) will likely be fixed as more polish is added to the game.Now, onto the game itself. It remindes me a lot of a ball game mode from Unreal Tournament concept wise. It essentially uses shoot mechanics in a hoop and ball game similar to soccer (football), however it leans more heavely on the sports side of the shooter-sports hybrid. It is a high flying, high speed, and it does suffer a bit from a lack of feedback on landings and jump hieghts, but that forces you to pay attention to both the game and the platforms (I'd recomend using the highest FOV settings to help), as falling to your death is a constant threat. There are a lot of deep mechanics and power ups that make this game very strategic and competetive; It probably has the potental to compete with CS:GO's competitive scene.Over all, I would recomend this to someone who dislikes CoD style shooters but enjoyed the interesting gamemodes from old competitive games like Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike, and Quake Arena."

Forgot about it.The Sniper is good if you can hit people with it, but as I am not a sniper, I cannot say anythingYour fist seems to be the overpowered hand of god though, as you can instantly knock people out with it if they are even slightly erring.The object of the game is to get a ball in the middle of a bunch of floating platforms, and throw it into the enemies net, sounds easy right?Not really, as this game is not newbie friendly, the older players will rofl stomp for every time, until you get better.I used to play this game all the time on a different account, but I could never get very good.

The graphics and the sounds effect on the game are without a doubt amazing. All the sound effect on this game makes us feel like a badass. Strong music with violent effect really feels awesome!The biggest issue of this game, which puts this game with a score of 8/10, is the community. In fact, when I bought the game and wanted to play online the community was inexistent. Not even a single server had 1 player in it, I was playing alone on all of those servers. Watching all those vid seemed like the game was HUGE, but really it's not that big and in fact one of the smallest community I have ever seen. Hopefully, the community will grow and we will be able to play a real 6v6 match.Despite the fact that theres not a bunch of weapon variety, this game is fun to play with all the weapons. The maps seems ok but I couldn't really appreciate it at there full potential since the lack of the cummunity. Seeds how ever, are an amazing aspect of this game, making the maps customizable and also allowing player to create some fun strategies throughout the game.In the end, the game is really promissing, really fun to play. But the only way to really appreciate the game would be having a larger community. I recommend this game to any fps player who love a challenging game."

The blasters you are given are usless and its near impossible to stop the other team from scoring.-Let you know who won the game.

There is a single player mode however, so if there's not people on you can battle against AI.The second thing somewhat bad is the controls, they feel a tad unresponsive at times, including jumping, but other than it being unresponsive at times, the characters do control mostly smoothly.Now on to the good.The graphics are pretty good, and I can run it at 60fps without turning much down as far as detail. Although I do have more than the recommended PC specs. At times on larger, more detailed maps, it will dip down in to the 50s or 40s, but it doesn't last long.The idea is good, and pretty well executed. It's kind of like Super Smash Bros. without the percentage building up, and in a 3D environment + basketball. You have weapons that knock people all over the place, including in the air, off ledges, and down in to the abyss. You also have a goal, which is to get the ball and throw it in to the enemies base (or hoop) and get points, the enemy is doing the same of course, so it leads to a pretty even match.Each map is timed, if you get more points than the other team by the time limit, you win. HOWEVER, that's not the only way to win. Every time you score a goal you get a seed, which you can use to plant something that can help you and your team out, in the set positions you can plant it in. If you, or your team plants every plant in their spot, you'll also win by that.I got this game while it was on sale, and got the 4-pack for $2.49, but I would highly recommend it regardless of the price.All in all, this is a good game if you've got friends to play with. If not, you may get bored of fighting against the AI all the time, but it still offers and enjoyable experience if someone joins your game, or if you join a game in progress."

But that won't be easy because a bunch of angry men are running at you firing lasers and trying to punch you, turrets are shooting huge projectiles right in your face and some tornados are here to bring pain and misery. Yep, it's not 2k14.That game is pretty similar to quake or unreal. You can double jump, you can find bonus on the ground (blink, grab, pushback aoe etc), you are firing rockets and lasers. Jumping is the key of the game, the arenas are made of platforms and you to have to jump from one to another, there is no real ground. That means that you can fall and die really often if you fail your jumps.Weapons are pretty original, the first one fires rocket that'll push your ennemys away or pull them to you, the second one is a laser that stops instantly the ennemy movement (really effective when shooting a men while he is in the air, he'll fall to death). You also get a construction laser.Yes a construction laser! When a player scores, he gains a seed. This seed can be used on the biggest platforms to create a bonus. These bonus consist of turrets, mortars, ramps, shields, smokescreen and trench. Each of these bonus will help your team to win, choose them wisely because they can change the battlefield a lot. Each of these contructions also brings you a passiv bonus like an acceleration boost, a higher fire rate etc. But be carefull because the other team can destroy them and make you loose the bonus.I really enjoyed it, it's not bug free but it's pretty solid at what it does.

It's really fluid and the seed-planting mechanic that allows you to capture platforms is really interesting. If I had one gripe about the game it would be the non-existent community. Seriously there's never anybody online except once in a while you'll find a few people on. This problem will hopefully be alleviated as the game gains popularity and is further in development.

I recommend the devs  do more free weekends. During those the servers are almost always full. When theres not a free weekend however, there is not a single person playing 99% of the time. You may catch the occasional 2 people on some russian server. I really really want to recommend you buy this game, but I cant knowing that there is virtually no one playing ever. If you are to find this game on sale and or during a free weekend PLAY IT."

You get the aiming and shooting part from first person shooters and the action and strategic elements from sports games.Epigenesis takes half an hour to learn, but I bet it will take ages to master. I think everyone should give it a try.See you on the field of battle! :)"

With very simple maps, no real 'WOW' factor, and only moderately decent servers, this game is really only worth the buy if it is on sale. A fun sports game, it gives a break from the Shooters that dominate just about everything. I enjoy playing it, but I will love playing it after it gets some work done."

Sports games are underrepresented, especially on PC, and there are even fewer examples of games that use the theoretical gaming environment to present a new conceptual sport. This hybrid extreme rugby / gridiron football / dodge ball / gymnastics / etc -type of challenge is really an entertaining concept.Unfortunately, the gameplay is clunky and lags graphically too often, and especially at critical times, it seems.Could be a 9+, but due to the mediocre controls and glitchy action it is hard to hate or love in any definitive manner.Meh.

I was always hard-pressed to find people online to have a good game with as the low challenge of the AI soon became unsatisfactory for me. The aim of the game is to grab the ball and run to the enemy goal and throw the ball in. It's quite a bit more complicated than that but that is the general gist of it. The game felt overall very well put together and had a really great concept with decent execution but fell down because of its heavy reliance on multiplayer gameplay but nobody playing it. It saddens me to have to give this game a thumbs down because it is so very fun to play but i simply can't with such a small player base.
