The Interface is very primitive (tip: highlighting is F1). Writing is pretty good. Characters are ... interesting: lets just say that Characters are written to be ""period appropriate"". Puzzles aren't exactly self obvious (I guess that is a good thing) - and could be accused of ""pixel hunt"".This one is for Adventure Game veterans and Film Noir fans... Me,  otherwise avoid."
,Recommended,244690,13659960,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Gwidhw,"I love me some detective games, and this one is... well, worth buying for very, very, very cheap on a Steam sale.If you're as big a fan of detective games as I am, then maybe I added an extra ""very"" or two, just now.CONS:1) Voice acting: The voice acting is really bad. Sometimes the quality is, well... ugh. Enough said.2) Animation: The animation is sub-par, today. I mostly speak of the mouth movements. Everything else is quite par.3) Lockpicking: You can skip doing it altogether.4) Issues: Now, this is an interesting con. I would have broken this one down into more than one part, but, the single word ""issues"" really sums it all up neatly. For instance, near the beginning of the game, it seemed quite impossible to be able to find a light switch in a blackened room, which prompted me to get frustrated and stop playing for months. And then, when I finally mustered up the jimmies (yes) to play it again, and use a walkthrough to figure out where the hell it was, I still couldn't find it with my cursor for quite some time.Another instance was when trying to get around some NPCs to investigate; finnicky business, that, at times, but not awful. Just.... finnicky. You really have to play the game to know what I mean by  just saying ""Issues"". It's definitely not (it can't be) a big-budget game, by any means, though it does have it charms, and humour enough to keep me interested.PROS:1) Humour: The game has a good sense of humour, of which I won't spoil, because there's some fun quirkiness that you need to play into to appreciate.2) Interactivity: The game is very interactive, for a point and click, and doesn't hold your hand too much with what you're doing. Though, as I said, Lockpicking was just... yes.3) Story: The narrative is actually kind of interesting, once you... well, wrap your mind around it. Don't take this the wrong way; it's not complicated. It's just... a series of things happening, to the point of me not really remembering what sparked the narrative in the first place. But to be fair, I got frustrated and put this on hold for a few months. Maybe you would fare better..? All I remember is that I'm now framed for something I have to prove I didn't do, at this point. That's all I'll say, detail wise. That small tinge of con aside, it's amusing and not too shabby at keeping you engaged, so I take this as a positive thing.4) Puzzles: The puzzle solving and clue finding is just what it should be; involved. You really need to think hard, search around, and try every angle you can to get the solutions your looking for. Some are easier than others, but none are 100% obvious.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you like detective games, point and click, and something that feels a little rough around the edges, this is the game for you. As long as you don't mind the awkward and sometimes questionable quality of the voice acting...If you are looking for something to keep you on your toes, immersed, and delving into the shady underbelly of society, well... not so much.Do I recommend?Sure, why not.But only if it's very, very, very cheap.(Did I add one too many again?)"

Really bad voice acting, mediocre graphics, but a solid noir storyline and reasonable adventure/puzzle mechanics. If you like movies from the 1940s, this is a buy, otherwise you'd probably be better off with a Telltale game. Telltale games are awesome, just to clarify."
,Recommended,244690,9986406,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,HardboiledShamus,"Don't listen to the bad reviews for this game. The art, style, setting, story, characters, gameplay and so much more are really dark, gritty, onimous and have a lot of the other aspects that really hit well with the noir genre. It really feels like you're playing some old Film Noir and really hit home with me as I am a huge fan of the genre.The puzzles aren't too cryptic, but aren't too easy. Most take a little bit of thinking without having some ridiculous solution that makes no sense as I have encountered in other adventure games. The story flows well, has twists and turns and always has a dark, slightly melancholy feel. The soundtrack is great ((and comes free with the game)) The game brings the suspense, style and so much more. Unlike many games today, it's really easy to delve into and really become entangled with the plot, characters, their issues and so much more.While the game does have a FEW MINOR problems, they are just that. FEW and MINOR. It's a nod to the classic style and feel of adventure games, in a world where gaming is becoming too mundane and unimaginative. It's a highly underrated game that deserves so much more. I enjoyed it so much that I will buy the sequel as soon as it comes out."

Gameplay is not bad. The down side is the lip sync. Mad Orange has done a great job. Fans of adventure games would find this interesting. The price for this game should be lower by now (since the original release date). Maybe $10.? Overall... 8/10.

The story was a well written and the puzzles made sense in the world and didn't hold my hand through them but still remained fair and balanced. To address some complaints I've seen in the reviews:1. Graphics: I found them to be ideal for this game, they were detailed and there were interesting ambent effects like the rain and smoke in bars.2. Voices: If you watch any 40's noir films you quickly notice that's how they talk, I thought it really enhanced the atmosphere.3. Humor: Dry and funny! Just like the movies.If you like noir movies and you like adventures you're going to like this!"

The writing feels like a first draft where the second draft was just the same thing with bad attempts at slang shoehorned in.  There are multiple conversations where the word joint feels like it's being used every third word.  The acting is only slightly better than the script.  The only voice actor that felt like he belonged in a game that people charge money for is a character that you have a brief phone conversation with and (as far as I was able to get in 6 hour) never see.The gameplay feels like something from the 90s.  The screen is slow to move and so is the character.  If you're in a large room with a lot of things that can be clicked on, you'd better brew some coffee because you'll be waiting a while as Del Nero slowly plods across the room.  Fortunately, while examining things in smaller rooms, you get to see him occasionally flap his arms like a chicken, but I don't think that was actually supposed to happen.Despite the script, the story seemed fairly good for the first little while, but occasioanally you have to make some leaps in logic to figure out where to go next, and if you save and come back or miss a line of dialogue, you may as well just throw darts at the map because there's no real way to figure out where to go next.  While the story was decent it eventually started to drag by the time I made my third trip to the docks, so I took a look at a walkthough and said, ""Damnazione, I've still got at least a third of this thing left?  I'm getting out of this joint!""  Delete local content, move to the ""Bad"" category."

But trust me, the game is pretty good for what it is.It's a little slow to start and it's difficult to grasp the story at times since there are so many characters and side stories to keep track of and there are intervals throughout the game that calls for 'rewinds' and 'fast forwards' in time to portray other perspectives.However, what sets this game apart from other noir-themed games, is that this is a point & click game - which means it's going to be story heavy and less on the action side, which I personally enjoyed; also, you will be able to pick locks and solve puzzles (some of which can  be maddening at times, but they're a delightful addition).You do get to interview various characters and while there aren't necessarily any consequences for your choices, you might miss out on some details of the story if you don't ask the questions in a certain way or if you're too rough.My outlook on the game is mostly positive but I do have a few complaints.There are a few plot holes, things that aren't explained; and, there's a cliffhanger at the end that leaves room for a supposed sequel - and I do hope that it is completed and released soon because I want to know more about the story!And, it's a bit frustrating that you have the option to skip lock-picking if it's too challenging, but you can't skip puzzles - I felt that option should've been balanced.If you're like me and craving the noir genre, I do recommend this game."

If you like detective stories, noir films and point-and-click adventure games, then you will like this game. I know I do. This game should be ranked 100/100 on Metacritic.

The gameplay is annoying (not allowed to continue without the right clue even when you know the next step as opposed to having to solve a puzzle without any clue whatsoever), and includes irritating mini-challenges. Ad\nd finally, the script is cheesy, even for noir story, with rather poor voice acting. Definitely not going to play the sequel."

It's priced at $10 as of the writing of this review, and it's worth it, but getting on sale would be better!Except for one point, the story was excellent, the feel of the game was great and very immersive in 1930s New York, the soundtrack kicked butt, the puzzles were intelligible (I knew exactly what to do most of the time, but there was just the right amount of difficulty in getting it done), and I thought the humor of the protagonist was fantastic, but I like dry humor. The connect-the-dots mechanic was pretty inventive, I thought and added a good detective story even better, IMHO. The mannequins were probably the worst part of the game because they sometimes looked or did things that weren't right, but almost all point and click adventure puzzles suffer from this. My second complaint would be all the Dannazionis that were liberally peppered throughout the game. It was a bit overused.To address some complaints about the story being too linear or limiting in that I can't grab an object or do something now, but can later on when the story advances, I actually thought it made sense and, once again, is something most point and click adventure games do. I actually didn't mind because I viewed it as a story-focused game and that stream-lined it so that I could enjoy the story instead of getting caught up in picking up a bunch of useless stuff that I didn't need and wouldn't use.SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!The one thing I didn't like about the story was the paranormal element that was thrown in regarding the girl. While she is basically the MacGuffin for Face Noir, there is this allusion to her being able to control time and dreams and that she is going to do something supernatural in the sequel. This kind of threw me out of the immersiveness that the rest of the game established so well. The supernatural really has no place in a good noir story. Read any of the hard-boiled detective writers like Raymond Chandler, Dashell Hammett, and Mickey Spillane that typified the detective/Noir writing and none of them ever got caught up in that stuff. I also thought that its introduction in the last 1/3 of the game kind of blindsided me after being so true to the hard-boiled detective genre for the first 2/3 of the game.I do look forward to Face Noir II, though. Great job!"

It is an old school adventure (point and click) game but it acts more like telling a story while most puzzles feel like a check if you follow the plot. Still it may hook you for long hours just to see what happens next. Sad thing is that this game is supposed to be part 1 and ends with a cliffhanger. (Was Oscar really left forever tied under the table? Haha... But it is enough for spoilers.) Unfortunately part 2 is not on the horizon yet but still remains a possibility according to some information on the forum. Nevertheless the part 1 is still worth going through and it is about 14 hours of a film noir style story without counting time being stuck on puzzles.

You are a private eye solving a mystery in the 1940's; the setting is very noir and complements everything perfectly.There are some pretty decent cut-scenes and I didn't mind the voice acting at all. The puzzles and clue finding are well done, especially lock picking!I'd pay the $10, but got this on sale for $5.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

The hand cursor made some of the     puzzels fiddley the arrow cursor would have been fine. The abilty to run would have great, double click to run, after walking round the secne you've visited before can really slow down the gameplay. keyboard controls would of been a god send, trying to stealth with point and clicking can be quite infuriating."

I have put in only a small amount of time, but I have the impression that it is going nowhere. In one conversation, the word ""Joint"" was said over and over again and really reflects upon poor writing. In my opinion, a game of this nature requires quality voice acting and script writing. Both were lacking here.Untimately, this game didnt hold my attention. The music and atmosphere was excellent, however."

This is a mystery game with basic contradictions in the facts of the case. For example, there's a police report that claims a character was found 'not guilty' on Dec 1932, for a crime they were originally arrested for in either March or May 1933 (another inconsistency). The dialogue is incredibly disjoined (half-clinical, half written-by-someone-not-quite-fluent-in-English), and their idea of making it ""noir"" is to repeatedly use the same two or three Depression-era or Italian-immigrant words (e.g., ""joint"", ""Dannazione""). Also, when they talk, their models just chomp robotically for about two minutes longer than it would have someone to actually say what's being said. Textures on important characters are misaligned and then repeatedly shown close up (GOOD GOD PLEASE FIX THE LITTLE GIRL'S FEET, she looks like a cripple). Some of the puzzles are so contrived it's ridiculous. At one point you need to cheer someone up by finding some music on the radio, but there's like five frequencies with music and no hint as to which one she would prefer. At another point you need to get through a door with a barrel in the way, and the only way to do so is to pull a nail (one of 5, the only one you can pull out) from a pile of disused boats, then drive the nail into the barrel with your bare hands to drain the barrel of fluid so you can move it. Yup."
