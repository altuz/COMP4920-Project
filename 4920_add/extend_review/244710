The soundtrack is joyous to listen to and the threats ingame tangible. Over a very short time you feel a real connection with your baby badgers and will do anything to save them.Sadly, the game falls down on it's length, which is my only criticism. A lovely little game, but little it is, with around 1 hour for a full playthrough.Still a fun experience!Nilesy"

I often found myself seriously distressed at the thought of losing one of my beloved badger babies or being unable to feed them. I can't handle this game.Pros:+ Emotionally jarring as you experience life through the eyes of a mother badger.+ Unique atmosphere. The graphics and soundtrack added to the experience.+ Gameplay is smooth, although some things I found very difficult (like sneaking up on a fox).Cons:- Crying, lots of crying"

Every new level/setting I entered I would think to myself, ""there's no way they can top this"", but lo and behold, I was even more impressed with each new area I entered. The music is incredibly well done and obviously hand crafted personally with much thought put into it, as every piece fits it's respective area very, very well.As fine as I think the game is in it's current state, I don't think anyone would deny that more areas would be a very welcome addition. The game is quite short but doesn't overstay it's welcome, in my opinion it's just right for the concept and the message it's trying to convey.This is a game you'll want to show your friends and family."

You'll need to keep them fed, and out of harm's way.My biggest problem with this game is the lack of content. For the ten dollar price tag, you get about a one hour campaign. There's a ""nurture"" bonus mode where you bring food to your babies and watch them grow, but it's not very interesting.There's really not much to this game. You keep going on a linear path, feeding your offspring any food you come across, and here and there the game will throw a very clearly scripted hazard at you, killing one of your babies if you fail to guide them away from it.Linear and boring gameplay, muddy visuals, poor conveyance. A great concept with bad execution."
,Not Recommended,244710,9019937,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,AleSatan,"Let me start by saying that even though I'm not recommending this game here, it isn't by any means a broken or even objectively bad game. It's just that what it does offer will appeal to only a very particular type of player.I am not a good mother. In my first and only playthrough, I managed to lose all but two of my cubs. The cubs must be fed regularly or else... As they get hungrier, they become pale. This makes it easier to decide who gets to eat next, a decision you will be making very often. While the controls are generally manageable, it can sometimes be difficult to steer the mother badger toward the desired cubs at feeding time. The task is somewhat alleviated by the cubs spreading out around you, but they occasionally continue to adjust to your adjustments and a mildly frustrating process of microadjusting with the WASD keys ensues. Fortunately, there is plenty of food in the game, so starvation should never actually be a problem. Were I to play this again, I would try to skip more than half of the food I collected.The path you travel is very straightforward. Sometimes areas open up a bit and there might be different routes to take around an obstacle, but they always lead to the same exit. I would have liked to see some kind of reward for exploration apart from another token of the same food items (which, again, are bountiful). As it stands, you are always best rewarded by traveling directly for the exit.There are a few timing puzzles. None of them are especially difficult, though it's a bit of a guess how to proceed through the hazards at times. This is always what cost me my cubs. I found this to be one of the game's strengths, however, as it does enhance the feeling of being in the wild and trying to make the best decision possible without all of the necessary information. Reloading is impractical, and the long stretches of relatively boring wandering serve to discourage starting over when something goes wrong. While this is effective in design, it's a bit overwhelming (especially for such a short game) that boredom is the greatest penalty for failure and cheapness. This factor alone is my biggest hesitation about recommending Shelter.Aesthetically the game is a mixed bag as well. I personally enjoyed the music (folky post-rock vibes) and the art style. The most confusing flaw in the production is the washed out look of the game. No matter how I set my monitor, it looks like the brightness is far too high. This might have been designed to give the colors a pastel quality, which it does to some extent, but I found it far too distracting throughout the game. It was something I was never quite able to adjust to.I try to save my recommendations for games I think anyone could enjoy. Shelter asks for a lot of patience from the player, which will certainly not be for everyone. There are no glaring bugs, however, and the game is short enough to not overstay its welcome for the most part. If you're already intrigued by Shelter, pick it up and have fun! On the other hand, most players should know what they're getting into."

76561198013723081,Recommended,244710,31010421,Posted: 7 April,all,RPG Gamer Man,"I wanted to let you all know first i was gifted this game from a dear friend.This game is not about sheltering in a bunker or like Fallout shelter, this game is more natural in it's settings. The story is non-existant, but obvious too. You are a mother badger trying to save her cubs from dying. That is the best description that i can tell you about this game without ruining it, since i wish to be spoiler free also. There are sad moments in the game.Many people will not like the look of the graphic style, but it did not bother me. Also, the ending is somewhat sad. This is a game for nature lovers and animal lovers. The game is quite safe for younger children, like other MIGHT AND DELIGHT games. Also, if you wish it, the mother badger and it's cubs come back in the game Meadow, that you can play also.If the regular game seems too short or too easy, there is also a hard mode called ""NUTURE"". This mode is opened after you finish the regular game once. It features challenging gameplay with much more challenging ways to find food and playing in it. Just check under ""Extra"" menu on the main menu screen for the game.One thing i will suggest is to buy it during a sale as i found the story is quite short. Note that M@D usually put their things on sale once a year, so watch for it on sale if you want it for a cheaper price.Recommended for child-friendly, natural settings and sad storyline."

It employs a graphics style all its own, the end result of which delivers at once a realistic and alien world. The natural environment is at once your friend and enemy, and you and your five badger cubs must make a truly hazadarous journey through it. Can you provide enough food for each badger cub to survive? Can you guide them safely past the flying bird's shadow? Can you hope to navigate them all past the deadly rapids? When the forest is aflame, can you quickly discover the safest route?Shelter is a tense and emotional experience you should make time to play. The whole game isn't much longer than an hour in length, but that brief time spent is really something remarkable. Also after you play this you will hate birds T^T Overall 7.5/10 fun game ^_^"

,Recommended,244710,27494273,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,changeqe,"Shelter- a Sophisticated ReviewShelter is a 2013 game by Might and Delight. You play as a badger, mother of five cubs. Your task is to venture out into the wilderness and watch your little ones grow over the course of the four seasons. To me, it isn't obvious why, because you neither are really searching for a new home (or ""Shelter"") nor do you lack food in the beginning. Nevertheless it is one very interesting experience.There are about 5-6 different areas that you have to cross before reaching the ending. All of them contain some kind of threat to your cubs. Except the first one- which is a ""light-hearted"" introduction to what turns out to be a ""heart-breaking"" experience. Everything starts out just perfect in summer or spring (I'm not quite sure) and then the environment slowly starts to show its claws- be it through predators, a waterfall, a forest fire, or just the harsh weather in winter.The levels are quite big and are made to give you an open world-feeling yet everything about the game feels linear. Even when you start loosing some of your cubs, you begin to ask yourself: is this really my fault or is it all scripted? Strange thought, but this makes sure you play the game more than just once. Maybe it is possible to finish with all of the five cubs. Or what will happen if all of them die?When you finish ""story-mode"", the so-called ""Nurture""-mode is unlocked, where you have to check on your cubs every day in rl to make sure they get something to eat and grow up healthy. A very interesting concept to keep you playing.The gameplay is very intuitive, though anything but challenging. You only need the typical WASD-scheme, left mouse button to interact, shift to sprint and ctrl to sneak. All you have to do is look for all kinds of food to feed your cubs with. At the beginning you are left alone with looking for things to eat, but as your cubs grow, they start running towards everything they see.With things you find you can only feed one cub at a time. That is until you decide to try out your hunting skills. Mice are the easiest to catch, but then there are foxes or frogs. When you manage to catch one of these there's a feast for all of your cubs.One thing that really bothered me however is: How does the mother survive without eating anything? Does she feed on her cubs being content and healthy or have I missed something?The artstyle is really interesting, but after some time you begin to realise that technically it's well beyond it's possibilities- especially for a game released in 2013. The textures(even for me- someone who normally doesn't really give a s**t about graphics) have very low resolution and the lighting is very dim and colorless.The soundtrack however is perfect. In every scene (or level) it enhances your experience- by creating a tense atmosphere, winter atmosphere, light atmosphere and so on.Although the game runs fairly well on my PC without any technical problems whatsoever, after I finished it, it hardly got back into the main menu. The screen just sort of kept popping for a whole 30 secs.CONCLUSIONShelter is a very special experience. Over the course of only 70 minutes it managed to personally engage me into the journey of a group of virtual animals- some would call it a family. Everytime I lost a cub I felt bad- it made me feel as if I was a loser to make that happen. At the end I had only one cub left and it felt like victory to me- with a bittersweet aftertaste- but a victory nonetheless.It is also a very tedious experience. The visuals aren't as fresh as they should and the pseudo-open-world just hinders the experience as in some closed off areas there is nothing to find except a single carrot. Also the popping menu screen leaves a very bad impression in a technically nearly perfect game.In general, Shelter is something you have to experience. It isn't the best and it has its problems, but as a whole, it is a gratifying experience. You get to learn that although the world can sometimes be cruel, it has its reasons. It genuinely makes you feel good- although it also makes you think.7/10"
