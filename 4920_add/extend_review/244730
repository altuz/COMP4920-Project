If you can ignore the fact the artstyle looks pretty DeviantArtish there is actually a really fun game inside.With two buttons however, comes the realization that people who ARE good at fighting games, have much less to think about. Divekick is both the easiest and hardest fighting game to learn and excel at respectively, for this very reason."
,Recommended,244730,7748492,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,FujiSyusuke808,"BUY/SALE/PASS: Buy - Feel free to buy at full priceDivekick is a recent addition to the fighting game genre developed by Iron Galaxy Studios and released in late August.  Everyone loves fighting games, right?No.  Not everyone.  But why?The fact of the matter is that for most fighting games the barrier to entry is complexity.  Players must learn about each of the characters, how to perform special techniques, and master precision combinations on a six-button layout just to be able to compete.Divekick throws all the rules out the door and introduces simple yet absurd gameplay.  The madness begins with a simple premise: there are no movement controls, and there are only two buttons: Dive and Kick.  Pressing Dive makes the player dive into the air, and pressing Kick while in the air causes the player to kick downward towards the opponent.  Pressing the Kick button while on the ground causes the player to jump backward away from the opponent.  These are the only ways to move around the arena.  All divekicks are one hit kills.  The first to five kills wins.Not exactly what you would expect, huh?What if I told you that it’s one of the most engrossing fighting games released in the past five years?In a time when fighting games regularly introduce complexity, it’s refreshing to see a game that breaks fighting games down to the bare essentials; strategy.  None of the 13 characters, each of whom dive and kick differently, are severely overpowered.  There are  no long combos to memorize, no comeback super techniques.  With no complexity, all that’s left is mind games; the ability to fake out your opponent, the rush of emotion when a plan is executed and comes together flawlessly.While Divekick is generally understood to be a parody of the fighting game genre, it also unearths concepts that have been buried under layers of complexity for too long and brings the genre back around full circle.  Divekick cannot be recommended enough for any fighting game enthusiast willing to try something nice and silly.."

You may not immediately click with its unique parody of fighting games and general poking fun at the fighting game community, but at the very least, you'll probably be pretty good at Divekick by the end of your first match due to its elegance in simplicity.1 Dive Button.1 Kick button.1 hit and you're dead.5 rounds won and you're godlike.1 hell of a good time.That's all you really need to know to get started playing Divekick. Jumping and kicking moves you forward and pressing the kick button while on the ground hops you backward, which can  you can also attack during. You couldn't ask for something more approachable.Divekick's depth comes from managing the space between you and your opponent and trying to outwit one another to land that crucial winning blow. All thirteen characters have unique kick angles and characteristics that are suited for beginners (Dive and Kick) all the way up to characters that require a lot of skill and patience (S-Kill and Stream).  All special moves in the game are activated by pressing both buttons at once on the ground or in the air. It's just up to you to figure out how to best utilize them.Multiplayer is what makes Divekick truly shine. While the AI can be good for getting to know your character a bit, the game's honestly a much better affair when paired with other players either online or locally. The implementation of GGPO keeps matches online mostly silky smooth, though the lack of a proper 4-8 player lobbies is a bit of a bummer.Even if Divekick is targeted at folks who love their fighting games, its simplistic approach, low skill barrier for entry, and lighthearted nature make it easily recommendable and enjoyable for anyone simply looking to have a good time."

,Recommended,244730,19664155,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,Scrubsauce,"I have only ever observed the competitive fighting genre community from orbit.  Things like Evo Moment 37 and MAHVEL BAYBEE have been ingrained into Internet culture through osmosis, and while I've never been super into, let alone GOOD at them, I have always admired the passion that the players put into their game(s) of choice.Divekick is a perfect embodiment of all that energy fans put behind the fighting game scene.  The brilliant Kickstartervideos, the silly convention floor demos, the giant two button fight sticks made specifically for the game, and even the game itself all carry that thrill of the fight.  Many of the characters and a good portion of the dialog for the various storylines all reference fighting game culture.  There are characters based on trolls, players, developers, and even canceled characters from other major fighting game franchises.  The game even buys into the whole ""guest character"" feature ala Soul Calibur and Smash (and probably like 10 other franchises, but remember, I'm not big on fighting games!).  Johnny Gat of Saints Row fits right in with the absurdity of Divekick universe, and the new character trailer for Nidhogg's ""The Fencer"" is a Smash Bros character intro in everything but name.Speaking of the Divekick universe, Iron Galaxy has built such a silly, lulzy lore to tie this whole concept together.  Fighting in this world revolves around combinations of kicking and diving (like, literally their legs are so powerful they can push themselves off the planet and up into the air).  Mechanically, there are only two buttons, the gameplay is super simplified but still carries  with it quite the meta.  Characters are diversified through different angles of attack for diving and kicking, and select characters have additional moves like changing angle in flight, usually at the cost of a movement penalty or something to that effect.  The game also employs gems you can set before playing to boost your diving/kicking/meter and some other gameplay modifiers.The two button mechanic is so basic, but the stakes are just as high as any round of Tekken I've ever played.  If you share a love for fighting games, or just want some really silly writing with really silly characters (there's a guy who wears boots on his hands so he can ""kick"" with his hists), you'd be kicking yourself for not taking a dive into your wallet to buy this game.Puns."

Part of me has a difficult time reconciling it's sheer awesomeness with it's inherent simplicity, but really, that is the beauty of this game. You use two buttons (on the gamepad anyway, and you get to decide which two you want to use). One is for diving, one is for kicking....and that is it. All movement is accomplished by virtue of these two moves, and the battles are short and sweet, and yet surprisingly complex. Considering how basic and simple the game mechanics are, this may possibly be the greatest game ever made, lol.Everybody owes it to themselves to give this game a go.The only knock I have on it right now is I couldnt find an online match.

,Recommended,244730,7823402,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Iguana,"The One True Game:Originally made as a joke game with only two characters for a fighting game tournament, Divekick is a very unique 1-on-1 fighting game by Iron Galaxy Studios.What do I mean with unique? Well, it only has two buttons. Yes, you read that correctly, just two. No directional inputs, no macros, none of that. Just a button to jump (Dive) and a button to descend with a kick (Kick). You can also jump backwards if you press kick You even navigate the game menus just by using those two buttons as well. This game is just about diving and kicking, and every hit is an instant K.O. Divekicks, for those who never played fighting games, are a mechanic that some characters have in some already established fighting game franchises, and are usually seen as a great technique for any character who possesses them.Despite having very simple gameplay mechanics, the game is surprisingly deep and varied, and being just a two button fighter, anyone can get into it easily. Each of the 13 characters, who are parodies of other fighting game characters and personalities from the FGC (Fighting Game Community), has its own jump height and kicking speed and angle. Like most fighting games nowadays, it also has a meter, which can be used in different ways. Each character has a different Ground ability and an Air ability, activated by pressing both buttons in ground and air respectively. Some abilities can even work together, like Kung Pao's Ground ability, which creates a sort of dimensional crack above herself, which she can then use to teleport through using her Air ability. Each ability's cost depends on the character as well, which ends up adding even more variety to this game. Also, when you fill up your meter, Kick Factor automatically activates (if you ever played Marvel vs. Capcom 3, this mechanic might sound familiar to you). Kick Factor basically powers up your character's diving and kicking for a limited period of time. And to add even more variety, before every match you must choose one of 4 gems (a parody of Street Fighter X Tekken's gems), which powers up by 10% either your Dive, your Kick, your Meter gain, or a 30% boost for all 3 of them with the painful cost of beginning the game with 4 rounds already lost.Like I mentioned before, every hit is a one hit K.O. (each hit does 1 BILLION DAMAGE), so each match is a first to 5 20-second rounds in order for matches to have some length. It has a very creative way to solve timeouts, making a red vertical line appear at a random point in the stage, and when time runs out, the character who is closer to the line wins the round. It has a simple story mode, with a final boss that can be unforgiving even in normal difficulties. Unfortunately I can't comment on the online, but it uses GGPO, so netcode must be good. Being from where I am, finding an opponent in ranked matches has been impossible for me so far XD.Voice acting is one of the things that I think is unimpressive about this game. I know this isn't a major detail, but some characters' voices are not cool, and can sometimes feel even a bit annoying. Also, if you do not belong to the FGC, you probably won't understand most of the jokes in this game, but maybe that's not a bad thing. If anything, curiosity in those jokes might want you to get into the FGC. I also feel that there's too much FGC-related stuff going on in this game. Some of it is a bit unnecessary in my opinion. All in all, I think this game does not excel in the comedy department. Music is decent as well. Not too complicated tracks for a not too complicated game is a perfect fit the way I see it.---------------------------------------------------------------To sum up, Divekick is a unique and very interesting take on the fighting genre, one where anyone can get in and have fun at any moment, while also being a big (sometimes too big) love letter to the FGC. It's no Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, but the depth and variety hidden within its seemingly simple gameplay might surprise you. And with its very low cost, it's a game that can't be missed.A fighting game that can cater to basically any kind of gamer, in one way or another, is an amazing accomplishment.This is a fighting game for everyone."

It subverts expectations by whittling the notoriously complex movesets of the fighting genre down to two simple maneuvers: diving and kicking. The result is engaging – after only a few rounds of combat, I was able to feint, dodge, and fake out my opponent with gratifying precision. Peel away the colorful artwork, and Divekick closely resembles the best of classic arcade fighter design philosophy. The goals and interface are instantly comprehensible, bouts are quick,DivekickAUGUST 20, 2013Divekick distills the essence of the fighting genre into a two-button, no-joystick, rage-inducing form that can be enjoyed by anyone.→ MUCH MOREJARED PETTY SAYSFriendly fightersPersona 4 ArenaBlazBlue: Calamity TriggerSuper Street Fighter IV and the pacing is snappy. Practice and experimentation are tangibly rewarded by skill development. Divekick has no dull tutorial or five-minute story interludes, just fighting, an occasional dumb joke, and more fighting.A diverse cast of characters infuse Divekick with a variety of special abilities without overly complicating matters. I found something to appreciate in every one of the 13 warriors, but I kept coming back to Uncle Sensei, a cartwheeling hippie wearing boots on his hands. The nearly horizontal angle of his full-body Divekick extension leaves him vulnerable, but it frequently beguiled my opponents, creating an intriguing risk vs. reward proposition.Divekick’s humor varies between cute and bizarre, and occasionally it goes too far. There are gobs of in-jokes about fighting-game tournament culture, staples, and tropes, as well as less obscure comedic one-liners. Some of the visual gags are quite funny – I laughed out loud the first time I watched one of the fighters writing notes on her clipboard while divekicking through the air, immediately before her foot impacted on my face.Less successful is the tongue-in-cheek commentary on racial prejudice. Mr. N’s announcement that “I don’t hug white girls” might make sense to folks familiar with personalities in the fighting-game circuit, but stripped of context it just comes across as unsettling and offensive. The ill-advised naming of Asian martial artist Kung Pao also strikes a distasteful chord.The Vita version has a remarkable competitive two-player mode. My first local Divekick match took place in an IGN hallway on a single handheld, where I held half of the Vita and my opponent held the other half. I expected the layout to be awkward, but was pleasantly surprised to find it quite ergonomic. I could easily envision two friends on a train or kids sharing the back seat on a road trip going at it. It can, of course, also be played online, and my experiences on PS3, Vita, and PC were nearly free of latency.THE VERDICTDivekick is a deep, refreshingly approachable tournament fighter. The unusual control configuration is no gimmick, but rather a functional design choice that helps tear down the barrier of entry for players intimidated by combo breakers and juggling. It is unfortunate that there’s not a better single-player mode, and more unfortunate that Divekick’s cultural insensitivity can be downright cringe-worthy, but it’s still a successful experiment in simplified fighting."

,Recommended,244730,29367681,Posted: 19 January,all,AirMechanic,"This is probably the weirdest fighting game I've ever seen. Built on a mechanic that seems preposterously simple and full of humor that takes heavily from martial arts, fighting game, and anime tropes before mixing in an appropriate dose of stupidity. I'm not disapproving at all, but it wasn't quite the game's tone that had me laughing so hard I had to stop playing for a minute and collect myself amid a raucous exchange of rounds. It was the intensity of trying to beat a much more experienced friend while frantically using just two controls (jumping and kicking).That's the game, in a nutshell. You can jump up or back and you can aerial kick forward. It's a complete parody, but they squeeze a surprising amount of technique out of that format and it's harder to do well than it sounds. You're inside the classic fighting game 2D arena, with health bars for both players that are mostly part of the joke as you're KO'd in a single kick. Each character jumps a bit differently and kicks a bit differently, and there is a special ability that charges up for each character and innate abilities like teleporting or surviving one kick. One character's normal kick is a pro wrestling style dropkick that is almost too effective in the right hands, but each round he wins makes his head bigger (literally - it becomes comically larger with each won round, quickly enabling an easy headshot kick).The game becomes greater than the sum of its parts when you play it with a friend you love to compete with (all the more so with real time voice chat). It becomes an absurd, intense, and hilarious fight to master two keys. One misstep- er, mis-kick and the round is over. There's also online play and a campaign for each character, complete with silly backstory. The humor might not be for everyone, and those looking for a serious or in-depth fighting game may want to look elsewhere. But the gratifying absurdity of this game lies not in its story or characters (though each of those elements here fits the game perfectly).This game probably won't immerse you for hours, nor may you become addicted to it. But it just might inject some laughter into your night. For going a few matches in between other games with a friend of yours, it's a solid one to have in your library and quick enough that you can get a person to play even if they're not really down for games."

I wasn’t really fond of the game when it was announced and that feeling didn’t change after playing it. It’s a novelty game making fun of players who would constantly jump kick through the whole fight.

,Recommended,244730,7772888,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,MonkeyKingHero,"Dive kick is quite simply one of the most fun and interesting games I have played this year and while for the most part I would love to leave it there I just cannot do so. Dive kick is one of those games that appears once every so often out of the blue and is possibly one of the fun and simplest games I have ever ha the joy of playing in my lifetime. The games developers Iron Galaxy studios are well known for their ports of popular gaming franchises to consoles and PC's including the soon to be port of Borderlands 2 for the PS Vita and developing the lacklustre game 'Wreckateer' for the Xbox 360s arcade.Dive kick is a fighting game to its core with the simple premise of knocking out an opponent with a twist-- you must jump into the air and hurl yourself towards the opponent to DIVEKICK them to win the match using just two buttons for jumping into the air and dive kicking your opponent. Rounds end quite quickly with a typical match lasting between 2-5 minutes long and for the most part it becomes a frantic battle to try and stay as high in the air compared to your opponent in hopes of getting them off their guard, that is not to say however that Dive Kick has no skill involved. I found myself trying to outsmart my opponent by various different tactics such as; standing still and waiting the psyche out my opponent, however in the air, going for make and break by instantly jumping and diving for a quick kill and more.Before you start a match you are introduced to a variety of characters each with their own stories and unique abilities which allow for higher jumps, faster kicks and in some cases even slight hovers. After the characters and skins have been chosen you are then given a new option to choose a gem which act as the games help for your character... most of the time. There are some gems that are there purely for either fun or a means to show off! I am talking of course about the YOLO gem, a gem which gives the opposite player a 4 round lead only needing to dive kick the opponent once to win. I found myself most of the time choosing YOLO gem to challenge myself, to see if it was possible to actually win but I could never succeed.My first impressions of DiveKick were quite literally this: What? I can play a fighting game without learning ridiculously hard to pull of combos, anyone can jump into it and know exactly what they need to do to win and it's fun to play? Where do i sign up!? Because that is what it really is, a game which anyone can play without having any prior knowledge of what the game is about or what they need to do. It is a game that brings people together for a forgotten sense of whimsical enjoyment and fun that seems lost in many fighting games lately and is a game which relies on playing tactically and biding your time and not knowing more than the other person and being able to pull off a move without your opponent screaming 'how did you do that?! that's a clear advantage!'Sadly however the game is not as much fun by yourself and should be primarily played with other people either locally or online. That is, if you can connect to someone to play with in the first place. I found myself waiting for long periods of time to finally find a person to play against during the launch week of the game and ended up just turning the game off all together, unplugging my console and going over to a friend's house to play it with them instead.It must be stated however that Dive Kick is fun, there is no question about it. It's a game that brings together the enjoyment of playing together with friends and is a simple idea done right. Dive kick should be a title picked up by everyone and anyone who has a PC or PS3/Vita. Dive kick gets my sphere score of a 8/10 for its sheer replay-ability, hilarious characters and great system. Kudos Iron Galaxy Studios and the team behind Dive kick! I am here hoping for DLC/Dive Kick 2!"

A game that was originally a joke, has only two buttons, and technically doesn't offer the full fighting game experience. HOWEVER, and yes it must be caps, Divekick is a wonderful fighting game! The gameplay is fast and tactical. Fights are very match-up based, but don't count out skill. Yes there is strategy, and yes skill does matter. Reaction time, knowing the character you're up against, and personal play-style are all very important factors. At a glance, this looks like a game you could pass on. I was worried I'd play it for five minutes and be done with it. Yet I find myself smiling and laughing all the time while playing. Online is well implemented and exciting. Characters are so different from one another that there is a lot of space for you to expirement and develop your own unique style of playing. Seriously, I don't know how many ways to say ""This game looks simple, but don't judge a game by it's jokeyness."" Divekick is a silly, yet serious fighting game just as Borderlands is a serious, yet silly FPS/RPG. I'm not saying it's GOTY material, but I'm saying it is well worth the $10 price-tag.

,Recommended,244730,7783073,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,phoenix_advance,"I have a bit of mixed feelings for Divekick. It's exactly what I predicted it would feel like gameplay-wise. Originally I bought this as a gift for a friend on the day it came out. I think the price was overkill. But it really depends on some factors:- You like parodies made on Mortal Kombat.- You're looking for comedy based on ethnocentrism or prejudice.- You're not looking for cool combos. Just K.O's.Overall I personally don't think the game is bad. Worth the daily deal of $2.50? Maybe. Depends on the factors I mentioned above. Otherwise you could do away without it.In just under 1 hr you'll mostly see everything there is to know about this game. And from there on you can either keep playing it, or never play it again.One thing I sometimes like to note about games is the credits. I counted about 50+ people that designed this game. This is too much for an Indie company imho. After all, the more complex Doom 3 was made by roughly the same amount of people before 2005. Divekick is the type of game that strikes me as a 5 man job. I'm fairly certain I've seen just as interesting web-based flash plugin fighter games.The mechanics is sort of interesting. Each character seems to differ only by speed or boost to the dive (forwards/backwards) and the kick. I also feel that there is some weird collision system happening based on the dimensions of the characters. But overall it seems like you tend to get the most success of a K.O by allowing the enemy to attack first. There are special moves, however I ultimately still believe the many variations are caused by a change in speed.For example, if you have a character that kicks at medium speed, you might notice that a character that drifts slowly may be more deadly as they tend to perform more of a flying kick rather than a divekick. But if you have a character that divekicks too fast, you may easily K.O someone that seems to be doing a slow-mo flying kick.Although the music is sort of transparent to me. It's reminiscent to I guess classic games like Double Dragon and Streets of Rage.As a tiny quarrel: Initially I thought the main menu wasn't very intuitive. After a minute I get it. But it still feels bad navigating thereafter. I quote from Albert Einstein, ""Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."" That certainly applies to the main menu in terms of user-friendliness.It seems to be that a large portion of this game has a lot to do with online multiplayer. So I can't really say I'm getting the full potential out of this game. I wouldn't mind giving the ranked matches a shot. But so far on my Steam friends list, only sauce seems to own this game. So I guess I'm just going to have to divekick his butt one day from the other side of the world despite any lag :P"

Somehow a two button fighting game is amusing and takes control, strategy, and timing. However because the game only uses two buttons, controlling your specials gets very buggy and confusing and the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive. Though there is a large roster of characters with different specials and different storylines there just isn't much the developers can do to make the game any different between characters when they are limited to two buttons. Not to mention the very slow loading screen between very quick points.

The controls consist of 2 buttons or 4 if you play with 2 players. It's great that you can choose to use a fight stick, controller, or the keyboard to play. Although it's a bit hard to go through the menu as you only use the selected buttons.There a good variety of characters and costume for each. Each character has their own special attribute to their kicks and  jumps. You got 2 specials for each character which are unique. One for ground and one for air. The meter for them is filled by kicking. But there is no explanation for how the specials work so the only way to find out is to play the character. There's no real way to practice in the game as there's no training mode so it maybe hard to figure out a character since you must play online or in the story mode.The matches are quick since it is a one hit kill. There are some interesting features that you can use while fighting like headshots and gems. Headshots can cripple you or the opponent by making you slow for a couple of seconds and emptying your special meter. There are 3 gems and they don't have a big difference though as I can see. The most noticable one would be the yolo gem though. Which makes lose the the match if your hit once but giving you a big stat increase.The game has some funny parts with random qoutes during loading screen. The game would be much more fun if you had people to play it with. The game has references to the fighting game community and may go unnoticed.

The two button gameplay works well - it gives players only the bare minimum to move, attack, and defend, but that's all any player needs. As a result, the game gets to the meat of what fighting games are all about - reading your opponent and outplaying them. There's no elaborate combo system or pretzel motions to learn, so players can learn to play the game more quickly instead of just playing their character (though character matchups certainly have their importance). And because of the 1-hit KO system, anyone can be a threat - this isn't Marvel where a skilled player can steamroll a newbie with his eyes closed just because he knows touch of death combos by muscle memory. Every opponent demands caution and strategy, which keeps the game from getting dull (though it does get exhausting). The art is pretty bad, and the story mode isn't as ridiculous as it ought to be, but Divekick is about divekicking people in the face, and god damn does it succeed at doing that.And don't be that guy who thinks only Street Fighter clones are allowed into the hallowed halls of the Fighting Game Genre.

Divekick does a pretty good job of eliminating that problem by having literally only two buttons: dive (jump) and kick. That's also the only way to move, so if you want to close the gap between you and your opponent, you will have to do several small divekicks and hope he doesn't do a big one right to your arrogant face, or a big one which is even easier to counter.Each match tends to be about 50% luck and 50% timing.

It had its hayday, and I've never cared much for the competitive level of it, which seems to be about all the legs it has left under it anymore. My enjoyment of it lies in the more accessible entries these days if I can glean any at all, and the failure to innovate on the genre as a whole has by and large left me moving on to other things.Along came this odd duck though, Divekick. While it still falls to some of the same trappings of any other vs. fighter, the incredibly simple yet deceptively strategic gameplay breathes some much needed new life and individuality into this game.It is truly that simplicity that makes this something more than just another vs. fighter. You have two buttons, one for ""dive"" which makes your character jump, and another for ""kick"" which makes them do their diving kick attack. If you use the kick button while not in the air, depending on the character, you may have another mobility option at your disposal, but it still only ever requires two buttons.That's it. There are no d-pad/joystick movements. There are no strings of perfectly timed combos and reversals. There are no complex 360° movement requirements while in the air at the precise timing where your foot reaches your standing opponent's armpit. There is only dive, and kick. Sounds boring right? Surprisingly not!I found myself playing this more often than I expected to, given my apathy towards the genre in general, and the fact that it managed to keep me playing it beyond the first 10 minutes is testament enough. You see, as simple as this concept sounds, there really is a game to enjoy here. Each characters movesets vary slightly, and with every attack being a one hit-KO, it's all about the mental aspect, faking your opponents out, knowing your character's strong opponents and weak opponents, and really just some plain ol' good luck/timing.Give it a try, even if you don't usually like fighting games. You may not get all the genre in-jokes (I know I sure didn't) but I guarantee this is at least one fighting game that you won't have a frustrating time with the learning curve."

I can only assume this is some sort of joke and the positive reviewers are in on it.Divekick appears to be a big joke on the fighing game community... but unless you are super into tournament competetive play the jokes are completely not there and unfunny. Playing a round of Divekick is like walking into a room with a bunch of people laughing and just feeling confused because you dont know why, and noone tells you. Yes i like Figihing games. Yes my friends like fighting games, some even competing in tourneys. no the general public doesnt give a rip thats its ""funny"" that you name a character whose head literally inflates after each victory after a guy who arranges tourneys and then plays in the same ones he hosts. Yes, in ""Divekick"" that is a thing.How does the game play? like 5th grade geometry. Every charachters movest can be broken down into triangles, or trapezoids. Ive won most of the online games i have played by just sitting there and doing one move at the right time while the other player jumps around like an idiot. Angle x intersects angle y at point z. Does that mean i have ""skiilz""? This game is a joke, both literally and figuratively, it plays like a bad flash game and has all the humor of a small community in-joke. A good game COULD be made with a 2 button control scheme im sure, but ""Divekick"" aint it. Save your money and nab ""skullgirls"" instead.

But that's what all this amounts up to a few minutes of fun then it gets stale. This is more like a parody than a real fighting game. It has it's moments  but you can be simple without being boring. If you're looking for a GOOD 2 button fighting game wait for One Finger Death Punch to come to Steam. In my honest opinion the gameplay mechanics of that game blows this one out the water. But if you really want to try Divekick I highly suggest you wait for a sale or else you're going to get a case of buyer's remorse.

All characters have a million health and every attack does four million damage. There are two buttons. You jump, and then you kick. The brilliance of this design is that it is so simple yet there is depth in the way each character jumps, how each one kicks, and how their supers behave. Even the super moves are brilliantly simple, being activated simply by hitting both buttons at once and changing depending on whether you are on the ground or in the air.I watched this game developed from the ground up thanks to the beautiful romance between Dave Lang and the GB crew and I'm so happy I saw it all the way through.

Throw that nonsense out the window because they have nothing on this. This game takes character influences from everywhere, and the things they say are HILARIOUS. Even the loading screen ""hints"" are so meta you won't believe your mind. There are 2 buttons, ""Dive"" and ""Kick"". Simple. Kicking while diving sends your character forward while kicking on the ground usually sends them backward, removing the need for more buttons. You can also use ""specials"" by hitting both buttons, but you honestly don't even need that. There are also ""gems"" to upgrade your character's stats to try and gain an advantage over your opponent. Oh, also, it is 1-hit kills. So it is all about timing and mindgames.Story: 7/10So it is a fighting game, so naturally it isn't about the story, although from what I have played so far, everyone has a backstory and it is ABSOLUTELY silly and amazing.Audio: 10/10The announcer, honestly the best part of the game. Every time I see someone who I enjoy playing this game with, we yell out DIVEKICK to each other trying to sound like the announcer. The music is decent, but you aren't really paying attention to it because the announcer is #1. Also, when you lose, your character usually says something hilarious like ""Ganked!"" or ""No MIA calls!"" (from games like League of Legends where those are apart of the meta.Graphics: 10/10For what the game is, the graphics are simplistic but quite detailed. It gives everything you need to be aesthetically pleasing and hilarious, but at the same time simple enough so that there is no input lag, which is a MAJOR importance in every game.Gameplay: 10/10Honestly, Dive and Kick. What more do you need, 'nuff said. Headshots stun your opponent for 5 seconds in the next round, and chain headshots give Double Kill and Rampage for the additional sillies.Overall: 10/10This game is beautiful. Hilarious. Magnificent. Find some friends, set up a tournament, and kick some dive. I personally HATE fighting games, they aren't very fun to me. The only ""fighting"" game I have ever liked is Super Smash Bros and that doesn't even count as a traditional fighting game because of how unbalanced it is.

When most people think fighting games, they think long 10 minute combos and mashing 15 buttons on an arcade stick.  Divekick is almost the antithesis of that since it only uses 2 buttons and each round is a 1-hit kill.  Because of this, beginners and experienced players will be on a similar playing field and can both enjoy themselves (that is not to say, however that pros will be dominated by noobs).  The depth comes from the meta game of using your fundamentals, gimmicks, spacing, and mind games.

If you want to come out on top, you will have to out-smart your opponent while avoiding falling pray to their own mind games. Seeing as the first one to get hit loses, one mistaken can lose you a round and repeated mistakes will surely end in defeat.Being the parody fighting game that Divekick is, the game comes with many references and jokes originating from the fighting game community that appear all over the game. As someone who has never played many fighting games, I didn't get most of the references, but a little research  or a friend versed in said community can help to clear a few things up.Ultimately, Divekick is a funny, enjoyable and straightforward game that catters to all gamers of all skill levels. The biggest complaint about the game is that it can feel a little short lived, especially since the community has begun to dwindle and the story mode will only last you so long. This can be a problem for those with hurting wallets looking for the most bag for your buck, but playing with friends is always a blast. $10 might seem a little steep for some, but it's definetly worth getting on sale if you've had any interst in the game."

,Recommended,244730,9047367,"Posted: 10 February, 2014",all,StevenSeagal,"Divekick is probably the most accurate title for any game ever. The idea of the game being only two buttons (dive and kick) is a fresh breath from the world of competitive fighters where 6 or 7 button strings are not uncommon. Yet there's a subtle complexity to a game with only two buttons. The spacing of the characters and mindgames that go on with such a short round period make for a very deep sense of strategy, despite a shallow control scheme.The characters are diverse in playstyle and feel very different from one another. The story mode for each character is pretty short and the cutscenes could stand to be better, but story is never a big part of fighting games anyway. It can be a little iritaing using the two button control scheme to navigate menus, but you get used to it.The online mode is as barren as you would imagine with a fighting game, but joining a reliable steam group can fix that. The ""Casual Divekick Tournament Group"" that I'm subscribed to here on steam meets almost every Friday at 10pm EST for maybe an hour to set up a round robin style tournament. Without them, I think this game would be tragically left as a competitive curiosity for LAN parties.*Edit as of 11/24/2015: Divekick is now $5 for a non-sale price. I feel like this is a very solid price point for this game and hope that the couple new characters that have been added since release help to foster more players online. A great buy at this price now."

Divekick is a game that's easy to learn, and two people can easily play it on one computer, so it's a great party game to whip out during a get-together with your friends.The only problem I have with Divekick is that the online multiplayer doesn't ever match you up with someone. I don't know if this is due to lack of people playing the game or a problem with the game itself, but it means that if you don't have frineds to play this with, you probably shouldn't buy it, but if you do, you're going to have a great time."

It's a nice tagline: ""A fighter with only two buttons"", but unlike One-Finger Death Punch, it lacks depth or lasting appeal past a few for fun matches with a friend. And believe it or not, having two buttons makes the controls confusing or unresponsive. The character choices are fun to laugh at but frustrating to use, as some are obviously better than others, most being joke characters, either pathetically terrible or grotesquely overpowered. Despite a clear and clean art style, a lot of clipping issues within matches, not really being obvious what's hittable and what's dead space. Don't even bother with online play; all competitors use the aforementioned overpowered characters to an undefeatable level, so this game is interesting only up to your first time playing with a friend.All in all, a gimmick that doesn't take itself seriously enough to flesh out assets that could have made it a worth while game."

I wouldn't buy this game full price even if it is cheap and I also wouldn't buy it for the online (which is basically non-existent)In short, its a 4 quid flash game that doesn't take itself seriously and acts as a gateway to more advanced fighters."
