,Not Recommended,244810,8210548,"Posted: 22 December, 2013",all,ElDobleK,"The brawler genre, simple as it may be, is one of my very favorites -- I include Scott Pilgrim and Castle Crashers when discussing my favorites games. So, I was predictably excited to pick up Foul Play upon its release. The art style looks fantastic and the presentation (while gimmicky at first) is fresh and creative.Unfortunately, the gameplay is pretty shallow. Granted, the brawler genre is not known for its depth of gameplay, but, after running through the first few levels, I can legitimately say that simply mashing buttons is a viable, if not more effective strategy to defeating enemies. While it's amusing enough to try to string together juggles and combos, knowing that I could be blindly smashing keys to accomplish the very same thing diminishes any sense of reward or accomplishment I could have attained.I really wanted to like this game; it's cool looking, kitchsy, and charming. Ultimately, though, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Maybe when it drops to around $2.50, it might be worth purchasing. At the time of writing, however, it's sitting at $7.49 during the 2013 Winter Sale. So, this brawler fan must give Foul Play a thumbs down."

So I was kind of looking forward to playing this game. I played it with my best friend when he came over. We played around the first 2 missions trying to make it as fun as we can with combos and voicing over the characters but we both realized something after the 2nd mission. It was really repetitive. all you really do is go around the screen and punch people around in the same environment. No power ups, lives, extra moves  just punching the same people around the same environment for that level. This was a really big disappointment for me. The game play is there it's just I can't recomend it."
,Recommended,244810,14805856,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,zeroxxx,"My my, glad I got this - a very funny platformer.If you have previously played Castle Crasher, this game is similar but more action-oriented.So what, we control a character that's supposed to perform a... foul play. While we're performing our play on the stages, we move forward, beating enemies and pleasing our audiences with good performance.The campaign is divided into five acts, each acts have five levels, each levels is approx ten-fifteen minutes long, a bit longer if you're into boss battles. The objective is simple, you just need to beat each enemy waves with style - be it by performing chain combos to fill and maintain the meter gauge (audiences' mood). Don't let it get too low or the curtain will close and game over. A bit lacking aspect, though, is that the campaign is incredibly linear - you have no option to do anything else and can only follow the direction the game wishes you to. You can, however, replay earlier stages from main menu to achieve higher scores.The combat mechanic is very simple, chaining normal and powerful attacks while deflecting the enemies or throw them against each others. And this what differentiates from Castle Crasher, it offers more lively battles and flexible ala Devil May Cry DMC but in 2D. By chaining you'll be increasing your scores and earns stars that'll be calculated at the end of each level. As you progress, you'll unlock more abilities/perks to use in game. Use these to... chain more enemies. Heh.And of course, playing coop is much more fun than alone. It's hilarious, really, to have a messed up battle on the stages.Graphic wise I'm incredibly amused. It really is that great - suitable for this game - colorful and innately bunch sense of humor drawn into the art and character designs. Special effects don't distract you from the battles and carefully blend with the stages, movement and attack animations are not sluggish and feel natural. FPS throughout the level is stable enough even during chaotic battle.  Some minus points though, there are no deep customizations like AA or refresh rate and some commonly supported resolutions are not supported. But overall, I'd say the job well done.And lastly, controller support is great - and I expect it so much because this is a platformer. I wouldn't even give the game a damn great review if it had poor support, but this Foul Play is just apt at adapting controller support. Dinput and Xinput are both supported, moreover each buttons can be customized in game. No complaints from me on this aspect really.Funny thing is, metacritic user score gives this 69/100. Don't listen - it deserves more. A recommended game from me."

,Not Recommended,244810,31006519,Posted: 7 April,all,waelhadaya,"While Foul Play is a fresh concept with some unique aspects, it fails to execute completely.The first hour was fun, it initially drew me in with some cool artworks, funny moments, cheerful audience, and some nice combos, that was the only pros for this game, otherwise, it's painful.The gameplay is very repetitive and shallow, there is no progressive system unless you want to count some new useless new combos as progressive, I couldn’t feel rewarded at all.It’s extremely easy, you can beat the game without dying once, the difficulty comes from the three challenges each act gives you, most of them are tedious, you have to beat the three challenges to get some charm (useless perk), for example why can’t I be rewarded if let’s say I finished two out of the three challenges in each act?There is another major problem with this one, the enemies have a ridiculous amount of HP for no obvious benefit other than more button mashing, it seriously hurts my thumb, and there is no strategy in it, just to make a longer gameplay time but a very boring and annoying one.It took me around 4 hours to reach the final boss (which I didn’t bother to beat because of the ridiculous HP with no fun at all), I could have beaten this game in less than two hours if the HP was of a normal level, I don’t recommend this game, it’s at most a painful 3 out of 10."
,Recommended,244810,29657092,Posted: 2 February,all,Rainiac,"A spirited performance, but a relatively short oneFoul Play is a side-scrolling brawler. Nothing very original there, but the charm of the game lies in its presentation. The game is presented as a recounting of the past exploits of its main character, Baron Sebastian Dashforth (aided by his plucky sidekick, Scampwick Steerpike), performed by the pair on a Victorian stage. The setting & overall presentation is one of the game’s two major strengths. Its other strength is the unique way Foul Play handles its gameplay; you don’t have a health bar. Instead, your goal is to please your audience, which you do by stringing together combos against your enemies, which range from frill-wearing vampires to robed cultists and many more besides. Take a hit or fail to land a blow against someone for a period of time and your audience’s mood will drop, as indicated by a meter at the top of the screen. If it hits rock bottom, you’ll have to start the act again. There’s also a level up system, which unlocks new fighting moves each time you reach a new level.Unfortunately, for all its neat presentation, Foul Play is still a beat em up, and is therefore subject to the same limitations as most of the other examples of the genre, namely repetitive action & a fairly short length. There are 4 ‘acts’ each containing four regular levels and a multi-phase boss fight, plus a final act featuring the last two stages, for a grand total of 22 levels, but even with all that content you should be able to finish the game in 5-6 hours, and that’s assuming you don’t have to replay any of the acts. The developers also included a number of challenges in each of the regular acts. These challenges can be anything from ‘Get a 50 hit combo during this battle’ to ‘stop the enemies from killing these innocent extras’ to ‘Use this move successfully x times during this act’. Completing all the challenges in a particular act rewards you with a Charm, which provides you with a boost of some kind. You can equip up to 2 Charms before tackling each act, and they prove to be quite handy, especially in the later parts of the game. The game also boasts a 2 player mode, with one person playing as Dashforth & the other taking control of Scampwick. Co-Op can be played both local & multi, but I cannot comment on whether co-op mode is any good or if the netplay was stable or not as this was purely a single player experience for me, so please bear that in mind.Overall, Foul Play is a good attempt to take a well-established genre and put its own stamp on it. I’d recommend this game to fans of the side-scrolling beat em up but given it’s short length it might be worth waiting for it to go on sale before you pull back the curtain."
,Recommended,244810,9307353,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Charlie,"Foul play imo should be given 6 out of 10. I haven't complete it yet but basically I got the entire idea. It is classic beat'em style game and fun to play with firend online or locally. It is well done in visual aspect, the soundtracks are good, and the gameplay is decent. For 15 bucks, it may not be worth that much but with 75% off sale, I have to say, it is worth that price.However, being worth 3 or 4 bucks doesn't mean it is flawless. Here come the some flaw.1. Maybe or not, the later levels doesn't introduce many new features. It lacks variation. Sometimes you probably feel that enemies are just the same but with different apparences. That is not variation which needs new strategies. It becomes repetitive sooner or later.2. Movement/action delay. You will feel sometimes character take too much time on one movement and you have to wait until the movement is finished. Otherwise, you can't do anything during that process. This concept is acceptable however, when you jump too high in the air doing combos, if you miss the target or enemies, they fall on the ground before you do, then your combos are simpy break because when you are doing combos in the air, you have 1. combo attack, 2. stay in the air process to finish. It takes too long for you to get back to ground to continue the combo. So to complete the challenges like 100 combos are really hard since it is easier that movement delay breaks combo.3. I was really tired playing this game. Confronting multiple enemies, sometimes time limits, and movement delay as I said above are the reasons that you constantly typing buttons. It either kills your index and middle fingers when using a keyboard or kills your thumbs when using a controller. It becomes a button masher.4. I still don't understand how your health point is calculated...None of the indicators on the top screen are clear for me. I just don't get it..."

It tried to be unique with your character's ""health"" but i think that was a pretty bad blunder. I think it may be impossible to ""die.""The combos are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ too. Like, I didn't find any that used the two buttons that didn't end up hitting the enemy across the screen before i could get a fat combo going. The parry button is easily spammable and I don't think I was punished for doing it once. There doesn't seem to be a reason not to unless your ""health"" meter is about to run out because the audience is bored.I didn't find this challenging in any way other than how much I could play this without falling asleep.

Love the design, with the stage-setting and the semi-Victorian motif the visuals are just absolutely my cup of tea. For me, the gameplay mostly involved lots of button-mashing which is how I play every fighting game ever, but the idea of your performance skills being the main criteria for success makes this game something unique. Co-op is entertaining, and each stage is short enough that you don't feel obligated to spend hours on a single session. All in all, a different and welcoming take on the genre."

,Recommended,244810,9392247,"Posted: 8 March, 2014",all,CopycatPls,"So after checking the game and playing it completely,I think I can give a fair review of this game.First of all, what you should expect when you play Foul Play:You should like beat-em-ups with 2d sprites and all the cons that come with it (bad lineup,more ""That should have hit""-moments).You should like the general idea of a game having a theatre-like feeling.However, you should not expect a hard game when playing. Elaboration on why later on.Story: You control Sebastian Dashforth,who combined with his assistant Scampwick Steerpipe is presenting his life as a daemonologist on stage, re-enacting the main events of Dashforth's last 20 years. Not fearing to go into hand-on-hand combat he and Scampwick are fighting themselves through an lost city of egypt, cursed villages, underwater cities and a london in control of a cult.Fairly generous with the humor and honest (though you may not thank him for it) he will keep you interested to keep playing for a while.Gameplay: You got six buttons that are important for playing, a weak,but fast attack,a stronger, slower attack which can bring enemies into the air or down from it, a jump, a button for improved abilities (which you learn at a higher level),a Showstopper ability granting you double the combo and double the audience approval when you activate it for a certain amount of time, a dodge and a block. The block is the most important of them,since you automatically counter blocked attacks from weaker enemies, letting you combo into them and from them. The enemies attacks have a clear indicator and you have a longer time to block or dodge an attack. You can play with someone else in Co-op and the only downside is that you have a combined health bar but seperated combo meters. You even get some upsides like a combo bonus if you activate showstopper at the same time. Enemies differ from higher health and exclusive gimmicks, like binding you if they hit on mummys.At the end of a level,you can get a charm if you did the challenges and a diary page if you collected enough stars.Additional Pros:-Replay value to 100% the game and to experiment on different gamestyles-Unique Storyconcept and interesting Characters-Soundtrack available with the game for no additional cost-Attention to detailAdditional Cons:-Low Playtime(any% about 3 hours, 100% 14 hours)-Bugs like enemies thrown up into the air won't come down that easily at some points-No Wiki-No active lobby community,so no random multiplayerAll in all it is worth playing, and if you are a fan of unique concepts,than this game should be yours!"

You just mindlessly mash buttons and sometimes switch to another button. I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of this genre, however I enjoyed Castle Crashers, I respected it's humour, and it has much more content and replayability, with up to 4 people. There is no humour in this game, other than the combat is a joke. I see no difference as I progress through the levels, and the enemies are pretty much the same everytime. I am fully aware of the genre, but even for the genre it's below average. I cannot recommend this game, especially when it's £10.The art style is cool, the music compliments the experience, and the idea that you're in a play/theatre is actually really interesting and unique.

,Recommended,244810,10480023,"Posted: 15 June, 2014",all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Buy? Maybe.-=TL;DR=-Foul Play is a very simple side-scrolling beat 'em up that plays much like Castle Crashers, in the vein of a stage play as acted by the players. Gameplay is focused on performing well by maintaining combos, avoiding hits and completing level based challenges, instead of survival and managing lives/continues/respawns. It's a clever take on the genre that makes for a somewhat interesting experience, but in spite of the description's ""rewards performance over pummeling"" the gameplay does get fairly repetitive and it's easy to loose interest after a few levels.-=Presentation=-Foul Play is easily comparable to Castle Crashers due to it's art style and simplistic combat - it looks and almost plays quite like a Flash game even though the game doesn't seem to be in Flash. Animation is fluid like Castle Crashers, but certainly won't win any awards. The old British comedy will probably put off some players, not because it's bad, but it's a style of comedy that won't make alot of people laugh. I never felt that any of the jokes were bad or purile, nor did it put me off at all, but I didn't laugh. The game is cartoonish, attacks have that ""PISH! POW"" as expected and enemies eyes turn into ""X's"" when they ""die"" (in which humorously, the enemy actors will be pulled off screen or sneak off screen"". Backgrounds gradually fall in the back, as if the props were being managed by an amateur. The director is often seen in the background even on the scene itself, as if he not aware how fast the play is moving. They're all nice touches. The soundtrack fits the theme very well and I do like the menu music, though it's nothing spectacular, it's just good and fits the game well. The game plays at 60FPS, though, doesn't reach my 2560x1080 resolution-=Gameplay=-The way to win is the complete the level without dropping the ""Mood-o""meter"" low, which is the visual metric of how well you are performing. You maintain and grow this meter by performing big combos, maintaining those combos, reversing attacks, avoid being hit and activating a ""special"" that doubles your combo count output. The gameplay is very forgiving: Combos allow a good 2-3 seconds after you last hit for you to continue hitting enemies (making managing the screenspace key), reversable attacks have a near infinite window for you to counter them and if you can't block it, you can easily dodge a good bit out of the way. Staying alive is extra easy and I'm honestly not sure you can die unless you simply don't perform well enough for the meter - you can usually spam a few attacks here and there to keep yourself in the game. There is still a challenge of keeping your combo going, as you can lose it from being hit or not keeping enemies near you to attack, and the game offer various combo, attack and time challenges. This style of gameplay makes the game potentially more valuable for the completionist.Combat does get a little boring fairly soon. While Foul Play gives the player new moves at a very reasonable pace, it's generally most effective to mash the attack button and/or spam reversals, as enemies constantly attack. There are moments where it's definitely handy to dodge whether to avoid damage or make it to an enemy fast enough to keep a combo going. Some moves are fun, like the Stunning Piledriver or multi-hit air attack, but the gameplay is very repetitive as you constantly slap enemies with your cane and throw them around with the same two slam attacks. There's a second uppercut style attack, but there is really no reason to use it as air combos aren't awarded more than normal combos and doing so can knock enemies out of your range, causing you to lose a combo.The game offers Local and Online co-op, though, finding a game seems impossible - I've only seen 0 games in the server browser and that was even when I played the game shortly after it came out. You will likely have to find somebody in the community hub or elsewhere to play with.-=Conclusion=-Foul Play offers a unique and lightly fun experience, allowing players to challenge themselves by completing goals, versus beating up and staying alive. The combat becomes dull fairly quickly and after a while, I became disinterested in finishing the game, even though I was halfway finish and trying judiciously to get this off my backlog. For most players, the $15 price point may be a bit too high for the repetitive gameplay, lack of online players, and potentially non-entertaining comedy. The price seems fair for somebody who would really enjoy this game and expect to beat all the challenges, as that is the arguably the best part of this game - seeing if you can complete them on a game that is very easy, though providing some challenges that might feel just slightly out of reach. This surely isn't a must-buy and you would be missing out on the performance based gameplay, though it's nothing revolutionary. However, the game is certainly not bad and there are many worse games you could buy, but you may feel the lack of value shortly after playing."

,Recommended,244810,7636392,"Posted: 11 November, 2013",all,Based64God,"Updated review: I'm a little further into Foul Play with two acts under my belt, but I'm loving it.The first thing I thought upon playing was that Double Dragon, Final Fight, and the Batman: Arkham series had an awesome little spunky lovechild.  It's a side-scrolling beat 'em up with cute graphics, a funny plot, and simple-yet-pleasing mechanics.You play an intrepid  British adventurer and demon hunter and his scamp of a sidekick.  Gameplay focuses on parrying enemy attacks, situational awareness, and making magnificient combos.  As you advance through the retelling of Baron Dashforth's exploits, trials, and tribulations the scenery morphs at lightning speed to set each scene - the game is a play upon an everchanging stage.  The graphical style is reminiscient of Castle Crashers with a dash of Alien Hominid thrown towards enemy designs.Developed and published by Devolver Games, the same studio that published Hotline Miami, Foul Play brings more addicting albeit different strategic violence into the fold with a more chipper and humorous take on plot and design.The only downside comes from the combat mechanics getting a little bit stale - it is a beat 'em up, after all.  However, some of the repetitiveness is alleviated by the introduction of new combo moves and charms as you progress further into the game and complete various performance goals for each act.  Charms unlock abilities such as combo multipliers, lengtheners, and more exotic buffs and aids.I'd recommend this game with two tips for enjoyment:1.) Play with a friend - it makes it much more fun.2.) Play in half-hour to hour stretches - avoid burning out on the mechanics"

Not that it's unfinished, but it would probably be disregarded as ""another  mindless brawler"". But it is not that. This game is amazing. It isn't perfect, but it is awesome when you play it right.Yes there is a right and wrong way to play this. Before I get to that though here are the pros and cons.PROSFantastic and humorous storyline.Believable characters who also have awesome dialogue.Original concept of the audience being your score, also you can't die on bosses that would be otherwise frustrating.Fair but challenging enemies.Co-Op actually has benifits other than playing with your friend.Awesome combos that are uniqueParrying is the best thing in brawlers since magic in Castle Crashers.Those 4th wall breaks do.Extremelly fluent combat that never cancels your moves unless you get hit.The art style is utterly beautiful and fits perfectly with the game.CONSSometimes the joke of being in a play is too forced.Getting high combos can be hard on large enemies when it doesn't tell you you can't parry them.The learning curve suddenly jolts up, although it smooths out later on.The crowd cares very little for a climax. Why can't you get bonus points for being in a tough spot then pulling through.By itself rating 8.5/10But there is a way to play the game that just makes your time with the game the best. Be immersed. It is hard since it constantly reminds you that it is a game. But once you feel like the character, the game truly feels like a hunt against daemons. Get a friend to play this. You two voice the characters like you really mean it. Once you feel like you are in the game, it feels like you are preforming for a live audience about YOUR adventures.

This is one of the more unique features of the game! The action take place on stage infront of a live audience, the principal being that you are recounting your adventures on stage. Much of the humour of the game comes from this; defeated enemies will crawl off into the wings after a few seconds, the sets and props will be wheeled into view and occasionally you catch the stage-hand taking to a breather or chatting to one of the 'actors' playing an enemy. This setup means that you don't have a health bar as you might in a traditional setting, instead you are given a gauge showing the excitement of the audience. Taking hits causes this level to drop and if you don't pull yourself together and get on with the show then the curtain will fall on that act.Each play (of which there are 5) is split into several acts and the plays have a range of settings/themes although in essence the gameplay doesn't change hugely other than upping the difficultly and enemy count between each one. Each act has 3 challenges which, when completed, give you a charm which can be equipped for some extra combat bonus or ability.Overall this is simple but enjoyable and best enjoyed with someone on the couch in co-op mode."

This game is better than what I expected. For what it's worth I am not disappointed. I Imagined it beling like Castle Crashers, but with only 2 players. However, the crowd mechanics of the game plays a big role. keep the combos up or you will loose the audience's intrest, not to mention getting hit by an enemy is a no-no. You're supposed to be the hero that's naturally invincible; an unstoppble force to be admired. You'll have to wow the audience back from getting hit or you may risk failing the act. Then again combos are an easy pleasure to get that mood up. Enimies dont actually die (it's a play) but rather crawl off the stage after being knocked out. On occasion you see a backstage staff member doing something comedic, reminding you that in the end it's just a play. All-in-all Foul Play is a pretty good way to spend a little time playing a few acts, maybe get through a play in a day (there's more than one play). If I were to grade it I'd give it a B+ because i enjoyed it. But it really is a bunch of mayhem. The story developments (given that fact it is a play after all) don't really seem that much of an incentive to keep pressing onward. But it's good game."

The graphics are more smooth than Castle Crashers, but still retains the same charm, with all the characters and enemies big enough so that you can see them, but that also sometimes makes it hard to know if you are in the same layer as the enemy. The bosses are both challenging and rewarding, each with their own special attacks. The story is very well thought out, with Scarmpwick acting as a great source of comic relief. The presentation of the game is wonderful, I couldn't find one glitch or error with the game. The music fits well, and perfectly suits the seriousness of some situations.Overall, Foul play is a wonderful game, and I would reccomend this game to anyone who has played Castle Crashers, and liked it, or someone who likes side scrolling beat-'em-ups. 9/10"

With castle crashers the game does a good job at making me want to finish it. This one nnot so much, also if it had additional player slots it would be cool but it only at the max a two player game while castle crashers is 4. So i'd honestly only recommend this game if you already have Castle Crashers and want to play something similiar but different. Still a worthy buy. Forgot to mention the whole life bar and game mechanic is very different as it is performance based in a way that plays really nice with the ""play theater"" vibe the game's story is based on."

The combat is center statge at it's just as good as Arkham, albeit less deep and minus the gadgets. Make no mistake this is a side scrolling button masher but the combat is much more fun than other button mashers since you can block and counter, and the game wasn't designed to eat quarters.The art direction and style is unique and cute as the entire game takes place on a stage with a Daemon hunter recounting his exploits to a crowd. The crowd's happiness/entertainment level is your life meter and the actors take on the roles of werewolves, mermaids, and giant crabs to name a few. The art direction doesn't go all the way though with flying enemies conspicuosly lack wires and some of the bosses are just monsters, but overall the concept works great.The game works best in small doses and actually isn't a drag in single player. Very much worth your time and money."

They tend to be repetitive and quickly boring, but Foul Play builds on the genre and manages to avoid most of the things the annoy me with other titles. It's theatrical structure is a perfect options that allows for a lot of different monsters, settings and situations. The writing is full of humour and wits. The game avoids the too obvious ""save the princess"" goal, which is a very good point.The other thing I like about that theatrical structure is that it allows for a choice of gaming length depending on the time you have. Only a few minutes to play? Play an act and move on to other things. Wanna go for longer sessions? Do a full play in one run and you're good to go.Overall a nice game, great universe and graphic style, good gameplay with some twists in the genre. Clearly worth its price anytime, an absolute best buy when on sale. Go get it!"

It's very hard to fail a level because there are no health bars per se. The move list is not as extensive as in other games, the focus of Foul Play however is not to dispatch enemies as fast as possible but to keep your combo going. The rather limited moves you have serve that purpose well.Two other minor annoyances for me were the menu structure (if you unlocked a new move during online play, you would have to go back all the way to the main menu - thus terminating your online game - to check what exactly you unlocked) and the fact that the game assumes you have a 360 gamepad. You can use your keyboard for it and it playes well with it, but all the tooltips etc. will only show the corresponding 360 pad key, not your keyboard key. Also you can not bind attacks to your mouse, so you ca not play WASD to move + mouse to attack like you can in many other games.If you can look besides those things, you will find Foul Play to be a very fun co-op experience."

If you are somehow interested because of the art style and silliness, I'd suggest skipping this one.The good:Super tight controls. Pleasant visuals and audio. Light-hearted atmosphere.The bad:Very repetitive. Enemies come in all sorts of varieties, but there are a lot of reskins. Fighting is reduced to button mashing. Gameplay is also extremely easy. For example, the game actually gives you a pop-up over enemies' heads to tell you when the time is right to parry their attacks. And because of how the game mechanics work, as long as you manage to get a good number of combos in there you won't actually die, since pleasing the crowd essentially heals you.Conclusion:Castle Crashers is still the go-to game in this genre, at least on the pc and until we get a remake of the glorious Alien Hominid. If you're a rabid beat'em up fan looking for the next fix I would suggest buying this game when you find it on sale. If not your money is best spent elsewhere."

I really enjoyed the idea and thought it would be a ton of fun plus overall pretty funny. While its pretty clever and ok for the first level or two. The game gets pretty old and feels extremely button mashy around the third play. My greatest frustration is how easily combos are broken up by what feels like a bit of garbage. At first I would try to learn the combos and go through the work of stringing them together, but at a certain point it was clearly easier to just hit the y button over and over again.Overall the game gets huge points for being clever and fun, but it loses all points after that for being repeatative, and button mashy. The value of the game is good, but unfortunately it starts to feel stale and boring pretty quickly."

This was definitely a labour of love and I really enjoyed it."
