Sometimes is a bit unfair, but that's how masocore games (trial and error) are supposed to be. At first, you'll lose the count of how many times you died, but with practicing you won't believe you finally passed that damn level! The pulsing music will get you pumped and also helps to make the experience much more enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value if you try to improve your times and/or want to get the achievements.If you liked ESJ I recommend to buy the mini-sequel ""Groove City"". It's much more shorter than this game, but has a level editor and a lot of community made levels. It means even more replay value and some crazy stuff fans created.I think Electronic Super Joy worth the full price, but if you buy it on a sale it's an absolute steal. Even if you're not experienced with masocore games, but are a fan of old-school platformers, you'll like ESJ. A lot!"
,Not Recommended,244870,8186075,"Posted: 21 December, 2013",all,Kaidelong,"In short, his game is quite derivative except for being a blend of two game mechanics that don't really work well together: precision platforming and bullet hell. If I were to give this game a more conventional rating it would be something like 6/10.First, the derivative bits: It's another ""faux retro"" platformer scored with electronic music and made a low tech art style, built to encourage 100% completion and intending to keep you playing by being brutally difficult. In this regard it's in the fleet of games where Super Meat Boy has been serving as the flagship.So what about the differentiating aspect? The mix being attempted is just too difficult to pull off without compromising something without robbing the sensation that the player is able to master the game. Essentially the problem is that the game seems to be trying to marry games that have a highly mobile, bullet spamming protagonist who can dodge just about everything and constantly shoot with precision platforming, which simply doesn't work. The design choice seems to have been rather than compromising on the platforming to make an interesting platformer-bullet hell hybrid (Drunken Robot Pornography does quite a great job at this), or compromise by making the bullets easily spoofed and prone to the kind of memorization and reflexes you use on precision platformers, they chose to try and be uncompromising on both fronts. I don't think it works because it robs me of the illusion of controlling the course of gameplay; after beating a difficult level on Dustforce or Super Meat Boy I feel proud of myself, but this game more makes me just feel lucky.I should clarify that most of the game is not like this, I only point it out as important because I think these segments are what truly set this game apart. I think this important distinguishing trait did not play out very well.Other than that the game is competent but doesn't really add anything new or special to other precision platformers. A similar game with somewhat similar (but better) art would be They Bleed Pixels. It is an easier game but it captures some of the bullet hell ideas in a similar fashion to this game on limited sections on later levels without compromising on the important illusion of control a precision platformer needs."

,Recommended,244870,23770641,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Gao Li,"9/10 (version 1.12C) Just Give in to the Groove, You Know You Want ItMichael Todd Games’ Electronic Super Joy (2013) is unexpectedly one of the most relaxing hardcore platformers I’ve ever played. Design-wise, it initially presents itself as yet another hardcore platformer with both characters and stages being nothing else but simplistic, black and white pixel shapes with monochrome backgrounds, however, once booted up, the game starts to shine when the visual composition meets the soundtrack.Health Warningshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=709966760Health WarningBefore considering playing this title, please be aware of two things: The camera and the flickering lights. In World One – stage 12, Pope 2: Hyper–Pope, the screen shakes at the beginning of the level. As I died fairly often, I felt nauseous after a couple of tries because of that. I felt similar unrest in World Three – stage 3, I Blame Your Mother, wherein the camera suddenly tilts clockwise by 90° only to tilt back a couple of seconds later. Another potential concern might be seizures as bright, rapidly flickering lights are a leitmotif in every stage.GameplayWith that said, anyone who has ever played a classic 8-bit platformer, will quickly comprehend Electronic Super Joy’s mechanics, namely: Any enemy that touches the protagonist kills him and the only way he can defeat them is by stomping on their heads. Also akin to “ye olde games” are the controls; one button to jump (in some stages also used to double jump or to flap the arms to fly), a different one to stomp, and a third one to quickly respawn from the last checkpoint, in case things didn’t turn out the way they should. However, though this is all easy to understand, the gameplay itself requires both experience in the genre and patience to get through and were it not for the last button and the many checkpoints, I doubt I would have gotten as far as I did.As I am not too experienced with these types of hardcore platformers myself, it took me around seven hours to get through the 45 stages of the main campaign (Classic Electronic Super Joy) and so far, I’ve only beaten three of the 15 A Hot Sticky Mess DLC levels, none of the five bonus maps, nor any of the nine Micro Hell stages. During this playthrough, I never felt that any of the deaths were unfair, due to the controls being very well-balanced out and responsive, so that getting through was just a matter of trial and error and being observant. To spice things up a little bit though, in many stages the camera does not follow the protagonist, but instead scrolls by itself. That means that I frequently found myself in situations wherein I either had to react quickly or was required to stay in an enemy infested area for longer than I’d like to. Another noteworthy addition to the game were the occasional shoot ‘em up segments where players had to avoid an onslaught of projectiles while navigating the stage. But through all of it, I had a good time, which can be largely attributed to the rest of the titles presentation.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=708615337OverallWhat got me hooked on the game was its juvenile sense of humor. The main antagonists motivation, for example, is to steal everyone’s butts and whenever the character respawns at a checkpoint either a male or female voice roars “Oh Yeah” or “Oh Là Là” in a hilarious, yet highly sexual fashion that is sure to make you blush uncomfortably when you’re playing this in the living room while your family is over for a visit. But in case that these utterances are a bit too much or you just feel annoyed by them, they can easily be turned off in the options menu under “PG”. Fitting to the sexy “Oh Yeahs” and entire atmosphere, the stages are accompanied by a strong house and techno soundtrack. Many of the enemies are even in sync with the music, which makes beating them that much more enjoyable.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=709967156OptimizationElectronic Super Joy’s PC port does everything right. The button layout can be fully customized and the game features full keyboard as well as controller support and the menu can easily be navigated with a mouse. The game’s framerate is also unlocked by default and runs at around 230 frames per second (fps) with frequent drops to around 100 on my old toaster – an old, 32-bit desktop PC running on Windows Vista Home Premium, an Intel Core 2 CPU, an Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT, and 3070 MB RAM. However, even weaker models, like the Asus Aspire E1-410 laptop, can play the game without problems and framerate can be locked to 30 or 60 fps in the options menu.ConclusionIf you’re not prone to nausea or seizures and are a fan of difficult platformers, this game is definitely worth picking up. The music is great, there’s tons of achievements (I only have 3/37 for completing the main story) and great music. The game also features a speedrunning mode and a global leaderboard. So, core gamers can rejoice."

This entire journey is to find and defeat the one that took his butt. The story is really simple, and is told through quick dialog that's thrown out to you as you go through the level. It doesn't take itself seriously, it's very silly, and you'll get some laughs out of it.Gameplay is very addictive. It mostly involves around precision platforming, an endurance race outrunning the screen while dodging obstacles, or surviving an onslaught of missles which you need to get rid of. There are 5 worlds with 20 stages each, lasting any time from 10 seconds to a couple minutes; with the exception of World 4). It sounds short, but it's a hard game. A very hard game, later on. You need to bring your platforming A-Game if you want to survive the difficulty it brings.You can think of it as Super Meat Boy, but a little less extreme. As you can tell, this game would be ideal for platforming lovers and gamers who love a good challenge, and I'm both of those. Achievements further reward your skills with painful goals such as earning zero deaths on each level, or beating all the time trials. If you love challenge, and want to be tested, this is for you. For other game modes, there's Infinite Love Mode, where you try and go through as many microstages as you can in a row before you fail. There's also No Checkpoint Mode for the most hardcore players out there.The soundtrack is one of the highlights that everyone keeps talking about, and rightfully so. The game offers many tracks to keep your spirits high and your ears a lovely taste of music with each step. For most people, it's what keeps them going, and offers motivation to move on  to continually hear the amazing beats this game pulls out. I suggest you find the soundtrack when you can.Overall, Electronic Super Joy is a fantastic difficult platformer with stellar music and a hearty challenge that platforming enthusiasts would surely love, and achievement hunters will get a run for their money.8/10"

,Recommended,244870,8278087,"Posted: 25 December, 2013",all,Mykaterasu,"Electronic Super JoyVisuals:The game’s visuals are dynamic and wonderful to experience. It is apparent that every visual style done between levels has been manipulated to make every level dissimilar from each other. Therefore, traveling from level to level is never tedious and is instead always a pleasant surprise. Although the foreground is black, it is ripe with detail while backgrounds are bright and a great contrast to the monochrome foreground. Small things like the moving pieces in the background are a faultless addition and sync perfectly with the music. It’s not photorealistic, but for a game like this, it has no need to be.9/10 – Damn near close to perfect.Audio:I’m a musician myself. I know that it takes a certain level of self-control to be able to write multiple brilliantly catchy pieces without making them sound too similar to each other. EnV did a wonderful job here. To be honest - the ""electronic-only"" music isn’t really needed because through development it could have been any style (it’s most likely there because “Electronic” is in the title,duh) but it is well integrated, and fits nice and snug in an essential part of the game that is very hard to explain in words. It works, whether someone is crazy over electronic music or not. In terms of SFX; jumping, smashing, double jumping, those arrow or star thingies, and checkpoints are spot on. (Guys, wheredidyou get the SFX for the PG Checkpoints? Did yourecordthem?)10/10 – Perfectly Integrated.Plot:The Plot is ludicrous. Absolutely ludicrous. I was actually surprised to find one to be honest – a hardcore platformer really doesn’t need one. Long story short – your butt is stolen and you need to get it back “Taken” style. That's as developed as it gets, and I don’t want to go into ESJ’s anatomy to see how that’s possible and open up a ton of plotbuttholes on the way, so that’s all I’m saying. However random it is, and however unneeded it is, I have to rate it how bad it is. Sorry guys.3/10 – It’d be a 2 if it wasn’t random enough to be fairly amusing.Gameplay:Well guys, here we go. The skeleton of any platforming game is the gameplay. I am glad to report that controls are tight as they should be. Gameplay is fun too, to an extent that new players will find picking up the game a perfect challenge while older players will be able to still enjoy the 2 button controls (4 if you count quick re-spawn and restart). The difficulty curve has no real spikes, so the game paces itself very well. Level transitioning is fluent and instant, which can lead to some frustration, but all caused by the player. Even though there is some difficulty to them, some levels are actually enjoyable to play, not matter how hard they are, which is something that is very hard to accomplish. Simply put, you are always put into a situation where you die because it was you that did something wrong, not the game.8/10 – Very well done.Replay-ability:Ever since the invention of leaderboards, games have always existed to see who is better. Life’s a competition right? Electronic Super Joy has a brilliant leaderboard where checking individual levels, worlds or the total time is available. Apart from this, the game has very little replay-ability. There is the infinite love game-mode, and I’m sure that developers will add more game modes over-time, once you get the 25+ achievement then there is no more incentive to play. On top of that, it seems that the game is way too short for it’s own good.  That’s just a personal gripe though.6/10 – Fairly re-playable, but not for too long.Conclusion:In the end, Electronic super joy comes off as a very strong platformer, and it's my personal favourite for this year. I hope to grind more into this game getting to the top 10 (My OCD won’t allow #14 global rank) and I hope that everyone else that reads this hopes to join me. What a gem.Overall Score: 36/50     Personal Score: 44/50"
,Not Recommended,244870,21667796,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,winterpast,"Intro:Energetic electronica music, tight platforming, colorful backgrounds, and girls moaning at every checkpoint.What more could you want out of a platformer?I guess something that is interesting enough to hold your attention for more than an hour.Electronic Super Joy is your typical run-of-the-mill platforming game that has nothing unique going for it.When I initially played this game several years back, it was an absolute buggy mess. Fortunately, its come a long way. I no longer consider this a bad game, but I don't consider it a game that's anything more than mediocre.Gameplay:The platforming is very basic. Go from point A to B while jumping around. Your only ability is smashing downward which serves as your only means of defence. You can also jump up specific walls and bounce off of certain objects.It doesn't get much deeper than that. One thing that's a positive is the control is very tight. It feels a bit slow though. Imagine playing Super Meat Boy or Mario without ever using the run button. That's what this game always feels like, but I wouldn't say it hurts it since the levels are designed accordingly.Story, Visuals, & Music:There's no story, as usual with these kinds of games. The visuals are passable. The vibrant colors are nice, but one of the early levels is a seizure paradise. Its hard to explain, but when you see this level you'll be asking ""WTF"". It just makes me feel sick playing through that level.Apart from the graphic quality itself, the main character's sprites are.. the most uncreative design you could think of. Its as if they had a placeholder design for the protagonist and never changed it.The music, on the other hand, is great. There are some great tracks, but none of them are very memorable. I listened to one for quite a while on the menu and still couldn't remember it afterward.Also, the music doesn't properly loop. It fades out and then starts over. This is so damn unprofessional. Making looping OGG audio files is not difficult at all. Any average person can learn how to do it in minutes. There is no excuse for not having your music properly loop.The sounds are worth mentioning since every checkpoint and respawn you'll hear an almost porn-esque moan. The female ones are alright, but the male moans are some of the creepiest♥♥♥♥♥♥to come out of a game like this. No, you can't pick a specific gender only but I think you can turn them off altogether. Also, the audio levels for these moans are WAY higher than the rest of the game. Its as if the developer wants everyone in your household to think you're watching some rather energetic porn.Its a nice little touch at first, but as you get to more challenging levels and die more it'll start to feel a bit tasteless. Its just another gimmick added to try and make a barebones platformer stand out.PC Version:Much better than it was at launch. Didn't have any issues with my gamepad, performance, or graphical settings.One thing to mention here for content creators is that uploading gameplay/ streaming this game can be very iffy. The developer says you're free to monetize recordings of it and that there won't be copyright claims, but there's numerous reports for them everywhere. Apparently the artists of the music are striking down videos of the game.If this kind of thing matters to you, then don't even bother.Conclusion:Do I think people could like this game? Definitely.Do I think its a bad game? Not at all.The reason I don't recommend it is because this is one indie platformer out of THOUSANDS on Steam. There are SO many better options with so much more going for them. This game isn't terrible, its just insanely average.If you're a diehard platformer fan, you might enjoy it but you're so much better off putting your time into one of the many platforming titles out there.If you insist on playing this game, don't spend more than a dollar or two for it. I believe I paid around a dollar during a Steam sale. For that price, you might get a few hours of fun.For anything else, no way."

The controls are tight and responsive like other games in the genre.

Murder the pope, defeat the Groove Wizard, and shake your booty like the music won't stop in a refreshing challenge for veterans of the genre.Play it loud, the music makes the game. The well-composed tracks leave just enough room for the gameplay to assume the limelight, with the DLC worth the purchase for the soundtrack alone.Combined with the rapid respawn, the pulsating rhythms of the game give no time to recover and keep you playing through dozens (sometimes hundreds) of attempts to reach the next goal. Some of the stages pose a real challenge to even seasoned gamers, although checkpoints are abundant and the maps are relatively short. I was able to finish all stages in the main game and DLC in 25 hours of gameplay, with most completable within a few to ten minutes.Electronic Super Joy is afeelingthat delivers an immersive platformer experience to players who can get their groove on."

It starts off with a bit o' exposition to set the scene. The dramatis personae: a guy that can run and jump. His harrowing journey has taken him many places and taken much from him. Most importantly, he lost his butt to a Groove Wizard.  It's your job to guide him through his most worthy of quests: to avenge that badonka-donk.The first thing you'll notice is this game brings the colors and it brings the beats. The backgrounds are a deliciously seizurey array of colors, but they fall just short of being the eye-bliss that they were clearly intended to be. The music is electronic wub-wub ear joy that made me want to pull out some glowsticks and get felt up by the nearest European. Mix that together with the bleak, monochrome foregrounds and you get a sort of oppressive-but-fun atmosphere, like some kind of mandatory dance party in a dystopian police state. However, that's not the whole formula. Lastly, we need to add some love. Some definitely not PG-13 love. When you die or reach a checkpoint, you hear moans, ""oh yeah""s, some dude saying ""ohh la la"" and even some heavy breathing. Clearly, this game is intended for an audience that knows where babies come from.And believe you me, you'll have plenty of chances to hear your computer getting hot and heavy with some sound files because you're going to die. A lot. Unfortunately, the checkpoints are spaced too close together, robbing the game of the hardcore-ness that it seemed to be shooting for, instead leaving you with a series of bite-sized chunks of platforming to memorize and toss away. However, those bite-sized chunks happen to have a lot of variety, off-beat humor (the first boss is the Pope in a spaceship) and, well, fun. Of course, it can be made hardcore-er by trying for runs where you don't die or beat a time goal, but I never found myself interested enough to bother.Electronic Super Joy falls a little short of the bar set by other recent hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but pulls what it has together well enough to make it well worthwhile for any fan of platformers. What the game lacks in polish and length (sorry, no level editor) it makes up for in humor and general originality. At $8.00, it's definitelyworth picking up, even if it isn't on sale."

While the music was decent (the one gripe I have is that the background voices make sex noises and it's awkward explaining to people who hear it what is actually going on) my main problem is the mechanics.  The controls are crap.  Not the key bindings (the default ones suck but you can rebind them) but the actual platforming.  The only control you have over the character is timing.  To a certain point, platformers are pretty timing heavy mechanically but in Super Meat Boy and pretty much every other good platformer you have some way to increase your jump distance, either by running, or jumping off of a wall.  This game has no run button and so little control over the character's jumping that the gameplay boils down to clicking jump in the right pattern.  Instead of feeling punishing but fair, it feels unfair and like you'd be better off getting a bot to beat the game for you.  Imagine Dark Souls without a roll/dodge button.  It wouldn't be any fun because you don't have the precise control over the character that the enemy design requires.  That's how the levels in this game felt."

The humor is sharp and the music is awesome, and while there are many platformers that are ""challenging,"" Electronic Super Joy feels more like Super Meat Boy on LSD. Infinite checkpoints (complete with sexy moans and oh yeahs) make sure you're never too far off course, and the gameplay is tight and constantly changing. The final boss in particular is a nerve wracking experience in that I personally both loved and despised, for it took me far too many tries to finish even though I knew what I had to do.This game is not for the faint of heart, and there were plenty of areas that made me stop and take breaks after many frustrating failures. At the same time, the game is not strictly a barebones platformer. Many mechanics are implemented through out such as changing gravity and a constantly changing move set, but there are plenty of moments where ESJ becomes more like a bullet hell shooter, keeping the freshness around even after I felt I'd seen it all.It feels unfair to compare this Meat Boy, for the platforming has a very different feel than many games of the genre, nor is it as nearly precise, even though it demands it. This often led me to most of my frustrations as I found it harder and harder to play out what I was supposed to do, for the controls can be extremely touchy, even with a gamepad. There were plenty of moments where my palms were sweating less out of nerves than frustration, but these sections are not common and did not ruin my enjoyment.Plenty of modes are offered as well, including an endless runner that I enjoyed a bit more than I should've. There are also four bonus levels that you can unlock once you find all the collectable stars, but they pose a challenge that far exceeded my abilities, as I only managed to complete one of them. I got half way through the second before being driven insane by some of the obstacles, and the other two including I tried a few times before calling it quits. Completionists will enjoy the increased challenge, but for me the fun quickly waned.All in All, Electronic Super Joy is a fantastic but flawed game that far surpasses most games that come out of the indie scenes. Strikingly unique but with a familiar feel, this game will leave you with a lasting impression and a sense of accomplishment time and time again."

The game tries to provide some variety by occaisionally giving new abilities (ground pound, double jump, low gravity) or taking ones you've had for a while, but these changes are pretty short lived and don't really make you play too differently.The difficulty is your standard indie platformer difficulty. It's precise but not really hard due to instant and unlimited respawns. As always, the ""real"" challenge is probably speed running or no death running the stages in quick succession. My only real gripe with the difficulty is that rather than ramping up, it tends to stay constant throughout the game but with occaisonal random feeling difficulty spikes where the game suddenly demands pixel perfect precision out of nowhere. It can be a bit jarring.Also for a game with ""bite sized"" levels and challenges, it's pretty short, with only really 2 hours or so worth of stages.As for the aesthetic, I recommend turning on ""pg mode"", not because it isn't sfw, but rather because...well it's annoying. The humor here is probably more grating than any Team Meat game, which is saying something.If you're a big platformer buff it's probably serviceable, but coming to this game shortly after playing games like Volgarr The Viking, They Bleed Pixels, Mega Man Zx Advent, and Rogue Legacy, it felt solid but underwhelming."

This game follows the same idea, levels are super difficult, jumps require millisecond timing and you really need to know your jump button very well to know how long to press it.The soundtrack is just great, it has enough variety to prevent you noticing that after a while some songs are repeting. The soundtrack also tie in very well with the game. The are levels are very intense and fast, others that are slow, and the soundtrack matches very well.The levels itself are very creative. At first you may think you just go to the right, jump on platforms, smash enemies, but then in some levels you face low-gravity, upside down screen, slow-motion, double jump, flying, light and darkness, an so on.

76561197983662248,Recommended,244870,13901322,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews describing my reviewing ethos, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.Gameplay: Just to start out, I'd like to say that I'm not the greatest at platformers, but I do consider myself fairly competent  at them, considering that I got Golden God in Super Meat Boy after about 20 hours my first time through. As such, I wasn't too sure quite what to expect going into this game. I will say that this game is largely easier than what I expected, ranking in terms of difficulty around Light World Salt Factory to start and ending around Light Hell. There really wasn't too much of a difficulty curve, to be honest. However, I've also been one of those people who has been somewhat against the influx of ""masochistic platformers,"" 'cuz they're usually not all that fun. Does this game manage to break the trend? ...kinda.Platforming in ESJ is about as simple as it gets; you can move left and right and jump. There's no momentum to your run, and you can control the height of your jump. I will say that the game is much slower than what I expected (also maybe for a good reason, since the game doesn't handle fast scrolling all that well), which can throw you off for a bit. There's actually only three other gimmicks you get throughout the game: a slam attack that moves you straight down, allowing you to kill any enemies in your path, a double jump that you get for all of five levels and have arbitrarily taken away from you, and flight which you get for like the last three stages and that's it. There's also your standard fare of obstacles: lasers, portals, mid-air jumping arrows a-la Jumper, and a few others. The enemies are largely unimpressive and consist of enemies that either walk left to right, shoot a slow-moving projectile, or have a laser coming out of them. They're usually not a big deal at all to deal with, but the laser enemies do require a bit more precision to eliminate than they honestly should, considering that they're standard enemies. Boss fights are pretty much just about dodging projectiles and hitting the weak point.This all sounds like pretty standard fare, right? Well... you're right. There really isn't much else to this game. There's no trial-and-error gameplay and all levels can be beaten first try if you're good enough, but there just isn't much substance to the level design. It just feels like it's going through the motions that other games went through, of which, the short length of the game certainly does not help. I got very close to completing all the stages but stopped on 4-4 because it took a design page from I Wanna Be the Boshy's design (one that I certainly do not approve of), and even then, this game only took me about three and a half hours to beat. Even as a ""masochistic platformer,"" there really isn't much here. All the extra gameplay comes from either no-deathing or speedrunning the stages. Other than that, it's just... okay. $8 is about right as a price; it's about as long as an average movie and just as satisfying, which is to say as satisfying as peanut-flavored packing peanuts: maybe alright in your mouth for a few seconds, then you realize that it's just filler. 6/10.Story: Ehh, the humor is take it or leave it. You could fit all the dialogue in-game onto one page of a single-spaced Word document, so I'm not gonna bother rating it.Graphics: I'll just get the technical stuff out of the way; the game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without any hassle. As far as graphics settings, you really shouldn't need them. If you do, you should probably think about updating your system. As for the graphical style, it's alright I guess? Again, this is something of a take it or leave it thing. Levels usually only have two or three colors to them (excluding black for the stage and your character), but there's a lot going on in the background. I'd again refer you to my peanut-flavored packing peanut analogy as far as my opinions go on that matter. As for the pixel art, it's fine. Nothing impressive, though. There were a few moments where the background/foreground elements hid some parts of the stage, which is always frustrating to die to something you can't see because the level designer put too much stuff in the way. Again, this is just okay at best. Passable. Average. 2/5.Sound: Yes, they use porn star sound bytes for the checkpoints. Yes, it does get a bit annoying after a while, but I was able to drown it out. As for the music, it's loud screechy techno; if that's your thing, you'll like it. If you're like me, you'll get bored with the music and put on your own. There really isn't anything else to talk about here. 2/5.Overall scores are: 6/0/2/2; cumulative score of 5.0/10. I've opted to lean on the side of recommendation just because there *is* some fun to be had here; it's just that it becomes so painfully mundane after a while. Not terrible, but definitely a one-and-done game, which for something as short as this, may not be good value for your money."

This game is extremely hard and you need a lot of patience to play it. You will find yourself dieing a lot in this game which is very annoying, but quickly remedied by the many checkpoints in the game. This game follows the usual platforming formula that I have seen in so many others. Which is the trial and error formula. Basically, you will play a level die at an obstacle probably die again and again.... and probably again and finally start learning the pattern and finally beat the obstacle just to come to another extremely difficult obstacle. With this said it is incredibly rewarding when you finally beat a level especially the harder levels near the end of the game. The levels increase in difficulty as you go through the game like most platformers. With this said I found that the earlier levels were still extremely hard for me, but were much easier the second time I played through them. Although most of the bosses in the game were just plain out hard and at least for now are still hard for me even after playing them several times. Although that might just be an issue with my own skill level. You also obtained and losed different skills as you played the levels which kept the game interesting. With this said, this only happened the odd time so its only a minor positive point towards the game.Gameplay (negative)This isnt exactly a negative but it can be depending on who you ask. The level design I found to be very interesting and there was a good assortment of different obstacles for you to overcome. But I did notice that the game did recycle a lot of the same obstacles over and over again especially in the later levels. This didnt really bother me though because they usually changed the obstacle a bit to make it more difficult. Still people may get bored with this and I thought it should be mentioned. Also for people that do not have the patience to deal with the trial and error element of this game, then its best to not buy this game. Many times I wanted to throw my controller out the window and kick my TV screen out of anger and weirdly I still enjoyed the game. But someone with little patiences, well you might just destroy your TV. Also another issue I had with the game is although there were many check points at the start of the game, near the end, some levels had only a few checkpoints. This irritated me and really didnt increase the challenge for me. It was more of a nuisance then a challenge. If I fail I want to try the obstacle that I failed at again. Not be pushed back to do three or more obstacles that I have already done.Graphics and soundThe graphics were simple but colourful, and went well with the music. The music was amazing and really motivated you to keep playing the game even after you have died for the 20th time on a run.ReplayabilityThe game can be beaten within around 10-15 hours if not less so its not a huge game, but good luck trying to get all the achievements. So replayability really depends on your patience level and stubborness. After you beat the game do you really want to get some of the timed achievements, or beat the levels without losing any lives? If  you do, then the game has a lot more replay value to you.There also a another game mode called infinite love mode which allows you to play several levels in a random order that get progressively hard each time you complete one. Once you die you start at zero again and have to try to beat your high score. There are achievements based on how many levels you can complete in one run so you can play this game mode for a long time if  you want."

Every challenge in this game is about extreme precision jumping and timing, and slipping up even the slightest means you're back at the checkpoint.  It's incredibly frustrating that there's no room for adjustment or freedom between each of your jumps, and the resulting level design is like a gauntlet that tests your patience like a game of Operation.  There's a distinct lack of reward when beating a level besides continuing the tedious routine the next level.Plus, the physics are the most unintuitive I've ever felt in a platformer; your jump speed is faster than your move speed, and it just draws such a huge disconnect for me, I can barely tell whether or not I'll make the jump and I often overcompensate a jump.  When double jump was introduced, it was a brief breath of fresh air that I'm actually given a bit of breathing room.Aesthetics are pleasing and play an interesting role, but that's all I'll say in its favor.  Save your steam money for Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV, which have actual interesting level design (at least the latter in my experience)."

You go the way the you want to, and you always feel like it's your fault and not the controls in the countless deaths you will encounter. It's very easy to know where your character stands out, and the controls allow for no mistakes on your end.This brings me to the point that this is also the hardest platformer I've ever played, probably even the hardest game I've ever played. Your jumps need to be timed perfectly, your attack smashes need to be right on your enemies, and you need to dodge the countless amounts of projectiles on your screen at once. If you make a single mistake, it will most definitely result in your death.It's very unique in many ways. the main reason is that this game has most convoluted batshit confusing hilarious story ever. I have no idea what is going on the whole time. It's something about you losing an arm and on your quest to find your butt. There are also random ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic sounds in the game for some reason. Secondly, this game has an art style that you don't see in many games. The background is a single color with strobe lights going around the screen and everything else is black and white except for the lights, which can be any color. It's art style is very calming.The music score in this game really puts up the epic mood. The electronic music is very intense and gives you a feel of  badassery in what you are doing in game. There is also quite a bit of variation in it. It's just hard to find it when you repeat the same section of a game multiple times.The level design is pin-point perfect, the jumps are spaced out perfectly, the obstacles you have to go past are put in the exactly right position, so patience and preciseness are key in game. There are certain parts in a level that will speed you up and let you go past larger obstacles, and there are certain parts that let you fly and grab keys out of the air. Fantastic.Electronic super joy is one of the best games I've ever played, it's unique, fun, varied, challenging, and overall a masterpiece of a game.10/10"

Less Super Meatboy and more The Impossible Game, which is that flash/Xbox360 Arcade game where you are a cube that is automoving across the level and have to make a series of increasingly difficult jumps across floating platforms of varying sizes, and some spikes. ESJ doesn't automove but the levels do autoscroll, and it is solely based on making a series of increasingly difficult jumps across floating platforms, and some spikes. Sluggish and imprecise movement makes dealing with the autoscroll that much more annoying, plus all the traps are less tricky exercises in manipulating your movement (ala Meatboy, or meshoff's Punishment 2: The Punishing) than they are transparently hosspucky gotchas that prey upon the game's bad controls and autoscrolling. Mind you, they aren't witty gotchas in the vein of I Wanna Be the Guy or Eryi's Action. Rather, the level design is simply tedious in how desperate it is to bust one's spheres about jumping on slim platforms.Also the graphics are nowhere near as flashy as one might assume, and the game plays a sample of someone moaning extremely loudly every time you die. There's a lot of dying in this, so this plays every few seconds. You can turn it off (""PG mode,"" as if I weren't the type to be jerking off to some nasty-as-hell porn up on this internet, 24/7), but I bring it up because it is indicative of the level of thought that went into the thing.

When it says it's brutally hard, it's not kidding. Everything about the game is out to kill the player over and over again - the camera panning especially. It races across the level leaving you desperate to keep up, and then, as soon as clouds of missiles are being fired, slows to a snail's pace. Checkpoints are often few and far between, with convoluted strings of blocks, lasers, hungry monsters and almost impossible jumps keeping the player repeating the same segment of a level for several minutes.That said, if I keep the game's purpose in mind it's easy to see that it succeeds. The difficulty is as advertised, of course, the music is nice and there's something really addicting about the game in general. It frustrates me to no end, but I have fun regardless, and when I do quit it's more out of tiredness and a sense of ""I should really go do something else"" than out of pure rage. However, I think if I hadn't caught it for seventy-nine cents during a flash sale I would be disappointed... because at the end of the day it IS that hard and the flashing lights ARE that headache-inducing. I can't post this review with a big fat thumbs up on it, but I do recommend it to anyone who happens to be into platformers and likes a real challenge.Also, there's a 'PG Mode' in the options menu that can be turned on when the player tires of the... oddly emphatic... checkpoint voices or the odd swear."

It's so cute and I love the pixel art and the music is freaking awesome. But sadly I would recomend this game to almost nobody. Do not be fooled by this game. It does not care about you. It is not your friend. It wants you to burn in hell to an awesome sound track. I gave up in under an hour because this game is so insanely infuriating. It demands an ungodly amount of percision from the player and the contolles can't deliver. So much that I would narrowly miss a platform 5 inches from the goal that took me five minutes to get to then I'd just have to try again from the check point. In my opinion, for a game this difficult, there should be more checkpoints. At least for the beginning story line and have alternate levels that are more difficult. Then you could slowely get better through the main story and enjoy the more difficult challenge later on. There is no difficulty curve in this game. It starts at ♥♥♥♥ you difficulty and seems to just continue with ♥♥♥♥ you through all the levels. Also I had multiple times I died and didn't know why. It could be I missed something because the screen is so hectic but I actually really like the way it looks. Also I had a weird glitch that the music just broke and didn't play the way it was supposed to. I really want to like this game. But it is to teeth grindingly, butt clenchingly, self mutalatingly difficult that I can't even play it without wanting to physically harm myself and the evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that made this game (side note I don't hate the developers I really like this idea but it could have been so much more beginner friendly and difficult later on. That would've been brilliant and then I'd totally love this game). The platforms seem too inconsistantly distanced and there is only one jump hight, (you can't tap for small hops or hold for longer leaps) it just made the game really unplayable and I really pushed myself to continue but after the missles were introduced and i got killed by a chain for no reason I quit, tried the other modes, then rage quit the whole game. I'm getting a refund. I can only recomend this game to people who absolutely love having their testicles smashed with a tire iron because you're already crazy so this game shouldn't be too hard on you. If you want a platform game with fun music there are others a lot better then this. Electronic Super Joy is the extreme opposite of anything even near the feeling of joy.

Do you have an odd sense of humor that involves evil Groove Wizards stealing butts? If so, then this game is for you!In Electronic Super Joy, you play as a nameless protagonist who's a serious badass. Even though you lost an arm in the Disco Wars of 1515, the War of Rock 'n Roll claimed your eye, and defeating DJ Deadly Skillz cost you both legs, you jump and smash your way through 4 rediculously difficult worlds on a fantastic adventure to recover your most prized possession: your own♥♥♥♥♥ If that's not enough, there's a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack that's not just there for background music, it's the driving force that keeps you going throughout this pixelated, adrealine-rushed, rave-fueled (and sometimes seizure-inducing) adventure.When I said this game was hard, I'm not kidding. Just when you think you've mastered everything about this game, it throws a wrench into the gears and slaps you in the face with some new mechanic that'll force you to adapt and change your playing pattern. The difficulty seems to pay homage to many difficult platformers from the past, such as Contra and the NES version of Ninja Gaiden.The graphics, although not important to the overall game, cast all the characters and landscape in shadow, while the background is alive and animated. Sometimes I seem to get lost in its beauty.The controls, gamepad or keyboard, are perfect and well-responsive. When you ♥♥♥♥ up in this game, it's usually your fault, and you know that.Another large part of the game is its humor. Checkpoints emit sexual moans and groans that will likely catch players off guard at first, but after a while, they'll seem fitting in this world full of bright colors and awesome music. Foul-mouthed characters adorn the landscape, such as the insanity-stricken Pope who threatens to shoot you down in his flying Popemobile.The only downside I can find with this game is that the smashing attack is a little too accurate. Often times I find myself dying from missiles I clearly smashed beforehand, and this lead to many frustrating moments.All in all, Electronic Super Joy is an original, artistic platformer that'll keep you entertained for hours. Now go and get your booty back from an Evil Groove Wizard!"

Despite unashamedly being a Super Meat Boy rip-off (you can tell that from the title!), the game is well-made. The best example of its polish is the collision detection, which is very precise and required for this type of platformer. The frequent checkpoints, varied levels and colourful backgrounds help keep rage quits to a minimum.Two slight gripes which may put people off. Firstly, I am playing this on a mac. The first time I loaded the game it froze at the title screen. To address this problem, I had to run the game in development mode. After changing this setting, the game worked flawlessly, including access to steam achievements.The second gripe will be a deal breaker for some: the electronic/dubstep soundtrack. If you cannot tolerate this type of music, you should avoid this game. Every level has a thumping electronic soundtrack in the background which I imagine would be extremely offputting if you don't like that type of music. However, I found it ok and often at times found myself enjoying it.A must buy at $0.79. And otherwise recommended!"

The music, the visuals, the story, and the gameplay all make you feel confused. The soundtrack is the best part of the game hands down. I never liked electronic music, but I love this soundtrack. The visuals are very primitive, but the backgrounds are incredible. In gameplay sometimes it is hard to tell what something is because the graphics are limitted, but you better get used to dieing because that won't be the only reason. It is BRUTALLY hard!! Think Super Meat boy meats Super  Hexagon. The controls are very random with tightness because the levels have different gravity. The story is simple, funny, random, and completely offensive.

You ARE going to get a seizure....but you are still going to have a good time. This game is another one of them ""Rage games"" You will rage....but you are going to be freaking rocking the hell out to the kick♥♥♥♥♥Music. The controls are slightly slippery, The Checkpoints are slightly far from each other but this game is less of a rage game more than a trial and error game, So it's not technically a ""Rage game"" Because every fault that happens is YOUR Fault. The difference between a rage game and this kind of game is that rage games are highly unfair and every single death is not your fault, it's because the game is trying to get under your skin, it was specifically designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. THIS game however does not qualify itself to be titled a ""Rage game"" As every single ""Death"" or fault that happens to you is your fault. The game isn't unfair, or trying to kill you and give you a heart attack it is fair, although very very hard, even at the beginning. The main problem is that the movement keys are only SLIGHTLY delayed, you press the right move key for a brief second, there is soem delay before he Stops. Now, for the positives, this game is Freaking awesome, It has very slight yet very noticable crude comedy, nothing like south park bad, but the innuendo is there, (Love the checkpoints, give me all the checkpoints! X3 ) The levels are slightly simple yet very challenging and never boring. The greatest thing about this game is it's soundtrack, Holy, freaking, Hell, this soundtrack. This music is seriously all you need to have a good time, the music make you literally want to get off your Non-existant butt (In-game joke) and start shaking what you don't have. Get out your glow sticks boys, this is going to be one hell of a part-ay. If you like kick♥♥♥♥♥music, a difficult challenge, and platforming games, this is the game for you."

My problem comes from the level design. If they wanted to put this in an arcade that would continuously make money, it'd be fine. Unfortunately it's not, so we have different standards. I found the level design to be utter crap more suited for paid structure. I struggle to complete levels and that isn't inherently bad. It's bad because many deaths, I feel, are not my fault. There are, of course, some that are mine. Don't get me wrong. When the level is well made, it's well made. There's also the problem of difficulty progression. It's not gradual. It's not even dynamic based on player skill. It's just all over the place. I understand that when you're the creator, it's difficult to distinguish between difficulty levels since you know all the ins and outs, but this is extremely poorly plotted out. It's not Super Meat Boy difficulty. It's Ninja Gaiden NES difficulty."

Here's an example: a level contains wings, that when you pick them up grant you ability to fly, however, no one has told you that flight is limited, and if you don't fly through that huge chasm efficiently enough, they will suddenly stop working, making you fall down and think there's a bug. Also, movement IMO feels much less fluid than in SMB, and it becomes very counterintuitive on levels that contain ice, sticky walls and/or double jumps. Especially ice. Little things like that result in very challenging but very unrewarding experience, unlike the masterpieces of the genre that are Super Meat Boy and N.(I don't hate this game though, my review is negative because too many reviews are positive)"

I've kind of been jonesing for a Pope to murder since the last guy and the new one is still not quite ripe enough for a fresh murdering yet so this'll do in the meantime. It's kind of like what I said regarding Receiver. It's fun and satisfying and all but really it just makes you want to murder a real Pope.Now, I'm really loving this game so far and the soundtrack just kicks all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥and you can tell it does from the very first screen of the game. It's one of several ways that it's quite possibly even better than Super Meat Boy.I'll wait for you to stop gasping for a moment. Okay, so let me expand on that since I know what I just said is heresy (hehe, see what I did there). Even though I love SMB and always will, ESJ has been compared to it often and from my personal experience thus far the comparison is favorable. SMB has its own share of kick♥♥♥♥♥tracks to be sure but this game ispackedwith them. So much so that it's one of the few soundtracks I'm actually considering buying on Steam next to Rebirth's.The gameplay is what it looks like, side scrolling platforming. Except it seems to have more variety by default than SMB by virtue of having an attack and enemies that can be killed. At one point it even turns into a bullet hell shooter for a little while. With suitably epic music and visuals. It's also pretty goddamn difficult. Especially when the missiles start clustering up.Now before I comment on the aesthetic let me just say I'm getting just as tired of the monochromatic foreground/background thing that started infesting the place once Limbo was discovered as much as the next guy. But here it's done better than the screenshots are giving it credit for. The foreground and background scenery are animate and colorful and even have this lil' beat to the music going on. With all the visual noise that can start you'll be thankful that the interactive foreground and character is always one predictable color. It's not like that ""we decided to be lazy and call it minimalism"" crap. It actually has its own style."

Every challenge in this game is about extreme precision jumping and timing, and slipping up even the slightest means you're back at the checkpoint.  It's incredibly frustrating that there's no room for adjustment or freedom between each of your jumps, and the resulting level design is like a gauntlet that tests your patience like a game of Operation.  There's a distinct lack of reward when beating a level besides continuing the tedious routine the next level.Plus, the physics are the most unintuitive I've ever felt in a platformer; your jump speed is faster than your move speed, and it just draws such a huge disconnect for me, I can barely tell whether or not I'll make the jump and I often overcompensate a jump.  When double jump was introduced, it was a brief breath of fresh air that I'm actually given a bit of breathing room.Aesthetics are pleasing and play an interesting role, but that's all I'll say in its favor.  Save your steam money for Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV, which have actual interesting level design (at least the latter in my experience)."

Music is good but the platforming is inconsistent.For one it feels like they developer did a poor job of accounting for ceilings, often times I would jump off a platform only to bump into a low-hanging ceiling above me to lead to an untimely death. After awhile it just got annoying and felt less like my own fault and more like they really could have stood to design it just a little less frustratingly.For another, the game lacks really anything special about it. The visuals are pretty bare bones, gameplay lacks much in the way of diversity in the levels, and your abilities are pretty weak. The stomp is interesting, it lets you slam downwards into the ground to attack or stop momentum, but it quickly loses its uniqueness. You get a double jump for the second world, but then lose it after, which is kind of lame because it misses out on potential it could have had with both abilities.It feels like there should have been more to this game that just wasn't.Music is amazing though.

,Not Recommended,244870,31880848,Posted: 21 May,all,Poppers,"Electronic Super Joy, although having quite a delightful name, isn't much fun (in my opinion, of course).I'll start with one thing first: I haven't finished the game; I haven't even finished the first world. But the fact that I haven't just proves further that I really couldn't stand this game. From what I played, the main obstacles are the missiles: they home in on you and kill you in one hit, sending you back to the last checkpoint. However, the very nature of these missiles is what makes the game so frustrating.Missiles home in on you: what's the problem? The problem is that the unpredictable nature of these hazards is contradictory to the main reason I enjoy platformers. Something that I enjoy in platformers (and mostly take for granted) is the fact that when I put in a set of inputs, I always get the same results. But the missiles' parameters change so easily that I really don't have room to improve because I don't know what I did wrong. The World 1 boss is a testament to the frustration that stems from missiles.*I'm about to drop minor spoilers for the World 1 boss' gameplay, BTW*The whole boss is about grabbing Rainbow Missiles, which make a secondary character fire them at the boss. There's a lot of things that urk me about this boss. Firstly, the unpredictable nature of the missiles, as previously stated, are really annoying, and they're all over this boss. Basically every 30 seconds, the boss spawns 3 more missiles (except when he doesn't), which never go away, and you have to avoid them on an incredibly small platform.Secondly, as I just hinted at, the boss itself adds even more unpredictable attacks. Extra things that make the boss more rage-inducing include the random placement of Rainbow Missiles, the randomisation of the attacks, and the aforementioned weird movement of the regular missiles.Third, the death animation is SO long. It takes anywhere from 2-3 seconds (from my experience), which doesn't sound like much, but over the course of 100+ deaths, that makes about 6 minutes or more of just waiting for the game to let you play again. I found you could press the restart button as the animation was playing to skip it, but it's a motion that grated on me after a while, and sometimes I would restart because I thought I died, but then I realise I wouldn't have died, which caused even more frustration.Finally, the boss gives you no kind of telegraph. I'm sure that my character's position, time, etc. would influence the way in which certain behaviours would appear, but their methods were so convoluted that it just felt random to me. I can say that in something like Super Meat Boy (quite cliche that I bring it up), the bosses have predictable, telegraphed attacks, and even if you do die (which is quite easy), the boss in question behaves exactly the same way when you fight them for the second, or fourth, or hundredth, or thousandth time. The key difference is that in Super Meat Boy, with each death I feel like I'm learning something that I can apply on the next attempt, which is sadly not the case for this game.That's not to say that Electronic Super Joy isn't without it's qualities: the game is quite pretty, and the plot, although simple enough, is a good motive for the actual game. However, I don't think that these can outweigh the negatives. Some people could tell me that this game gets better later on, and I would totally believe them. The problem with that though is the game has not engaged me enough to make me want to spend my time on getting to the 'fun' part. Overall, this game isn't awful: not even close. But personally, I couldn't put up with it's flaws, and I'm going to have to give it a pass....until the inevitable point where I'll need to complete every Steam game in my collection, and then I guess I'll have to get it over with."

The game very quickly turns from ""A is to jump!"" into precision double jumping, auto-scroll and timing reliant sections. Outside of gameplay, the design and colour scheme is epilepsy inducing but genuinely fascinating and extremely well executed despite the limited palette. The music is not great; it's the type of dance music that is only remotely tolerable when you're dancing in a basement nightclub at 4am on MDMA.Super Meat Boy still remains the ultimate platformer for players of all skill levels, but if you made it through the entirety of that game and are clamoring for more then this game may be up your alley.

,Not Recommended,244870,19383275,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,spice,"Short version at the bottom.Based on my playtime you can probably tell I did not finish the game. I beat the first boss, and the level where I stopped playing was one with a lot of moving lasers that are blocked by walls. The reason I quit wasn't because I got frustrated, but because I was just getting sick of the game.I was hoping for a game that was extremely difficult but still a lot of fun, but it wasn't all that hard, at least from what I played. There were only two parts that gave me trouble.One was the first boss fight, since it had very heavy RNG. You have to collect randomly spawning power ups while dodging projectiles, and often the power-up will spawn in a bad place. If the powerups spawned predictably you could memorize where they would come up next, but it's randomly chosen between 4 different spots. The other problem with this fight is that there is a pit in the ground that is exactly as wide as your character. Sometimes you can walk over it, sometimes you will fall in if you try. It depends on if the physics like you.The other was a very frustrating level where all your abilities are taken away. That's not the annoying part though; what makes it difficult is the enemy placements, which are placed such that you have to move away from the exit, back towards the start of the level, to avoid dying. It's weird.Not only that, but it's a lot more fun to play the game as fast as possible, and try to go for good times- but almost every level is an auto-scroller! And if you get too quick and go off the edge of the screen, you die! This is a HUGE problem in the aforementioned level; it would be extremely easy if you could just run to the end, but you need to wait for the screen to slowly move to the exit while more enemies keep spawning.I found the humor really weird... I didn't think it was funny, just strange and random. The first boss is the Pope, for example. Also, every time you touch a checkpoint (this includes when you respawn) there's a sexual moan. I think some people would find it funny, but it wasn't for me. The randomness also leaks into the plot; in other words, the plot is just random crazy junk happening.The music was absolutely awesome, though, just as advertised, and the flashy lights and general art style fit together great. I really liked it when the stage would rotate a bit, making you tilt your head in order to play. It was a nice touch.Short version:Pros:-Awesome music-Great art-Game is fun at timesCons:-Game is mostly too easy, but has huge difficulty spikes-Humor doesn't really work (for me)-Nonsense plotI would recommend this game if you laugh at the trailer and you want something that's harder than Mario but easier than I Wanna Be The Guy or They Bleed Pixels. It's not a bad game at all, but it wasn't my thing."

I played many hard games in my life like super meat boy, so i know what is fair or cheap.  And this game, this****ing game is hard is so many wrong ways, but first, let me explain the positives.The story made me LOL!  The Grove Wizard stole your butt, so you have to get it back.  Everyone knows that without your butt, you can never twerk nor poop!  The other thing i like is the music.  It always makes you dance (if you don't have everything trying to kill you at once) and the levels have so much eye candy!  Even the bosses have really cool concpts.  The first boss you fight is a pope!  There are even 2 DLC packs with the first one being free!  The stars and getting the gold medels add replay value.  Now to talk about the negatives.Have you ever had a day where you get punished for doing the right thing or so many things going wrong?  That is this game in a nutshell!  At first in world one, it is fun.  There was some hazards that really want you dead, but it is fair.  But then when you reach world 2, it will show it's ulgy face.  For one, you don't truly feel like your in control.  You can never feel how fast you move or how high you can jump.  Then there is the♥♥♥♥♥♥enemy placements that gets in your way at the worst possible time!  Too many times, i felt like nothing hit me at all due to the hitbox being bigger then it looks!!  90% of all stages are autoscrolling levels, which is even more then Super Mario bros. 3's levels and worse, cause if you even stop for one second, the back of the screen kills you and no, it does not push you, i ment that it is an insta-kill!  Also, about the bosses with their cool concepts, their fights are nothing special.  Just survive, get chased, hit their weak spots a few times, etc.  And about the stars, some of them are easy, while others are put in the most evil spots i had ever seen, like to the point of requiring dumb luck just to get them!  But you have to collect them all or you can't unlock world 4!  And world 4 has 5 stages, but it is also where all the problems i suffered from merges into one big mess!  From indestruble homing missles to fast auto-scrolling, to♥♥♥♥♥♥poor enemy placement to the controls not working with the level desgin to a BS boss fight at the end, world 4 is one of the worst levels i ever went through!  This game is also really short if you are decent at this game like me.As a result, Electronic Super Joy made me laugh at points and had amazing music, but falls falt to cheap difficultity, evil star placment, a short length, and more.  This may be my opinion and i know that some people will not agree with me,  But i don't recommend tis game.  Just go play another hard game and if you want to find something that is hard but fair, go fight the final boss of the genocide run in Undertale."

Yet satisfyingly stimulating and enjoyable to play with its charming music and challenging platforming. 6/10.The Good: The controls feel nice and fluent. The gameplay changes futher as you go. Has potential replayability to those who want shorter goal times, no deaths, or to 100% accomplish the game. What makes this game stick out is the up beat music.The Bad: The game is short and can be beaten in an estemated hour. The game is not recommended for anyone who has epilepsy for its seizure enducing backgrounds and if you stare at them for too long, they could make you feel sick.There's no big story to this game. All you're given about the story is getting revenge for your butt...I'm serious on that one. The game starts off easy with its simple platforming. As it then starts to get harder and harder, sometimes there are difficulty spikes to some areas. Not to mention being chased down by a lot of missles that home into you. The game causes you to multitask to avoid every obsticle it throws at you. At some points of the game, it changes the rules and makes things a lot harder to progress. Making you want to tear your hair out from repeatedly dying in this trail and error game. But as you keep going, you start to get good at it. Taking the right timing and accuracy, you can continue the game to it's short lived end. There are also bonus levels you can unlock in the game if you replay the levels to unlock those levels. And when you're replaying them, you can also enjoy listening to the music of this game. I personally would recommend buying the game's music, than the game itself. Cause that's the game's strongpoint to itself. Just makes you want to rave.X3"

While the music is quite nice, the art-style is extremely cluttered and many visual effects are extremely unpolished.The gameplay itself is described as ""The Unholy merging of Super Meat Boy & Super Hexagon!"" and unholy it is. If anything it combines bad aspects of the two games, the ridiculous lack of vision in some areas is reminiscent of the very progressed sections of Super Hexagon and the only similarity it has with Super Meat Boy is a lack of punishment for death(a good feature, don't get me wrong) and the fact that it's a difficult platformer.There was nothing that compelled me to continue playing this game past the level shown in the 5th screenshot on the Steam Page [http://i.imgur.com/4lkvh1q.jpg].I would not recommend this game for it's regular price, for $2 maybe.But ahead of games like I Wanna Be The Guy and Super Meat Boy?

I often caught myself being too slow, getting caught in the music. Thank God for checkpoints!Electronic Super Joy is a blast to play, but there is the occasional ledge or wall that is difficult to scale and makes the game's flow stutter. These points will make you rage, but when you vault the wall and find a way to get past a missile, the game is very forgiving. One thing that I would take out would be the checkpoint noises, they don't feel right in this game.I picked this game up on sale for just $2, and it was well worth it.

Even though the game only took a few hours to complete, I don't think I could recommend it even at the price I paid - there are just better games out there for your time.On the plus side, the game is visually appealing, and sometimes there are clever elements that alter the level in sync with the techno music. They show almost all of those clever moments in the trailer.Beyond that, the game just feels generic. The platforming is sluggish, occasionally demanding pixel-perfect precision to make a long jump or two - hardly the 'hardcore' experience it's been touted as in other reviews. The complete lack of momentum doesn't help things along, and the level design, while varied, doesn't tread any new ground.On the sound design, the music is bland techno that starts off promising, but if you listen to the trailer you've pretty much heard it all. Also, it sounds like every checkpoint ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, so that's a thing.That leaves the game with its humor, which induced the occasional smile but mostly fell flat. The pope gets CROSS. The evil wizard stole your BUTT, and you want revenge... FOR YOUR BUTT! Cute, but nothing special.If you want to spend a few hours on a generic platfomer, save yourself a few bucks and go find something on Newgrounds - there are flash games out there with platforming and humor equal to or exceeding this, and those ones are free."

,Recommended,244870,8787780,"Posted: 20 January, 2014",all,RiotBricker,"What to Expect--------Genre: Precision Platformer with checkpoints throughout the levels (you'll die a lot)Standard Mode: consists of 4 worlds each with 15 levelsGimmick: Changes throughout, it would seem you'll get a new ability to be replaced in each world. Fairly standard platformer gameplay.Compare: Super Meat Boy difficulty and platforming with longer level design and checkpoints as in games like They Bleed PixelsMisc: PG option available in the game menu (turns off the semi-pornographic 'OH YEAH' that accompanies each character respawn, and possibly a few jokes throughout. I recommend this option as it removes some of the more obnoxious aspects of the game) and possible secondary game modes (I only saw one, but there's an option on the menu for it).--------Impressions and Review--------In many ways Electronic Super Joy is the poor man's ultra-tough PC platformer. With about 3 hours of play time (all I could really bear in one go) I can honestly say that this game will give you all of the frustration of the most difficult platforming games you've played with a fraction of the enjoyment.-What's Good?Visually ESJ is a fantastic and engrossing dance-party themed game with bold coloring that is fitting of the music and the hurried pace the game requires. As long as you're not prone to seizures or vertigo (the game actually warns of this, however it's unclear if the warning is serious) you're likely to enjoy the flashy art style which only serves to enhance the game experience. The music, as one might expect is of the electronic, techno variety and, while obnoxious in many settings is quite fitting as background for a game like ESJ.While you may not need, want or expect much story for this kind of game there is a little background given in the beginning as to why you're setting off on the adventure Spoiler alert: It's to avenge your butt which was seemingly captured and/or obliterated by an evil wizard. The humor and off colored jokes are lighthearted and probably somewhat offensive, but I found myself frequently laughing at off-color puns and surprising vulgarities.-Why you probably won't like itUnfortunately this game shines everywhere that a gamer could forgive mistakes and really phones it in on the all important aspect of gameplay. With many of the games ESJ shares a genre with the promise of a job well done vastly outweighs the ultra-frustrating moments of the game, this isn't the case here.Precision goes out the window fairly quickly and responsiveness leaves something to be desired. The feeling of close-calls with projectiles and enemy run-ins all but goes out the window as the kill radius of most enemies is far beyond their sprites. The millions of rockets that will inevitably hunt down the game's protagonist tend to kill when they come withing the range of close enough. While given the ability to destroy anything that can kill you the move (ground-slam) most often ends up getting you killed as you become instantly vulnerable to incoming attack without the ability to instantly jump or dodge out of the way.While these issues may seem minor, their presence in-game is so ubiquitous that this game is less an ""Electronic Super Joy"" to play than it is an ""Electronic Super Migraine."" Finishing a level is not so much rewarding as it is a relief that you don't have to play it more. Most unfortunately you are left feeling lucky that the game finally let you win than feeling that you were able to skillfully evade and triumph over a tough enemy or scenarioAmendment: After a few complaints that my critiques of the ESJ's hit detection and responsiveness were flat-out incorrect I gave the game another go on an entirely different rig and I have to say that I was somewhat surprised to find a noticeable difference in control response and a major reduction in deaths and bad jumps caused by the game (I still died a lot but many more of the deaths felt fair). After reviewing the video settings there's little adjustment that can be made on the player's end save limiting frame-rate (an action that on further exacerbates my earlier complaints).While the gameplay experience was vastly better the issues I previously held with the game persist, although to a lesser degree. I was able to run from start to the end of world 1 in about 1/4 of the time it took last time, however issues such as instant vulnerability, input responsiveness and other quirks that I didn't address earlier (the game tends to pigeon-hole play to a single correct way to perform tasks, quick respawining requires a button press rather than being automatic, among other small gripes) still drag the total experience down.All in all I will be giving this game a more favorable rating with the caveat that it likes your system (I'm unsure of what the determining factor is in this).--------Final Thoughts/TL;DR--------With just a little more work ESJ's developer could have had a fantastic game worth playing multiple times, however with sloppy hit detection/kill ranges, occasionally frustrating platforming aspects and responsiveness that is just not quite up-to-snuff the game is a bitter disappointment that throws the precision of the ""Precision Platformer"" genre in the toilet; especially since the game makes you want to like it so much.Be Warned: if you buy this game it's entirely likely that you won't be able to stop playing, which will cause you to hate yourself a little when you realize that you've been yelling 'it's not fair!' like a petulant child (even though you're right;ESJ is NOT fair.-6.5/10-8/10- It seems that ESJ seems to prefer some systems over others, after playing on another machine and having a much better play experience I've raised my rating and recommended it on Steam.

Now, im really into electronic dance music so i can tell you if you're an edm fan then you find the soundtrack to be great! This is the kind of music you'd hear in a rave, except it kinda sounds digital-y to fit the style of the game. It suites the game and it sounds great. Infact, id go as far as saying that the soundtrack is the best thing about this game. I bought the dlc pack just so i could get my hands on the soundtrack.Anyway, as far the as the game itself goes, it is interesting. I expected your typical 8-bit game storyline but this one is just crazy mad fun. The level backgrounds and trees pump in a subwoofer manner with the music and it is just a visual-and-audio gasm.Like conventional edm, this game is hardcore. The levels are mad difficult and it is quite possibly the hardest of indie games ive ever came across. Which is good, because i like hard games (if you're the type of person who picks ""easy"" difficulties in most games and likes it easy, then this might do nothing but frustrate you).8.5/10"

Another thing that caught me off guard was the humor. I personally love the type of humor it uses.

The controls are not tight enough for how fiddly the jumps are, the sound effects seem distracting and mildly out of place.  The music is pretty decent, I'd go so far as to call it good -- but I don't think it's good enough to carry the game.  The visuals are flashy and visually distracting in a way that makes it occasionally difficult to tell what's going on, which makes it very hard to build up the kind of rhythm that's necessary to make trial-and-error platformers fun.  Similarly, dying animations are too long and slow for how often you'll see them.  It makes dying repeatedly punishing (emphasis on the fact you died), rather than rewarding (emphasis on how far you got before it happened).The controls just feel bad to me, in a way that makes me wonder if it was designed for use with a console controller.  Maybe that would make a difference.All in all, I've played much worse games, but I've also played better.  I will probably not revisit the game."

I don't particularly enjoy indie platformers that claim to be ""hard"". I find they usually just end up frustrating without being fun.I was pleasantly surprised.Right off the bat I found the art style very well done. The whole pixelized art style is being done to death these days, but ESJ manages to pull it off surprisingly well. Despite the overly vibrant background effects, the game world remains legible; whenever you die, you don't feel like you did so because the game was hiding the fatal element.There are a variety of platforming challenges, so the game remains fresh throughout. ESJ has a interesting mechanic used to take down enemies. To do so you use the typical ground slam, but with a little twist that allows the mechanic to add to the gameplay in more ways than one. Instead of simply hitting the ground, you essentially teleport downwards destroying enemies in your descending path. This also opens up the possibility of using the mechanic to shave off precious fractions of seconds in time-based platforming challenges, of which there is a substantial amount. It also allows the game to remain really fast paced.Apart from the solid mechanics, another star of the game is its soundtrack. Very stellar and well made. If you enjoy electronica, consider picking up the soundtrack as well. I did."

The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the level design, beautiful. You'd be playing this game for hours because it's just so addictive! It's really hard at some parts, but it is possible. The DLC is really hard as well. For those who aren't a huge fan of major language, there is a PG mode! Some lines that a few characters say is censored with huge text that says ""CENSORED"" so that you don't have to know what they actually said. Only thing is, there is still some sexual content. For example, the first boss still says stuff like""No sex is safe sex"", so PG mode isn't 100% clean. However, that does not mean that it does this kind of stuff all the time! I haven't paid much attention to the text as much because i was mostly trying to figure out how to NOT die.The boss fights are all great! I liked the first one for the most part because I like to blow stuff up. The second one just remindded me of Doctor Who because all I was doing was running. The end of that was rather...interesting? I'm not going to spoil it, but I thought it was weird, but with a game like this who cares?There are a few references in this game! Hopefully you guys can figure them out. I know I did!Just a heads up! If you're actually still reading this review, I'm leaving a tip on how to find your soundtrack and digital poster. All you gotta do is right click the game in your library, click properties, then the local files tab. Click browse local files. Your extra content will be in the extras folder.

The soundtrack is amazing, the levels are tricky but enjoyable, and the storyline is quite strange but oddly memorable. The protagonist is the strong, silent type, but that's the only ""typical"" thing about this game - and that's perfectly fine, as he has a bit of a problem that he needs to work out, anyway... you wouldn't be talking either if you'd been through half of what he's been through himself. The characters that populate the BEAUTIFUL!!!!! levels will make you laugh, as will the story, but I'll admit that some of these levels are absolutely brutal. You won't be able to stop yourself from rage quitting.What's great about it, too, is that the replay value is there! Once you've beaten the main game, there are lots of challenges for you (beating gold times, and collecting all the stars) - and, once you've collected everything, a new world unlocks that will provide you with more fun times. World 4 is brutal, but if you get tired of that, there are the holiday levels that were released for free, and those are a lot of fun. Also, you'll probably end up replaying favourite levels just for the heck of it.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll pull your hair out, you'll get up and dance, you'll buy the soundtrack and all the DLC for this game - ESJ is the game that you'll have fun trying to beat.

Alas, when I got the game, I was quite disappointed finding out that the awesome background music has nothing to do with the gameplay whatsoever.In my opinion, the game is pretty good. Visually appealing, great to listen to with a pair of bass-enhanced headphones. MOSTLY straightforward obstacles, and checkpoints just a little ahead of where the real danger is, giving a sense of achievement on each save. Storywise, ain't the best you're going to find. The only issue I have is that the jumping mechanism seems to be a little too precise/tight. I'd have to press jump ONLY AFTER I land, and not when I land, or I might miss, say, 50/50?So, if you enjoy platformers or masocore games, go ahead, you'll enjoy the tiny lines of speech by those humorous little friendly passive creepos along your journey.

It's like someone made a game in the style of Super Meat Boy, only with electronic dance music (good) and a control feel that while responsive and accurate is weighted in the exact right way to feel entirely wrong to me. I know there are other people who think it's just fine, but I'm not a huge fan of things like having no acceleration on movement or the ultra-high precision required with the attack. With Super Meat Boy or Dustforce or games like that, when I screw up and keep trying again repeatedly my main feelings are determination and then achievement after succeeding, with a little frustration if it takes me a long time. With this game, it was mostly, ""Why does it still feel wrong after an hour to get used to it?"" Clearly not for me.

""Hey, come and play me! It'll be fun!""It's all a ruse. This game is difficult. It doesn't just get progressively difficult... it's difficult right from the beginning. The levels seem to get longer as you progress, with checkpoints every so often... but it always feels like there isn't enough. The game requires trial and error to beat, since a lot of the jumps that you make require you to start moving in the direction of the next jump, but you often don't see what that is until you've already started the jump. You have to be really precise with your movements and timing... and on some levels, you hardly have enough time to complete the level even while rushing yourself.Not only do you have to subject yourself to this treacherous platforming, you'll also have to deal with practically everything in the level trying to kill you. Oh, and there are collectables in the levels that you'll have to risk your life for. Go ahead and try to collect them... just be warned they add even more difficulty to the levels when you do. And when you die, you'll have to go out of your way to get them again, since you have to beat the level after snatching them.Masochists will hate themselves after playing this game.Even so, this game sure is enticing."

The soundtrack by Env is it's main selling point, so you can take a gander and see if you like his style of music.Being a hard platformer is what the music accompanies, with a few easy to some finnicky gimmicks. Expect having to get some megaman style jumping going when hopping off some of the trickier platforms, and frequent and numerous restarts to get the deathless and or gold time runs.The accompanying sounds have an amusing twist which, thank god, you can turn off, because restarting the same checkpoint over and over again gets very old very quickly, but on casual runthroughs provides a chuckle.I would like if there would be a button to restart the level (with checkpoints that is), as you end up on the main menu every time you quit a level manually. Even though there is a no checkpoint mode, resetting a checkpoint helps with hitting some cycles. Also if you could change your background music in infinite love mode would be great.All in al an enjoyable keyboardbreaking game."

,Not Recommended,244870,29629246,Posted: 1 February,all,TheColorUrple,"This is a platformer that just doesn't *feel* right to play.Your character controls like a brick. Aiming a jump is difficult because you have very little momentum once in the air, and even then, correcting in the other direction is sluggish. You don't jump high, your arc is small, and when you start to fall, you fall fast and pretty much straight down. It's tough to explain with words, but it's easy to feel within the first few minutes playing the game.Forgive the comparison, but in Super Meat Boy (which is an incredibly good platformer) you are comparatively lighter and can maneuver well. You're fast, you can change direction and accelerate in mid-air, and you can generally get through insanely difficult levels with micro-precision. Electronic Super Joy, on the other hand, doesn't feel precise at all. It feels clumsy and awkward, which quickly leads to frustration when trying to navigate its death traps.And yet, this is a game that absolutely demands precision. Because you have so little momentum or ability to control while in the air, jumps must be timed *exactly* right when launching. If this timing is off even by a little bit, you will not succeed the jump. This is especially true in the later levels - world 4 from the vanilla game and the Hot Sticky Mess DLC in particular have some punishing challenges that will definitely feel unfair before you succeed. Again, this is par for the course for this type of platformer, but since Electronic Super Joy feels so heavy and cumbersome, it's hard to get a sense of improvement in your own skill as you progress.To add to the disappointment, a significant portion of the levels rely on infinite homing missiles to keep constant pressure on you. Since these missiles have slow, looping trajectories that are constantly changing based on your position, you will often get stuck amid several of them without any possible way of surviving. They also have a nasty habit of tracking you while offscreen, and you can wind up getting killed by a missile that you could never have seen coming. The game requires you to manage this by taking them out with your stomp ability, but it's not a perfect system, so the mechanic still leads to many cheap and unfair deaths.On the plus side, there is some really good platforming design. A lot of the challenges combine the traps, projectiles, and gaps in pretty creative ways, and you can grudgingly appreciate the thought that was put into the gauntlets even as they kill you over and over again.The aesthetic is also decent. The music has that Swedish House Mafia sound that was popular in the late 2000's, and while it irritated me most of the time with its upbeat joyous major-key synth progressions, it's still admittedly pretty well produced and some may like it. Visually, it's pretty much one flavor: black foreground, monochromatic colored background. It would have been nice to see the artists combine numerous colors in more interesting arrangements, sort of like what you would expect to see at a light show for an EDM concert, so this seems like a missed opportunity. The visuals will also deliberately mess with your perception of what's happening, which just adds annoyance to the difficulty.So in short, while there are some interesting ideas here, laced with a bit of humor and some appreciable effects and artwork, the core of the platforming controls just don't feel good, and it makes the significant difficulty level joyless to face."
