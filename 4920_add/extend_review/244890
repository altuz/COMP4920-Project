,Recommended,244890,8022863,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,theguardianlegend,"Before modern day ""shooters"" existed, the term ""shooter"" referred to games in which the singular player (or occastionally multiple players) destroys hordes of enemies whilst dodging attacks.  The player usually takes control of an aircraft (or spacecraft) to do this, and today, we define this sub-genre as the ""Schmup"" (shoot-em-up).  These games were such a staple of gaming's earlier developments that you can see thier DNA now infused with many modern games.  The problem is that the more pure form of vertical and horizontal scrolling shooters doesn't seem to surface very often anymore.  The more recent release of Radiant Silvergun in the x-box live marketplace makes up for some of this, but the modern shoot-em up world is still barren!Enter Velocity Ultra-- possibly the most clever evolution of the classic shooter genre, since Ikaruga.  This game takes the conventional shoot-em-up, adds an excellent teleportation system, throws you into it's more than fifty mini-playgrounds,and challenges you to adapt to them while meeting certain requirements.  Those that find an affinity with this game, as I have, won't be able to stop until they've gotten a gold medal in every stage.The graphics are more than adequate, and have a consistent style to them that doesn't confuse the eyes or get in the way of the gameplay mechanic.  The comic-like art in between missions is fun to look at, and serves as a throwback to the ""barely-there"" style of storytelling that most shoot-em-ups adhere to.  Why tease the player with too much story when all that'll be needed is very twitchy hands?  The comic-frames more than suffice.  Music is above average techno (I understand that electronic music consists of multiple sub-generes, but ""techno"" seems to fit the profile here), and carries the game's pace nicely.  Controls are fluid and responsive, with only the occasional failed teleportation to make the player question his or her controller.  And even then, practice makes perfect is the bread & butter of this game, and evidences it's tight gameplay.  I'm curious as to how the controls feel in the Vita original, and I'm even more curious to see how curve studios might integrate the teleportation controls in to IOS, or other mobile devices.Buy this game.  It's an evolution of one of the most classic genres of video gaming, and it does what it does very well.  The price is certainly right, and we need to encourage more development of games in this genre!  Oh, and did I mention the game has a built in calculator, as well as the game Mine-sweeper?  Does this enhance the experience?  No!  Is it awesome?  Yes!9.1 / 10"

But not only does it have great graphics, the music is also amazing, and the game-play is well thought trough. Boosting and teleporting around the world work well and the loot you find helps you out quite a bit.Would recommend this Game just for the Graphics and the Music alone."
,Recommended,244890,14941906,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Titan,"Gameplay:Velocity Ultra is a Shoot 'em Up game that doesn't focus on killing waves and waves of enemies or dodging thousands of bullets: it values more the player's ability to play fast and efficiently. Teleporting gives you a nice method of advanced movement, and in many stages a mechanic for puzzle-solving. The controls are easy to understand, but take a while to master.Replayability:Even after beating the game, you will probably revisit levels to achieve the level-specific milestones for time spent, survivors rescued and score (possibly all in the same run, to get a ""Perfect"" stamp). Getting all that usually takes about 15h to 20h.Presentation:Unfortunately the game falls short in this category. The visuals are simple but at least for me get the job done, and the music isn't exactly bad, but gets annoying over time. I mute the in-game music and set my own playlist.Conclusion:It's a very underrated gem, and deserves your time for bringing fresh ideas to the genre, while providing precise and rewarding gameplay."
,Recommended,244890,8319159,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Velocity Ultra is a cool shoot 'em up, where you can complete most of the levels at your own pace. You can scroll through the levels at a faster pace with the press of a button. Your ship can also teleport and hit walls without taking damage. It's an impressive spaceship, really. There are many levels, about 50 or so, and completing a level will earn you xp; xp that can be used to progress through these many levels as some of more difficult ones will still be locked at the beginning. And it's not just about navigating levels, you also have to shoot enemies (with upgradeable weapons later on) and collect escape pods. Collecting and shooting these will help you earn a bronze, silver or gold medal and these are tied to your xp. I should've mentioned that a tiny bit earlier maybe, but what the hell. Anyhoo, to make a long story short, or a short story shorter; it's an amusing game with, for me personally, not enough content to keep me coming back for more. Then again, it's a shoot 'em up and I've rarely seen one with tons of content. Still, entertaining. Certainly not bad.[Rating: 73/100]"

You need to clear every levels and save the survivors, but for that, you'll have to use teleporters, dive ability, booster and or course : shooting.The game is in 2D but that's fine, it's beautiful, and smooth. The difficulty increases for every zone you'll unlock.This is like a race game mixed with Ikaruga and Portal. There is leaderboard and high replayability to gain every possible gold medals.

76561197995211570,Recommended,244890,10403235,"Posted: 8 June, 2014",all,La Mer,"Velocity®Ultra is a new(at least for me) twist on the slowly fading Shmup genre. The concept is simple: save all survivors, take out threats, and complete each stage as fast as possible. The twist to this game is that you have to teleport from area to area in order to complete these tasks. Where many shmup's difficulty stems from bullet hell, Velocity®Ultra's challenge comes from fast pace manuvering. The game's fluid and tight mechanics are its stong point. However, this is what will make or break you during your play. In other words, it's a perfectionist type of game. Learning how to navigate/teleport as quickly as possible while rescuing all survivors as quickly as possible is a rewarding challenge. Visually, its easy on the eyes. It boasts a cartoonish art style which is a nice touch, offering a different atmosphere than most shmups. However, It can be somewhat repetetive. Each of it's 40+ stages is just a slight variation over the others. Then again, for the under 5 bucks I payed for it, I can't complain. I think there's a lot of potential this title and I look forward to any future installments."

,Recommended,244890,8023542,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,Treygone Martin,"It isn't the prettiest game nor is it the best port but it sure is a great puzzler.  Unfortunately, like all puzzle shmups (excluding a particularly awesome boss sequence in Shikigami no Shiro II), the shmupping(?) falls a bit flat.  Ikaruga fares a bit better in this regard with the awesome boss battles but Ikaruga not only sucks as a shmup (enemies never aim at you, they just spray patterns, everything is pre-set and once you get the hang of it every game will be the exact same) but it sucks as a bland match-three puzzler.  If you want a good shmup I would generally avoid Steam because even the ones with more praise such as Jamestown are not that good (fine, if you really want one maybe try Ether Vapor Re-master) so graduate to the Sega Saturn or at least download a good version of Shmupmame.  Now, it may sound like I'm bashing the game, but in reality I'm just very long-winded; the puzzle half of this game rocks!  The levels are tight and well thought out, the controls respond perfectly, and there are various techniques to master if you want to improve your time and score throughout all 50 levels.  The shmup aspect does fit in such a way that it makes what are already complicated puzzles more stressful and constrained adding to the challenge.  There are neat frames shown before missions giving you the gist of what is occurring in the level and the music is your standard techno affair but done better than most.  My two largest complaints so far are that the leader-board scores seem broken (or I'm just the worst player ever) and the screen tears at the top quite frequently.  I'm only eleven levels in and those eleven levels did not take me very long but the difficulty is starting to ramp up to a point that I'm being genuinely challenged which, for being only a fifth of the way in, is awesome and leads me to believe that there should be some decent longevity to the game, especially for its genre.  I'd recommend this game to fans of puzzle games who shmup in their spare time and recommend people that do not fit this niche to watch some game-play videos and wait for more qualified reviews from anywhere that is not IGN."

This is more of a puzzle-SHMUP, as the point of flying the Quarp jet around is that it teleports, not only where you can see, but also with teleport pods, making level navigation an interesting part of the later levels. While not overly difficult, it is very fun and addicting to play. I'm greatly anticipating the sequel when it comes out!"

,Recommended,244890,15101655,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,Anterk,"Velocity Ultra with a 360 controller feels better than any shoot-em-up (shmup) I've ever played. Throwing powerful bombs in every direction is as easy as flicking the right stick, yet the less-powerful main guns have their place. Every stage in Velocity is designed like a puzzle, with switches to hit in a certain order, enemies to kill, and civilian pods to rescue. A single miss-placed bomb can reset the switches, while the main guns take far more shots to activate a switch.Switches and shmups wouldn't seem fun on paper, but Velocity includes a teleportation feature that makes missing a switch far less punishing than it would be otherwise. In certain levels, you can place a limited number of checkpoints to allow you to hop between switches with ease. The teleportation isn't limited to the checkpoints, however, as you are also free to teleport into any open space you can see.The combination of the shooting, switches, and teleportation with a screen that constantly scrolls upwards (you're always forced to go forwards, so without the teleport you could never move back) seems overwhelming. However, Velocity does a very good job with pacing. As someone who is usually terrible at these kinds of games, I was surprised how quickly and easily I got into the game. I'll probably never get a handle on all the systems in play, but I'm definitely having fun.I only have two issues with the game. First, manually teleporting around the map feels extremely clunky, and I've died several times from the cursor refusing to recognize a space as empty. Second, levels are gated by XP, so if your not good at these kinds of games you may find yourself forced to replay levels in order to progress.Overall a good game. Not as good with a keyboard, but playable."

You can teleport at will anytime, any distance and at whatever angle you wish, your only restriction being that you need to see your arrival point on the screen.The game focuses less on the shmup combat and mostly uses the enemies as obstacles in your attempt to rescue all the survivors in a level ( which consists of flying your ship into them, like collecting a power-up). Survivors are spread around the level, often surrounded by enemies or impenetrable force fields that require you to activate switches in a specific order to deactivate them.You can also speed up your ship, meaning that the screen will scroll faster. This is primarily used to get a better score for a level but some levels will demand that you use this feature as much as possible by implementing a short time limit.At about the 33% mark, the game introduces the ability to place beacons at any point in a level, allowing you to teleport back to said beacon even if the screen scrolled past it. This paves the way for much more complex and enjoyable levels, with maze navigation becoming an important factor in your success.The game has very tight controls and a great soundtrack. The art style is fine, but there is not much detail in the graphics.Overall the gameplay feels innovative and very very fun."

The story is about a blackhole coming to destroy a bunch of colonies and space stations and you as Lietenant Kai Tana (only realised the name halfway through the game...) are tasked with rescuing as many engineers, scientists and colonists along with taking out some alien invaders taking advantage of the situation. The story reminds me of Sanctum 2 as in it's there but almost pointless and acts as a base setup but here it looks like they really tried expanding this game's universe and it's somewhat interesting so A for effort!You take pilot of the Quarp Jet which let's you teleport to hard to reach places. This shooter has some puzzles as well, mainly deactivating powerstations. It's interesting and works for the most part. You have your normal things like shooting aliens, upgrades and such. I like the cutscene images, they're very nice and detailed and the levels themselves are alright too. Music is okay, it sets the mood but you won't be tapping your toes to anything. The game contains a story mode with 50 missions, leaderboards and a flight computer which has various things to offer such as concept art unlocks, minigames, a calculator and... minesweeper? What?Still this game is very good, it won't rock your boat but that's fine. It's a nice little shooter game to have fun with occasionally. It has a couple of cool tricks too and uses them well enough. I'm not sure if the sequal is any good but now I gotta give it a try someday. This game gets a 7.5/10"

,Recommended,244890,18187062,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,Eranar,"Fun and addictive little game. I'll try to write a mini review below to justify why I recommend it.First let's take a look at (in my humble opinion) the most important aspect of any game - the gameplay:It's awesome! It's fun, it's fast, it's everything you'd expect it to be. It's easy to learn, hard to master and very, very satisfying. Once you understand how the mechanics work, you'll complete the missions relatively easy. But the enjoyment comes after that, when you try to get the best rating, achieve the highest score and collect all the collectibles. There are total of 50 missions or 'zones' for you to complete, so you won't be able to beat the game in one sit. Combined with the replay value of the missions, I'd say the game is pretty lenghty. A thing to note here - this in not your typical shoot'em up game! Sure, the SHMUP elements are present, but it plays more like a puzzle game. Another thing that should be mentioned - I found the default mouse/keyboard controls kind of strange. Forunately you can customize them for your liking. However, in my opinion the best way to play is with a gamepad - I'm using a XBOX360 controller and it's definitely better than the M/KB controls.Next - the graphics:The graphics are 2D, with enough eye-candy to keep you entertained. The visuals are shiny and colorful, but don't expect something revolutionary you haven't seen before - it's the typical space setting we all know and love. The graphic settings are limited to changing your resolution and Anti-Aliasing, but seriously, who needs more in that kind of game?  The game has a very small impact on your system's resources, so even if your computer is older, you won't have any problems running and playing it.A few words about the music:The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. It consists of several electronic/techno tracks that fit with the gameplay perfectly. Even if you're not a techno music fan (like myself) you'll like it.  Each mission has it's own theme that pumps you up and makes want to play more and more.The story:Before each mission, there's a short comic that explains what you're doing in the current mission. And that's pretty much it. I ended up skipping these after the first two missions, simply because I didn't really care. Sure, they could have made up a more complex story, but honestly, if you're playing the game entirely for the story, you're doing it wrong.And that pretty much sums it up. If you're not sure whether to buy it or not, I'd say go for it! You'll have fun and it will last you more than what you paid for it.TL;DR version:Fun little game with nice visuals and good soundtrack, that will keep you entertained for a long time. Buy it!"
