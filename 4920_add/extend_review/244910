It felt a little tedious and the slowness of movement was padding for time, not atmosphere.The puzzles were a little fun, but a little on the easy side. The hardest aspect and quite fun at first was learning to read again.This game is GORGEOUS. Up there with the prettiest at the moment, like Ethan Carter. But the game is WAYYY too short, and there's little variance with the setting, and not much to explore. I beat this in two hours, and that was with getting stuck on the freaking drawers and spending a lot of time figuring out that one.Anyway, if you have doubts about buying this, probably don't. If you just love games with this sort of atmosphere and walking simulator puzzles/exploration, you might give it a try, but wait til it's on sale. The amount of content does not justify the price"
,Recommended,244910,17550309,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,Bad Whippet,"What is it?Homesick is a narrative-style indie game that sits somewhere betweenThe Vanishing of Ethan CarterandDear Esther(but with considerably more 'game' than the latter).  Your objective is no more than to find out what happened, why you are there and how to escape by a small amount of puzzle-solving and decyphering of cryptic code to reveal what happened.  Homesick is a short game and mostly entails you unlocking access to various areas that form one floor of an abandoned apartment block and eventually piecing together the story before finding your escape.How long is it?The game will take no more than 3-5 hours if played thoroughly (that is: solving all the puzzles and then, after decyphering the remainder of the code, backtracking to read all the pages and letters you were unable to read earlier in the game in order to properly piece together what happened.  If you don't backtrack, you're probably looking at an hour less.  Whether or not it offers replayability is a tough one.  I can imagine I will play it again much further on in time, but of course will remember what needs solving and when, so will likely just play it just to repeat the experience in the same way I might reread a good book.Is it scary?No, but it is haunting atmospherically and can feel a little tense at times (in the nightmare sequences).  The bleakly beautiful music score creates a melancholy backdrop to your waking hours shuffling through decay and detritus of a building's former existence.  The visuals are superb as is the music.  Minor spoiler if you like to know about anything scaremongering at all:there is one minor jump-scare at the very end of the game, but it's not one of those where you scream and drop whatever happens to be in your hands at the time.Even if you're a self-confessed gaming-wuss like me, you'll be fine.Is it difficult?It's about on a par withThe Vanishing of Ethan Carterin terms of difficulty, perhaps a little simpler.  The few non-code puzzles are easy enough to solve after a bit of thought and logic - especially if you use audio as well as visual clues.  The code decyphering is fun, and you will have decyphered it fully by the time you finish the game - even if you think you're struggling at the beginning (trust me on this one - you'll nail it).Anything not to like?Not really.  Anything I didn't like initially transpired to have a very good reason behind it.  These ranged from pace, to camera views and areas of accessibility - but ALL had reasons (ie deliberate by design), so if you find yourself grumbling about this or that, bear in mind that there is likely a very good reason for it.  The only gripes I had beyond these were the somewhat unwieldy inventory system (would have been easier to have a popup screen to click the required item rather than scroll through each until the correct item was equipped) and I missed the sound effects that might have accompanied my movements as I shuffled through debris, trod on papers and such (just scraping and crunching sounds - the usual stuff).  But they are minor and petty, and are no reason not to enjoy the game itself.In summaryIf you enjoy short, narrative driven games with a bit of mystery and puzzle-solving, and think exploring the ruins of abandoned buildings is a bleak but moving experience, then you will enjoy this game greatly.  I hope the developer gives us further, similar experiences in the future.  In the meantime, this little game deserves to occupy a small space in your library."

The last thing I noticed was also how beautiful it is. The game is just a joy to look at the entire time, I wanted to take a screenshot every  time I turned a corner (and often times I did) just because of how captivating each bit of environment was in the game. Whether it was the stark blasts of white light leaking through windows or it was the shocking amount of wallpaper peeling off the walls, everything is built with such detail and is the obvious result of a lot of effort from the developer. Environments are spectacular, and so are the bits and bobs of info and story you will find in them. I would go into the story more, but I would rather not spoil it, part of what makes this game worth playing is discovering the story for yourself, so I will let you do that.But before you do enter the halls of ""Homesick"" I must warn you that if you are not a fan of games like ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" or ""Gone Home"", this is not for you. Most of the game consists of simple puzzles that are solved with either very logical solutions or kind of out of the blue. But there is one paticular section towards the end of the game where the game gets the balance between mind numbingly simple and oddly aloof right, and it finally feels like you are doing something fantastic that also makes sense.The game has flaws, specifically the ""game"" part of ""Homesick"", but it gets so much stuff right. ""Homesick"" is a tour through a meticulously built set of rooms that have this oppresive sadness to them but I always had to turn the next corner. Play ""Homesick"" if you want to see a game made with a lot of heart and double the talent."
,Not Recommended,244910,23362213,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Cyanogenic,"Stunningly rendered, the waking world has a thick atmosphere of brooding and lingering dust.  Books, pages and photographic slides litter the defunct and decaying apartment building - hinting of history, of the people who once dwelled within these corridors of plaster and peeling wallpaper.   Somber music punctuates the melancholy as you explore the modern ruin seeking answers: what happened, where did everyone go, why am I still here, and why is the sunlight so painfully bright?   Some of the writings and pictures I found rummaging through the kippleized environment spoke of answers to come.Asleep, the world is transformed into a shadowy nightmare version of itself.  The unconscious world is a place of frantic, terrorized sprinting as the darkness aggressively moves in to gobble you up in its hellish maw.The puzzles are well-thought-out, logical, and fluid; meshing perfectly with the environment.   It’s feels less like coming to a “puzzle section” like in some games, and more like creatively seeking out ways to move around the environment.This is what I liked about Homesick, the atmosphere, the mystery, the logical puzzles, the tip-of-the-iceberg world building that promised something more; a reward for pushing further into the game’s brooding depths.  The game didn’t deliver.   I’ve clocked about three hours in the game and I can tell you without exaggeration that 80% of that time was spent staring at books trying to decipher their script.   (I managed to work out most of the alphabet, the key I scribbled down in a notebook lacking only the ciphers for Q and X).   After about 30 minutes of actual gameplay and head-scratching, Homesick abruptly ends with no answers, no story, and what amounts to a cheap jump-scare and a vague sense of “paternal-ness”, for lack of a better word.   Homesick feels like a project that someone did a lot of work on, felt strongly about, and obsessed over for a while, but got tired of producing 10% of the way through, polished it up, and slapped a half-hearted ending on it.   I bought the game on sale, so I’m not upset that I spent money on it.  But the game is in no way worth the $15 USD price tag.My recommendation is mixed.  But since I have to pick yes or no, at this price the answer is no, I would not recommend this title."

I thought Dear Esther was a nice concept but it lacked basic gameplay, which I found to be a bit of a shame.Sure, there is not a lot here, the puzzles are basic and simple and the focus lies heavily on your own interest in the world as a player and your love of exploring a mysterious world. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every minute of it because it is just creepy enough for me to enjoy it (Not a horror fan..) and the music and story makes this a very unique experience.Well balanced between the relaxing daytime explorations and the nighttime stress of running away from dark creepy sticky looking blobs.The ending was amazing and it surprised me even though I though I had it figured out completely. Also, because I know now what happens, I kind of want to play through again and discover all the little hints I missed!One of the best games I played all year.

It's not a super-long game, but it's also not super-short; it gives you just enough time and detail to piece together a lovely narrative without getting bogged down with too many red herrings.  There are a few diversions, mainly to be found in the ""bonus"" manuscripts, but they mainly provide a light palate cleanser in between stretches of growing dread.And yes, the game is creepy.  And it's creepy in a way that's engineered purely by scenery and mood.  Most of the game is actually rather peaceful; it's just that you KNOW something is terribly wrong (obviously), and you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  It's just a question of how and when that will happen.The puzzles, wonder of wonders, were all common sense.  There was not one instance of ""tie this string to that eggbeater while the moon is in the seventh house, and lo, the door will be opened.""  If at any point I said, ""Huh, I wonder if I can do this...?"" the answer was yes, yes I could.The music is just phenomenal.  I never got tired of it, and it was just eerie enough (those breathless gasps underscoring the strings!) that despite its tranquility, it completely fit.The only thing that I would list as a possible con is that, well, there's a Message behind the game.  And I have to say Message (with the capital M), though if it was a little less heavy-handed, it would have been merely a Plot Point.  Did you like Little Inferno in spite of its Message?  Then you'll like Homesick.  (And no, it's not the same Message.)All in all an absolutely enjoyable title and a great way to spend an evening!"

My bias for puzzle games will show, but I think it is really interesting. Without spoiling anything, you get thrust into everything and are forced to stumble a bit before you get the game makers logic. Little clunky at first but I soon got the hang of it and really started enjoying it. To put it simply the game has an odd, but neat way of making you enjoy the slow and pretty way of exploring everything."

How you slowly unfold the mystery of the strange building you wake up in and, and how it all connects and makes so (painfully) much sense in the end is amazing.The music perfectly accompanies the mood and the slow/medium pace of the game. The gameplay is smooth (unless your mousewheel is glitchy).This is also one of those games that make you question the realities of our world, without forcing its arguments onto you.I recommend this game as an excellent and artistic 2-4 hour experience."

76561198042261571,Recommended,244910,17513737,"Posted: 12 August, 2015",all,Jamie,"Homesick doesn't seek to make you terrified by shaking you with ghosts, zombies, or storylines meant to shock and disturb you. Homesick just wants to entice you with pretty scenery, puzzles that are so simple that they WILL go over your head (three hours of ""I don't get it! What? OH! Wow I feel so stupid!"") and then kick you in the gut within the last five seconds you're playing this game.It's beautiful and I love it. It's wicked and I love it.Homesick forces you to go in blind and refuses to tell you any of the plot because the written language is so alien to you as the main character. This gets remedied later, but you're left looking at photos and faded books while pondering why you're the only one left in this abandoned place. It's beautiful and it is creepy. If you have a love of urban exploring or enjoy following people who do this, you'll immediately love the setting in this game. The way that light is suddenly your enemy and that nightmares can give you a startling sort of solace is something noted early on, because learning to manipulate your nightmares is what will help you solve some of the puzzles you face.The light as an enemy/puzzle to solve really is something I have to repeat as something I loved. When I'm on my worst days as someone who is disabled from a condition, I get photosensitive. While the lighting effects do hurt (take note gamers this could give you a migraine), it's enough to replicate that feeling I get when I'm just trying to open my blinds. The sun is suddenly blaring while I'm simply trying to function. A game was able to recreate that feeling, even in just a tiny way. Kudos, really. You've won me over.I honestly forgot that this was a walking simulator with how the puzzles were set up. Everything made sense. I wasn't listening to innane dialogue rattle on and on and on. I just got to take my time and enjoy a story that was hinted at to be heartbreaking and at some points, scary for the people who once lived in that building. Each clue and each puzzle were tasteful and everything meshed perfectly. I cared about these named people who were long gone by the time I had begun my journey.This was a game to just take one's time with and it was three hour's well spent. Sure I probably spent a little too much time reading over things in the library or staring at photos, but I wanted to know more. Homesick gives you just enough story, leaves you wanting more, and ends with beautiful imagery swirling around you.I have to admit, the decoding system made things difficult and if I could have solved that earlier, it would have made things less stressful on me, but that would have eliminated a lot of tension and the suspense of finding out why the building was there and what it was for. However, I'd be worried that other gamers would lose interest by then and wouldn't think to go back and check to see the stories and get more hints to what happened. If that is my only complaint, that's probably it.Get this on sale. It's pretty short and you'll finish it in an evening. But if you like games like Dear Esther, The Path, Gone Home, etc, you'll probably like this. If you like staring at pretty scenery and forgetting you're playing a game, this is a perfect choice. If you like puzzles? Decent game with some simple puzzles you'll hate yourself in the morning for not getting.It was so pretty it hurt my eyes!"
,Not Recommended,244910,28989179,Posted: 3 January,all,Kuroko,"Summary: A gorgeous unspoken narrative with solid puzzle gameplay undermined by technical flaws, slowness and especially how it asks too much of its player to fully appreciate it.It looks beautiful and intriguing, it's got decent reviews and those who like it are glowing in their appraisal. So why isn't everyone talking about Homesick? Well it's basically because games like Homesick can't afford to be too slow, technically flawed or in some way inaccessible, and unfortunately Homesick is all of those things.If you've ever looked at pictures of Pripyat and seen beauty in it, you'll probably dig the aesthetic a lot, and Homesick sticks to small environments so it can render in lush detail the cracked walls and fallout specks, to the tune of a somber, memorable piano theme. It almost completely works, but you can still see rooms load in front of you and the occasional graphical seam, which just shouldn't happen in a game like this.Regardless it's a joy to simply look at for a while, and then you have to set about finding out how to proceed. Most of the puzzles can be worked out from environmental clues and I wasn't stuck for too long with these, they were satisfying to do and didn't take much guesswork.The central issue of Homesick concerns the notes scattered everywhere written in a cipher. Most are optional and don't require your engagement, but one puzzle requires you to painstakingly work out the cipher and then apply it to a puzzle. Now, as someone interested in language I found this quite fun and satisfying, but as I was enjoying myself I knew that to many this would be a stopping point. It's not complicated, but it is a slow, slow process exacerbated by your character's subhuman gait.Once the cipher is cracked it's possible to go around translating all the notes in the game, but this asks FAR too much of the average player, especially since many of those notes are very dense. In fact, that such a wealth of actual written knowledge exists alongside Homesick's minimalist, environment-based narrative undermines the experience for the user.Homesick could have been a beautiful, self-contained, wordless experience that tells its story with feel and pictures, leaving its world with most of its questions unanswered. But the answers could be there, hidden under all that cipher; the price of translating it all and finding out more is simply too high, so the average gamer will cope with the 'unfinished' feeling the game leaves them with. That's not the feeling the game should be engendering.I actually enjoyed my time with Homesick and I'm glad I played it, which makes my conclusion complicated. Visually it's a game of rare beauty. It has some solid puzzling that makes you engage with your environment, and you might well enjoy it. But particularly at full price Homesick doesn't deliver on that satisfaction that it promises and simply won't please everyone."

While the graphics and music do provide an excellent environment the actual story and puzzles in the game are terrible.  The story falls completely flat not only in content but also has no effective progression.  While the game has a lot of readable content after you decipher the correct letters, the content itself is very two dimensional and leaves much to be desired.Having progressed through a total of 4 rooms and completed each of their ""puzzles"" , if you can call them that, the player is then treated to an abrupt and worthless ending.

,Not Recommended,244910,29624045,Posted: 1 February,all,alphyna,"Of all the walking simulators I've played this one is probably the silliest.It's incredibly beautiful and creates a consistent, enchanting atmosphere—which is indeed the baseline that's required of a walking simulator. The cryptography puzzle is a great idea that highlights the decently non-linear level design (for such a short game) with its shortcuts circling back; after deciphering the code, the player is encouraged to double back and explore the previous areas once again, this time being able to read and learn more about what went on. It's a great and inventive use of the game's limited resources....But this is also where Homesick fails, I'm afraid. Knowing that in gaming less is often more is a tough wisdom to accept; few developers do. As a result, they try to add more content to their games without realising that it actually leaves their creations emptier than they would have been without it. The texts in Homesick are boring and bland, somehow leaving the player with less story than they had before reading them; at least without those notes (that somehow completely evaded the fire that had destroyed everythng else, must be made of titanium or something) the player could imagine a story to their taste based on audio and visual cues.And it would probably be a better story than the boring one we ended up with. Not to mention the poorly-executed TWEEST at the end.I may sound nitpicky, but for such a short game with such a price tag, every aspect must be brilliant for it to be worth it. And I think Homesick would have been a much better game if it just mesmerized us with brilliant lighting and dilapidation—and left it at that."

It's more of an old photograph or painting that needs some cleaning to reveal the full picture.  There are a couple puzzles to solve in order to go forward, but I found them to be fairly easy.  The biggest sticking point for me is the written language you see -- just know it will take a while and a little bit of work to figure it out (simple substitution code).  It's not until close to the end that it is spelled out for you (almost literally).I found this to be a very touching experience.  The rendering is beautiful in its decay.

And this game gives me just that. The game overall feels like a Dream. You end up in a strange world that you have just woken up in. And you have no clue where you are but there are things around that look interesting. You find clues as to what to do and explore a modern ruin of a tall building, all by yourself.Why do I say that it feels like a dream? The overall setting already feels very much like a dream.- You open your eyes in a world you dont know, yet you go with it and just do what you can/want.- You take a look around and do what you can to get further into the building.- Somehow the light does not grant you acces to the path it shines upon which is intentional.- But when Night falls the light no longer blocks your way.- Now off to the next room to find out more about this strange and unknown place.One thing before I end the review.This game is not easy and it certainly does not hold your hand.The game gives you hints, clues and pictures as to what you are looking for. But what you are looking for is sometimes different. This means that the clue you just found has something to do with it and that is where your brain comes into play. Think. Think. Think. And think again. Search everywhere and think about ever logical and maybe not logical outcome. It will most certainly help you.For those that like the athmosphere of a modern ruin, reclaimed by nature, this game is certainly for you. Plus you get to uncover a mystery and solve, maybe not too simple, puzzles. I can say that after only playing for an hour, I have gotten what I wanted out of the game. I couldnt want more than what I wished for. A game, set in a modern building which became a ruin over time and was reclaimed by nature. That plus the feeling of a dream makes this game perfect and I still wish that we would get a full on game similar to this one, with open world similar to Fallout. Maybe this wish will be granted one day."

But I can't.While the storyline is intriuging, the game is painfully short, even when taking your time to explore every nook and cranny and reading everything.In addition, there are several points where the soloution to a puzzle is very counter-intuitive or you have to do something that wouldn't have occured to you without reading a guide. (Like typing to interact with the letter blocks, or which direction to turn the valves in the gym.)My final complaint is that the ending needs serious work, both in storyline, and physical gameplay. (In particular, the poor design of the mirror scene really ruined the experience.)All in all, if this was an early beta of a game that would be further tested and expanded, I would really enjoy it. However, it's already finished, and quite frankly, so am I.TL;DR: The game doesn't justify the cost, and it still needs work that will never happen."

And how they reach this somber tone by dilapidation is even more common, running the gamut from post-apocalyptic games adhering to more eschatological worldviews and the games like Homesick, that uses it as a symbol for something a little more personal. The world is as always, but uncannily in distress when in our sudden awakening from the slumber of ignorance we notice its despair. Such is the way Homesick presents itself, as a distressed world we have to manipulate to adapt to psychically and better. Or as stated in the history of the game's development on Lucky Pause's website: “figuring out how to continue to grow when the world is falling apart around you“.This is what constitutes the aesthetics and tone of Homesick. Degradation, dilapidation, disaster, world as inhabitable, world as impossible to come to terms with. Puzzles that you solve lead you into news articles in lost languages, but it being a newspaper and newspapers being what they usually are – fear-mongering, attention-grabbing, often elucidating the pain-stricken and the suffering – serves its purpose as pointing to the same type of cynical outlook on the world. This is further made clear by photos found in the game, picturing different natural disasters and industrial monstrosities.Is the world that bad? The corporate politics and industrialization of the world seem to worry the creator of this game. Progression and positives boils down to fulfilling the potential of germinal flora (watering plants), progression lies in moving on the obverse side of pollution and general destructiveness of our beloved, morally just nature. In reality the world is a lot more complex. Nature is not nature unless for the knowing subject. The knowing subject interjects moral into an indifferent nature and becomes outraged, reacting accordingly. . . but is this the right way to go about things, or better: to think about things? To revel in indifference, not making equivalent the flesh of man and animal, or even worse, of man and plant, is in a way more comfortable, less existentially terrifying, but at the same time impossible as a being of morality and poetry. Even though the game puts forth a rather naive ecological message, I appreciate it due to it being put in a quaint way, with some piquant moments of sheer beauty being emitted from every pore this game has.Moreover, the models and texture qualities are truly great. From the flaky paint on the walls, to the buckles of water-damaged ceilings, to the wallpaper's bleak and torn appearance, it all looks crisp and detailed enough to feel powerful, to feel like you are in a world truly on the verge of collapse. There is no glaring issue with the looks of the graphics or textures, as far as I am aware of. Although I did manage to get out on a balcony I wasn't supposed to get out on, which subsequently let me see a black textureless wall above. This also forced me to reload the game, since I got stuck out there. But the saves are frequent enough, and progress once made is easily enough retread, so that this was not too frustrating.I find it is always nice to see simple mechanics but complex puzzles in an absolutely beautiful setting. Where gamecreators find the balance aesthetics and mechanics, finding creative solutions to making puzzles interesting despite a lacking set of mechanics available. While the balance is good, I do find the walking to be tiny bit too slow for my taste, making especially some of the deciphering of the language in the game frustrating (it required a lot of walking to and fro between blocks and texts so to verify the correctness of your decoding). Beyond this, and in general, the puzzles are fairly logical and straight forward. Some boil down to trial and error, perhaps due to my stupidity, perhaps due to the design of the puzzle, but there are possibilities of such solutions being the only way forward. Other than that, there is an interesting contrasting of day and night, nightmare and waking life that through gameplay convey the same message the aesthetics and objects in the game do. Or at least plays into it slightly, according to my “reading” or interpretation. When a game has been made conscientiously enough for this mirroring between mechanic and aesthetic/setting to occur, you have to give kudos to that sort of effort. Which is what I am doing now.Some things could have been explained better as well, but were not too difficult to find out, and I would recommend reading some guides for the game just to get some hints as to what you are supposed to do. If you press escape you will see controls, but not all controls used in the game, or all the mechanics that are at play, so keep that in mind and don't feel discouraged to look at guides or whatever other source of information that would help you progress mechanically.In between these larger themes is a more direct story, that I more or less neglected in this “review”. I don't think it should be spoiled, but it is foreshadowed in a nice manner with obscured effects and perhaps through another interpretation of the game's look. They do both play into each other as well, but still distinct and operate on different planes, both in terms of scope and complexity. I am staying deliberately vague here to avoid spoiling anything, and with that in mind there is no real point in delving deeper into the story or symbolism at this moment.So Homesick is a good game, it is interesting, perhaps a bit shattered (not fittingly) in its scope or ambition, where social critique and personal story go not so much hand in hand as side by side, giving occasional glances each other's way just to make sure they are still there. But nonetheless, the game has substance, it is enjoyable and beautiful. It is worth the purchase and it is worth your time, it is worth thinking about; even if the things you'll think about are not necessarily as enjoyable or wonderful as the portrayal of them graphically."

It's got a fair few flaws and you'd probably be better off with another walking sim. Original review below.It's a very pretty walking sim. It is quite short, in terms of the (admittedly flawed) time/£ comparison, it's the same ratio as an actual film, if that matters to you. It is fairly understated, most things are alluded to obliquely until the final twist. It has a nice use of colour in the level layout, even if it is a bit drab to look at generally.Honestly, if the creators read this,I understand the reasons to set the walking speed so slow, but you have erred on the wrong side of the line there. Also how on earth is anyone supposed to get the final puzzle except by accident? Archimedes called and he's very disappointed in your grasp of displacement. And I'm all for not feeling like my hand is being held, but it could have done with more feedback for the incremental parts of the puzzles; label the valves and light switches open/close, on/off, little things like that. Everything being so far apart with the walking speed being so slow made trial and erroring the light switch and radiator puzzles a chore.

But the three teamed developers down at Lucky Pause have really nailed it and delivered a highly polished, extremely rich in detail, emotional tugging, and thought inducing adventure.The objective of 'home sick' is at first vague other than the fact that you have awoken in a extremely run down building littered with books and torn pages filled with strange symbols. Eventually you realise that you need to unlock the secrets of what happened to everyone by finding solice in growing flowers, keeping the lights on in your nightmares and knocking down that next door that bars you from finding out those answers. You will need to teach yourself how to read again, if you are really to get to the core of the mystery.The game is mildly supernatural in that it attempts to explain what a ghost is, why they flicker breifly to the living, why they haunt or are confined to a location and what they need to do in order to move on. This side of the story is all told through graphical detailed art and by also using the art form to incorporate cleverly designed puzzles to convey hidden meaning and subtext.I say mildly supernatural, because it is only hinted and never spoken or conveyed through written language. On the other hand the accompanying main story of everyone in the apartment story and what eventuated to them all is clearly explained in the hundreds of written documents that showcase as a museum to a tragic event. Both stories somewhat tie in nicely in the end leaving you with a somewhat thought provoking and yet enjoyable experience.While the game is relatively short lasting only a few hours there is enough here to warrant a second play through and a solitary reflection of a time that was. It helps you understand how precious life is and how industrial dreams can quickly turn into nightmares as was demonstrated on Apr 26 1986 in the Ukraine.In final I would like to end this review with a simple 'Thankyou' to the developers. Who would have thought great inspirational games could have come from California? Where have you been all this time? The gaming art industry has been in a deep need of a great team like you for a long time!!!Look forward intently to your next work of great inspirational art. This game could do with achievements for those that like to get 100% and personally I would like to buy the truly magnificent musical score which accompanies this masterpiece.

Most of the difficulty behind these 'puzzles' stems from a lack of opening context. However, once you've figured out the context and solved the first puzzle you're half way though finishing this very short game as each subsequent 'puzzle' isn't much more than a variation of the first. The story which is revealed as the game progresses just isn't that interesting or complex - this is nothing compared to something like the Talos Principle.This game is pretty, but its also very short, hollow and unsatisfying."

Why do people stand in line for 2.5 hours to sit in a floating boat for 5 minutes looking at animated pirates? Is not a fast rollercoaster with five loop de loops more exciting? Not necessarily. Herein lies the beauty of a game like Homesick. Anyone can cause an adrenaline dump in your brain by throwing a bunch of speed and action at you thus inducing a sense of excitement, but it takes a true artist to create a masterpiece that appeals to your intellect and emotions in such a way as to leave you breathless when the experience is over. It has been said several times that Homesick has stunning visuals. It certainly does, but in my experience, those stunning visuals served to immerse me into the story to the point that I do not even recognize them anymore. The puzzles are challenging enough to make you earn the ending, which I must say is quite a payoff! Homesick is a masterpiece of an experience. Breathtaking!"

I was a bit on the fence from the descrption, but I purchased it by virtue of the screenshots.  If nothing else, the art direction in this game is haunting.  The game itself is haunting, but not in a ""jump-scare"" sort of way.  There's certainly an underlying story here that you can choose to explore further, or you can simply ignore it.The game is essentially a puzzle game.  There are a number of puzzles throughout the game.  In order to move to the next area, you must complete all of the puzzles in the current area.  Some pieces are simple to figure out; others are a bit more complicated.I do find some of the puzzles to be a bit redundant.  Or at least there's enough of a trend that you can somewhat figure out other puzzles based on those you've solved already.  That's not to say the game isn't challenging.  You will certianly be pushed into thinking.Meanwhile, I do wish the game could have been a bit longer or had a bit more content for me to explore.   I really do appreciate the method of storytelling in this game.  Sometimes the story is much more interesting with the less-is-more approach.  I haven't seen such subtle storytelling since Portal 2.  Sometimes it's the story that isn't told that makes it much more memorable.  Even so, the game is fairly short, and there isn't much reason to replay.In summary:  The game is a casual but challenging puzzle in a first-person-shooter-like presentation.  It's haunting, mesmerizing but most of all fun."

There are no instructions, which usually I enjoy figuring things out on my own! But the walking mechanic is painfully slow so if you miss something, you can't run around and search for it. You crawl. Painfully slowly. The puzzles are somewhat repetitive, and the character decoder puzzle isn't until the very end so if you want backstory, you have to craaawl back through the game from the beginning to get all of the lore and vague backstory. Everything that happened before the game start is hinted at as opposed to outright explained. If the game was less than $5, I'd consider recommending it. But at $15, I cannot say it's worth the money.It's also a bit more creepy and unsettling than I was expecting, and there's a bit of  a jump scare at the very end. If you've heard of the uncanny valley when it comes to people, that was the other half of my issue with the scare. I'm still a bit unnerved from it."

But when you go back and read all the text you passed by, you will be let down by what you find.The story is very minimal, and mostly relies on the player guessing what happened, and during the end there is a big reveal that is played as a shock, instead of used to further a story.

Yes.I feel like the length of this game does not effect the experience, as the opposite is true with so many games. By the end, you'll probably be wanting more but you still have the sense of finishing a complete story. Homesick's goal isn't to hit the finish line as fast as you can... You can equate this game to a short story. How far you want to dive into the story is up to you.One of the major puzzles in the game requires some cypher decoding, this forces you to read at least some of the information about the characters. The reward at the end isn't a speed record or some count on how many 'totems' you've collected. The true reward is the impact the ending has on you. The more you uncover while playing the game, the greater the impact will be.A complaint you might see other users having is how easy Homesick's puzzles are. I can definitely agree. This is no Rubix cube. What this is, is a story unfolding; a character discovering the same things you are in real time. It might be a 25 piece jigsaw puzzle, but what you have when you are finished putting it together will give you chills...What i find most amazing about this game is how easy it was to learn more and more about it's enviroment.

The pace of the game isn't rushed with combat or platformer-esque puzzles, instead you're free to meander and take in all the ambience (and Homesick has it by the bucket-load).The biggest drawback in the game would be the length: my playthrough took just over two hours to complete.

They've done plenty of things right, but could have perhaps done some things better. The initial game gives almost no tutorial or introduction, which even I found somewhat daunting at first. After a few trial-and-errors, you begin to figure it out if you have the patience for it, which I'm afraid a lot of people might not have.If you can get over this hurdle, the game opens up rapidly. It does get bogged down in some areas with puzzles that, while the solutions usually make sense, can take a lot of patience to figure out. I have to admit, I needed to use some user hints on the forums because a game mechanic wasn't explained to me. The mechanic in particular was the block puzzle. I was not aware I could press a keyboard letter to change the symbol to that letter, despite looking at a dozen blocks, it never occured to me that you were able to do that. It's a great idea, but if you don't provide some context, people won't know what you want from them.The beautiful environment is a healthy balance between grey and green, and it sounds good to boot. The story even starts to come together at the end with a little twist.

This isn't a horror game and there's nothing overtly ""scary"" involved, but there is some definite creepiness to the locale that is a marked contrast to the soothing music.  It's a fascinating juxtaposition.+ The puzzles are relatively straightforward if you're paying attention (which you should be!).  There are some spoiler-free guides available for people having trouble; I would greatly encourage trying everything you can think of first before going to a guide, and if you do need one, definitely use a spoiler-free one so you can experience everything firsthand.+ There's a point where you can go back and get some information you couldn't in the beginning.  I strongly recommending going back and reading anything you couldn't at first, because the backstory you gain is great.+ The game isn't overly long but the beautiful graphics and soundtrack combined with interesting gameplay, plus an overarching message that is important and yet not heavy-handed, make it worth the price in my opinion.  I picked it up on sale but would gladly have paid full price.+ The ending was short but fit perfectly.

In Homesick you spend the majority of the game wandering through such a building that nature has already started to reclaim. As the game progresses you pick up hints as to what led to the building's fate, but it isn't until near the very end that the full picture is revealed. The music and atmosphere manage to be both soothing and unnerving at the same time and there are enough clues to the puzzles that even newbies into the puzzle genre should be able to figure them out in due time.The only major drawback I experienced in the game was bugs in the inventory. You might be walking down a hallway and the game will bring up the (calculator)** from your inventory. Even though you didn't request it and don't need it, now you're holding a (calculator)**. Or maybe you think 'I bet I could get past this obstacle with a (firetruck)**! I have one in my inventory here I know *scroll scroll scroll* Let's see...

Little did I know....This game touched my soul on a level that I didn't expect it to. Superb story. I rate it up with Gone Home and Among the Sleep. It has excellent puzzles, but also lays out a backstory that leaves you guessing until the very end. Reflecting back on the experience, I realize now how much work the developers put into placing certain items of interest in specific areas, making sure you don't discover them too soon, or too late. It's such a bitersweet experience. The best way I can explain the experience without giving too much away is...a surreal thought provoking adventure that throws in a few surprises along the way.I would highly recommend to set aside a few hours to immerse yourself. Take your time, explore every nook and cranny, and backtrack occasionally. The puzzles take some trial and error, but leave you feeling rewarded for not giving up."

It is a short game which can be finished within 4-6 hours. Although the visuals are stunning and the atmosphere is captivating, most of the game is spent by trying to understand how the game works and try to make sense the puzzles. Late in the game the game introduces a long and very good puzzle however it is introduced quite late in the game. At the end, when the whole story is kind of revealed, the story makes more sense but then I have the feeling of a lost opportunity instead of a better understanding of the game as a whole.Pros:- Very beatiful environment and visuals.- Captivating atmosphere and environment.- A long but good puzzle near the end.- Good storyline but could have been explained much, much better.Cons:- Most of the game is spent by trying to understand the basic mechanics of the game.- Story could have been explained much, much better.- Some puzzles are really stretching the imagination too far."

But does the game live up to the online comic's standards?As promised by the Kickstarter, the video game takes place in the same universe as the comic, but is otherwise its own separate story, so knowledge of the comic is not necessary to enjoy the game for what it is.  However, fans of the comic will still appreciate the occasional references to the comic's events, and they may have a better understading of the context of the plot.  For example, the protagonist is a player whose session has prematurely ended.  The game begins with the player waking up after successfully achieving god tier in spite of their limitations, and now they must learn to use their powers to navigate the deteriorating session, which has constricted them to a small building.Visually, the game is very much a departure for the series--or at least one would initially assume.  Given the setting, which resembles a colorless apartmentment complex, I believe Hussie is purposely recreating the stark, simple visuals of Problem Sleuth.  Even the puzzles are reminiscent of the puzzles the Problem Sleuth characters face; one moment, you're picking up keys to unlock a door.  The next moment, your keys have suddenly turned into an axe that you're using to chop down the doors instead.As you learn to properly navigate the world's dream bubbles and solve puzzles that impact the real world, you will come across writings left behind by other characters.  True to the Homestuck name, there are several characters involved with the story, and none of them really take the role of ""main character""--everyone is equally important.  One minor complaint, though: Those who have read the comic are already familiar with the fact that each character has a unique ""voice"", following different methods of punctuation, capitalization, and sometimes substituting letters for numbers according to their personality.  Apparently Hussie was REALLY desperate to continue this trend despite having already fully explored the concept, because in this game, every new character writes entirely in abstract symbols.  I appreciate a running joke as much as anyone, but sometimes you can take things too far.Overall, though, there are quite a few noticeable differences between the game and the comic.  The visuals are much more realistic and detailed, the music is slower-paced... Actually, the whole game in general is very slow-paced compared to the comic.  It makes me wonder what Hussie was thinking as he directed the game.  Maybe he's decided he wants to explore new methods of expression as he matures as an artist.  Or maybe he's just trolling all of us.  That's usually what I assume the explanation is whenever he does something confusing.In short: This is one of the more pleasant walking simulators that focuses on exploration and learning new things about your environment at a slow pace.  I suggest it to those who are interested in taking it easy.  Sometimes it is very important to relax and not take things seriously.P.S. Steam please revive Namco High."

This is done through direct story telling. Most of it is indirect that is built into the game’s puzzles and level design. Even the music that is playing radiants the emotions your character is going through as you play then finally beat the game.StoryI can't go into the story to much without ruining the plot but the game is short enough where if you want to try something new but don't have 40 hours to get the whole story of a game this is a good start. With the said the game will depress you and leave you with a few extra questions by the end of it. So if you have depression or are having a bad day i recommend avoid playing this game until you get into a more positive mood.GameplayThe game is in a first person view and you wander around an apartment building by yourself trying to piece together what happened to everyone. You solve puzzles based on the environments around you that add to story and aid in the feeling of loneliness.Final thoughtsI recommend this game if you want a “movie” experience of a myst like game.

Whatever you think makes a good game, Homesick has it.Do you know what it's like to have amnesia? I think I did once, but I don't remember... But that's what this game is all about: figuring out what the hell is going on. Now while that might seem like an overused trope at best, and a really cliche and boring videogame staple at worst, Homesick does such a great job with it that I can quite easily completely overlook the generic aspect of the motivations the main character has.You wake up in a hotel room, surrounded by similar rooms: all empty. Your goal is to figure out what the hell happened and why. Along the way, you'll read about your fellow residents (may they rest in peace), they're reasons for coming here, and (if you're thorough and really, really clever), you may figure out what the darker conspiracy is...All I can tell you is this: a major disaster occured, and this building (or rather, the city the buildilng is in) was at the heart of it. If you want to know what the actual event was, you should play for yourself.The visuals are stunning. I've never stepped foot into a game right from the get-go and said: ""Wow, this place is freaking dilapidated, but I could totally see myself living here."" Visually, it's just so well-done that I can't help but gush about it.The score is just... oh. Rarely, if ever, am I willing to buy the soundtrack to a game. The two exceptions to that rule are Portal 2 and this game. Which reminds me, I still need to buy this games soundtrack. Hang on...Well, now that my wallet is lighter, on to gameplay. I know what you're going to say: walking simulator. And while, yes, most of the game is just walking around, interacting with notes and file cabinets, picking up miscellaneous tools and using them in specified locations in the building, the one mechanic I love is when you ""go to sleep"".See, there are sleeping areas of various forms all over the place. Every set of puzzles in an area revolves around eventually growing these blue flowers near where you can sleep. You can only go to sleep in an area once the flowers have grown, and once you go to sleep, you enter the dream world. In the dream world, there's a sence of urgency you don't feel in the waking world. Shadows that come up like stalagmites on a cavern floor slowly surround you, so if you don't want to get swallowed, moving is key. It'll take a while of standing in one place to actually trigger a ""game over"" (which just starts you back at the beginning of the dream sequence), but the feeling of being rushed is definitely present. You have an axe, can't interact with anything that you can while awake, and have to find a particular door to smash down using your axe. Follow the sound of scattered conversation and you'll find where you need to go. Stick to the light, and you'll be safe. Beware what lurks in the shadows...These sequences are important, because it's how you unlock new areas to explore in the waking world. It's so cool and surreal and makes you feel like everything you do has a purpose, even though it's all scripted anyway.The attention to detail in this game is amazing. Every mechanic makes sense to the overarching story about why you're there and what happened (once again, no spoilers), and it feels all so well-done and expertly crafted that I just can't wipe this freaking grin off my face.Now for the ending. No spoilers, but I will say this: you will cry.If you play games for fun gameplay, exciting story modes, challenges and completionist ratings, this game is not for you. But if you love a good experience, one that tugs on the violin strings in your heart, one that makes you cry, laugh, and feel shocked, startled, and sometimes, even scared, then Homesick is most definitely for you. And for all you money-grubbers out there who don't want to spend all your Steam Cash in one place, let me let you in on a little secret:after playing this game all the way through, I can say it was definitely not worth $15 to me specifically.I would've paid $30."

It's practically a crawl.  The entire game I was ready to throw my computer across the room because I didn't have a run button.Secondly, the puzzles are not rewarding, or at least I did not find them rewarding.  They're mostly frustrating, again MOSTLY because of how slowly you're forced to walk.Probably the most annoying thing is the inventory system.  You're unable to simply select the item you'd like to use.  You're instead made to scroll through every item to get to the one you want.  I felt like I spent half the game walking, and half the game selecting items from my inventory.The especially annoying part is that sometimes I would make a full rotation, while scrolling through my inventory, and STILL THE ITEM I WANTED WOULDN'T SHOW UP.  Meaning I had to make two full rotations through it before what I wanted would show up.Why do I have to keep picking my keys back up after I use them, but the proddy stick is in my inventory for the duration of the game, even though I only used it once?All in all, 10/10, what a beautiful game.Just kidding, this is the first game I've wanted my money back.  0/10 would not recommend.The puzzles are illogical, unsatisfying, and the game is glitchy.  I only beat it so I could be done with it.By the way, 2 hours of my playtime were spent watching a movie with the game running. The only reason it takes longer than 10 minutes to beat is how slowly you walk."

I purchased it instantly, hoping to relive the intense joy of playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, which in much ways seemed similar to this game.For those who played ""Ethan Carter"" as well, you will remember how the puzzles and gameplay were contributing to your comprehesion of the story. Slowly uncovering the truth was an incredibly rewarding experience.This is where Homesick vastly differs.Its puzzles remind you of that point-and-click adventure you once bought but barely played. Once again you'll find yourself revisiting every area, clicking on every object in the hope something will happen. You'll wonder why the game isn't progressing and finally discover it was waiting for you to -whatever- water a plant or something. While the dreams (interactive cutscenes) give away the story pretty quickly, discovering the solution to a puzzle won't help your comprehension at all.Homesick features a linear progressing story, invisible walls, simple yet tedious puzzles and slow gameplay,As such, I'm afraid I did not enjoy it."

I must say I'm a bit disappointed. You wake up in an abandoned house that looks and feels a bit Silent Hillish. Everything seems broken, like the house has been abandoned a long time ago, and yet you wake up there and got no idea what you are doing there. The light that shines in through the windows hurts you and blinds you so you gotta stay away from it. You find books and notes everywhere but you can't read them as they are written in glyphs. So far, an interesting start. Then you walk through the house in slow motion (yes, you walk pretty slow) and gather informations about what happened. Finding out how to read the books and notes took me the longest, and sadly this was the only slightly challenging part of the game. All the other ""riddles"" and tasks were quite obvious and way too easy for an adventure game. The story behind Homesick is not bad even, but the only way to really get it is by reading all the journals and notes that you find on your way. That's something that I enjoy doing, but a bit more in-game-storytelling wouldn't have hurt. The graphics are a pro of Homesick. They are solid for an adventure game, but not outstanding, and the engine needs to be optimized as in addition to the general slow motion, it also lagged way too much on my PC and nope, it definitely ain't my hardware. I would have ignored that if at least the story and puzzles entertained me well enough to make this a game to remember, but sadly, with the sudden and unsatisfying ending, it's rather a game that I'll soon have forgotten about. They could. and should have made more out of this."

There's probably only about 16 minutes of actual content in this game. It manages to stretch that 16 minutes of content to around 2 to 5 hours via puzzles, but the puzzels themselves are so incredibly obtuse that there's no way you'll make it through the game without having to look at a walkthrough.Oh, and I encountered a progression blocking bug in the game, which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks because there are no manual saves. I lost an hour and a half of progress I made painstakingly deciphering the in-game alphabet. I just stopped playing at that point and watched the rest of the playthrough on YouTube.I hate giving this game a negative review because it's made by a small developer, but this totally isn't worth $11. If you're in it for the atmosphere/story, I would recommend ""The Old City: Leviathian""... it has much more than 16 minutes worth of content.If you're in it for obtuse puzzles, there are probably better games for that as well. Try ""Anna"".EDIT: Okay, so it turns out that you can manually save. You can do so by ""sleeping"". But once again, this isn't obvious. It isn't made clear to you that you can do this. Once you reach a new area, you can no longer sleep in the old sleeping locations, and the new sleeping location is not made clear to you. Sometimes it's a couch, sometimes its a matress on the floor, and sometimes its an actual bed. No indication is given to the player."

The game is not bad per se, it just does not offer much.There are some interesting things in the way the game tries to stear the player without using text or cut scenes, but it is a bit hit or miss (there is a whole puzzle that remains a total mystery to me thanks to a lack of clues and feedbacks) and the puzzles themselves are not exactly awe inspiring. There is not much to chew on as far as story go and while the environement and music are commendable in their execution there is a total lack a variety.A bit of a shame, because I am absolutely in favor of this type of compact format for games. A 2 to 5 hours game requires a quantity of content that is managable for a small team, BUT the format also requires a very high level of quality and/or originality that simply is not there in Homesick."

Sadly no. It's like having your hands tied and walking through treacle. I can't recommend this game I'm afraid.Problems:1) There is a use of glaring light to prevent you walking to the windows. This is obviously to save the developers having to do anything with the outside scenery. This would be fine except the shafts of light that appear are solid and prevent you walking!2) The walking speed is slow. You have to walk up and down the same damned corridor over and over, very very slowly.3) To save the game you have to go to a certain place in the house. Another slow walk down the corridor even when you've had enough and want to exit the game.4) The cursor is tiny and the same colour as the room - it gave me eyestrain trying to spot it. And you need to spot it, because it's the only visual clue that something can be interacted with.5) All the rooms are so similar (at the beginning at least. I haven't gone any further) it's like the same texture has been used everywhere.6) I've picked up many books and pieces of paper that are all written in a code, and put them down again as the key doesn't come until later in the game. What a massive waste of time. I can't even keep the papers in my inventory - I just pick up - and put straight down.I'm bored with it - it needs a considerable overhaul.Go and play firewatch or vanishing ethan."

This game leaves a bit more to be desired in its puzzles. The first two were barely memorable, the gym was sort of random, but the alphabet puzzle was flawless. The last one took complex work and searching for clues that aren't obviously given out. The first two puzzles did that, too, but the alphabet puzzle was by far the most challenging one. The main point here, though, is that all of the puzzles weren't explicitly telling the player how to complete them, which is rare for any game today. However, I think more fine-tuning could be helpful.Beautiful environments, perfect lighting, and fitting noises and abiance. They nailed it with the admosphere. Like, Silent Hill 2 level nailed it with the atmosphere. I don't think I've played another game on steam that had me this engaged with just the atmosphere.

Story wise, things start to unfold once you are able to decipher the texts.  It was a little underwhelming since I was able to guess the ending about halfway through.  The greatest strength of the game is the melancholy atmosphere which is aptly conveyed via the excellent, yet subdued soundtrack, and the reflective, somber, and sometimes entertaining letters and book excerpts.If you're desperate to kill a few hours, enjoy these ""walking simulator"" type atmospheric games, and have $15 to blow, go ahead.

Player spawns in a beautifully deteriorated abandoned building, littered with notes that dont make sense. There's absolutely no story to start with. This game gives you a feeling that some developers are trying to be overly artsy and *deep*, especially with the pianomusic playing in the background. You're just thrown into a beautiful gameworld to wander around... slowly.. frustratingly slowly. The first puzzle involves you finding a bucket, filling it with dirty tub water and watering the plants in your room. Thats apparently supposed to make some sense I guess. When you've finished a puzzle, your character starts yawning and that's when you're supposed to sleep in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bed you spawned in. This is actually where the most exciting thing happens - you apparently black out and get to walk around more freely. You're armed with an axe and should avoid the black spasm dripping everywhere. This is when every text is legible, and that's when you're offered the opportunity to learn a new language. Really? That's a bit too much to ask. Can't be bothered! Keycode puzzles allow you to rotate the numbers only to one direction. So If you've missed a number, you need to click 9 times to get back to the correct number.  Also the bloom effect is way too strong! You want to make me blind? Damn. It's just tacky compared to the otherwise beautiful graphics.TLDR; not worth it! Only if you have the patience to start deciphering the notes and stuff, this might actually be OK. For more casual puzzle lovers, I'd strongly recommend ""The vanishing of Ethan Carter"""

SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!]If you go with the mood and resist the urge to be analytic, it will be very good. Someone put a LOT of work into the settings. The entire game has an apocalyptic ambience that makes Fallout 3 look like a bridal boutique. It isn't scary. It's upsetting and unsettling. There is a difference. Something ghastly happened here, and the fact that there aren't skulls grinning at you from all the trash heaps makes it worse, not better. The effect that the light has on you is somewhat contrived (dizziness might have been better than just bodily forcing you away from the windows), but that's a minor point. The various actions that you have to take to move through the game seem natural in the context of the feeling established. In other words, if you go with your emotional reactions and sensations, it's horrifyingly good.If you turn on your analytic functions, even for a little bit, you're screwed.There is no reason for you being there in the first place (it's clearly a long time since the key disaster has struck). The way you end levels and level up is irrelevant to... well ANYTHING that can be handled rationally; absent the emotional context, it would be a flimsy tissue of absurdities. The game has none of the realism of ""Gone Home"" or even ""Dear Esther."" The texts in the game begin incomprehensible (at first I thought they'd been written in Inuit or Cherokee), and the way they are rendered readable is arbitrary to the point of absurdity. The reason given for the tragedy is banal in the extreme (note that I'm not saying it's unrealistic, just threadbare from over-use), and some of the supporting material is hamhanded in its bluntness. Okay. Companies are (or can be) evil. I learned that from the Doomguy many years ago, and even though it's true, the way the message is expressed in a number of the texts here is as subtle as a kick in the nuts. And the ending makes no logical sense and has no logical connection to what came before, whatsoever.The conclusion here is not that the game is bad. It isn't if you take it the right way. Decline to analyze and rely on your emotions, and it will be haunting. But the extent to which this is true is far greater than with other games of its kind, and I can't help thinking that a little more attention should have been paid to reducing or at least hiding its absurdities.(Approaching it purely through the emotions also renders it very replayable.)I'm changing my original ""no"" to a ""yes"" because there is a legitimate way to play through the game that makes it a very moving experience. But be warned -- start flipping the wrong switches in your mind and you'll feel that it was a silly waste of time. This is a risk it really should not have taken."

While I cannot say it is indeed a bad game in itself, Homesick did leave me feeling very disappointed. It felt like it had much more potential than the final product offered.So, where do I begin? Visually speaking, the game is quite lovely at times. Other visual aspects felt repetitive and lackluster. The game itself does not expand across a vast area, but rather small, intertwined rooms and areas. Many of the graphics were overused throughout different rooms. This building, which is now empty, was once occupied by many people, but their own personalities rarely show in their personal apartments. Most of the apartments consist of the same furniture rearranged in different ways, with maybe a few unique items on the wall. Every apartment has the same bathroom and when looking through the windows, the outside of the building itself looks sloppy and unappealing. I felt that with such little space and a high price, the creators could have gone the extra mile into the details to make sure every room in the game was unique.In terms of content, I felt the game was also lacking. Most of the (few) puzzles in the game are uninteresting and difficult to understand without any clear guide. There were very few times in the game where I could move forward without the help of one. I know there are some others who had an easier time getting through the puzzles, and I applaud them. I guess I don't have quite the same amount of ""logic"" to solve these puzzles. Some of the puzzles were either boring, too short, or unoriginal. One particular puzzle involving blocks was the one time in the game where I felt I was enjoying the experience other than the nice music.The story itself also did not unfold well for me. The first half of the game was simply solving puzzles in confusion and frustration as to what I was trying to achieve and why. This beginning half of the game did not give me enough story or instruction which made it feel tedious. By the time the story and my understanding of it began to unfold, I already had a bad taste in my mouth due to all the frustration and not as invested as I felt I could have been.Because of this, I do not feel that the game is worth the price, and that's why I cannot recommend it. It felt unpolished and the gameplay itself is nothing but tedious besides that one puzzle. This game is about 1-5 hours long depending on how well you do on the puzzles. I used a guide after trying to figure out the puzzles and it took me about 3 hours. If you still want to try it, I recommend buying it when it is cheap on sale and not at full price."

Good atmoshere and music, slowly figuring out what happened not by narration or dialogue but finding and reading the materials in the place. Negatives: it's short and wouldn't get unless on sale. The movement speed was annoyingly slow, biggest complaint by far.Only get if it's on sale."

This game I was able to play through in under 2 hours, and it is well worth the price when on sale. There is more content then what I explored, so completionists will get a bit more run time out of it then I have.The long and short of it is this:I have to recommend this game!Amazing atmosphere in all aspects of art and soundLogical puzzles, just think about them and try to be creative. Hint try to move around with everything you pick up.short but engaging story with a well paced revealall in all, if you enjoy short games especially slow and thoughtful point and click style puzzles this is a must play if you can pick it up on sale!"

,Recommended,244910,23291815,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,Wrath of Tron,"A decent enough game with decent enough puzzles. Homesick isn't a game that I can go on about. It's nice-ish looking and if you're willing to work for it, it has a pretty haunting little story to it. The game itself if pretty easy and can go by quickly. Honestlly the best part of it was the text cypher.A basic walking sim with pretty basic puzzles that rests just this side of mediocre. I'd pick it up again, but probably during a sale."

Playing it is sort of a zen-like experience.  There was a little translation mini-game that I enjoyed.  All told, I'd say if you can get it for under $10 bucks like I did, it's worth a few hours of quiet fun.  At full price, however, I just can't recommend it.  7/10"

Very short but also very intense (not to mention polished, for a change). Environments are rich in detail, and the piano/cello soundtrack is wonderfully touching."
,Not Recommended,244910,33449016,Posted: 10 July,all,Svenz0r,Having completed Homesick I have to say that I am severely underwhelmed.A lot of puzzles felt lacking and the only difficulty was figuring out what was supposed to be a puzzle. Add to that the painfully slow movement speed and it sadly made the game feel like more of a chore than a fun experience.With an overall very short completion time and very little in the way of stimulating puzzles I can't really recommend this game even for the AUD$9 I paid for it while it was on sale.

Even if the story is at low (You heva to adopt and escape from a place), there are some contiuous challeges to help advance... I am not juding this game becasue of its logic or concepts - but it could be more heavy for the averarge ones."
,Not Recommended,244910,33600892,Posted: 16 July,all,emry876,"The soundtrack is hands down one of the best pieces of a gaming score I have ever heard...the game? Not so much. I don't mind drop and play games - in fact The Vanishing of Ethen Carter was done beautifuly - but, when a game drops you into an enviroment that has no logic behind the hints that you read on the internet, then makes you backtrack the entire game just to know what is actually going on...well that is where I have a problem. Poorly constructed, and built with puzzles that I'm sure the level designer is patting himself on the back with, while we all scratch our heads in frustration. This game could have been one of the best PC puzzle games I have ever played, but to say they dropped the ball is calling it an understatement. Buy it (on sale) for the score, and ditch the game itself. I'm not a mind reader, and, honestly, your sub-par ""convuluted"" plot is not clever.  Also - if games that provide 150 hours of gameplay are 30 bucks, why should I pay 15 bucks for about 1 hour of gameplay and 1 hour of google searches?Oh and by the way, I hope you know how to read Latin and Sheet Music."
