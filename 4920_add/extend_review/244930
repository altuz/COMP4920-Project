,Recommended,244930,20322840,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,TheDaG,"I got this game after binge watching snowboarding films ( Its January and no hills in Scotland have any snow, I need my fix... ) and deciding to check steam for SSX, NO SSX on steam but it does have this early access game. To say the least I was intrigued. Before I go any further theres a couple of questions you will need to ask yourselfDo you love snowsports?Did you love SSX 3 and SSX  ( the newer 1 )? with its freeroamy goodnessDo you want to experience what pulling a 1080 feels like in first person?Can you afford to go snowboarding in other countries? ( I can't :(IF you answered yes to any of the first 3 questions and no to the last one then this game is for you. IF you answered yes to the last question then what are you doing on your PC? book that holiday to Tignes, Mayrhofen or where ever and do it for real. Read on for a more descript reviewStill reading? Good now lets break this downGraphics - The graphics are great, I mean its a freeskiing/snowboarding game so theres no explosions or anything fancy just fantastic looking mountains and pistes. The snows nice with persistent trails from your previous runs and the characters look well textured which is just as well cause you need to show off that fancy piece of kit you just plowed your hard earned credits into.Gameplay - The game is split into offline and online and in either of them you can choose to do events or freeroam. The events cover pretty much every category of skiing and snowboarding with time trial, freestyle etc... and the freeroam... well lets just say your plonked onto whichever part of the mountain you want and you go from there. At the time of review there is 1 mountain and several big air parks, don't let that put you off, the Mountain is huge ( of course it is, its a mountain ) The skiing itself seems fine but can be a little funny at times with some quirky bugs. I started a run and my character was stuck in the Jesus pose until I respawned or the fact that if you crash your body ragdolises as if you were made out of rubber.  I need to mention as well this game plays like a simulation so theres no insane tricks that make your ski's pop off and fly around your head before magically reattaching..... looking at you SSXMusic - The music is good, it could be better with some extra tunes and maybe some from that previous SSX game but the music they do have is chosen well for the snowscene. It would be good to see the total tracks or be able to skip them as a couple of times during freeroam its played the first track and then stopped. If anyone has been on a mountain without any music they know what thats like. Theres always steam music tho i supposeCustomization - The customization in this game is snow joke ( I had to ) This is where the game really shines, at the time of this review I am eagerly awaiting the release of the snowboarding part of the game however from looking through the items just for skiing theres is a HUGE amount to pick from. You kit your character out from head to toe literally, Chose hats,helmets,goggles,jackets,trousers,boots,skis,poles face masks & even bindings. Each of these categories have recent kit from most of the popular brands such as K2, Scott & Head to name just a few.Multiplayer - I actually haven't played much of multiplayer, my first attempt was met with huge lag. Second attempt and I saw 1 other person on the mountain which i followed in the hopes of showing my mad skills to. got ahead of him and prepared to hit a kicker unfortuntately I ended up hitting him and we both bailed. Which would of been fine but for some reason in multiplayer you can only restart at the top of the mountain and not where you bailed. Needless to say he bailed from the game. The developers are aware of the connection issues and are trying to improve it so hopefully it will be sorted soon as this is an integral part of the game, Imagine you and a couple of buddies on the side of the hill with a kicker taking turns at hitting it. For me that sounds perfectTo sum things up this game has huge potential, they are adding in snowboarding soon and If they add in the same amount of gear for snowboarding as they have for skiing I will be a very very happy person. As with any early access game theres still a long way to go. However again I highly recommend this game for any fan of snowsports or the SSX games.Some things i would like to see in the released game.Ability to get off skis/board and wander around + the ability to spawn in objects & move them ( such as ramps, tables etc ) for limited amounts of time to make your own jibs etc kinda like what SKATE hadIf you use a chair lift can we maybe be able to sit and watch from it as we go back up ( with the ability to skip ) sounds boring but its actually quite entertaining seeing whats going on from them especially when people bail :pSnowmobiles, currently used much like the chair lifts when you interact they take you to certain spawns instead maybe when we use them we could actually drive them to where ever. Would open the game up alot more.Weather and snow conditions - Everyone loves a bluebird day however in Scotland getting a bluebird day is a rare thing and i presume its the same for places everywhere else? Stoked had a fantastic weather system with storms that altered the snow conditions. It would be great to see the same thing done hereMountains - More mountains... can never have enough mountains"

Backers got to play one version of the game, and now that version has been subsumed by transactions and glitchy features and collision. Maybe don't impliment a cash shop until your UI is in one piece? I managed to accidentally buy 3 copies of the same pants, exhausting my early-access founder ""funbucks"" currency. Not keeping track of this game anymore, which is a shame, because it started off feeling an awful lot like a laid-back SSX with drones and a sandbox approach."

This game should not become free to play if it means making the users pay just to switch ski's in game, just release the game as $15 and give us all the feature. thumbs up if they fix the merchendise tho"
,Recommended,244930,7748230,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,[RT] Jdog90000,"Update: The game now has sound and effects like ski trails etc. The controls are rough and movement still need balancing though.Definitely has the best feel of a modern snow game. The game is in alpha, there is no sound, yet I still enjoyed every second skiing down the mountain. If you like skiing you will love this even in its unfinished state. It can only go up from here.Edit: So I'm going to add a little more to this review because apparently people are actually reading it.Here's what you can complain about: Lack of sound and snow effects.Sound's no big deal, just play some of your own music in the background for now. It's the effects that really throw everything off. Your character is basically just on the mountain, as of right now there's no interaction between the skis and the mountain; no tracks, no little specks of snow going everywhere as you might expect from skis in snow. But I'm sure that's in the works, and honestly once the sound and those little effcts are in the game is more than recommendable if you enjoy the winter sports.There's a little bit of a learning curve but I'd venture a guess and say it's easier to learn to play this game than actually ski.Earlier today they put out a big update and really cleaned up a lot of the UI. The menu isn't all over the place and flicking out of view and they have the basic framework down for the multiplayer. It's looks really promising.Now of course there's bugs here and there, the previous update completely broke the options menu but I have yet to encounter any crashing while actually playing the game itself which is something.As I'm writing this there are no negative reviews so that should tell you that yes, if you're unsure whether or not  to buy it and it seems interesting, but you're afraid it won't turn out great down the road; I'd recommend it even in it's current state."

I even paid for the founders pack. the physics, speed, and style of this game are not there anymore. Micro transactions are the meaning of this game now.

But if i spend 1699 in game credit, i get one outfit with a set of skii's. I use to spend hours on one part of the mountain, trying to see what i could acomplish on that section. Now i cant even stand playing the game for a few minutes without getting bored. This game may be good for someone looking to throw money at a company. But someone who has been following the game since the beginning, just like many others sadly might want to do too, i have to give it a 1/10.

No.The latest update - the ""Beta"" update on March 10th completely changed the game from something good with lots of potential to.. something that feels less like a game and more like a cash grab. They've added microtransactions for any sort of cosmetic item. Anything that one could originally use on their character for free in the Alpha has been put behind a paywall. As of now, you can only get these items through purchasing a ""credit pack"" and getting them that way.The developer says that they will eventually add ways to earn these items in the game, but to release a major ""update"" with the microtransactions in-game for people like myself who already spent money on said game is a red flag. I know that the developers need to make a living and game development isn't cheap. On their forums, a developer has said that it was economically unwise for them to charge $15 or so for the base game and have everyone unlock the gear from the start - thus the microtransactions. However, I fail to see why exactly this business model has been adapted - it would have been much easier to just increase the price of the game accordingly - instead of adding a microtransaction system.Again, I realize that the developers need to make a profit. That's fine - but the current business model is not the best way to go, and if a drastic, negative change took place from Alpha to Beta, it makes me skeptical about what the future holds. Only time will tell. However, as of now, the game does not appear to be something worth investing in."

But now the game constantly crashes for me, they added micro-transactions and they made the movements worse than what they were in the beggining... I also have to add that the biggest part of the fun (with the launch version) was to explore the mountain with the ""cheating mode"" that was a mode you activated while pressing F1 and could drop your character anywhere you wanted on the mountain.

I'll update this review once I've had a chance to try it out. Until then, take this with a pinch of salt]I do recommend this game, but it's a grudging recommendation...The good:* The scenery is stunning* Going off-piste is fantastic* It has bags of potential* Pretty damned good simulation (especially since the latest update, still a few glitches but generally OK)* Excellent music* Great fun to relax and unwind with (I prefer free roam to doing events)* Lots of features being added / improved* Dev team seem committed and I see no signs of vapourware* I haven't personally had any performance issues (although I've seen post from some who have)* Rift support!The bad:* Microtransactions (At least they're currently cosmetic only)* If you want to get to the good spawn points, you have to grind XP* Features keep being removed* Updates are a little slow and there's no target 1.0 date* Controls could do with a tweak (especially moving the camera in 3rd person)* Grinding XP (worth mentioning again, especially when wiping out costs unbanked XP)Perhaps I was spoiled by playing very early versions of this game, but I loved if because it left me alone on a mountain to explore and go where I wanted. Now, however, if you want to try the best bits of the mountain, you need to grind XP which is still insanely slow in Free Roam mode.I may be wrong but I get the impression that once the game is Free2Play, the devs are worried people won't hang around long enough to spend money. Unfortunately, it's turned a fun, relaxing game into yet another slog.I do still recommend it, just. It's beautiful and worth playing, but IMHO it's worse overall than it used to be."

They found out they have to pay real money to customize their skiers looks2. The latest update has a few glitches that need to be ironed out.However, consider that:A. The game will EVENTUALLY be free to play, and they will fund the game on in game purchases. It currently is not because the game is still in early access. You are paying extra money to access the game early .. NOT TO BUY THE GAME. You might think that is stingey, but this is an independantly developed game by a company with LIMITED RESOURCES .. they need your money to make the game!B. Early Access = glitches .. welcome to the world of modern game development.If you can get past those 2 points and have more patience than a 5 year old whiner, then this game is the BEST Skiing game ever made, and IMO the BEST Winter sports game ever made.The major selling point is that the game takes a more grounded ""less arcadey"" approach, while the physics are still a little loose to allow you to pull off some silly jumps, it mostly gets there and it does it well. You can explore a full mountain with little to no restrictions, which includes a resort complete with lifts (which will be rideable eventually) and an entire back country area. There are a plethora of ways down the mountain, and nothing limits you in any direction.This is the Skiing game I have been wishing for since I was 5, and I fully recommend it."

With all the maps, challenges and events aswell as achievements, the lifetime of SNOW is sure good BUT there are A LOT of bugs, gamebreaking or not, here's a list of bugs I encountered:In the event ""The Devil's Descent"", when you spawn there's stone walls on the left, but they don't have hitboxes so you can go trough them and skip a small part of the descentWith the drone, if you rush in stones while boosting and going up, down etc... You can go trough the stonesThe most horrible bug, sometimes, with NO reason, your player keep crashing when he spawn, again and again, even restarting the game don't change the problem, idk how to correct it...In the event ""S Games Big Air"" my game keeps crashing and I have to log out of Windows or restart my computer.A funny bug, whenever you crash, your character fly meters away, go in the sky while you still hear the skiing sound or do some giant slides.Ok, now for the credits, the only things they can buy that is a feature is the snowmobile which you should be able to get if you keep the credits you win, otherwise you can buy cosmetics for your snowboards/ski, your clothes etc... I think it's a good way for the dev team to make some money aswell as keeping the game totally F2P except for the snowmobileOverall: 6.5/10The game has a great potential, but it has a load of gamebreaking bugs which are never fixed, and it's very probably going to be crushed by Steeps.

Recommended for anyone looking fora quality skiing experience on PC.FULL REVIEWSNOW boots you to the main menu where you'll find freestyle skiing, and a store to customize your character. You also find some upcoming features, like Competitive Events. The store is filled with lots of good looking gear, and hopefully much more will come. When you hit Freestyle, you are able to select from a Mountain, the Tutorial, and an olympic themed course. The tutorial I found to be quite confusing, but most of the game is quite simple once you get the basic controls. The mountain is beautifully designed, with great views and jump points. It also has hidden easter eggs like the Yeti and Castle. The olympic course looks pretty good, and can be alot of fun to pull off tricks. Speaking of tricks, air stunts in this game flow well, and there are a great number of them. One problem with this game is sound has yet to be an implemented feature. I'd also like to mention the console's cheat commands, allowing you to slow gravity can be very fun. In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good skiing game on steam."

There have been many ski/snowboard games beofre now but all fell short in some ways. For one, many lacked gorgeous graphics and controls were often stiff and/or cumbersome. Secondly, no other ski/snowbaord game that I have encountered has sufficiently embraced free roam as a major part of the game. SNOW is very open and the urge to explore an immense map put before you is alaways prevalent, unlocking new and diverse areas along the way. The two things I see as cons are microtransactions being too preavlent and unstable UI, but these aspects can easily be overlooked with vast custimization options and unique features throughout.

Runs absolutely terribly and they ruined the entire gameplay because now you have to unlock the areas, after playing it for roughly 1 hour or less trying to find out how to unlock the areas, I just couldn't. I don't know how.Through out the playthrough I've found waaay too many bugs (Understandable for a EA game) with both gameplay and controls. With the 360 (And XBone) Controller, it would either not work half way through the game (And I'd have to restart) or it would just crash the minute I used my controller. Keyboard and Mouse controls were fairly decent, didn't notice much of a problem other than a imput delay but it was ""Alright"".Here's my opinion about microtransactions, there should be a way to earn credits instead of having to buy these credits.This would really dim down the whole micro-transaction part, or maybe add a way to earn these clothings that you can buy with these creditsMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 3/10My overall rating with my microtransactions review: 2/10When new updates are released, I'll change my review depending on the updates.The updates have rolled in and I just installed the game after not playing it for... a couple months maybe?Let's ignore microtransactions completely, because the game it's self is actually pretty fun (now atleast), I'm still using the same build since I wrote the quoted review and the performance is flawless on the max settings. (Average of 120 - 200 FPS, frames do drop below 100 for me when I'm in forest-like areas.) Now, about the whole speed loss n' such after the engine change, yeah, I'm noticing that's kinda gone, but after the latest updates, it looks like they brought it back.I'm actually in love with this, mainly the multiplayer though, it's so damn fun playing with your friends in this game, honestly. I'd say pick up this game for you and a friend it you wanted to have fun, playing solo is still fun but sorta bland.The ragdoll physics are abit wonky but are actually pretty funny, assuming that's not intentional, I hope it stays like this, I love it. Skiing physics in general, I'd say they're solid, a few ""Hard to control"" things here and there, but overall works fine.Now, I'll get onto the bad of this game. The UI really needs some tweeking and reworking, in it's current state, it works withSOMEflaws, the UI in general is somewhat barely useable by mouse, but fine with keyboard and controller, hoping that this is not meant to be played with just a controller (Despite me using a controller mainly). The arrows to select between settings is rather annoying to click on the mouse, but perfectly fine for a controller.Switching settings is tedious as hell, I was trying to change my graphics settings and the screen the game was on, but the settings would either 1) change to what it was on before, 2) go back to defaults or 3) just go to some random setting I didn't select. YET AGAIN, this is another mouse & keyboard problem for me, using the controller for the settings, then applying them and they're set to what I chose, which is making me feel this game is very... ""Controller-required"" if that makes sense, mainly for the UI.As much as I said ""Let's ignore microtransactions"", I want to bring it up just this once;Yeah, sure there's microtransactions, but that doesn't mean dislike the game, all the items are cosmetic, they do not provide and sort of ""Boost"" of some kind, not saying I'll give them money for this type of system. But looking at the leveling system, it seems they give you items AKA unlocking parts of the map and the cosmetics, which I really like about a game filled with microtransactions. I will point out that you can unlock other areas of the map by skiing around or in them, which is a huge plus for unlocking areas. But this also means you are limited to certain areas for some time, getting around isn't entirely that hard though.My overall rating without my microtransactions review: 7.5/10My overall rating with my microtransactions review: 7.5/10"

The features in the  new L02 park are fixed to work most of the time.  Grinding and jumping from rail to rail looks incredibly smooth.  Spinning off of rails and boxes is a lot of fun.  The big airs aren't super massive to where it's unbelievable anymore, but the realistic approach works so well for this type of game.The rest of the mountain has improved much, although, I wish there was still a castle.  Maybe there is?  Maybe I haven't found it yet?   Another great feature of this game:  replayability.  I have spent hours taking alternative routes and  hitting yet another crazy line.  The mountain is huge and every nook and cranny is worth exploring.Overall, I believe this game is an incredible purchase $15.  With the fact that it will also be coming out for PS4, this game will make drastic improvements and additions within the next year (maybe months if we are lucky) including multiplayer, more mountains, new items, and snowboarding.

That really annoyed me. Then when i tried to play it (my PC is ""supposed to be able to handle it"" according to the requirements) but the loading screen was so long it reminded me of Skyrim. Then the map didn't even load and it started changing my COMPUTER'S screen zooming in everything. I tried closing the game, but it wouldn't close. Even when i tried to crash-close it with the task manager on my computer. So after the 10 dollars I spent and the hour I waited downloading this gave me 7 minutes in hell.

I am really sad that I wasn't able to play it and i will keep trying to get it to run.One thing.

And the potential for SNOW is immense.While most winter sports games are about racing or chaining together ludicrous jumps, SNOW is a more level-headed approach focused on the actual riding. Not that it doesn't feature its own share of ridiculousness: Surviving a drop from 30 meters with both your legs intact is just another day at the office. And due to the game's open approach, it's up to the player whether he does alpine skiing or just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around at the half-pipe.Despite the game being in a very early stage, it already captures the sense of freedom and speed more than adequately. It's a blast just shooting downhill and dodging obstacles or finding new routes during freeriding, all while relaxing electronica is playing in the background. SNOW treats winter sports with respect and transports much of the fascination to the player.It's needless to say that there's not much content at the moment and the little there is still requires a lot of work. Right now, a purchase would be less about your own pleasure and more about supporting the devs.With that being said, the core of SNOW is rock-solid, which is why I believe the game deserves support. Even in its current state, SNOW offers a glimpse of greatness and I wish the team the best of luck for this project."

The music is by far my favourite thing in the game there's only a few tracks but those few tracks are so calming and beautiful. You can deck out your character as much as you would like the options are all there clothing wise anyways and with the new addition of snowboarders there's even more!

With every minor update my FPS increases by 10-15, the UI (whilst still buggy) is now 'functional', and the graphical tweaks here and there have really made a difference - this game does genuinely look 'good', not spectacular, but a decent 'good' rating. The controls keep on being tweaked too; I can now compitently get down the Sialia course without having to respawn a billion times and even throw in some 'gnarly' tricks here and there. :DThat being said, the game still lacks motive. What am I supposed to be doing? You get to the bottom of each course and nothing happens. No leaderboard announcement, no objectives to meet - gravity pulls you to the bottom of the course... and that's pretty much it. There is an arbitary score counter, but it doesn't mean anything.I want the 'Closed Beta' to be big. I want a lot of people to come and play this game because it has impressed me, it's come a long way, and it deserves a bit of recognition. There's nothing else like this game on Steam.I REALLY WANT TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, POPPERMOST; I HONESTLY, HONESTLY DO.....but I can't - £10.99 for this game is crazy. I picked it up two years ago when it was in early Alpha for about £3 (because why not?) £10.99 for Early Access to an F2P game is insane, especially when all you get is some exclusive clothes. If people are playing this game because all they want to do is play 'dress up' with a wireframe, then good for them, but it's getting to the stage where I'd like to see more in the form of 'an actual game' from SNOW and I hope the Beta will show me this.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*UPDATE 25/09/14* The 'M4' patch for this game makes it playable (lol). It's still got a long way to go, mind you. The big addition in this patch is 'sound'. Fitting drum & bass beats over the crisp sloshing and scraping of snow; it's damn good, actually.The new map they added is completely unoptimised, so I got a steady FPS of 4 out of it, but this is an alpha, so it's to be expected.The no. 1 addition for me in this patch is that it proves that there is progression in this game. I'm not readly to 'recommend' it just yet - it is still alpha, but I am hopefull for the next patch. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 10 months.*UPDATE 14/09/14* This game is still completely unplayable. The commands work half of the time, the procedually generated map is not 'procedually generated'; it's just completely random. There is still no sound in it (as in, the game is completely silent - even the UI), and the UI is buggy as hell.*ORIGINAL REVIEW*'Currently in development' is a complete understatement.

The controls in the closed beta weren't any different to the alpha, which is a dissapointment.I think the only improvements that should be made which will make the game 1000x better are:-Better controls-More tricks-Feel faster (going down a hill feels slow as ♥♥♥♥)-Easier to navigate menus (It's hard as jeopardy)-and free, exclusive dlc to those who actually BOUGHT this soon to be free-to-play game.(That last one may be asking too much)To Poppermost, fix your game. This game has so much potential. I was thinking this game would be similar to the EA Skate franchise but to me, it's more similar to playing minesweeper with actual mines. While blindfolded."

For example, if you put the prices of the skies and other items up to a realistic price(mabey their actual retail price) you could give a few bucks for each medal earned. That way there would be a chance to obtain items whitout buying credits by being a good player and not just a rich dude.

It plays slightly less realistic than Amped but not over-the-top as SSX/Amped, it requires a lot of time to get used to it's controls and physics.Pros: A massive mountain with unique spots to go to, instantaneous loading to spots and restarts, really nice soundtrack and graphics.Cons: Grinding is still a bit wonky and physics can be inconsistant at times, not too much events to do at the moment, multiplayer requires port-forwarding or use of third-party programs like Hamachi.This game so far is a very enjoyable experience and seems to get better after every update.

I have always wondered as to why there haven't been too many ""realistic"" (or even close to it) skiing/snowboarding games. It has always been some sort of jumping over mountains doing sextuple backflips. Why? I don't know. I first heard about this lovely game from a friend, when I was asking him that very same question. He pointed me towards this, I watched a couple of videos and then fell in love.This game is just perfect. It has a huge variety of tricks you can do, a huge variety of rails you can hit and just  a huge map to shred! I love the first person mode (especially with changing the FOV to 110) while riding. Riding through the woods at a massive speed is really exhilarating. The game plays really well. The tricks look cool, the park is smooth and... awesome and the epicness and softness of freeriding is exquisite. I have played the game for almost 50 hours now, and I keep on finding new places to ride and love. The level of customization is pretty neat too (even though there are no khaki pants whatsoever).But even though the game has all that, my favorite part is the devs. I have contacted the team numerous times through twitter and they have always been super fast and helpful with their awnsers. Just the other day, I suggested that they add movable lights to the game (for street spots and such), and their awnser was ""That's a great idea! We'll make sure to include that"". I also remember asking them on a livestream of the game in a super early version about building kickers and stuff, and they said that they are already working on it. All this from a super small team from Stockholm!8,5/10 (Because no khakis)*Note* I'm a snowboarder waiting for snowboards to be implemented. The review was based on skis. Probably would've forgiven the khaki issue if the snowboards would be in it already.Great job guys, we all love you-Haze*Edit 9.03.2015*As a un-biased reviewer, I have to mention the fiasco that is S-Games. The devs told me on twitter that the map would be released at the end of January. Now that it is early March and there is still no sign of it, I am a bit disappointed and sad about it. I was also super excited to try out the open beta on the 10th of March, but just noticed that it is only available for Tester and Founder pack owners. I totally understand why they are doing this, but when they first released it, I understood that it would've been released for all of us - and so did many others.Don't get me wrong, I still think it's an amazing game, and you should totally get it, but I had to bring these issues up.

I bought the founders pack on day one so I already made the leap to help this game develop. Here we are a few years since then and I'd pay even more if I could.Let's get to the negative reviews. First to the people who bought founders pack and complain about not having access to all the items like you could before. The devs want this to be a f2p game so they have to do something to be able to keep the game in development because they still have so many plans for the game. If you were early to buy the founders pack like me then I hope you would understand that you paid that early backer price to help game development not get exclusive attention( except a few items). Some reviews are just way to harsh on a game that is still a work in progress.So get this game and start practicing! You see all these edits of people doing crazy realistic tricks and you know what they aren't easy so it's going to take some practice. But I think that's the kind of experience I am looking for in a skiing game.

I realise this is early access, and I accept that, but it doesn't tell you what they are in the tutorial apart from ""w to move forward"". Really needs to either have a completed tutorial or an option to view the controls. Then we can move onto the complete lack of ingame music, and because of that, a buzzing sound is in its place. There are plenty more problems, including paying EXTRA to play with friends, and the achievement for finding Nouk not actually granting the achievement. Not a good start to release on, and have people PAY for.It has the potential to become something great.. but this game doesn't even feel alpha yet."

Obviously there would be cosmetics, but will there be passes to ski down certain mountains and enter tournaments? Most likely.In its current state it feels very ""in-developement"" in lack of ways to describe it, which can make it feel empty at times, but I check in every now and then and its a slow but steady process of improvements.

My reason? Because SNOW markets itself as a ski MMO; the multiplayer was basically my main source of intrigue.Upon reading through the descriptions of different purchasable (packs before paying my £5.99), there was no material to suggest multiplayer wouldn't be available in the cheapest possible purchase. Imagine my disgust when the multiplayer option in-game demands more money in order to become available. What's more, there is no obvious forum where I could (if I had no self respect) through more money at SNOW to acquire multiplayer. Having quitted the game frustrated and confused, I notice that at the bottom of this page, under the ""Planned Features"" sub-heading, the developpers have placed 'multiplayer'; if this is their disclaimer that we are indeed paying money for a feature that isn't yet in game, then they need to do a bloody better job of getting the message across. Something like 'multiplayer not yet available' would be GREAT up at the top right where they promise us that SNOW is ""alone or with friends"".Another disappointment was the promise of in-game challenges, both in multiplayer AND single-player. In fact, ""Solo events and Challenges"" is under the ""Key Features"" sub-heading, showing that it should be available already. So where are they? What challenges have been set? Even after a 1.5 hour sitting I found myself still floating around with no direction as the game doesn't appear to offer anything in-game or in the menu other than an ""exclusive event"" - which also demands more money.Finally, to top off my own personal experience: in the character customisation it appears to be impossible to see the player's head, which makes headgear and goggles impossible to customise, and other than the (god-awful-doesn't-even-deserve-the-name) tutorial, the only map available seems to be Sialia. Thinking this is a personal (inexplicable?) problem as other disappointed reviewers still seem to be able to get 3 maps...All in all, SNOW had a great concept which I loved enough to dismiss the bad reviews, hoping that its coolness (*cough* MULTIPLAYER) would pay off for the lack of sound, or bad gameplay. What I didn't expect was to invest in a product which failed to deliver on aspects it Had promised, and leave me feeling cheated out of aspects it Appeared to have promised. Maybe it was down to bad marketing on Steam, but either way this ""game"" is not worth its selling price in its current state. Once they've fixed key issues, installed multiplayer, improved customisation (hey maybe even throw in a female skier/boarder?) then maybe it could be worth thinking about parting with £8.99. Right now, I'm frankly disgusted that I spent £5.99 on SNOW."

The idea behind the game, and the promise is there. However, this game is also a very good example of what's wrong with the gaming industry these days, and also how Early Access games can be so wrong.First of all, the whole notion of paying to test a game, is a weird one. Then paying to be able to test a future Free 2 Play game seems a bit out of order. People buying into this for 55 EUR, do need to love the game, to defend the use of money.So, what about the actual game then, it does not have any sounds, what so ever, not placeholdersounds, not any background music, not a thing. There is a big lack of options, and while they might not want you to rebind the keys at the current moment, you should be able to look at the controls, to at least know what to click.There is a tutorial in the game, that is somewhat small, and it does contain spelling mistakes - makes the game look unserious. But you won't be able to know everything to do by the tutorial.There are no visual effects in the game, in the way of snow being kicked up, or traces of skis - the same skis that you find to be just as often under the snow, as up on the snow.The game also have random errors, sometimes things work, sometimes they don't. This goes for the tutorial, the cabin, graphics settings.All things are stuff that can be added before the release. However, there has not been an update in 2.5 months, and it seems more and more like a distant dream to see this game in it's full pride.There is so much promise behind the idea - but there is no guarantee that anything will work out.EDIT: As it turns out (by the dev.response here), it does get updated more often - it just doesn't show on the store page or on the community page (high up), so you would need to check the discussions to find it.However, I will still say that this is a good example on why Early Access games are a bad thing. And that if you really want the game, wait for it to be F2P. It's not worth the price for it, at current time - sadly.-Myrvold"

The environments (and graphics) are stunning for an indie game.I already Ski myself, so to see someone working on an outdoors winter sports game these days is a great thing to behold. Not to mention a Skiing game, for crying out loud. I haven't played a game with Skis since SSX: On Tour.There are some negatives to this game as it's still an Early Access game.There's NO audio. None. Zero.So either play your own tunes for now (best option) or make your own sound-effects as you rip down the Mountain.There's also currently no ""true"" Multiplayer at this time so we'll have to wait for that.You can still join Multiplayer games but it will require some extra work on your part, and it's still rather buggy.Sliding on the rails, and some jumping mechanics are bugged (Half-pipe is impossible as it stands, rails are rather slow and *sometimes* your player will stick to the ground if you jump at the crest of a hill etc)These aren't game breakers for me since the general experience is ever-evolving and improving.Overall, I'm quite pleased with this game and the way the Devs have been constantly updating and listening to the fans.I feel comfortable recommending this game to people who are skiers/boarders themselves.People who are looking for either an arcade-like experience (think AMPED or SSX) or are looking for a totally complete game may be disapointed."

The feeling of speed is quite visceral, especially given the fact that there is....NO SOUND! Surprise!

As for now to controller support isn't the best but this is yet another thing that is going to be improved in the future. I do not regret purchasing this game in early-access and I would suggest this quality sports sim to anyone that has an intrest in sports and to some that don't."

Feels nothing like skiing. Clunky controls. Your player will spontaneously combust and disintegrate because you landed a trick perfectly, but for some reason your feet go through the snow, then you ride for 10 feet under the snow before exploding.Do yourself a favor and just go play Shredsauce or maybe wait until Steep comes out.Pce."

Poppermost Productions have listened to and cared about the community that makes their games.The game itself whilst your body may turn into a mangled mutant at the current point in time is otherwise spectacularly beutiful.

I hope they add multiplayer really soon because a few of my friends have this game and im dying to play with them.The only cons of this game that i found were that now you have to pay real money to customize your character (unlike the good old days where everything was free) and the fact that the game is still buggy (but dont let this discourage you from buying the game because its still early access and its expected).Overall, at the moment I think this game is worth buying because the bugs make it hilarious and its so open world and nice to look at that even just going down a mountain casually is loads of fun. Dont think that this game is a waste of money because its buggy since it is in early access and thats expected (like i said before).

From being something where I was like ' This might be cool' to now, where I'm like 'This is so freaking cool'. I don't think words can do this game justice. As a snowboarder I am in love with mountains and the aspect of being able to ride across it, sadly I can't snowboard all the time. This game more/less makes up for that. With amazing graphics and beautiful sounds the team behind this has created what can only be described as a masterpeice.2014 :This is a real snowboarding/skiing free-roam game, worthy of the title SNOW. Graphically stunning visuals make it a must play. SNOW in my opinion is up there with 1080 degrees, for the environment that is there and the amount of customisation. The developers are also very public - anwsering questions and relaying news on the latest update.SNOW is shaping up to be a real 'must have' for skiiers or snowboarders. When the work has finally finished it will have the biggest mountain ever created to ski/board on, multiplayer, events, ski lifts, custom spawn points, replay system, halfpipe, trick parks, collectibles, and those are just the confirmed bits. All of it can be viewed here:http://snowthegame.com/2013/10/21/early-access-feedback/I really think this is worth getting - I've spent 78 hours ingame up to the 19th of May 2014, this is most likely going to increase by a long way over the upcoming years.10/10"

Its super fun to play in the state its in now but its got some bugs and lots of gameplay features have yet to be implemented.Snow is getting a lot of flak from people about its microtransactions, but I really can't understand how people can complain. The microtransactions are just for asthetics, goggles, jackets skies ect. and help support the developers. They will also allow the game to be free to play which will give a lot more people the chance to try it out without having to drop any money. Skiing around, doing a few tricks, exploring the mountian are all really fun. The best sense of adventure and exploration ive played in a game for a while. And for the most part the game plays great, except for when it doesnt. The physcics aren't spot on, but theyre getting close and I'm confident that they will tweak it just right for when the game actually launches. There is a few bugs, but it is early access so that should not be a token of how the game will play on release. For the most part bugs consist of occasionally falling over when I feel like I shouldnt have, although there might be some preformance issues on older pc's. The soundtrack is boppin, many a foot tap to be had. I wan't to get a few of the songs on my phone. The game looks amazing, it may as well be an ad for cryengine. Type in e_timeofday 6 (or 18) for some sunset sunrise double s action.All in all, this game is really great. Free 2 play with cosmetic purchaseables is a really neat direction for this game to go. I cannot reccomend it enough.//Slight rant...Also if one more goshdarn person asks for snowboards im gonna explode. They've said that snowboards will be added, its the most minor thing in terms of gameplay, and its a monumental effort to rig and animate something like a skiier/snowboarder. Just wait. You bought a skiing game. Frustrates me when people dislike a game for such a minor reason."

This isn't some big game company making another Call of Duty. They can't afford a team of 10-20+ QUALIFIED testers to come in and debug there game in a month+ and have it ready to go.

Such as Trees and background. (Looks like a flat picture as the background)Distancing issue with objects (The moon appears about 4 meters away from your head and closer than other objects)Very sparse amount of 3D objects so you get a very poor 3D feel.View disorientating.

This isn't that good. Yet. I know, skateboarding isn't snowboarding or skiing, but some tricks (or what the game determines as tricks) are similar. Grinding. A game should be a bit forgiving and have a bit of a hook to a rail. Skate will hook you to the rail most of the time. When you slow down, you bail or slide off. This game, you jump, hoping to God you go in the direction of the rail, then you might land or slide off. You might even do some physics breaking wall-slide on it too. The word ""might"" is used way too often in this game. I'd say 75% of the time, you'll get points off your score if you land a trick. Apparently, you have to master the game in order for your moves not to be sketchy. So, in other words, you might get points, you might get more points.Having said ""if you land a trick"", I mostly mean that when you do some big air tricks. Your man might just rotate all he wants. You'll be able to rewind, which is cool, but why should I constantly have to? I know there are ways to rotate vertically and horizontally, but I just find it can be very random anyways. Maybe I'm just not figuring that part out.As for graphics, which I usually don't talk much about due to my lack of caring, I just have to mention the animation for trying to speed up. Most animations look pretty real, but that one looks like some sort of spasm. It's kind of annoying too, which is why I have to mention it, because I find I'll have to keep pushing it all of the time to keep some speed when not on a hill (even then, you don't speed up sometimes). So I'll be playing, tapping the button while watching the guy having a seizure. I know he can't just push the board like skateboarding, I'm just saying that the animation looks strange.Most of this so far is pretty negative, but really, there are a few good things. The rest of the graphics look decent for a free game. Most of the user interface is nice looking and easy to use, although switching to skiing in the menu doesn't seem to work, but I've only tried once. Some of the riding feels smooth and nice (don't quite know any other words for it), but like I said, you go slow pretty fast, jumping for rails can be annoying, and air can be a little too tough to land without rewinding.It's early access and it's free, but I don't just want to say I recommend it for those reasons. The game may turn out better later, but due to it's quality now, I have to say I wouldn't recommend it. Gameplay is the main part for a game, and the flaws affect this one quite a bit."

The steps the devs need to take ot fix this are eitherA: Rework Sialia with better terrain and tree variety/densityB: Replace Sialia with multiple mountains, each featuring a different style of ski/snowboard. Ex.-heavily forested, gladed map-double black alpine chutes and cliffs-Backcountry freeskiingAnd the park variety they have now is working pretty well, but rails are still pretty underwhelming.SNOW is a great game for (what I assume is) a niche audience.

I've watched the game evolve from just a game you could ride around to what it is now. I don't know what I think about the games state right now, but it's still a lot of fun for a couple of hours.You have a few different maps, whereas there is one you'll probably find yourself playing on the most. The big mountain Sialia is the biggest free area in the whole game, and here you can find everything. Slopes, parks with both big and small jumps, rails, half pipes etc, and you can find some super cool off-piste lines by exploring yourself. Once you find a new spawnpoint, you can always come back there.Trickwise there are many. There are many cool grabs, although I would like to see even more combinations. You can rotate in every way possible. Backwards, forwards, do rolls, 360s and combine all of them for a sideflip or something else. This is good.Contentwise there are many maps to play, but as a free to play game you have to pay for most of them. I have not purchased anything other than the starterpack back when I first purchased the game, but I still find it fun when I have 30 minutes to do something, so purchasing anything isn't neccesary at all."

I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce."

Yes, you can say the game is in it's early alpha stages and I should expect bugs and general annoying gameplay. But when the developers announced that the game would be ready by Febuary of this year back in October of last and it isn't, well that just shows how little care they have for the game.I bought into the this game as the original discription that was on Steam at the first release of this half arsed early access, was snowboarding. At first they never pointed out that the snowboarding would be implimented later on in the game's life. All that was stated in the original discription is that the game was in early alpha and that it had some issues.I am sick and tired of developers throwing their game onto Steam as an ""early access"". It is terrible marketing and has already made me want to not play the game when it is fully released. If that ever happens! I shall remind you, this game was supposed to release as a free to play in Feb. It is no April and the game is yet to be released.If you are in need of money as a developer just to finish your game. Do not release it as an early access. Hype the game up, get better funding and make sure your target market knows about the game. I would have had no idea about this game as, from what I know, it has only been marketed on Steam.Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, developers! Stop releaseing paid, half arsed early access games with no guaranty that the game is even going to be release on time or even at all. I invested in this game because I thought at least one developer may get it right, but no. Just like the majority, they screw up and seem to have little to no care about the game itself and only the money.Now, after that rant, I can say some good things about this game. The graphics are beautiful. They really give the feeling of gliding through soft powder on a beautiful day. Or at least it does when it actually lets you spawn. The character customisation is actually good, with a wide range of branded products to chose from. Like K2 and Vokl. The mountain looks real and outstanding, especially in the highest settings. The game seems to run well with very little hiccups, even maxed out too.I honestly want to see this game succeed in a big way. But the way it is now and the way the developers failed to deliver a Febuary launch just take hope away. I am truly wanting a good snowboard/skiing sim to play as none that I have sunk any time or effort into have been rewarding. Games like Shaun White Snowboarding and Stoked are good but not outstanding. If the developers are able to pull all of this out of the bag, even with all the issues that it shouldn't have this far into the development of the game, I will recomend it. But right now, with all the issues and my personal hatred for early access game at this time, I can not recommend this game to anyone.I have hope for this game eventually turning out fantastic. But for now, it is slim. Every month I will pop back onto the game and give another test. And each time, I will edit this review. I hope for the better."

The mountain looks great and the physics feel balanced. It is not nearly as over the top as SSX, which I like.What a lot of people need to realize is that this game is VERY Early Access. There is only 1 mountain (and a training slope if you want to count that), no sound, plenty of bugs, and NO multiplayer at the moment (partially untrue as of writing, I could as a Founder create a lobby and invite a friend).Pros currently:Crytek engine looks great. The mountain look phenominal.Physics feel polished and standard movement feels natural.Quite a few brands have signed on for support of the game (Redbull, K2, etc)The open world layout feels right for a skiing game.Cons currently. Keep in mind these will be improved on in later builds, but this is only for current.No MultiplayerNo SoundNumerous bugsNo tutorial worth mentioning and controls for tricks are a bit clunky.Only 1 mountain with only 1 of 4 faces containing spawn points. Many parts of that mountain unfinished.Lot of goals, but only 3 people on the dev team so progress may be slow.This is a early alpha build and some could argue this is only slightly more than a tech demo.No way to provide early backer rewards currently.With that being said the game is worth checking out if snow sports are your thing. Just keep in mind, you are paying to support the developer on this, as it will be released F2P. DO NOT BUY if you are not OK with the things I mentioned above.

Spacebase DF-9 had great potential. The War Z could have had great potential. ""Potential"" in early access games is meaningless. And all the praise of this game is about its ""great potential""2. the options menu is sub-par at best, and incompetent at worst. The natural selection for motion blur is ""high"", and when you set it to ""off"", it makes no damn difference what so ever. (I'd like to thank my headache to the devs)3. 3 maps, one of them a small freestyle slope that lasts less than 30 seconds, is not worth my time.4. This game has some of the weirdest graphical bugs, with random shadow blocks darting everywhere, when you look in reverse your ski poles seem to for some type of trans-dimensional-portal-mirror-thing, when you ski on ice even once you've jumped off the ice, you still throw up ice grinding effects5. all the recent positive reviews of the game I can find  are simple one-sentence affairs, saying stupid things such as ""this game is amazing and now there is even sound."" and ""your gonna love it !First pirson requires some 1337 skills but is amazing fun once matered like a kinkykizz.""This sounds pretty dodgy to me, as if the dev is astroturfing their own reviews, and I don't trust it for a second.6. This game does not require ""1337 skills"" (who above the age of 12 even says that any more???). In fact its a fairly basic and forgiving simulator, that will snap you back on track even after some fairly major screw-ups.7. the preview photos you're seeing look very little like the actual game itself. If it did look like them, this might actually be a fun little ""scenery with added skiing"" simulator.Conclusion: this is a sub-par skiing simulator,  with dodgy physics, standard graphics with stupid bugs, limited playability, and no real objective.This game fails to satisfy on a number of levels, and being ""early access"" (whatever that bloody means any more) is no excuse."

No, but the developer(s) are part of this community and are actively trying to fix bugs with the help of us. This game already looks beautiful and is a must have for skiers and boarders alike. Definately get SNOW if you want to see a completed version of this game and support the devs."

The mountain is beautiful and it is extremely apparent that the Devs are actually putting time and effort into this game. It has everything one could want from an open world skiing (and eventaully boarding) game.

I had been starting to lose hope.And then... SNOW came along.Oh, SNOW. Where have you been all my life?PROS:-Incrediblegraphics, lighting is very good as well.- Already tons of content in the store, from jackets to skis to tophats.- Decent physics engine- World is massive, and I mean MASSIVE. It's at least an 8 minute trip to the bottom if you have fun with it.- The park is on point with what I'd like to see in this type of game. Two sections, one street and one with big booters.- Just generally fun.CONS/Things that are missing/Things I'd like to see implemented:- No audio (yet)- Pressing escape while on the mountain takes you to the main menu and 'Do you want to quit?' dialog. Kind of annoying if I just want to restart my run.- I can't actually see my skier in the customization menu when I'm in it, so if I select something I have to actually hit the mountain to see what it looks like.- Collision models are a little off. The front half of the skis don't even seem to have a collision body, and just go right through rails.- Jumping feels sluggish, and I sometimes struggle to get enough air not to knuckle on the jumps.- The pushing animation is very jerky and abrupt. I'd like to see it so that holding W produces a nice, fluent, repeating pushing motion so you don't have to continually press W to gain speed.- I think the turn speed could be increased a little. Seems a little wide for my experience.- A help menu would be very beneficially, as I haven't fully figured out all the controls yet.I'm still in love with this game. I understand it's in early alpha and would be more than happy to contribute to the development process in any way possible. I hope the devs read this review, because they have my eternal thanks and respect."

Its got good mechanics, easy to pick up but hard to master. Like all early access games it has its moments. Grinding right now is by far the most underwhelming thing in the game but the last few updates have been making it a lot better. Its no Tony Hawk ""Press X to do tricks"" its more like the Skate games where you actually had to do some prep work for your tricks, like aligning your trajectories and landing properly or death. Also, to go along with the Skate games the massive and brutal crashes make this game a total riot. Ragdolling down the mountain in this game is as funny as Goat Simulator but without the ""why am I even playing this?"" vibe. Hoping when all is said and done that snowboarding and snowmobiles are well executed and I would love to see a mountain editor. Keep up the good work devs!"

They made it pretty clear thats what you would receive , and you recieved it. Nothing more, nothing less. They do care about the people who funded their work, they gave us more than two weeks to play before anyone else could. We all knew it would be F2P and they'd have to make money somehow. And besides, all this 'Exclusive Content' is purely cosmetic, it doesn't affect gameplay at all. If you don't want to spend money buying the gear, wait untill they add their progress system.

I began and it was a very enjoyable, arcade style skiing game.  I admired that they weren't afraid to try something new.  After M2 was released however, I noticed things were changing (no duh its still in development), but the changes weren't positive.  The ability to do almost anything in the air or on a rail was pretty much gone.  I went from triple corking to barely doing a single cork.   Of course I thought that this was to be expected so I stopped playing it for about 4 months.  Now M4 is being released soon and I thought I'd give it another go.  I think it is worse than the last time I played it.  I am getting severe lagging, the gfx are brutal (worse than I remembered) the physics are crazy.  Still can't do much for tricks.  The preload system is severly flawed, it seldom works like it is suppose to.  Not to mention the devs are devolping a PS4 version of the game.  Like WTF!  The computer version is hardly playable and yet they are doing a ps4 version as well.  Long story short.  DONT BUY THIS GAME NOW!

But...So far, this game still isn't at par with most simulator type skiing\snowboarding games that have already been on the market.  The character is stiff, weightless, and too obviously procedurally driven.  It looks and feels like you are controlling the skiis not the rider.  The controls are very binary when they should take advantage of modern analog controllers. For instance, regardless if you tap the steering controls or hold, the character drops right into the extremity of the turning poses.  Same for grabs and any other feedback coming from the character.There is no sense of speed unless you are in the trees. The levels feel wide open, flat, and tricking opportunities are sparse. The jumps in the parks feel dauntingly huge and are seemingly too big for the lack of speed even at max speed.   The physics feel just as binary as the controls and don't work well with the level design metrics for the terrain or park obstacles.  Rails riding is quirky and the rider looks dorky. Halfpipe riding is frustrating and it's nearly impossible to get any speed\air.  The radgoll is just broken, and bailing in any game other than EA Skate isn't fun. It's punishing and wastes a players time.The best parts of this game are the jump on the right thumbstick (thank you EA Skate) when it works and doesn't give you an awkward emote instead. As well, a huge plus is having the generous ability to customize the ingame camera.This game has a long way to go before Beta."

Games like 1080 Avalanche and Tony Hawk Pro Skater always had a nice mix of sick tricks and groovy clothing options that always allowed for a fun time. This game has both and its doing it in the right direction.For start, this game is in early access and there are plenty of bugs. With this aside, the dev team is working hard to make the gameplay mechanics, such as the actual movement and physics, extremely polished. As of right now, the skiing elements feel as they should.You are now wondering, ""hey bruh, wut bout my snowboard?! I want to be the next Dion Blaster....errr Ricky Winterboard...."" As of right now the devs are currently working on the skiing mechanics alone; focusing all their efforts before transitioning to snowboards. While this may seem upsetting, I will remphasize that the skiis are nicely done. This aspect should not deter you from giving this game a try.The game itself is centered around a few areas and one giant mountain that people can skii around. This I feel is the best aspect of the game. Every location feels new.  Any path you travel lacks the strategically placed fallen tree or mountain face that forces you to go in any given direction. While there are paths to follow, there is nothing stopping you from carving your own trail.The game itself looks awsome too. I dont know how hard it was to paint a mountain white, but it is incredibly satisfying to look around while skiing. With this in mind, The dev team is supporting the occulus rift, which is a step in the right direction. I often put myself in first person mood to get a better immersion while going down the mountainside and the rift will probably provide a better experience.I guess the only ""downside"" to this game, which isnt really a bad thing, is that this game will be F2P. The game will charge the players for buying different clothing. Who are they to tell me that I have to wear clothes..... pff!This will be a more mature version of the ""extreme"" sports I used to enjoy on the consoles. Knowing this, I cant wait to take all the skill I learned in SNOW and apply it to real skiing....."

Nothing can beat a F2P, open world, skiing/snowboarding game. They should also make more tricks (advanced ones), so that you can use some of the letters on the keyboard. But it says i need a controller, so i dont really know how it feels like if you have a controller.I also love how you get money just by leveling up, so that you dont need to spend 9.99 euro to buy clothes and drones and snowmobiles etc.You can pimp your character, ooo! They should make it so you can customize your characters real face.

The graphics on this game are beautiful though that is one of the positives. The fluidity of the gameplay is pretty smooth but that is negated by the lack of a good free riding mountain with very little jumping off points to do many tricks and at the bottom there is no end you just find yourself stuck on flat ground. I cannot recommend anybody buying this game in its current state, and by looking at the devs timeline of features they would have in this game by now they are very far behind which makes me question how seriously they are developing this game.

Have some integrity and keep it a pay  game where you unlock things by playing. SNOW was on the right track up until they ruined it by being greedy and turning it into this ridiculous money pit where you have to pay US dollars just to scratch your a$$. Save your money and buy SSX or Shaun White. Both of them are excellent and do not require any extra money- you buy the game and you get the accessories, clothes, boards, locations, etc. Obviously, the best gear is not available immediately as you must play the game to gain XP and unlock upgrades just like any normal PC or console game.October 1st, 2015- SNOW is still an unfinished pile of microtransaction garbage.

,Recommended,244930,8486416,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,Captor,"I have always wanted an awesome ski and snowboard game to play around with when I'm not on the slopes, and this game is just that. To start off I want to say that I love this game and hope that it keeps improving. There are many good features about this game, such as the beautiful environment and the control you have over the charcter. If you are into skiing or snowboarding I recommend this game, but if you are not then you might as well wait till it is free. I love the way you are able to control your charcter through spins and flips, but there are many improvements that could be made. I want this game to be the best it could be, so here is my list of things that could be improved:1: Crashing, I do not like how if you crash a menu screen pops up, I would rather that a crash animation is played and you can continue to ski.FIXED2: The controls are very hard to get used to, and I find it hard to control on the slopes (crashing almost every minute), and I do not like the way you jump, I would prefer if you could just press a key down to bend knees and release to jump.FIXED3: Better physics (still a little choppy escpecially when landing a jump)4: I am hopeing that there will be an increased input on the terrain park, bigger jumps, rails, not as crowded, or even a feature to be able to create your own park.COMINGSOON5: I hope that the creaters put just as much time in to make the snowboarder as they did the skiier since I would love to see some awesome snowboarding in this game.COMINGSOON6: A replay editor would be nice.ADDED7: Different camera angles so you can still ski but view the skiier at different angles.ADDED8: First person would be amazing, which I believe would make this game the greatest ski simulator ever made. I hated the shaun white firts person camera and if this was done, I would hope that the camera would actualy act as the charcters face and as you spin and do flips, the camera does the same giving the view of the skiier.FIXED9: Hopefully better optimization in the future for crappier computers like my own.10. Also I feel that this game should not be a free to play, since if it is not the creators will earn more money and will be able to put in more time and effort to make this into the best ski and board game ever.EDIT: Many of my previous problems have been fixed, and many more future wishes will be added in future updates!"

I am asking for a refund for this game, but since I got it over the 2 week limit (which I find a very discriminitory rule, especially for games that were gotten before the refund policy was enacted) its iffy.

As a winter sports fan and avid snowboarder, I naturally got excited and bought the game. Excitement ended right after the game was finished downloading and launched for the first time however.It was a disgrace that steam would (at the time) would allow such a pile of misery to be sold. Anyway, I thought I’d wait for updates and maybe, just maybe the game got better...It never happened unfortunately, when first released it was not even in a tech demo state. Fortunately it improved a lot from that state, however, the game is not in a good state after more than a year. Menus are still a mess. Skiing physics are a joke. Snow physics are non-existent. It seems like developers are wasting all their time on irrelevant stuff like licensed gear(more on this later), before making an actual game that works and plays well.And then there is the best part. I could swear when I purchased SNOW, store page did not mention game would go free to play when completed. The moment I realized the F2P thing, I got mad, very mad. Not because I care much about the money I paid. I honestly don’t. I can afford to lose $15 and not give a damn about it.However the whole business model of this company made me sick to my stomach. People should not be allowed to sell a game that will eventually go F2P. No wonder they are spending so much time and effort on licensed outfits and gear, instead of actually making a game. If ever completed -somehow I highly doubt it- SNOW will be nothing more than an advertising thingy.TLDR : Very incomplete and shows little promise. Avoid. Will go free anyway."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

It was just funny to play, I mean, it wasnt the sort of game I would spend hours infront of, maybe just half an hour once a week to mess around on. Slowly as the major updates started rolling in, alot of the mechanics quickly changed and made it very slow and floaty which really wasnt my thing as initially I trully enjoyed the game as a fast paced die quick fun time, not a, spend five minutes trying to master the new dpi standards you need to even slowly look around.

Certainly we are going to see many updates but this is the game. I have been dissapointed in the frequency of the updates for the last year or so it does feel like most of the complaints will not be fixed and now we are only seeing updates that do not change core game mechanics just extra maps and cosmetic gear, which is not bad exactly just something that is.As for the game itself I think reviews of f2p games are kind of silly. Just play it and find out. Why even bother reading random internet reviews of a game you can be playing in moments. That being said here is my 1 cent. I am a skier, been skiing all my life( and get paid to do so atm) and the skiing just doesn't look or feel right. It is better then steep, steep in third person is painful to watch, you look like an idiot. Some times snow gets it right though and is awesome. Just play the game if oyu are interesterd in it.TLDR: If you are even remotely interested get it and try it out and decide for yourself."

There is also a display problem, where the game will often format at a much higher resolution leaving me with the ability to only see half of the screen, severely limiting my enjoyment.

I thought I would regret it, read bad reviews, heard about the glitches, but still I wanted to play it. After I made it down the first hill I knew I would love this game. People complain about how early it is in development but that isn't something to worry about. The Available mountian and a half are extremely fun and You can approach everything in so many different ways. There are tons of easter eggs, gigantic jumps, and opportunities for exploration and all together it is one of the best simulation games I have ever played. Just taking one different turn than your last run could  lead you to a whole new area. I found an awesome castle/fortress, a few ski lifts on the ""in-development"" side of the mountain, and huge jumps hidden far out of the normal path. My only real complaint is that the new stuff isn't appearing as unrealistically quick as I would like it to. I want to get deeper into the game SNOW but I can't until newer stuff appears. Until then I will just keep finding new easter eggs, side mountains, and yeti's hiding spots. You should definitely get it if you like open world games, winter sports, or just anything ever...

Infact that was the whole reason i bought in early, because i wanted to see a game like this get finished. Normally in a review you rate all the differn't parts, but i just don't see that as being helpful with this game. I'm mearly going to talk about the game play, which is what this game is all about.The first thing that needs to be said is ""first person mode"". The dev's don't advertise it much, but it is there. Despite the complete lack of sound in the game (at the time of this review), the first person mode is like a whole new game. From someone who has skied a lot in his life, it really makes you feel like your on the mountain. The controls further this by mimicing the response of actual skiing. This is exciting, because it has never been done well. In every snowboarding and skiing game i buy, it always ends up like Shaun White, where the controls are to responsive, and there is no reason you would ever not want to just go streight down the most dangerious path, because you can jump 50 feet, and do 5 flips to clear any obsticle.This game is basicly the snow successor of Skate 3. IMHO it's on even ground with skate 3 now, with no sound, no ability to create mountains or runs, fairly limited gear and a few bugs. When this game is done, i think it will reign as king of the genre.The three worries about Alpha games on Steam:Are the dev's still making this game:     Yes. They are active in releases, on the forums, and it's obvious the progress they make in each update.Is the game playable and fun right now:        Yes, it's very playable and fun. It still lacks some features, like sound. That usually does not bother me as i play my own music anyways. It's controls, level design, makes each run unique, even if its the 10th run down the same place.Is this game worth the money:      I've been told that on release it will be free. It's relativly cheap, and won't be officially released for a while. If you like snowboarding, sking, skate boarding games, etc, then yes, this is as essential as Skate 3, and looks like it will be as revolutionary as Tony Hawk when it first game out."

Your character is completely convertible at any time, you can unlock accessory (cosmetics) or purchase them with micro transaction (with $ 15 you can create a character to your taste) yet this is yours if you want I did it to help developers and for the machine cool enough to make my friends jealous. Let us return to the subject of the main map which is quite massive and suits all tastes undergrowth rally and even Snow Park. Also the game has more fun events to achieve, has ongoing against time or point contest. The two only drawback I found at this time that major enough for a good immersion in the game is that we can not remove our skis on march on even if it is not too serious, but it made breaks a little more time even if it's funny is the ragdool. Otherwise I raised my hat to game creators and thanked them for having created such a fun game at times when there is no snow.-Français[snow]Snow est un jeu axé sur les sport d’hiver par exemple ski, planche à neige et motoneige et ect.Le jeu est un monde massif à découvrir avec vos amis ou tout seul.

Revenons sur le sujet de la map principal qui est assez massif et convient à tous les gouts sous-bois à rallye et même des Snow Park. Aussi le jeu a des évènements plus amusant à réaliser, a des cours contre la montre ou des concours de point. Les deux Seul défaut que j’ai trouvé pour le moment qui assez majeur pour une bonne immersion dans le jeu est le fait que on ne peut pas enlevez nos skis pour marche sur les marche même si n’est pas trop grave, mais lui qui fait casse un peu plus le moment même si c’est drôle c’est les ragdool.

By far the best skiing, even best winter sports game I have ever played, even though it's still in alpha! While the game still isn's polished, the flaws are easily ignored. The game is also stunning when run at any detail level. There's so many unique lines too, I'm still finding areas on the only mountain available.Can't wait for future updates, definitely recommend this game, support it!Edit: Now, one year after purchasing my Snow early access pass, I have to change my review. As more and more updates have been released, while the graphics have improved, the actual playability of the game has plummetted severely. Even in pre-alpha, which I admit didn't have the greatest visuals, the game never crashed, and I was able to string together as many runs as I wanted to without suffering from any crashes or glitches that ruined my experience. However, since the more recent updates were released, the crashes have increased tremendously. Ever since the additions of microtransactions (which I somewhat agree with, but founders should get more than an ugly♥♥♥♥♥helmet and pair of skis), I have yet to explore a part of the main menu that doesn't freeze regularly.This most recent update, however, has broken the game for me. When, after restarting Snow four times, I finally was able to ski on the mountain, I was going for about fifteen seconds before I discovered a new area. This lead to a prompt coming up that I couldn't dismiss, and I couldn't unpause the gameplay. I tried a couple more times to access the area, but to no avail.So, despite my past positive rating, I'm going to have to not reccomend snow until Poppermost stops adding new features and irons out the ones that are already there."

If you are a fan of winter sports, the season itself, exploring, or the outdoors in general, you'll love this game. The mountain is absoulutely HUGE and in my ~100 hours of playing this game I have yet to explore the entire thing. Also, although the developers can be slow, not a single update has been dissapointing to me at least. Make sure your computer is relatively beefy because this game is pretty graphics intensive. It looks gorgeous, one of the best looking games I've ever played.And to clear some complaints up, yes, there are micro transactions. I had a problem with it at first, but the developers were nice enough to give away free credits to people who played the game in alpha, like me. Also, it just makes your character look a little different. Different clothes don't give you different stats/buffs. There is also a leveling system which in the future will give you random item drops.If you like winter sports or any kind of extreme sport, I highly recommend this game.

If your skier catches the tip of his skis on anything, he will ragdoll like crazy. I've literally laughed out loud at the ragdolls because I had a few times where the characters head would start spinning uncontrolably, seemingly along to the music. I love the open world. The fact that I can ski down the side of a dam if I want to is amazing. There are only 3 maps at the time, but they each offer something different. The game is also beautiful to look at when all visual settings are at max. For the money I paid, I would say this is  a solid investment into a game with the potential to rival that of a AAA game upon release."

Although there is no solo racing or any type of challenges, it still seems like there is so much to do. The main mountain is huge, with plenty of area to explore around it.

I'm still hesitant to recommend it, and many of the issues I called out in my original review still exist.  There are still clipping issues.  It still seems somewhat limited.  However, it is fun.  I'd caution buyers that it is still very much early access and there's a lot to be done, but the game seems to be progressing along and there appears to be good support for it.The VR support is a cool touch (Rift DK2 Direct), but there's some issue with the head tracking/looking around.  As long as you keep your head pretty still and look forward, it looks awesome.  When you turn to the side, the camera keeps rotating and spinning.  It would be great if the developers could add 1st person mode and fix the tracking for it, but still nice to see support for it.Original Review:Snow is fun for 5 minutes.  The environment is cool.  The controls are decent.  But in its current state it is just too limited to recommend.  The interface and overall look and feel of the game just isn't up to par yet.  The animations and graphics for the player are ok, but there are plenty of clipping issues and other problems that just detract from the overall experience.  It isn't bad, but there are enough nuisances that it just isn't something I can recommend in its current state.  The game is early access and it shows.Development seems to be occurring, but at a very slow pace.  It does not appear that it will ever make it to a final product or if it does, it will not be a final product that is up to par with other titles.  I hope the developers prove me wrong on this, but based on my current experience, I just cannot recommend the game."

I've been waiting for a skiing game to come out for a while now. Unfortunately the ski mechanics/controls in this game are terrible, and the game is way too buggy. The only fun aspect of the game is cruising around and exploring the mountain, but that only lasts for about an hour. The rest of the game is extremely frustrating. The controls for tricks are very unintuitive and the jump mechanics are too buggy, so judging the height and length of jumps and rails in the game is nearly impossible. There is also no way to truly carve, which makes controlling the player at high speed impossible.

This is the nature of an early access game, don't be one of those peeps that assumes it will be perfect right off the bat. Take note though and don't get the wrong idea, despite being a little buggy, Snow is still **incredibly fun** (for me as a skiier at least).In it's current state the game is more than playable (despite various reviews here.... *grumble*) and definitely offers more than a fair few hours of entertainment and fun. What I love most about it though, is that it is always being updated with new and improved mechanics and content, and improves every month or couple of months at a somewhat steady rate. The fact that it's an open freeroam game and not scripted or constrained is also amazing, the freedom allows a great deal of creativity and it's a much, MUCH better game for it.In a nutshell, Snow is like Shredsauce, but oh-so-much better."

This latest update is worse then what the game has ever been playability-wise. I have had a lot of fun with pre 0.5 versions.

All they have so far is one mountain and just skis but I've already had a lot of fun. Can't wait for updates to fix the bugs and snowboarding as well as other features.

Getting to relax and just ski down very detailed mountains* and forests. Some mountains are more exciting than others but definitely worth play to get used to doing tricks.*The ammount of detail in this game's level design is incredible, I have never seen any game put as much into an open world map this early into the development as Snow has. I would love to be able to treck the mountain sides myself in any sort of adventure game and be able to get a better look at the castle for instance.There are very few invisible walls in this game and even then they are easy to get around, going beyond the laid out paths reveals a far more detailed game with small hidden cities or castles or forests beyond the visible limitations. Further getting to a point of no-return (falling off the edge of the world) is a tough as it is and takes a lot of time to dedicate to get that far.To developers thank you very much for this game, even from early access I've had a lot of fun with it.

,Recommended,244930,19637457,"Posted: 11 December, 2015",all,Ben,"So I'll state the obvious first; this game isn't yet finished so don't expect a polished game.Graphics - The graphics are brilliant. However you will need a decent PC to run it at max. I run an ASUS GTX 770, 8GB ram and an i7 CPU. I've not checked my FPS in this game, however it runs smoothly with no lag at max settings.Gameplay - It's slightly comparable to the old SSX On Tour game, whereas it has a good flow to it with zero loading screens on the mountain. You are able to spawn at the very top and ski right down to the bottom which takes around 10-20 minutes depending on if you're skiing realistcally (with turns etc) or zooming down as fast as possible. There's also plenty of spawn points across the map and you can ski up to a helipad and choose some heli-skiing spawn points right at the top away from the pistes.If you're more into tricks - there are a nice bunch to choose from, complete with plenty of snow parks on the main map Sialia, and then a few other separate maps which are just snow parks alone. Grinding is a little dodgy yet as the physics haven't quite been tweaked right but as far as I am aware it is being worked on. This doesn't mean you can't ride rails, it just means it looks a little funny when you're on a rail.A nice little feature is being able to change the time of day by pressing the right d-pad button. It allows you to enjoy bluebird days, spawn back at the top of the mountain and switch to night time or dawn, complete with a headtorch on your character for night-skiing. There is also a drone feature which allows you to fly about and have a look for some nice lines.User-inteface: This has been recently re-worked and is very simple and user friendly. There's not much more to say regarding the UI.Physics: This game is more of a simulator than an arcade type game, with that said it feels like there is still some work to do to make the physics feel realistic. Sometimes your character may tap a rock, only for your character to turn into a ragdoll and fly in to the air. Other times you may jump off a cliff and land on a rock but be absolutely fine. So it's hit and miss. Best advice is to stay away from rocks! Other than that it doesn't feel too bad and is completely playable, especially for a game which is in beta.Multiplayer: This feature is fairly new and therefore isn't very polished, but most of the time it works. One of the things that bugs me is not being able to move my camera around, but I haven't actually looked to see if this is possible so maybe it is, but it is a little tricky trying to stick with a skiing buddy when they're behind you as you can't see them at all.OVERALL: It's not an expensive game and the developers are extremely active with updates coming out fairly frequently and they also interact with the community which is great. There are plans in place to introduce snowboards and the map is constantly being expanded with new areas.  If you're an eager skiier (or snowboarder) and you are looking for your skiing fix, I would recommend you buy this before waiting for full release. If you're not too bothered about waiting, do so, as this game will be F2P on full release.Score: 8/10"

You are able to customize your character by either buying and equiping cosmetic items through the steam market or the in game shop using credits that you earn from either leveling up or buying them with steam wallet funds. In my opinion the in-game music is extremely mediocre and boring. But that doesn't really matter as you can mute the in-game music and play your own if it bothers you that much. As for the gameplay, there are many different mountains/parks you can visit. Sialia is a large mountain resort with a couple terrain parks and runs you can ski/board freely on.

I can only assume that the other positive reviews are payed for by the devs, or they are playing a completely different game.Have the devs actually played the game?Looks nice, but is extremely buggy and the physics, hit detection, and lack of gravity make it almost unplayable.It's almost impossible to land jumps as there is no 'auto-levelling' so after leaving each kicker at an angle, you then land in the transition at the same angle. I've tried levelling myself off manually but it just doesn't seem to happen. Additionally, for many kickers, dispite straight-lining in a tuck all the way to the kicker, you reach the lip of the kicker at a crawl and so can't actually jump any distance let alone reach the downslope.Rails are shoddy, often half connecting with the rail and sliding at an angle with on the tips of the skis on the rail. Then you get stuck in the flats, and have difficulty moving anywhere. The slopes are just too gentle and alot of the time you struggle to keep moving let alone get up much speed.It's a shame as I've been praying for a skiing video game for years and hoped we might get something like Amped 2 but with skis. This isn't it. Yet.

,Recommended,244930,20729849,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,Daydreamin,"I really like this game. The animations are well done, the world is beautiful and immersive, and the music is great too. However, there are also a lot of things I don't like.I'll start with the game. The mechanics are really really awkward. The way you charge up your spins either left or right causes you to also turn to the left or right which is really annoying, although it doesn't have much of an effect on jumps. Where it does have an effect is on rails, which are nearly impossible to slide to begin with. You have to be so damn precise with your approach that charging your spin almost always throws it off. Additionally, the grabs are pretty rediciulous and unrepresentative of freeskiing. The only one I ever use is the safety grab. All others are totally crazy and unrealistic. Additionally, the points and trick names are always wrong, which is pretty annoying. On top of that, there are some other minor glitches and bugs, for example, when you start an event, you fall a foot or 2 which staggers your character. In a time trial or a race, this adds a precious 2-3 seconds to your final time.The other issue I have is with microtransactions. I think it really takes away from the game. Your character starts off ugly as hell, and as someone who has been freeskiing for 8 years, it's really agitating to be throwing double cork 10's while looking like a damn gaper. All the brand name clothes (Armada, Faction, Line, J, etc) are really expensive. You can get *maybe* a pair of pants and a coat for $5. If I'm spending $5 on microtransactions for something that add no value to the game, especially when there are no ways of earning credits in-game, I should at least get more value from that $5 than a coat and pants.  On top of that, you can't even switch the color of the items you already own, you have to pay for the different colorways. Is it realistic? Yes. Is it crossing the line? In my opinion, yes. And the colorways aren't even at a discounted price, you basically have to rebuy the whole item.All in all, this is a good game with mountains of potential, if Poppermost can take advantage of it. However, I don't forsee the studio getting it together any time soon.Also, I don't know why Sialia (Meaning 'bluebird' in Italian) is nighttime half the time I'm playing. Gamebreaking."

But this game has done nothing but impress me. I've always been a fan of skiing/snowboarding games back since 1080° Snowboarding came out on the N64. Then onward to more modern skiing/snowboarding games such as Amped, and SSX. This game captures the more realistic side of skiing. And that's what I as a skier love.

Snowboarding is dope ( I am a snowboarder IRL) and has a nice tweaked stalefish pose, but rails can be very challenging.

The game now is very poorly optimized, on my laptop the game won't event start, it's just a black screen. CPU usage is off the charts. Movement is clunky making it hard to hit rails. The devs are more focused on adding in all these features (not that that's a bad thing) and optimizing for consoles than making sure the game runs smoothly.
