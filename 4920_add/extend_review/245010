First of all, the intro cinematic don't even play. The resolution is 800x600 and, the worst part, the soundtrack is bugged and plays the same song on all the levels. I still have the original cd, and the game is pretty enjoyable, but they should not sell a game full of flaws such as this. If they ever fix all those issues, yeah, i would recommend it, but until then, no."

It's dark and sadistic, with many monsters, traps and obstacles making this game insanely challenging. Sometimes it's seemingly impossible but it has that trademark replay value like modern classic Dark Souls which keeps you playing again and again."

Mind you, the PC version has total level redesign, even funkier controls, and seems overall harder, but yeah... I'll be shooting my Infernal Device at wicked Ratmen soon enough. Seriously, Lara who? What does she raid? Lil faerie would last 5 mins in teh Dungeon lawl! (I love this game so much I could cry, been looking for the PC version over a decade with no luck, one night I see it on Steam and have to make sure I didn't overdose...)"

The controls are o.k. you can change it in the menue settings.The graphics of this version isn´t that good i remember a resolution of 1024x for that game by its original.I know there is a way to get a better resolution but its somewere in the options menue.I never seen another game like that after it- its still good and not just in a nostalgic way.The saving system is o.k. its harder because it saves the moment of health too soyou have to be more strategic when and how often you save- some savepointsneed gold.I finished this game only once back in 2000 and try to redo it again."

Sure, but you can put a controller in and map it real quick ingame, it works with my 3rd party 360 pad. The combat is simple but satisfying, you really chop goblins into bits. Platforming is on par with Tomb Raider, and the difficulty is fantastic. I nearly finish the first level, and in my dumb excitement I rush out of the room I just survived and fall directly to my death, the character screaching before becoming a bloody mess on the ground. Then I wrote this review."

But with the game background being largely inspired from a gamebook written by Ian Livingstone (one of the first ones I read), this game had a lot of interest to me.So what you get in this version... nothing much new from the old one because it does not seem anyone bother to bring the game to current standard like some of the bitmap brother games available in ""HD"" (like speedball). Even worse, the bad controls are still here, the bad camera angle still here and the low polygon... yes still here.  However the game is now highly playable with no lag... but some brief returns to the desktop during change of screen.And the absence of lag making the game highly playable is definitively a go for it in my mind."

It's quite possibly the most difficult game of all time, especially on a no save run.

The verdict? Ain't got enough in common except in name with the former and what the hell was I thinking with the latter? This game came out the same year as Tomb Raider or thereabouts -- and this game is not as good as that game. I *STRONGLY* suggest you instead have a much better experience with this game by going to youtube and watching a ""Let's Play"" -- you will NOT have to struggle with the horrible interface and you will get amusing commentary about the frustrating elements instead of the frustrating elements themselves."

I've barely even gotten passed the first bit of the first level and I'm already hooked.

All these elements are what make this game a classic, Now to figure out how to use the controls again...lol...!"
,Not Recommended,245010,34249910,Posted: 14 August,all,Verdantil,"Tags: 3PHS - Third Person Hack&SlashAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Abandonware grade. Think tomb raider 1 with the platforming replaced with maze navigation and handling locked doors and spawning monsters. Expect traps.Outstanding Issues:-Unintuitive control scheme-No camera control - camera jitters uncomfortably often-Monsters spawn all around you as you explore, sometimes being invisible due to the camera-Constantly running into locked doors in a maze-like environment with limited assets that often look repetitive-Clunky combat, that at least has a nice kinetic feel to it but is hard to control, and you die fast"
,Not Recommended,245010,17786572,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,Aefion,"This is a pale imitation of the PS1 version.   While both versions have crap controls and camera, at least on the PS1 it was still pretty fun and there is something captivating about the game, having to force yourself through a dungeon filled with traps and monsters in order to survive and escape.  But the PC version is just horrible.  I just got a new monitor and because the resolution for DD is 800x600 max, this means I can't even play it now cos it 'fails to render' when I start.  But even before, when I could play it on my old monitor, the game is terrible.  The levels are mixed up and all wrong, and they've stupidly tried to give the blood and gore an update so the more you get injured its reflected on the character.  I can't stress enough how bad it looks, its just outright terrible.  The outdated graphics of the PS1 version look better.  Save your money.  Do not buy this game.  Get a PS1 and play that version of Deathtrap Dungeon instead, you'll have a much better time."
