,Recommended,245050,8758855,"Posted: 18 January, 2014",all,Rakun,"Although Faith in Destiny, the previous (also chronologically) installment of Spellforce series, was slightly disappointing, Demons of the Past is an amazing game, especially for the fans of the Spellforce series.Gameplay - RTS and RPG mix still exists. Although I always liked Spellforce 1 (platinum edition on Steam)'s RPG system (skill building, etc.) more, the RPG side of Demons of the Past is pretty great still. Many side quests and main quests give you many details about the story, making it long, good and rich. RTS, on the other hand, is really good - challenging, yet easy to do still. The system also makes it easier to use some of the skills, spells and other special abilities. Army often can even do it on their own. It may be a bit hard for the newcomers at the start, but not too hard.Soundtrack - as always, soundtrack to this new part of the series is pretty good.Voice acting - it has certainly improved from previous titles.Bugs - there may be a couple, but nothing too big. They haven't really bothered me.I haven't played multiplayer with DotP much yet, but previous titles were already a lot of fun. You can even play the campaign with someone cooperatively.Overall - 4 out of 5. It brings a good end to Spellforce 2, similar to Dragon Storm, and perhaps equally dark to Shadow of the Phoenix. Although the engine is old, it was improved. It may have some bugs and/or a downside or two here and there, but it has been a very enjoyable game with a very good story and also a good to Spellforce 2."

There is some kind of narrative value here, but will appeal only to faithful fans of the series.There’s a lot of content here, with a sprawling campaign and varied multiplayer modes, but ultimately it’s not worth the slog of what amounts mostly to tedious battles and glorified fetch quests. Despite this, the core gameplay is solid and the mash-up between RTS and RPG is a lot of fun. If you are a long time fan and follower of Spellforce 2, then I can imagine that Demons of the Past is right up your alley. You’ll easily understand the events surrounding the main storyline, and you will have been used to the nuances of properly playing the game. For everyone else, Demons of the past is a mediocre game that is not particularly memorable.Maybe SpellForce 3 will be a game that anyone will have to play, unfortunately Demons of the Past is for hardcore fans only."
76561197994095004,Not Recommended,245050,14524050,"Posted: 17 February, 2015",all,Canis,"I have played the Spellforce series from the beginning, and loved every installment. Until this one. The side quests are completely boring, mostly just ""go back to the last area you cleared and find an item or two."" The combat is easy but everything takes way too long to die. They probably expect you to skip the terrible side quests, so maybe I was stronger than I should have been.The dialogue is terrible, and not because it's translated from German. The translation is fine. Every conversation just is way longer than it needs to be, packed with unneccessary dialogue, and delivered at a pace that would bore a sloth. I usually read the entire line of dialogue before they'd said two words of it, but with plot dialogues you can't skip lines, you can only skip the whole conversation. So you have to sit and listen to the sloooooowest talking dragons rehash plot points from previous games to which your character replies ""I know. I was there"" before they move on to new information. Or you can skip the whole thing and learn nothing. I feel like I'm being punished for caring about the lore. At least I get to look at close up shots of said dragons, which would look decent for a game from the early 2000's. To be fair to the dragons, though, the elves/humans/ghosts are just as bad.The level design is terrible as well. In order, the levels are: a level from the last games, but ON FIRE! Then the laziest designed map in the history of games: a bunch of small islands that you teleport between so that they didn't have to try to create a flowing envronment. Then the most frustrating city ever, because it's very large and you move very slowly and the crappy fog of war doesn't update until you actually walk inside one of the dozens of buildings looking for the thing you need to move the plot along. Then a different level from the last game, again, but WITH DEMONS! That's where I stopped, due to it suddenly becoming unplayable.Oh, yeah. It doesn't even work. The series has always been buggy, but it's never been unplayable for me before. Some examples of bugs: if a character is talking, and you go into a dialogue, your character starts what he was saying over. Which was really annoying during one puzzle in the second level where you have to use trial and error and keep initializing dialogue with some objects, and every time you fail they say the exact same lines. So Caine would start to talk, I'd interact with the item, he'd start over, I'd click the next item, he'd start over, etc etc etc. In the five minutes it took me to solve, I probably heard that first line about 100 times. Next, after completing a side quest involving 6 items, it didn't remove those items from my invenory. So I just put them on inventory page 10; not a big deal, but shoddy work. What finally broke the game for me was in the fourth level I had to go kill an NPC that was formerly neutral, and when it told me to go kill her it never set her to hostile. Reloaded my backup save and trudged through the tedious fghts and crappy dialogue and guess what: same bug. Unistalled.So, I didn't finish the game. From what I played though, the ""25+ hours of gameplay"" would probably be about 5 in a game with better pacing. Slow movement, slow combat, slow dialogue. No new units added, poor map design, poor writing. I have been progressively more disappointed in each installment of Spellforce 2. I'm gonna reinstall the original Spellforce to cheer myself up."

I've clocked a number of hours but haven't got a long way through as yet. But I'll give it a thumbs up merely because I think it will end up ok - vastly different to the number of thumbs down reviews here from people who have spent little time in the game and their issues sound more like technical or other problems rather then an actual ""review"" of the game itself.Sure, it's got a few bugs, but I haven't seen a game release in ages that didn't have bugs first up - sometimes badly affecting even being able to play. It does have some other developer issues like the stealth mission in the Stepping Stones ""My god what were they thinking!"". This kind of mission doesn't suit this type of top down rpg/rts at all. And there are bugs where if you skip missions, do things in the wrong order or something, some weird things show up. But like all other games, the dev's do hear about these issues and I'm sure there's patches coming.The game itself, well if you have ever played the other Spellforce games, it will be instantly recognisable. it's much the same gameplay. What they are doing here is finishing up the story of the entire series. Considering the series started a long time ago, I've forgotten most of the story anyway... but, certain things do spark a memory flash in my brain at times.The game is reasonably priced, it's not an ""A"" title, so don't expect the latest graphics and latest engine, it's running on the old Spellforce 2 engine. So far it's reasonably enjoyable, although sometimes a little frustrating. Mainly because the game so far is pretty linear in format. Even though they have lots of side quests (so they say) they are really nothing and get swallowed up by the main quest ie: if you complete a section of the main quest line then bang! Those side quests you had are now irrelevant or unplayable because you moved on - literally - it shifts you to a different area in the game world.I guess Spellforce has always been a bit like this - just wasn't expecting for it to hit me so hard in the face with it, like when it transports you off to the Stepping Stones and you are sitting there going ""No, I need to level up and I wanted to visit the merchants and that side quest I was doing...oh...bugger"".But as I said, it's not an ""A"" title and it's price means it's most probably worth it, so give it a shot - whether you've played Spellforce before or not."

Unfortunately though, this release is still in a serious need of further updating. As the game is currently, it is nothing more than seriously frustrating and an annoyance.Leaving the lack of missing patches aside, this standalone release of Spellforce may provide many hours of joy and feelings of nostalgia to everyone who remembers playing Spellforce 1. But until those bugs have been removed, a bit of patience may be useful."

Granted the first one was vastly superior to the 2nd one, Spellforce 2 still had some good things going for it. However... this ""expansion""... yeah stay away from it. It's horrible build, has ""quests"" that barely work. It wouldn't be a bad thing if you could skip the majority of these quests but most of them are main storyline quests which do hinder your progression. The only redeeming quality is the Freeform Game which is also horribly bugged in some levels.What more can I say? It's a badly made expansion and I do hope that the devs who worked on this never touch another piece of software again. But that seems to be wishfull thinking since the rumor is that Spellforce 3 is already being made. At least I know which game to avoid in the near future. A real shame the Spellforce series dies here because of this ""expansion"" for me."

They forgot to put in the tutorial, which I don't mind (seeing as I own all of the Spellforce games before this), but for anyone new to the series this could be a huge issue. The game is littered with a relatively boring story-line that involves cut-scenes (multiple minutes at times) that one can't skip. To be fair, the story might be good, but the video at the very beginning did not work for me, which is just one of the many bugs that make the game-play a frustrating experience. I am probably still going to finish it (if the game lets me), but I would strongly discourage buying this unless you are a die-hard fan of the previous games."

The first Spellforce was pretty decent, and, unlike this mess, was actually coherent. Spellforce 2 was better. It had an actually driving plot that you could follow and know what was going on, and more than just know what was going on, but know where to go next as well as incorporating some really cool elements of RPG and RTS. In the end Spellforce 2 was a good attempt but needing a great deal of polishing and a little support.But what happened after? You get a HUGE cliffhanger at the end of Spellforce 2 as you are in a giant city ship saving the world. Well, the recent 2 standalone expansions make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. This one is a great deal better than the 3rd installment which I could not even bring myself to torment myself through the absolute mess of voice acting and the worst script released under the sun.Spellforce 2 Demons of the Past forces you to go through a string and series of events and dialogue that makes absolutely no sense if you have not played Spellforce 2, and even less sense if you had actually played it. It seems to have absolutely nothing to do with the other expansions that preceeded it. The entire deliverance is heavily fractured and fragmented and I am certain that is not just due to translation issues, but that it simply is an abysmal script. The presentation is also far worse than Spellforce 2 was as well. You get a bugged intro that you have to start a new game, exit, quit, open, start a new game several times before you finally get the sound for the introduction. But you are not missing anything if you skip it altogether. It makes no sense at all, except that it makes you wonder if it tapped the wrong intro to Craig Un'Shallach in the previous incarnation of the game that had a decent deliverance and, god forbid, an actual coherent string of events to teach you the game as well as to teach you the story.Once the intro video is over you are getting barked at by 4 dragons 2 ghosts and a captain of the guards, but it doesn't show a gathering, it just shows a dragon poorly rendered or created flopping its jaw up close, then the next, then the next, then the ghost, then the dragon, then you for 1 line. It gave me a huge headache. Mind you, if you skip this you also are not missing anything because it as well makes no coherent sense whatsoever, brand new to the game or not.Where it's original namesake was a treat to play and progress in and gave you a great experience both in combat, strategy and story,  it even gave you a sense of dire importance. This one I am 4th map in of 8, so halfway through the game, and I still am not sure what is going on and am having the hardest time figuring out what the hell people are talking to me about. Was it from Spellforce? Spellforse 2? one of the expansions of each?Basically this game they didn't even try. The round before it I would give 0 out of 5, Fallen whatever it was so horrible I don't even want to look it up to remind me of its name. This one I give a 1 out of 5. Spellforce 2 I give a 3.5 out of 5 and Spellforce I give a 3 out of 5. Those 2 are worth playing, but the final 2 stand alones  for Spellforce 2 should never have been allowed release. Instead of polishing a good game they ripped it apart. What is astonishing is not only did they not follow through with a single aspect of Spellforce 2, it did not even improve a single line of coding or graphics. It is exactly the same as it was on from Spellforce 2 and Spellforce 2 Shadow Wars (Shadow Wars was also decently done, a 3.5 out of 5, it had a compelling deliverance of story and gameplay). Considering it has been a decade since the original platform released you would think they could work out kinks, but the game is barely playable with all of its bugs. It has absolutely no support either.If this is an indicator of the direction of games from Nordic Games or any company from Eastern Europe I would just flat out not spend a dime on any releases until they can pull their act together. This game came across as a poorly done and lazily approached high school student presentation using an outdated and unrefined game editor from 2002 rather than a developers graphics design and production works of 2006.It is such a let down because at the end of Spellforce 2 and Spellforce 2 Shadow Wars there was a cliffhanger, showing that a really great storyline was coming up. 10 years later with its 2 later expansions which were nails on chalkboard every moment, barbed wire lacing your clothes grating steal on steal horrible of acting and dialogue just was such a dissapointment. Here I thought they were onto something and they didn't even try, they just wanted some easy money, and not even that much."

I really enjoy this game, but I've been a fan of the series since Spellforce 2 - Shadow Wars because of their unique gameplay (RPG - Strategy) and setting, so I'm might be biased to give a positive recommendation. What I can honestly say, I think Sepllforce 2 - Shadow Wars and Spellforce 2 - Dragon Storm are much better in terms of voice acting and plot than Spellforce 2 - Demons of the Past. The voices really sometimes don't fit the characters, and for me that is really annoying. But all in all, I still enjoy it a lot so I give a positive recommendation.At least the plot is better than Spellforce 2 - Faith in Destiny... That was a dissapointment."

NOT recommended!I played every Spellforce game so far, and after 5-10 years of pause, I recently bought Sp2 Faith in Destiny, and despite the bad reviews, I actually liked it and it brought all the fond Spellforce 2 memories back... so I was really excited and immediately wanted to buy the last expansion: Demons of the Past, which also received better reviews!What a disappointment! Buggy as hell (you need a community patch to be able to solve certain quests, which requires you to register!!! in the forum to be able to download a community patch, which requires a fix of the fix, to not be lv30 at the start!!!, which is not fixed in an official patch, as there will be no support anymore...The gameplay dreadful! The first map is one of the most difficult, the main quest often cannot be finished (save 5 villagers, they are stuck and dont move!), it is too difficult, and there is almost no items or monster hunting on that map at all. The next map, even worse, a stupid stealth!!! mandatory quest, out of hell, which makes you die within seconds, just a pain and nothing which made Spellforce great... Then the Ziggurat quest... often you cant progress anymore without any info... just nothing happens anymore, if you reload within the quest... on later maps it gets better gameplay wise, but much too late and not good enough... Then Steam achievements are messed up, did not receive any for finishing the game, for certain cast xxx spell 50x times... another let down... and the story is just confusing and not really good!If you still want to play a more recent Spellforce 2, definitely pick Faith in Destiny instead!"

It had me searching for more than 20 minutes until eventually I gave up and so searched on the net for it. The dog was hiding in one of my buildings that I've just built, there was no notification where the dog was even though I had the whole map covered the game didn't give me a tip where to find the Lil'♥♥♥♥♥. This sort of quest you will encounter alot in this expansion big map no notification.Second map of the campaign stepping stones:This part of the campaign is just dumb its basically a series of mini games in more of which requires you to wait for 30 minutes before doing anything and after completing particular objective you have to wait 20 minutes more to progress. When you think the worst has come to pass there came the worst puzzle game I ever encounter click the right objects to proceed with no tips or guide provided.Overall there was tons of bad stuff to be found but the major insult from this expansion was that a darkelf/norcaine has a misshapen head to its former body. Spellforce 2 demons of the past could've been better than its last expansion but it wasn't, nothing have been improve and it only gotten worse.3/10 Bad experience"
