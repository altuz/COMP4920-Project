It performs well, has smooth controls, and I haven't encountered any bugs so far.  The game itself is a fun platformer with collectibles and puzzle-solving.  If you are playing by yourself, the AI for Oswald is good enough to get by no problem.  Lots of charming Disney songs, animations, and artwork!EDIT:  I beat the game today and I was able to finish the game without encountering any bugs other than Winslow getting stuck sometimes.  Overall a very fun platformer!"

I personally can't get it running on my system (freezes at startup). I've tried about every tweak/fix I can think of.*Update2* Okay, Gorillahas a possible fix. It involves limiting the number of cores used in Windows. Hardly ideal since may hurt performance in other games/tasks, but at least it gets the game running for me.There are also some other issues. Apparently the game:a)has no local co-opb)has a 30fps lockc)may not have trading cards, despite what the store page saysIf you are interested in the game I'd suggest putting it on your Wishlist and checking back in a week or so. See how things work out for people who bought it, whether it gets patched, and whether we come up with fixes for the framerate/coop issues. As it is stands, you're better off hanging onto your money until we see if this can get sorted out.(edit: added forum links) (edit2: added trading card info) (edit3: cpu issue info) (edit4: cpu fix info)"

It's a must have for Disney fans both big and small, as it lets you see into the world of the forgotten, and relive some of the first moments in Disney history. Oh, and I forgot to mention - this aint just some cheesy, cute, Disney adventure, oh no no no.. NOT BY A LONG SHOT! The world of Wasteland is a much darker, sinister, twisted version of the Disney we all know and love, complete with broken, withered down animatronic versions of Mickey's pals like Goofy and Donald... All in all, it's a game that if it had a bit more development time, could have been a far greater game than it turned out being, but it's still VERY enjoyable as is, and has a lore unlike anything else Disney you've seen before... It's Disney at it's darkest, that's for sure! But that's what makes it interesting!"

You might be fortunate enough to be able to actually finish the game, but be sure to test it first. If you have any crashes in the first hour or two you should expect the rest of the game to play that way (and potentially reach a point where you can't progress); if not, you're probably in the clear, but it's not a guarantee.The most common offender is cutscenes, particularly the transition from the Underground to Mean Street North. Some are never able to move past that point, others can reload the game and move on. I was able to get through it, but whenever I attempted to use the camera item I immediately crashed to the desktop (even just staring at the ground, so it's not a weird issue with draw distance or loading lots of art and textures), and have since given up further attempts to make the game work.The community hub is filled with similar reports, and these issues have never been resolved by the developer. There is a thread reporting some success bylimiting the number of cores in usejust to make the game work correctly, to give you an idea of what a poor port this is. On top of these problems, the controls feel clunky and this version of the game removed co-op, leaving you to deal with the occasionally frustrating and clumsy AI controlling Gus.If you're able to look past the bugs and serious functionality issues, and not run into any sections that block progression, the game itself is an average platformer with lots of collectibles, but nothing particularly special. If you really want to play it you should stick to the console versions."

The point of the game is to be co-op, it's even part of the title.  Bought this for my kids to play together, very disappointed to find out that the co-op feature was removed, but not the point of it.  So the game is rather lacking and very disappointing for the kids who specifically wanted it to use as a co-op experience.  Why Disney would cripple the game like this is beyond me, but their disdain for their paying audience is palpable."

It's basically Disneyland if all the rides were made out of paint, and you happened to visit after a really bad rainstorm.The game itself is not the best platformer, and doesn't hold up to it's predessesor, but it definitly has a sort of appeal to it, one that any Disney nerd of Animation or Parks can look at and say ""Hey, I remember that!"""

And if it is, it's rare, and after about 30-35 minutes of playtime.And Oswald's AI is not completely buggy. Sure, it's not flawless, but because there is no co-op, it will do fine."

I got this game very cheap in a Disney bundle sale and so far it's okay BUT I'd recommend the Lego series games before I'd recommend this. Alice in Wonderland by Disney allows local co-op I'd even recommend that first and that makes me unhappy as I love mickey mouse and this game has been okay with most things but it would be way better being able to local co-op it seems the computer doesn't always pick up what you necessarily want to do. The story is predictable but alright and the graphics aren't bad. I recommend it due to the unique concept but honestly I'd recommend getting this on the original platform it was released for and play it with a friend.I recommend this if it's $10 or cheaper... no more.

I enjoyed the replayability of both games.  However, this sequel really didn't add anything new in that regards, just the same old same old.  Epic Mickey 2 really felt like Epic Mickey 1 with added levels.  This was not a bad thing, though, since I really enjoyed the first game and wanted to experience more of it immediately after I finished.  The graphics were bright and colorful and looked like a modern Disney cartoon with some old school scenes mixed in for nostalgia.  Using Oswald was nice, but felt unpolished and unecessary.  This game ran without any glitches or technical issues on my Intel Core i5 Toshiba PC.  In addition, my Xbox One controller made game play a lot easier and less frustrating than using the keyboard.  Overall, Epic Mickey 2 is a solid adventure/platformer game, just don't expect anything groundbreaking with this sequel.  If you enjoyed the first game and just want more of it to play, then buy it."
,Recommended,245300,28957369,Posted: 2 January,all,[DFS] Funtime Freddy,"11/10The game brought back Oswald, probably my most favorite cartoon character, even more than Mickey.Pros:- Brought back Oswald- Costumes affect gameplay- Camera controls are easy (honestly, i have no idea why peeps hate them)- No crashes (only crashes if you launch DEM2.exe, I did Launch.exe, and it worked fine)Cons:- Pressing New Game overwrites your old save file, requiring you to start over. Luckily, this does not reset your achievement progress."
,Recommended,245300,15807109,"Posted: 12 May, 2015",all,Skäre'da,"The cocnept of Epic Mickey is an extremely good concept that supposed to appeal to casual players and tremendous fans of Disney. This game revives the classic cartoons as platforming stages and brings back old characters commonly left in the dust in Disney's media.The gameplay is simple, fun, and is a ""choose your own way"" type of adventure, causing and choosing good or bad outcomes. Only a few bugs and small exploits are found but overall the gameplay is an interesting concept.Though one thing I truly admire and think what gives this game it's name is the level design. The level design is based on altered/combined versions of the Disney Parks attractions, both still operating and defunctional (Haunted Mansion or 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), and turns them into a puzzling level. It shows appeal to both hardcore fans of the parks and people who just had a good time in the parks.Though I would say, plot wise and bug wise, the second one isn't as good as the first one, which is Wii exclusive, i'd give it a try to truly understand what this experience is along with the plot."

Heck it even has voice acting now which is neat.I really didn't expect the paint reticule to work as well as it did since it was meant or mouse or wii-mote but it worked great with an xbox controller.Some of my favorite scenes happened when the mad doctor showed up and turned whatever scene he was in into a musical because he refused to speak in anything other than song.There is a whole lot of content in this game.  So much so that I kept feeling like I was missing stuff as I progressed through each level, such as different paths I could have taken to see where they lead or quests I just couldn't complete because I may have screwed something up in another part of the area.For the most part I tried to stick with the hero path but I inadertantly caused more damage in a lot of areas than I meant to because I thought I was doing the right thing or defending myself.Anyhoo it was an enjoyable experience and perhaps I'll give it another go eventually to find all the secrets that I might have passed by."

Such as the keyboard controls. These controls are some of the most awful controls I've seen in a video game yet. That's why you should NOT pick up this game unless you have a Xbox 360/PS3 controller. Also, to just nitpick here, you can't go into full screen, which is very annoying on PC games. Now besides the port problems, this game has some extremely annoying characters such as Gus, the little green thing that wont ever shut up. He is constantly holding your hand through every little part of the game that may require you to think, which not only makes him an annoying character, but he also near ruins the game. That's another thing about this game: There is no challenge what so ever. The boss battles are the only thing that could be considered semi-challenging, and there are about 3 in the entire game, meaning the majority of the game is easy. Also, the game feels like DLC for Epic Mickey 1 more than anything, since it is so short. Really, you could probably beat the game in LESS THAN AN HOUR. Imagine purchasing a broken $60 game that only lasts 40 minutes. I'd be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Other complaints I had where the voice acting. Now I suppose you could probably deal with it, but really, the acting is pretty bad in this game. As well as the musical segments. Yep, musical segments. This game was marketed as a musical game, but really there are about 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ songs in the entire game that are all sung by the same character. I wouldn't qualify this a musical. Now there are a few things I liked about the game. One of them being the boss battles. The battles brought in a change to the game, allowing you to choose how you defeat them: Turning them into a friendly,  or killing them. I though this was a great idea in Epic Mickey 1 and it is still a great idea in Epic Mickey 2. However, other games have done this practice MUCH better than Epic Mickey, because in this game, your choices don't really matter. If you pick the good choice, you are praised as a hero in the end. If you pick the bad choice, you are praised as a hero in the end. Though that doesn't really take away from the over all enjoyment of the fight. Another thing I liked was the enviroment. If you didn't know, the world is pretty much a destroyed Disneyland, however, the first game did this much better. On consoles this was an over all decent game, on PC however, it is a bad game. So if you want to play one of these games, GET THE THE FIRST ONE, or purchase this game on consoles. I still do recommend getting the first one, because it is a pretty good game, and it will help you understand this one better.Consoles: 3/5PC: 2/5Not recommended unless you are a fan of the original game, or if you are interested in Disney history."

,Not Recommended,245300,35182638,Posted: 24 September,all,Calcifer,"Oh man I wanted to give this game a positive review and fall in love with it. Unfortunatly there are so many downsides to the game I can't recommend it.Here's a small list why not:Graphics:The Graphics look pretty good for the most part, the biggest downside is the animations. Dont know if it's just the PC version or all versions, but the game is locked on 30fps and my god does it show. Instead of a smooth cartoony asthetic the game is very choppy and it does not look natural at all!Gameplay:Something about the controlls feel very off. I can't realy put my finger on it what it is yet, but instead of being a smooth platformer with tight shooting controls (for the paint mechanic) I just couldn't get used to it at all! Rarely felt controls this unnatural :(Plus where is the Co-Op??It's pretty obvious this game was made with co-op in mind seeing as Osswald has to controller and Mickey had the paint brush and you need to work together ALOT to get things done. But instead of co-op now I just have to press B for Osswald to do his thing so I can do whatever it is I have to with Mickey to get the job done.Realy hoped for a better game here. But bad controls and a choppy frame rate hold this one back soooooo much! Sorry Disney"
