76561198005196937,Not Recommended,245370,15728417,"Posted: 7 May, 2015",all,DarTH ShodaN,"What do you get, when you have a multiplayer focused game, terrible marketing and therefore almost no awareness of your game, coupled with a low-budget approach?The answer is Etherium.The gameplay itself is solid and an experience, that focuses on the main things you'd expect from a strategy title:- rock/paper/scissors mechanics- multiple tech tiers- focus on map/ressource control- base building and defenseIt takes all of this and breaks it down to the bare essentials:- Counter mechanics are straith forward and most units are hardcounters to others.- Unit production is almost instant.- The map is controlled via sectors with a capture point in each.- Base buildings are limited to pre-defined locations in the sectors and can only be upgraded however you see fit (with the exception of defenses, which are limited by number in each sector).All that makes the game a very streamlined experience, which is not necessarily a bad thing. You can focus on making decision. And having only a limited set of options makes every choice count.So it doesn't sound to bad, right? HOWEVER as I initially stated Etherium is obviously built with Multiplayer in mind. You have only a lackluster ""skirmish vs AI"" - campaign mode, your ""rank"" is displayed in the main menu aswell as a button to enlist in matchmaking... If only pressing that button would do anything!Because YES, Etherium is dead already. I strongly advice to look it up onsteamcharts.com, should you have any willingness to buy it left in you. With a peak of around 15 (!) players per day this is a multiplayer title with no one to play with.It should come as no suprise to the devs, that people will not pick up their game, if they fail so hard at raising awareness. Etherium is yet another failed attempt to create a low-budget title that stands on multiplayer alone, but just doesn't have the content, quality and appeal to get enough people to actually play it.Conclusion: Steer clear of this game and save yourself the money. Neither the Singleplayer nor Multiplayer are worth the price tag."

Etherium brings in a dynamic weather system where you HAVE to adapt to situations by selling units before they get blown away by hurricanes,crossing icy rivers for flanks after a big old blizzard,running away from a volcano that's about to blow up and steamroll your troops and more. AI's are perfectly fine on my end, medium AI's aren't that stupid,easy AI's are,hard AI's are challenging. The gameplay is also great but some of the controls are a little bit odd,you'll see for yourself when you buy the game. Conquest mode isn't online yet as of the current time and date of this review which is... 1 PM pst 3/25/15.MultiplayerThe only thing that I'm left wondering about is....What happened to the multiplayer? Multiplayer's dead on my end,I don't see any rooms in the lobby and there's no chatroom system whatsoever so it's a wee bit hard to connect to other peeps and make sure that it's not you who has a glitched/bugged/dead multiplayer system. Overall,it's a great game, they just have to fix the multiplayer system. Lots of people can't get multiplayer to work. Hopefully,they'll add more content to the game. $30 isn't too high or too little of a price for this game. ESPECIALLY if there's more people in multiplayer.Cores for RTS games.When you look for an RTS game,graphics are a nice plus but it's not ALL about the graphics. The graphics are great for an RTS. If you wanted an RTS that has a loooooot of graphics go for SC2 if you want to take a risk and plunge into a game filled with potential and support the developers,here you are. The gameplay's pretty much a SC2 and Company of Heroes mix. Gameplay is a major plus for a game. Putting all of the big Plus's for RTS games or just adding some innovation/improving the ideas for RTS itself is another big plus. Multiplayer database is ANOTHER big thing in ALL RTS games. If an RTS doesn't have a big multiplayer base,it's a goner. This RTS is suffering in that direction.Edit:Conquest is on! Ratings have been updated. 1:20 PM pst 3/25/15Edit: They really need to add some lore into the game though. That's also another big problem in the game that I hadn't bothered thinking about because of the lazers flying across the map on the battlefield. Regardless, still a fun game,just need a bit more content. Ratings have been changed as of 3/25/15 10:14 PM pst.Overall rating:7/10Graphics:9/10Content:6/10Multiplayer's dead/not showing up?:3/10Music:8/10AI mentality:9/10Buyability mentality?:YES,and yes. The game's ready to go,just a few slight flaws,a fix needed for multiplayer and some actual lore to be passed down into the game.Also need a bigger multiplayer base.Edit: Haven't played this in a while, back when it first released we didn't have the problem of the game crashing but now the problem's been introduced now for some unknown reason. Don't know how they screwed the game up. Game's great if it's not crashing but regardless, don't buy the game until the problem's fixed. It has a lot of potential and can still be a developed game.Updated 5/26/2016"

The graphics were appealing at first and gave the game a unique look. I finished the tutorial skirmish and decide to load up a conquest game tutorial. An enemy fleet appears and I am instructed to attack it. I was expecting a space battle or atleast a cinematic but instead was greeted with 4 shots from each ship being fired in a system ressembling a dumbed down $5 DS game I played once.Crash...I reload the game and assume that it must be a bug in conquest mode so I start a skirmish game and I am introduced to the factions. These showed little inginuity: You have your typical corrupt or oppressive human empire, a technologically advanced alien religious zealot and a group of aliens who sacrificed their entire race in order to live inside war machines. The last one was the first bit of creativity in this game that I found worth the effort. 3 minutes in and my screen freezes for a moment then my fleet decides to fly off and it says that I am defeated. confused I try another skirmish game.Crash...Being a modern game I expected it to run smoothly on windows 8 with 16 Gigs of Ram and a higher end graphics card.After finally playing through my first few unbroken skirmish games I am incredibly dissapointed to find that this game also suffers from over-balancing. All but 3 of the units and buildings per faction have incredibly similar stats to each other within the faction and share projectiles, names and descriptions withe similar units across the faction.The symmetry means that what faction you play as has little to no effect on gamplay other than visuals (Unless you go as the incredibly over-powered alien faction and their light walkers that dominate early game.)Final verdict: 5/10- Buy it if it's on sale or if you crave a simplistic RTS or symmetrical gameplay could be so much more."

Nope, it is not!Maybe around 5 or 10 in a sale. But why, you might ask?Well...The good things:-Interresting conquest mode.-It's not difficult to learn how to play.-Epic soundtracks. (My opinion)-A good overview on what's happening on the battlefield.-It looks nice. (The skybox is also amazing!)-There is more combat and less base building.-Great in-game features that can change the game in seconds. Such as secondairy factions you can take controle of and weather effects.The many bad things:-It crashes alot, this isn't just me. The entire community was screaming about it.-Gets repetitive after a while.-Bots can either be really smart or crap.-Factions are not very different from each other. Sure, there are some different units and abilities for each faction. But compared to other RTS games. That's nothing! Each faction is basically  a re-skin from each other.-The player base is dead.Yup, I couldn't find any players online!The game developers left the game like trash.

The game has some really interesting concepts, but overwhelmingly fails to provide a rewarding experience.At $30 the game simply doesn't pack enough content to be worth the time.  An average RTS game is going to be worth hundreds of hours of gameplay, this one might not pass the 20 hour marker.Balance in the game is pretty awful with one faction just being overwhelmingly better than the others.What the game does offer is a unique take on base building giving you a lighter version of it.  Your home base can build a number of attachments.  Logistics allows you to build more units, tech allow you to build better units, and refineries allow you to earn more money.  Then there are more specialized buildings that can be used as part ofa strategy, like the military industrial complex which reduces costs from losing units.On the map are various points that need to be captured.  Each point will build 1 or 3 attachments.  Building with only 1 attachment can build a refinery.  Ones with 3 cannot.The main problem of the game is that things sort of snowball out of control fast.  Holding on to an extra base gives you a definitive advantage over your opponent in which case it's less likely you'll be able to come back from a loss.The game also features the option of buying out neutral factions.  Neutral factions will only attack you if you attack them and are place in areas that would eliminate a potential flank.  Buying out factions is a huge investment and honestly... a waste of time.  The advantage is gaining a few extra units that don't count towards your unit cap.It's a very disappointing game in a poorly planned series.  Hold off on buying this one indefinitely."

So if you're used to smash the hardest AI in other games, try ths one.You can choose between three factions. Each faction has a unique bonus (one has four slots for units, the other four slots for turrets...)It is not a classic RTS with basebuilding. You basicly conquer the map and upgrade your mainbase and the facilities for each sector, which makes it simple to get started and still is interesting because you still have to make the right choices or even be capable of change the choice and your strategy.The units are well balanced. For each unit of the enemy you have a unit that can fight it, as long as you have enough Etherium, as long as your techlevel is high enough. And that's where the difficulty starts, in a positive way.It also has potential to become an entertaining esports game. But...--------------------------Updated 31.03: Soloplayer Campaign Review:There are three ""campaigns"" for each faction. After you've chosen your faction, you'll get introduced by some pictures and voiceover/text to the motives and backgrounds of them, which is interesting, though it could be implemented better (cinematics would upgrade this alot). Then a little tutorial and the thing starts. You can imagine this as sort of a round based board game, with 6 planets.Each round, you can make your moves with the fleet, upgrade your techlevel based on the techpoints you hold. Per round you have general action points and fleet specific actionpoints.With the general action points you can buy cards (you get a card each round), play a card/cards, spy the techlevel and missions of your opponent, or - if you can - buy a new fleetWith the fleet action points, you can shoot the enemy fleet which is in the same orbit, repair your hull, conquer/attack a sector of a planet. Goal of the game is to hold at least 12 winningpoints for one round, or - I'm guessing now - to hold the most points by the end of the last round (I think it was like 16 rounds). You get those points by completing missions and play the cards giving you those points.Resumee: I really like this gamemode. It will be a different game everytime you play it, especially with the tough KI it won't bore you too much. Though the fights are always the standart fights. I hope for more diversity in future and I also hope for a real story campaign and addons for this conquest mode.------------------------------------------------To the negative points:...I believe the distributer and the developers made some big mistakes.First of all: You can't throw a game on the market without having made anything in terms of advertising. I just heard about it one day before it is meant to be released. I know more about the smallest indiegame starting on greenlight - no joke - because of twitter. You probably wanna try this one too.Second: I don't understand, why the developers say ""by the devs of Stellar Impact"". It's nothing you can be proud of. Not because it is a bad game, because you left this game alone and still sell it, though you can't play it without others. You should have make it f2p, if you do not want to shut it down. Guys, this is your second chance. If you mess it up, I will never ever buy anything made by you guys again.A last negative thing: It is hard to find anyone in matchmaking. But this is of course because it has a low playerbase. So buy this game, give it a try and change it. It's worth the 30 bucks.-------------------In a previous version of this review I critizized that the game's Solo Campaign isn't released. This was  a bug I experienced."

Personally, I am a pretty big RTS fan and I am always looking for fun, new strategy games to spend a bit of my limited free time on.The game is interesting in that it is easy to get into but offers a surprising amount of depth. The emphasis on direct unit counters and map control is appealing and presents different opportunities for both micro and macro strategy. Furthermore, resource management is very important and learning to make compromises between units, buildings, and turrets is important.Another thing I would like to point out is the AI. Its kicked my butt quite a few times. I lost my first 4 skrimish games against a medium AI, and I didn't win until I conceded that I have more to learn and dropped to the easy difficulty. Its pretty good and there is certainly enough challenge for me.Overall, I find the game to be both fun and satisfying. I would definately recommend it, although I would caution to anyone who purchases, to be patient with a few bugs and optimization issues (which the developers are already working on).Here is a breakdown on my thoughts:Gameplay: 7 / 10Strategy: 9 /10Graphics: 7 /10Sound: 5 / 10Fun: 9 /10Challenege: 8/ 10Replayability: 7/10"

You can't beat enemy AI in micro management. It just sends 10 divisions around at the same time - healing, attacking, refilling troop count, evading special attacks. The player AI on the other hand just hunts down enemy divisions while you try to handle the 20 other divisions you have instead of attacking the enemies nearby. Battles are just decided by spam. Units die so fast you are just busy spamming reinforcements all the time.

76561197964909121,Recommended,245370,15164914,"Posted: 1 April, 2015",all,Kane McNash,"Every once in a while, from time to time, you find something awesome among the tens of titles produced by small studios, Etherium is one of those games and the more you play it the more you will enjoy it.The game (developed by Tindalos studios and published by Focus Home Interactive) tries a few things which most game companies would avoid in these times of fantasy themed MOBAs, namely to create a hardcore-scifi RTS game, from the very first look you know the developers took heavy inspiration in the likes of Supreme Commander, Starship Troopers, Aliens and other classics of scifi, no Warhammer 40,000 though, there are no chainsword melee oriented units neither blatant ""magic"" psychic powers although there is a considerable reliance on Clarke's Third Law.from a gameplay perspective you will find a very interesting mix of concept which includes territory control, squads and hard-counters, all of this is quite well balanced as no faction really is overpowered, a lot of this is helped by the fact there are many mirror units, but worry not you will still have enough variety as every faction has special powers which make them unique and show a wider array of possible tactics. For instance, you can use the human Consortium financial support to boost your resources in order to get an economic edge over your enemies, the intari on the other hand can automatically level up their units from some command points, allowing for greater shooting accuracy in the battlefield, the Vectides on the other hand have deployable healing and evasion fields, which allow their troops to stay longer.Some other options will make you choice different tactics to defeat the enemy, should you tech rush your awesome heavy walkers while holding the line or should you try to break the enemy's early economy through raiding units? Shall you go for a full military assault or turtle while your orbital cannons force your enemy to evacuate his fleet? Take also in consideration the special events of the maps, which depending on the planet may come from volcanic eruptions which cut certain map sections to hurricanes which may destroy everyone's airforces.The implementation of subfactions also brings other possibilities, you may get these powerful forces through the sacrifice of certain kind of incomes such as command, tech or etherium points, indeed, you may also just wipe them out to capture their territories for further resources and experience.From a background and visual point Etherium brings three unique factions which have been invited by a mysterious entity known as the Smuggler to fight for this precious resource:The human Consortium, kinda like your OCP/Futuretech/Clonglom-O/Weyland-Yutani/Atlas on steroids, through economic power and illegal actions they have become most powerful human power in the universe, eclipsing the old nations of Earth, they relay on monetary and construction tactics and bring an army with the high-tech blocky look you are used whenever someone portrays humany in the coming centuries, no utopia for mankind here, but you still have a solid Starcraft Terran looking arsenal.The Awakened of Intar are your cool scary dogmatic aliens, older than mankind, focused on battle and tactical prowess, with a marble and crystalline stylized look which speaks of a fanatic and spiritual drive, this is perhaps the most ""magical"" faction, with a bit of protoss and another bit of eldar in the mix (without going as far as psionic blades or psychic swords), they use teleporting and time predicting capabilities as well as levelling up powers, great for wreaking havoc across the battlefield.Finally the Vectide Empire is the bio-chemical looking faction, with insectoid looking units, lots of glowing green stuff and the classic martian vibe, they may also remind you of the Hierarchy from Universe At War, long story short, these guys managed to transfer their consciousness into etherium, so if you are thinking about the necrons yes, there seems to be a bit of influence on them, and also the daleks for good measure, take advantage of their healing and evasion drones as well as their infantry boosting structures to overwhelm the enemy through sheer resilience.In the audio department the game makes a decent job with the sound effects and the voice, although it's a bit sad all units have the same stock phrases at least they may remain solid. The music is okm even nice to bring the scifi atmosphere, just' don't expect anything like what you get whenever Frank Klepacki is around.In conclussion, for 30 bucks you get an awesome game, if you have any chance try to get it as soon as possible, you will not regret it."

With these two things combined, it is impossible to play the game properly since the ai has a huge advantage because of this. The combat overal is very rock-paper-scissors like: Each unit has an obvious counter unit, which can be interesting when there are loads of classes, but this game has three main classes. I also find it dissapointing that there are no space battles implemented. When you attack a fleet, it's just dice roll mechanics.With all this said, I think I would reccommend the game if it's on sale and you want to play some RTS every now and then, but if you are an RTS fan and you want an awesome in deth sci-fi RTS experience, stay far away from this game."

Things you can do in the campaign do not work in the tutorials. There are some really bad things, like you can not save during the enemies turn (space turn based section) and the game tends to crash after you play the Real Time Strategy fights. These fights can last up to 30 minutes easily per fight. With multiple enemies attacking one or multiple worlds, means you can spend hours defending territories after you use your turn for whatever you want. At any given point the game can crash and you have to undergo the entire enemy turn again. So even if you have defeated 3 invasions and are working on your fourth, you win it and just as you are supposed to return to the turn based space view, it crashes and you are back to the start of the enemy turn and have to repeat all the fights. Really makes it unplayable. Other than the obvious problems of this games programming, there are other options which are clearly lacking.Many of the standard options you would come across in games these days like easy to control rally points or grab all military units commands are not readily available. It leaves a lot to be desired and that is good in a beta but not in a completed and packaged product. A lot of the concepts are well thought up and fleshed out but don't really make for a very entertaining section. Maps having lava cut off ALL avenues of attack for minutes at a time or weather features that randomly will take out your army and leave the enemy completely unscathed. Most of the options are pretty useless and smaller maps are really just a fast build up.The speed of the game is a bit slow but that is really personal preference. Most of the options are just not worth it."

Even if the game has a strict rock-paper-scissor mechanic with hardcounters all over, there are plenty ways to win without missing possibilities to an individual playstyle.You will see a very good programmed AI, funny but repetitive singleplayer mode, a huge variety of maps, decent balance with just some minor issues, ingame ranking system and a league system similar to SC2.Unfortunately, the game suffers from a very common issue nowadays, a small playerbase.Buy it if gameplay is more important to you than graphics and if you want a straightforward RTS to fill some of your freetime by playing both singleplayer and multiplayer. Otherwise, pass it.EDIT 21/04/15:By now the number of players has reached a point where it become very difficult to get a multiplayer game up without directly inviting a friend.

Whoever did the graphics for this faction needs to SERIOUSLY take a moment to reflect on their overall level of effort. Quality wise, it's Vectides>>>>>Consortium>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Intar- No articulated parts on tanks and many other vehicles, i.e., tracks that don't move, units that literally glide over the terrain = painful to watch.- Units do not emit any type of munitions, for example a multiple rocket launcher - never truly fires a rocket, everything is supposed, no rockets ever leave the tube.- Maps, horrible looking, think red, red, red - everything, the one world where it's supposed to look somewhat similar to earth, more red. Everything is flat, meaning there are minimal shards of vegetation, you'll see things that look like grass, though they are lifeless, as are the planets themselves. They have a low resolution cell-shaded appearance.- Sound has static throughout at random times.- No way currently to offset teams, 2 vs 1 etc. everything has to be equal.- No save game function in skirmish mode.- No advanced movements, formations etc.- Units will not engage often unless directly forced to, your base can be under assault and your units unless they are directly in the enemies line of sight will not engage.That said, I really like this game a lot, would love to see a fourth faction via DLC and some more maps offered."

,Recommended,245370,18422268,"Posted: 10 October, 2015",all,Raven800,"as gameplay goes, I can best describe this as ""RTS for Newbies"" as it takes a semi streamlined style of RTS base building akin to Company of Heroes or Dawn of War 2. Not an amazing game, but it was easy enough for me to pick up and play. Though I must say it does feel a bit incomplete at times and the tutorial leaves much to be desired and the HUD is a bit chaotic and hard to follow. Once you get into it though it gets a little better, but it still leaves much to be desired.Do I recommend this game? yeah i think it's worth a play if you like Dawn of War 2 and COH. The gameplay might get old rather quickly, but I still stand by what i say. It's fun to kill time with. You have 3 factions each with their own special units and their own special off-map abilities with different types of economies and population growth. For example one factoin starts off with 4 ""Division"" (unit) slots and a special unit that specializes in tactical espianage while another faction starts off with 3 ""Division"" slots, requires a research level 3 to access their Special Elite units but in the mean time has an off-map support that allows a player to rabidly promote basic units to higher, more effective levels so as to outclass enemies in the battlefield. The three factions are easy to learn but difficult to master and and you can choose 1 of 4 different maps from up to 6 different environments, each with their own unique environmental hazards that can make or break unit deployments. during key points in your skirmish.So yeah, I can recommend this game for the price that it is now ($20.00). It's not the best RTS I've ever played but it's more certainly not the worst. Some good effort was put into making this game and it shows."

If I can't play through a tutorial before it smokes itself, then I can't be bothered to play it with more than a hundred games in my Steam Library. #PCMasterRaceThe graphics are gorgeous. The scaling in and out is perfect and works well with the resolutions, and I picked a medium-sized 2058x1128 or something with Maximum-everything. #LoveMyR9290XThe gameplay is a bit clunky and slow-paced, from what I managed in the tutorial after it ends and allows you to finish the level out. Building troops is meh and there's little instruction in the tutorial on the slots per command post (some have 1 and some have 3), however its your call once you discover that a slot can be filled with tech, repair, more troops, etc ... but these aren't covered in the tutorial.The vagueness of the tutorial is also irritating. There's no indication that once air transport has lifted comms troops, and you move them, of how to drop them. So you're looking all over the map, re-reading the directions of what to do next and eventually you'll find the drop-circle over the air transport. Seems obvious, but there's 1000000000 buttons on the HUD for every little thing and you're clueless as to what everything does in the beginning.Suggestion: Grey them out for the Tutorial until they're usable. A bit overwhelming.And in the end, I got Raiders to join me, picked up some little rocket buggies, orbital struck the enemy base for ... 0 damage, pretty much, like the tanks, a bit depressing when it comes to tactical firepower and then you just overwhelm the base with like 30 troops and the game crashes.</the end>My windows manager showed that the game was taking something like 2M K of memory at the time of crash (on 8 cores with 16 GB of RAM isn't much, but I digress) and tried to freeze up my system.Not sure why. Nothing is out of date. No explanations. And in reading the forums or community board, only morons claiming that ""your PC is a potato"" is the answer for crashes and you have bad drivers. To him I say, ""Blow me, trollfays. Your nubile PC is no match or comparison for my Kingslayer.

You can dart between locations and point and click at an enemy fleet or the ground.  No actual graphic intense combat scenes ensue.A lot of the intro videos allude to much more in the game, but sadly there isnt.  The developers have made a very good AI and if you do play the campaign you'll find the only way to successfully hold your own is to mercifully squeeze every resource and exploit possible.It is what it is, but its not what they selling it as through their videos.

It's like everyone in modern world has the right to vote: kids at their 18-teens, housewives who produce nothing; former prisoners and just arrived imigrants. For most people RTS is just like Windows solitaire: they're are playing on scripted maps to achieve 1 single result set by designer(s). They don't know what competitivness is, but they do write reviews. Anyway, if you wanted to play a game with complex build-orders like SupCom (not degenerative ones, like in CoH2) and much more than 5-phases-escalated gameplay(it's very very parallel), then your chance is lost (but wait, you could always play with me and some of my friends, if you don't mind, because community is dead too).And if it's proper for me to advise, don't buy Grey Goo instead of this. It's primitive. Felt like 2003-'s. Not bad, but worse than warcraft3, generals, AOM, any successfull title of the past. And yes, it was made by Petroglyph, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, who was kicked off after Emperor:BFD has failed, (was a good game, actually) and the greatest game of C&C serie was made without them. They made that Universe at war instead which I still want to refund.***It looks like the game designed not in a way that favours the most. Well, units aren't individually voiced and graphics could bear some amount of detail ) But game do have it's rich side, it's internal design - mechanics. Conventions is complex and at the same time wouldn't terrorize you with extensive detail.Can't say a word about the singleplayer, but may bring you a tale from the past: C&C3 1.03, crashing on start, F-U most of the WinXP users- So, where is everybody now?- Playing campaign.If you think this game is not good enough for it's money, think again: there was that Planetary Anihilation thing, and someone pay for NO current orbital bombarment and NO current planets collision, like, 49,99£ or 49-99$ (personally took it on the zommer sale for ~ 29zi). And somehow, PA by now got Postive user reviews, while Ethrium is currently Mixed... At the very least, you'll get complete game with no dropped features, balanced and stable.Considering bugs. The only one I had was when the game randomly redefined my control keys(pretty strange and was only once). And yes, there is a good connection on the multiplayer, and, looks like, no lag-compression(or it's tuned just fine; anyway, no missing orders here).Good-made RTS. Took what is needed from the genre and expanded it with it's own content. Not a revolution, of course, but may be a good start for a new serie.If you are fan of RTS, getting bored of your current rank, or just in search of smt adequately new, this game is for you."

You capture zones and use them to house certain extensions that can bring down troops, repair them, or even make your legendary units more powerful.-command points: use these to call down orbital barrages, spy on the enemy, or even make your units more powerful.-Squad-based ""divisions"": The units are organized into divisions which are grouped together in groups of either 10, 5, 2, or 1. These divisions can level up Halo Wars style and even become legendary, which gives a massive increase to accuracy, dodge, and health.-Colossi: Colossi are massive walkers capable of levelling entire bases or armies. They are the super-weapons of this game, and are certainly cool.-Multiple ways to win: you can win by destroying the enemy's base or their fleet with orbital cannons.-Fleet gameplay: A fun, fleshed out experience in conquest mode.-Secondary factions: Sway these powerful factions into your favor and you may just get some sweet allies.Cons-Multiplayer: The userbase is rather small, and therefore, the multiplayer is usually hard to find matches on.-Crashes: This game sometimes crashes after certain battles, and you may have to replay them.-the different factions are rather ssimilarTL;DRThis game is fun and rather well made. It has some refreshing ideas, but the multiplayer and crashes are definitely disheartening. This game is a very fun game. I highly recommend this."

I have post on the offical forum, well no response.Focus Home Interactive, please improve your support for YOUR released titles that are still on steam!

If you can get it for 5$ like I did via the Steam sale, and are craving an RTS game to just jump into and mess around with, then go for it.However, if you're expecting any depth from this game, you won't find it in Etherium.  It's a game of many missed opportunities, and for me I wonder why they missed them at all when the game itself is so bland and simple.- No space battles, which could have easily made way for some nice variation in the Dawn of War: Soulstorm style Conquest mode, or even made for an interesting co-op mode/campaign where you have one player fighting on the ground for resources and the other fighting in space putting pressure on the fleet to disrupt reinforcements.- No real campaign/story mode to really acquaint you with the races aside from the faction introductions, I would have loved for some sort of story driven campaign to really integrate you with your faction of choice, as well as the other factions should you so choose, and give you a better scope of what the game's central premise is about in full.The gameplay itself is pretty fun, I enjoy the battles and the way everything develops with the amount of unit variation/entrenching of postions, but the lack of faction uniqueness as far as unit rosters were concerned kind of took away from that for me.I can only hope they decide to add story driven campaigns and space battles in future DLC content, assuming they even have plans to do this, but if not that's pretty unfortunate as this game definitely has the potential of being so much more."

While this isn't a huge issue it does make the game feel rather long. Each fleet has two actions per turn. This means that in single player Conquest you can end up fighting two battles per alien turn because they seem to enjoy attacking you over the other faction. When you start getting to the point they have two or even three fleets in orbit of one of your worlds and each fleet can attack twice thats a LOT of battles to fight without an auto-resolve and since most battles take 30-40 minutes for me... Its a good game and i enjoy but please for the love of god add in a auto-resolve :)

No point on playing conquest and for the entire game itself is amazing but they did nothing for this game and this game would had a chance of becoming something great.

Units are weak, and you can have hardly any of them at all. Oddly, stability is also an issue even though hardly anything happens on screen. It's a fascinating concept, but the execution was lackluster. This game feels like it was designed and coded for a mobile device.Overall? This game isn't worth it for $9.99. The devs have abandoned it, so nothing will be done about any of the problems. You'd be better served by picking up a slightly more expensive game, like Ashes of the Singularity or Supreme Commander.I wouldn't be surprised if the curators and gaming sites that recommended this game were paid to do so. Nobody could possibly recommend this game without financial compensation."
