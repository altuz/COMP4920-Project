I will caution if you want to play this and start out the Wizardry Trilogy...patience is something you must have! Either that be from making characters that can survive the first parts of the game(even well into the end of the game...) or constant reloading cause you don't want anyone to die from a fight(and thus lose 1 point of Vitality), which is a constant danger, Even with a little bad luck you are in a frustration.With all that aside, I will say never has a game given it a real sense of victory for gaining a level or beating a group of foes...or even beating that game! Frankly you'll need the guide provided to make any regular progress, otherwise you'll lost for a long time.So if you want a real old challenge...this is it! Let this be the start of a real adventure!"

Maybe it's just me, but the doors in this game seem a little hard to open. Having to save before every door is a given; having to reload a save because every door is made of titanium shouldn't be. When you finally pry the door open, you'll be treated to old school monsters like bats and rats that will dodge your every blow as they lay in gentle slumber. No worries, however, for if things get too hairy for you in the depths of this 1990s castle, your characters have the option to run away; which was the default operation of graybeard D&D players who cut their teeth on the 1st edition of the pen-and-paper game. Unbeknownst to you, however, is while you spent thirty rounds swinging in futility at sleeping enemies before they awoke to tear your hide apart, you were set upon by other enemies who ambush you as you run away. Whatevs, you think, I'll just run from them also. Well, when these monsters come to gangbang a party of inadequately-statted paper tigers, they come in droves.Then, inevitably, Death and his SoundBlaster call, as he stands over your tombstone. Yes, a single tombstone, because in the 8-bit era, your horde of characters are buried in the same hole, piled one upon another like firewood, except firewood is useful and characters in the game of Wizardry are not. But, you, my friend, are a true old school RPG fan, and you never give up. You spend hours rolling another party and head down into the depths, uneasy at the strange feeling that you are not playing a clone of Dungeons & Dragons but of the RPG Paranoia, where the Dungeon is not your friend and the assembly line of heroes who engage in suicide-by-bushwhacker is moving faster than that conveyor belt in I Love Lucy.You will never give up, not until you beat this damned game. Because it CAN be beaten—can it? Or is this game like the module Tomb of Horrors, an exercise by game developers to assume the role of a merciless and antagonistic god, presiding over a world whose populace is comprised solely of doomed heroes fresh from the womb that see the gates of a hungry dungeon and shudder at their fate.Addendum: Apparently, there is a tool to boost your ability scores during character creation, which will save you the tedium of hours rerolling your team like I did. It isn't necessary, but welcome, especially on a subsequent playthrough."

Unlike other RPG's you'll feel a sense of accomplishment because you helped create these characters and develop their own storyline rather than letting the game decide it for you."

The story and gameplay of that version are  nearly identical to the steam version, but other aspects are greatly improved.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=895826458&fileuploadsuccess=1The steam version has reused some same sprites for many different characters. For example, the steam version has all these 9 characters look identical  (AMAZULU，MEI-LAI，BRIGERD WOLTAN，VALKYRIE，AMAZULU QUEEN，KUWALI KUBONA，AMAZULU ARCHER，SHAMANESS，PRIESTESS), while the SFC Version has them all look very diffirent.The music of the SFC version is also very cool. (One of the bonus contents of the steam version is the musics from the SFC version in MP3 format, you can check up if you want to know how good the musics of the SFC version are.)Now that I have beaten the SFC version, I do not intend to play the steam version through. But it is good to have. The pdf manual and hint book are cool. The cooleset bonus content is the mp3 musics of the SFC version. I originally intend to buy this cd from Amazon. This Wizardry buddle saves me some 100 dollars or so, by giving it as bonus! Now I can listen to these cool musics when I drive to my working-place.Above all, the steam version is cool, the SFC version is far cooler. I really hope that one day, the SFC emulated version of this game can be bought in Steam."

,Recommended,245410,34358413,Posted: 19 August,all,give the dog a gun,"I feel like I should preface this review by saying that A) Bane of the Cosmic Forge is the first first-person dungeon crawling crpg that I've ever played to completion, and B) I did this with the express purpose of importing a party into Crusaders of the Dark Savant. Also, this was within the last year, I wasn't alive when these games came out originally.Bane of the Cosmic Forge is something pretty unlike any other cRPG I've ever played. Sure, it looks uglier than sin and the character design has aged like♥♥♥♥♥♥and the story is complete nonsense BUT! The dungeon design, while really brutal in the early-going, consistently surprised me. Essentially the whole game takes place in a single mega-dungeon type area with several different subsections. The design of these individual subsections and the way they wove together at times was clearly the work of a group of designers who knew what they were doing. Once you've got a handle on the mechanics of this game, exploring these areas becomes so much fun. Some of the puzzles were pretty obtuse if you werent drawing a map (or unless, like me, you cheated and used the automap mod) but this is the age of information and if google's at hand you'll be fine, there's tons of resources for this game.The character creation in this game is pretty cute, you have to roll high in specific stats to qualify for individual classes, like so many cRPGs from this time. The thing is, as you level up your stats will advance and you can actually switch to these classes at level 1 later on, while keeping all of your skills, which is a neat feature.Honestly though, having played through a good chunk of this game's frankly incredible sequel, Wizardry 7, I can't say that this one is too worth playing. There's one tileset, the sound sucks (I just muted it and listened to podcasts while I played), and after a while the tedium does start to set in. Still, coming out the other end of it is pretty rewarding (even if the final boss that I experienced was kinda lackluster).Basically, it's pretty good, pick it up if you already have any interest in DOS cRPGs, and the ability to import your characters into Wizardry 7 with some of the neater equipment from this game is fun. If you get bored of this one though, it's packaged with its sequel which just takes all of its ideas and improves on them, with several more tileset and beautiful VGA pixel art. Plus it's dirt cheap so if you don't like it or it takes you a while and a few tries to even play the damn thing, like me, you're not losing too much."

I never played it before, first time I tried it - December 2016.Though it is difficult. It does require a lot of work with sketching a map or (the way better idea) to download a modthat draws the map for you and saves it for you (and shows your location, which hand drawn map won't do).Besides, while I am against any walkthrougs in general (unless you are stuck that is), I would reccomend one for this game.The mod disables the option to save and load state in any time you want, so I'd suggest using Daum version to roll your characters (save scum as much as you want with it, to save time) and install the mod than.The game is fun and rich in content, despite it's age (1990). Plus, you can export characters later to play Wizardry 7.And 8 after that :) Wizardry 8 was the main reason I started playing it and I'm pretty sure I will finish it. It is old and cranky.But it's worth it."

I haven't really played much of the game itself. If (like me) you prefer to not use cheats you need to spend a long time rerolling your characters so you can get a high strength, and I mean hours. Since you need high rolls to unlock some classes (Samurai, Ninja, Bishop, Lord- which is just a Valkyrie but can be male and is kind of crap, etc.) and you need lots of bonus points from those rolls to up your carrying capacity (based on STR) which doesn't go up after initial character creation. Most of your rolls will be 5 to 10 when you need 18s and 22s.That's after you've read the almost 200 page manual to get an idea of what kind of characters you need and will work. The game is very old school, the graphics aren't that great, there's no music (I assume the ""6+7"" soundtrack is actually just from 7) indeed there's very little sound at all aside from PC-speaker ambient noise and metallic clanks. (Time to bust out those Iron Maiden and Helloween albums.) If this sounds like something you'd like, it probably is. If it sounds like something you wouldn't like, then you're probably right.PS- I recommend turning off the mouse and just using the keyboard, it's much faster and easier."

The game also trolled me more than once.Killing monsters- traveling anywhere was an endless slog through goons. I would quit sessions because I had run out of patience.Getting loot- cool, unique items with a .2% drop rate, useless key items that took up inventory space and never go away, and two separate inventory bags per character all led to frustration.Becoming stronger- getting high-tier characters required grinding monsters for experience and dice rolls for stats.Despite how frustrating the game could be, I still had fun ☺"

76561197971477344,Recommended,245410,23958100,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,BerlinCB,"** Recommended, but with stipulations.  :)Back in 1984 I played the original Wizardry game and fell in love with PC gaming forever.  I played the entire series and enjoyed them all to a point, but 6-8 were masterful RPGs with a connected storyline that spanned the trilogy (you could port your characters from one to the next).  The character depth and NPC interaction was amazing at the time (NPCs remember how you treat and interact with them and it matters throughout the games).  The puzzles and critical thinking you needed to utilize to figure things out were challenging.  It was difficult, no doubt, but after you learned the ins and outs it gave a great gaming experience.THAT SAID, the only way that a younger current generation could ever enjoy this game is to understand a few things:You can't be hung up on graphics, because these are pitiful by today's standards.  You can't expect all the user bells and whistles of today's games like auto-mapping, quest journals, etc.   None of that is there, and you either have to map and journal by hand or you can use the ""Wizardry 6 - Cluebook"" that comes with the Steam purchase and is located in the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Wizardry6\Bonus Content"" (default) directory.  If you want to experience the golden age of RPG gaming, I'd recommend you do it with this companion guide and/or a walk-through from the internet (there are many and these games have a cult following).  This way you get to experience the great parts of the game, while mitigating the frustrating parts.  You absolutely should research the internet for assistance with the character generation, as it can be daunting, but it quite enjoyable once you understand it.Definitely pick it up during a Steam sale for under $2 and that way if you don't enjoy it, you didn't lose much.** - Just an FYI if you purchase this, you can hit ""Enter"" at the copy protection scheme, as it isn't necessary with the Steam version."
,Recommended,245410,8489726,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,Octogenarian,"It may quite possibly be nostalgia talking but I played this to death in my youth. It is a deep and wonderful RPG in many ways and although it is dated the basic story and the wealth of items and choices is still enjoyable. This is the pedigree from which games like Legend of Grimrock stem and while it isn't as pretty as modern incarnations it is still very atmospheric.The RPG ""simulation"" is substantially more complex than what is common in modern games and that makes it necessity to read through the manual at least in part. Everything from attacks to spells have modifiers and classes have a diverse set of mechanics. This in turn means that some classes are weak and brittle until relatively late in the game when they blossom into excellent additions.There is no hand holding and the assumptions you make when exploring will influence what ending you will get. The feature to bring the party forward to subsequent games is laudable and it was a novel experience when the game was fresh.I am far less enamoured of the next installment probably because the port to my chosen platform was hideously broken, sluggish and failed to include the party import but the ""Bane"" was installed for years on my PowerBook 165c, infact that old hunk of plastic still runs and this is still one of the games installed.In summary at the current Winter Sale price it is well worth adding to your library just for the hell of it and just while playing enough to be allowed to review it I once again got stuck rolling characters to get that perfect race / profession combination. I find it especially heart warming that the copy protection is still in there even if it has been disabled, while I did own the game the tiny irksome nature of looking up codes lent me to learn some basic 68k assembly.It is highly recommended that you set it to keyboard control only to save on some fiddly clicking as using the arrow keys is substantially faster,."

This is a genuine NES-generation RPG built to essentially replicate D&D on PCs not even powerful enough to run Windows 3.x...I'll be up-front with it: In this game, you start by building a party by rerolling virtual dice, sometimes for hours, until you get stats you can accept in your pre-planned growth strategy that will last the whole game before you even set foot in the dungeon.  If mashing a reroll button (which is made even less convenient by not letting you cancel out - you have to finish making a character before you can try again) to get the stats you want doesn't appeal to you, turn around, now.Even if you get attributes you like, you can still be screwed by randomly having only 3 hit points on a melee character in a game where a mere rat hits for 5 hp, you have full death on 0 hp, revive items and spells are extremely rare outside the late game, and even if you did, you PERMANENTLY lose 1 Vitality (on characters with an average of 10), which drops future HP growth.  Basically, if you take one unlucky hit, you have to reload.  (And there's no soft reset, you have to finish the combat or alt-tab and force-close the program...)To stop this, you can try to use a sleep spell, and insta-kill the rats, right?  HAHA! NOPE! Enjoy missing against an unconscious enemy about 60% of the time, and then having about a 50% chance that your sword won't penetrate the ""armor"" of the rat.Then, you have the locked doors.  Highly random, and failure frequently JAMS the door, making it impossible to open except by magic or single-use keys that are rare drops.  At least reloading is faster, here.Unlike other D&D clones, however, skills are train-through-use, not unlike Elder Scrolls.  This makes many skills, like weapon skills, easily trained by merely hitting the target (not that such an event is at all common) while only a few require actually spending skill points on them.  In some ways, this is great, as it means you can power-grind characters all you want.  On the other hand, this means that the game basically just flat-out expects you to power-grind every skill to max fairly early on, and 100 points in a skill isn't necessarily going to mean you succeed.That said, unlike Wizardry 8, there's extremely large room for multiclassing abuse.  This is a game that is more free-form about its character creation specs, and if you gained a single level as a bard, you can continue to train bard music then turn into a mage, take up some spellcasting, then go samurai to continue training as a singing, spell-casting, warrior.This is also a game old enough that having all the women topless wasn't a major concern, the manual is written as if it assumes you're 8 years old, and rolling a female character means you take a -2 to strength, but, ""That's OK, because women have a +1 to personality and karma!""  (Note: they're both basically useless. That said, the gender-restricted valkyrie class is generally worth it, anyway, and the caster classes don't need strength... unless you multi-class to a hybrid class.)If the idea of ridiculous power-grinding appeals to you, and you don't mind savescumming 'till your fingers bleed, then maybe, just maybe, you'll be the sort of person that loves this sort of game.  I can't even explain why, it's just a COMPULSION.  You'll beat that lock next time! You are so close to making that spectacular ninja-valkyrie or psionist-monk!"

A legendary name for a legendary game franchise, created by two U.S.A. college students in their spare time, one can’t help but wonder if they thought or even knew that their game, along with the Ultima franchise, would shape RPGs as we know them today. Probably not. But they did, and whether they knew of the greatness they would achieve is no longer questionable, but one thing is certain: a particular video game publisher out there wants us to remember the fun times we had playing Wizardry (at least from Wizardry VI, the subject of this review, onwards) because we can now purchase them and play them legally from websites such asGOG.comand Steam.Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge came to make our Dungeons & Dragons senses tingle way back in 1990 for the Amiga and DOS platforms. And for a game that’s as advanced as this one is, which is by the standards set in 1990, by the way, this game had a lot of cool features. A complex character creation system, skills that increased the more you used them, there’s more,I’m sure, but I can’t exactly remember them.Gameplay-wise, the game feels like a turn-based version of the RPG known as 'Eye of the Beholder’. When starting out, you must create a party of between 2-6 members, and you can choose their race, gender, class, what skills they specialize in, etc. Now, I’m fully well-aware that in this day and age, most people prefer to play with characters who are based into the story, but for me, at least, this is a welcome change. After creating the characters that will be in your party, you then venture into the castle, where the Cosmic Forge is said to rest. Your party has to fight and build up their skills and experience by fighting life-or-death battles with rats, bats, rogues, and for whatever reason, moving vines. At times, you must use their skills to solve puzzles. It isn’t much, again, by today’s standards, but back then, things like this in video games were unheard of. Using skills, such as Search to find hidden things within the game’s world, could make the game easier or harder, depending on the skills you invested points into.If you came here to see what music you can rock out to while playing the game, you... are totally S.O.L., my friend! The only “music” you can hear in this game is what sounds like the flapping of wings and something banging around on walls. And even then, you only hear it when you’re standing still. Now, when you hit enemies while you’re in battle, you’ll hear what sounds like a weapon of some sort hitting something else that’s metal, but it plays no matter what enemy you hit, regardless of whether or not they wear armor. Again, that’s just a small nitpick of mine, it’s not a make-or-break deal. At least, for me it isn’t.Graphics are actually very-well developed. You can tell what monsters (with a few exceptions) are of what type and in the inventory, you can tell (usually) what type of weapon is what, based on the name and item icon. And while the tilesets in the game are good-looking as well, be prepared to see them A LOT.Unfortunately, I can only in good conscience recommend this game to Hardcore Dungeons & Dragons fans. Or, to someone who has the patience of a saint for all of the grinding you’ll be doing throughout the game, and believe, you WILL do quite a bit of grinding if you want to get even remotely close to the end of the game."

Spend the extra time rolling characters. Spread it out in 20-30m bursts over days if you want. I like to have the following:Lord, maxing strength if possible. (No switch intended. Late-game ebony, mantis, etc will ensure super low AC)Ninja, with enough extra points to assign stats for a guaranteed profession switch to Samurai when needed. Allows maxed Kirijitsu by late game. (One game I made this a super-ranger who went ninja at level 8).Samuri or Monk, with enough extra points to assign stats for a guaranteed profession switch to Ninja. Allows maxed Kirijitsu by late game. Have one Samuri by or after Hall of the Dead, so you can equpi Murusama Blade. Second-best weapon in game (to Excalibur, which pretty much never drops).Rawulf priest with stats to change to bishop at first profession change. Rawulfs can always switch back to priest because they start with 12 PIE.Mage with stats to switch to bishop at first profession change. (I like elf because 10 INT, 10 PIE, making priest-mage switching very easy)Mage with stats to switch to bishop at first profession change. (I like elf because 10 INT, 10 PIE)One mage should pick Knock-knock at earliest opportunity to address lack of thief.I make all casters into ninjas before or after entering the Enchanted Forest (last 'zone') and equip them with the best ranged weapons I can afford (ninjato / cat o' nine tails, depending on available gold). At that point, you can trigger fights at the Temple of Ramm by approaching without a mask. You'll get 2-5 groups of melee-only enemies. Just read your book while holding down return, and your party of 1 Lord and 5 Ninjas will wipe them out methodically.Over the many many years, I have come to the conclusion that you should only play alchemist/psionic if you want extra spell points, or an extra challenge. Their spells are weak and more often resisted in comparison to mages.2. Profession switches at ideal times. Your casters should switch around multiple times, in a staggered rotation to make sure you have at least one to cast max-lvl iceball and another max lvl fireball.2a. Waiting at spell point regeneration fountains (L3 in Mines, outside Hall of Damned, inside Hall of Dead) and deliberately generating fights. I like to find a corridor near to these locations, and strafe left/right on the keyboard with one hand while reading a book; can keep one finger a tiny bit above the other relative to the keys and you can rapidly switc. Glance up once every half-page to see if you've met an encounter. Time will fly because you're reading, meanwhile, you are generating a tremendous amount of exp for the brief periods you're paying attention to the game (during the fights). Fill up on spell points inbetween fights or groups of fights instead of resting. You will accumulate an incredible amount of spell points, and way more HP than a caster usually has this way. But it does take patience.  This also generates a ton more gold than you would normally get.This is particularly advisable because top tier spells (ie, Asphyxiation, Nuclear Blast, Death Wish, Word of Death) do not work in the Steam verison of Bane. A fight with five groups of monsters that might be knocked out with a blast or two instead takes 10+ fireballs. Etc.(SERIOUSLY, fix that, please. I beg you)."
