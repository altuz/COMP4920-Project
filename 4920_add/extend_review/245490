,Not Recommended,245490,13840779,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Sandsh8rk,"Please take time to read the whole review...Don't get me wrong, by itself Trials Fusion is a decent game - Great graphics, great scenery and keeps the elements of its predecessors without changing too much. However, as a person who has dedicated over 120 hours into Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I must say that Fusion is pretty underwhelming compared to it.First of all, there are significantly fewer levels in this game than there are in TEGE - it took me at least 20 hours to get the medal tally required to unlock the platinum medals, but in Fusion it only took me 4 hours. It definitely felt like a step backwards in content.This leads to the next point - Ubisoft decided that in order for us to get more levels, we'd have to fork out money for a season pass. That's right, they took our beloved Trials franchise and decided to include DLC in it. It definitely feels like a dog move against us.Lastly, they decided to leave out the most essential feature when they released this game - online multiplayer! And only this year they decide they're finally going to release it? Pretty crap if you ask me.Final verdict - If you have played Trials Evolution Gold Edition for a while and feel like playing some new, different levels, buy this game when it's on sale, as if you ignore all of its flaws it's a pretty good game.If you have never played a trials game before, buy Trials Evolution Gold Edition as it is a lot more fun to play than this game."

This is a time waster, if you make it through to the extreme maps, then I'd say good luck.The difficulty of the game ranges from beginner, easy, normal, hard, extreme. When you are on the beginner maps you'll blast through the  levels, although when you move up, it'll of  course get harder - a lot harder.The game has 1  big bug which could put you off buying it though. It's that low fps cause a slowmotion effect, which renders the game more or less unplayable. A solution is to lower the settings, but i'd just like to include this.The DLC that's out so far (3 out of 6 planned)  they're all worth picking up IF you like the game. I'd say they're more difficult than the other maps, but not by much. In each DLC  you get atleast 9 new trails. I think you'd have to be a person that wants to get the best medal on everything to justify the 5€ price tag though.I personally love this game when I need to take a break from everything. It's calming and frustrating in a weird sort of way."

First up is Uplay. Everyone hates Uplay.There are never any players online, so there goes that whole section of gameplay... there's never anybody to play with.The DLC is just a huge money grab. The game by itself doesn't have enough content to justify the $19.99 price tag. I paid it and expected a lot... I got a little with the offer to pay more to get tracks that should have come with the game. That extra $19.99 for the season pass seems steep, because it is. $40 for a ""complete"" game that doesn't have much depth or the replayability of the older Trials games is a rip off. If the DLC (which should have come with the game anyways) was included in the original price, I would be more apt to recommend it.Screw Ubisoft for being so greedy, and for forcing Uplay on the innocent."

,Recommended,245490,15888769,"Posted: 18 May, 2015",all,Dj =D,"Sale edit: Every DLC is on sale right now, this hasn't happened before, so take the very low price into account with my DLC reviews :)Awesome level MAX Edit: This isn't included in the season pass, and as yet I do not own it. I'll update this section with details on whether the DLC is worth a full price or not when I purchase it for myself. As for the introduced microtransactions, they're purely cosmetic and not required.IntroductionThis was the first Trials game I ever played, and it's great. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, most of them are negative simply because it uses Uplay, which I shall talk about further down the review.SettingFirst off, the environment in this game is stunning. For a game like Trials, in which you just ride your bike across level after level, you wouldn't expect this level of quality, the world looks like it's part of a much larger game. There's also plenty of variety, as you quickly move from the futuristic city to platforms in the sky, ancient ruins, outdoor courses, underwater bases and even the planet's core. There is also some slight hints of story included through a few characters talking throughout the game, which hint at how the world became like this.GameplayIt's trials. You drive your bike, tilt your weight and try to make it to the end as fast as possible and with as few failures as possible. Every level also has three challenges that encourage you to play differently, and some even involve minigames entirely different to how the game is usually played. The difficulty as you pass through the levels is done very well. By the time I was met with much harder obstacles, I'd already got a basic idea of how to surpass them, and not once did a death feel cheap.DLCThe DLCs add some nice extra content that also gives you a look at more of the world of Fusion, and provide some decent challenge. I wouldn't recommend buying them seperately, but if you don't want to buy the Deluxe Edition, here's a summary of their content and quality:2/10/15 Edit: Read the Deluxe Edition section for my opinion on prices!Riders of the RustlandsThe first DLC and the weakest. Featuring only 6 levels, an FMX course and a mediocre minigame. -Not really worth £4 compared to the other DLCs, skip this one and get another.Empire of the SkySame as above, 6 levels, FMX and a minigame. The levels are a bit better than Rustlands,but still not worth £4. If you've beat the game and want some more fun, get this DLC. Otherwise you can ignore it.Welcome to the AbyssBreaks the chain and includes 8 levels instead of 6, as well as the FMX and minigame at the end. This DLC gives an interesting look at an underwater empire that used to live under the ocean. Some story is delivered through another AI who speaks to you at certain points. The levels are of a higher standard than the first two DLCs,and I think barely justifies its £4 pricetag.Fire in the deep9 levels, FMX and a minigame. In this DLC you are even further down, underneath the planet's core. As you move from level to level you go further underground, giving a nice indication of your progress through the DLC. There are also multiple secret recordings hidden around the levels, which give some extra information about the world, and what went on in the mines.Worth it.Fault One ZeroPersonally, I believe this is the best DLC. It drops one level and returns to 8 trials again, but the quality of the levels steps up greatly. This DLC has a focus on technology, much more so than previously shown, with teleporters, anti gravity machines and Mechs featuring. The levels in this DLC are very inventive, includingone that repeatedly glitches between looking normal, and a blue cyberspace-esque environmentandan interesting level in which you drive around inside three arcade machines!This DLC is definitely worth £4.After the IncidentThe sixth and final DLC. Same as above, 8 levels with an FMX and Minigame. One of my main disapointments with Trials Fusion was the lack of detail as to what was happening. I understand that this is a game solely based on a random guy riding a bike through obstacle courses, but with such an interesting world, with many deeper story elements hinted at throughout, I really wanted to learn more. After the Incident does so nicely. It's set in the future, when all the world is in ruins after the aforementioned ""Incident"". The levels all focus on fairly different areas, all destroyed or going through some form of crisis. Similar to Fire in the Deep, you can find secrets in the levels, which give you some backstory as to how all of this started. The way this is done is great, asSynDI talks to you through a dating game text box, with amusing exagerated changes in her expression as she talks.If you want to know more about the world behind Fusion, or just want to play even more levels,this DLC is worth the money.Deluxe EditionI'd like to point out that this game has gone on multiple sales, but not a single time have the DLC packs gone on discount themselves, and it doesn't look like they will at any time unfortunately.--In the most recent sale at the time of writing, all DLCs aside from Awesome Level MAX have been reduced to 99p, so I'd definitely recommend waiting for a sale before purchasing any DLCs--As such, I highly recommend you get the Deluxe edition during a sale, I managed to pick it up for £10. Otherwise, if you beat the game and decide you want more, you will be paying a much higher price. Say you got the base game on sale for £6. Now if you got three of the DLCs, that'll cost you an extra £12. Half the DLC total DLC and you've spent £18 already. The Deluxe edition is a much better purchase (During a sale of course. The DLC is good but not worth £30!)Why the negative reviews?Now, there are three main flaws that have gave this game so many negative reviews. First main point is the multiplayer. I played the game entirely solo and had fun, I can't really comment on it.Secondly, people seem to be complaining about this being a bad port, and having a many performance issues. For reference, I ran the game on an i5 3570k, 8gb RAM and a GTX 770 with constant 60fps and no issues of any kind. The issue may be related to lower-end machines.And as for the last point, UPlay. The majority of these reviews are from people starting the game, seeing Uplay, closing it and leaving a bad review. I will say right here that if you avoid this game because of Uplay, you are stupid.But UPlay sucks!The impact of UPlay is nowhere near as bad as the reviews make it sound. You start the game on Steam, UPlay appears, takes a couple seconds to log in, then minimizes and starts the game. You only need to interact with it once in order to create an account, and after that you don't need to touch the thing, aside from closing it when you are done.EDIT: UPlay now does not even appear when you start a game through Steam. It minimizes itself. Seriously guys, the impact is so minimal it's not even worth arguing about!ConclusionAll in all, I recommend Trials Fusion to anyone who is an existing trials fan, or enjoys 2D games with high difficulty. Though the price is a little steep for the content on offer, so I'd suggest waiting for a sale and getting the deluxe edition. As earlier stated, it's much better value as the DLCs never get discounted, and only costed £4 (the price of a single DLC) more than the normal pack in the latest sale. And finally, do not avoid this game because of UPlay, there is no reason to."

Get some friends together and it only multiplies it, but it's solid even by itself.Here's a video showcasing my shenanigans in this game for those who are curious. If not, just read the rest of the review below.http://youtu.be/3CtaMJHEkaYI'll start by saying the gameplay is pretty simple, but challenging at the same time. The only thing you're doing is balancing your rider and your bike along a path while pounding the gas. However, the balancing part is the main problem and where all the challenge lies. The courses have you flying and leaping over all sorts of nonsensical obstacles, and landing it perfectly just doesn't happen sometimes. Even more so when you're trying to show off in front of your friends and botch the trick. But in my personal opinion, it's more fun failing than it actually is succeeding. It's hilarious watching my rider flop around because I was being a dope and got overzealous in my flips, which is a huge boon to the game because you're having a blast whether you're succeeding or failing miserably like I do sometimes.The game also doesn't feel cheap, nor feel like it cheats you out of anything. It's easy enough to get a silver medal on most tracks, but getting a gold is never too out of reach. It saddens me a little that doing tricks doesn't net you anything special besides cool points for yourself, but at the same time, it's one less thing I have to worry about if all I'm trying to do is unlock things. It allows you to play the game the way you want to, and having more options of playing the game is always better.And even when you run out of tracks to do in the game, there is a track creation tool that can make more and be shared with the comminity, so you don't have to worry about stuff to do. The game is even getting DLC in the future with more tracks if community stuff isn't your thing, so there's an option for you there as well.As far as negatives go, my complaints are very minor. While the stages themselves look amazing, all the stuff that's happening sometimes can be a little distracting from what you're doing. Or sometimes even the reverse is true, that you're so focused on your bike, you don't notice all the stuff happening around you when you want to see it. Another thing is that all of the stuff happeing in the background doesn't really effect what you're doing in the foreground. It's just fluff. I think it would've added a bit more diversity and dynamics if the stage interacted with the rider more.There's also still a few bugs in the game or poor optimization. When I went to the create tool, it locked up my comp, which is a beast and shouldn't have any trouble loading anything. The same goes with how long it takes to select a ride at the beginning of the stages. I just stare at a black screen for a good while before something eventually pops up. But thankfully you can just press A to go to the course regardless, so it isn't that big of a deal.So to sum it up, for 20 dollars, you're gonna have a blast with this title. It looks good, feels good, has a great sense of humor (the endings and the announcer make me laugh quite a bit), has potential to grow, and is fun with friends. Definitely pick this up, even more so when it goes on sale."

I'll play the living hell out of it because I'm obsessed with the series, but it takes a very specific kind of person to really squeeze 50 dollars of play value out of this (base game + all DLC).Ubisoft really did some damage to the series and this game hardly stands well against previous games in the series. I still believe Trials HD is the best in the series, but that's more a personal opinion. I would recommend checking out the previous game, Trials Evolution Gold Edition, rather than settling on Fusion. Although the multiplayer is still rather empty, it's still a more down-to-earth title that keeps a lot of the aesthetics that make the Trials series so great. Plus it has way more tracks in the base game than Fusion does."

I've been playing the RedLynx trials games since waaay back when they were just 2D Flash games; so they've come a looong way.However - I ride a motorcycle daily, still do trials biking on my bicycle, and have ridden actual Trials motorcycles, and I actually prefer the handling of it's predecessor:""Trials Evolution"".PROSThe prettiest graphics of any Trials game to date; with fantastic gameplay to match.There's a wide range of beautiful environments and props for you to not only race in, but also create your own tracks in (with a bewildering amount of customisation). Your rides and riders can be personalised too, with (most) items being unlocked with progress and paid for with the in-game currency you earn. The rider can now do tricks in midair (once you unlock them) for that extra XP and show(off)manship. Tracks are varied, clever and engaging. And for those hardcore completionists, there's three side achievements for every track which range from simple to-dos to entire minigames. Lots of extra fun and value. Oh, and in case you didn't know, there are also Online and Local multiplayer modes too.CONSHandling that can be hard to understand and predict.I will say, the bikes move at a more realistic pace than ever before, feeling like they have real weight an inertia. But hit a bump or land from a drop, and sometimes those physics go out the window with a bike that surges and bounces like a space hopper, or jams/judders in a way that seems to stall the bike. Evolution had a bit of this too, but it made sense as the bikes felt light and twitchy. But when a hefty bike does it, it's hard to react, and harder to counter (the heavier bikes mean less airborne control). Performance also struggles too - The game isn't overly complicated, but it seems quite demanding on CPU and GPU power for what you get.OVERALLA great time wasting and skill honing game for people of all ages and gaming levels. Definitely worth buying if you see it on sale, but you may as well skip Steam and get in from uPlay directly (as you have to use uPlay anyway). However, if you're rig isn't very powerful, you'd be better served getting Trials Evolution - it's just as much fun, and probably better value."

The stages built around doing those tricks for points are too unforgiving: the checkpointing means you only get one shot at each jump trick, so any failed attempt means you've lost a potential 20% or so points for that stage. Maybe losing your multiplier would have been enough of a deterrent; as it stands, falling is too easy and too costly, so it makes sense to play it safe -- and that's boring, especially for a mode that's supposed to be a bit more crazy than the precision driving at the core of the franchise. Uniracers did it first and better, basically.'Challenges' are either Easter eggs hard to figure out without a guide, or require feats like finishing with zero fault while doing 10 tricks or never letting go of the gas pedal. That's one way to stretch playtime over a small number of tracks...Tournaments are one thing that's improved, though: they're time-limited and renewed every few hours, which is a good encouragement to participate and try to rank high.Now that the first piece of DLC (out of a planned 6) is out, it's obvious that we can't count on them to fix the fundamental problem of there not being enough content: each will be the size of a world, so 6 regular tracks and 2 gimmicky ones (and the first pack is boring like the rest, too).Are RedLynx / Ubi counting on player-created content to pick up the slack? Trying to find really good content is still a crapshoot though -- you can only rely on the 'featured' categories, very basic filters, or a percentage of positive reviews. There's quite a few enjoyable enough tracks, some with clever moments, but few if any are comparable in quality to the dev-made tracks from Trials Evolution, and you have to be in the mood to rummage around for them.It pains me to say it, but this is a disappointment. Just get Trials Evolution, and don't get Fusion until you've played so much Evo you're sick of it. And even then, be aware it's not great value at full price."

,Recommended,245490,20458994,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,ExLee,"Trials Fusion is a perfect time killer because you'll be playing and retrying all the tracks multiple times to get the best times. Thanks to the great bike physics this series is known for, the game is the very definition of “easy to learn, hard to master” and “trial and error”. So it requires a certain degree skill to fully enjoy but in my opinion it is extremely satisfying to see yourself getting better and beating that one hard track you've been stuck for so long.The game is not without it's problems: Uplay is mandatory and still a piece of sh*t that nobody wants, micro-transactions (luckily only for cosmetics), DLCs are pretty expensive for the amount of content they offer (best get them on sale), multiplayer is dead due to being added really late paired with PC having lowest audience for Trials games and also a controller is required because keyboard controls are next to useless.Many Trials veterans say that Evolution is better and more worth playing over Fusion for various reasons and they're probably right but I wouldn't know since I never got into Evolution when it came out on PC. The futuristic setting, electronic music and the ambiguous hidden story of Fusion was more interesting to me than bland old warehouses in a desert valley accompanied by rock music...But I'm in the minority who cares about that stuff so this review is simply from a Trials noob who enjoy the game for what it is despite it's faults :)"

The game doesn't run properly, it doesn't matter how good your PC is, it's port to the PC is the wost I've ever seen. It's practically unplayable. Trials is all about reaction and skill, imagine how hard it is when the game is constantly dropping to 15-20 fps and going slow motion below 60. The famerate is all over the place at all times for every track. So basically, have fun trying to control your rider as the game is frequently changing speed and frame rate. Even with their updates, lowering your graphics, lowering your resolution, turning off v-sync, turning on frame skipping, setting Trails Fusion to high priority and PC settings to performance, you will only marginally improve it. This game should be removed from Steam for quality control, they sold you a completely broken game that they don't even try to fix, or make good on.

Expierienced Trials veteran will find the game very easy to beat up til the Hard/Extreme tracks, skill games are now have to be unlocked and not accessible from own section, less skill games then previous games(probaly will be added via DLC). No launch SLI/Xfire support that causes performance issues.Bleh! Uses UPLAY,some game sections take forever to load, can be very frustrating to some people that could cause rage quits. Seems to be less tracks then previous games but I could be wrongLowdown: If you have a few friends to play with you will have a blast competing against each other's times, which is where all the appeal is. The game also can be quite rewarding as nothing is as awesome as beating a section of the track that you had been stuck on for 100 faults.4/5"

Most tracks are futuristic.Trials Fusion, unless your pro, this is only really a game to play with friends, it can get really frustrating so best to look at tutorial videos of the basic to advanced controls and tips before attempting to purchase this game for yourself."

The game can get pretty difficult and the map makers can turn the game into something entirely different. The games require uPlay as a second DRM, but if you just want one DRM, you can buy it from uPlay directly (and might save money doing so, as Ubisoft wants their uPlay service to grow bigger.) You'd like this game if you are into racing and competiting, though you might still love it if you hate typical racing games.For a comparison to Trials Evolution, the last Trials game:Pros:- Track editor is miles ahead of the older editor, meaning cooler content if you don't like to edit your own tracks.- You can do cool stuns in midair, used in a nice points-based ""race.""- Can customize your biker and your vehicle, including the new ATV.- Challenges to complete on every map with very unique challenges on certain maps.- Hidden secrets on some maps.- SQUIRRELS!Cons:- What is optimization?

,Not Recommended,245490,9934669,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Peanits,"It's basically Trials Evolution with different models.Just a few criticisms: The new FMX tricks are very clunky. It's difficult to trigger the one you want, some of them make your bike flip wildly when starting or ending the trick, and sometimes your rider just sits there doing nothing when you're trying to activate a trick. As for the level design, there's a lot of little things that ruin it. Later on, there's a bunch of jumps where you have to hit it just right or you'll fail. On paper, it sounds like that's just difficulty, but the bike control can sometimes be frustratingly bad. One of the worst things about the controls is that the bikes are rear wheel drive. If your bike comes an inch off the ground, you won't be able to make the jump. And if you want to get a gold on every level, you'll have to completely restart, because the timing is tight.And then there's the small things. Customization is so lacking that it might as well not be there. You can (supposedly) buy new bodykits and wheels for your bikes and paint them. So there's a whopping two options. The thing it doesn't mention is that half of the bikes either don't have additional bodykits or can't be painted. Rider customization is slightly better, but that's just because you can consistantly paint the different outfit pieces.I've also noticed some bugs, and many, many crashes. For instance, when you restart a level too quickly after finishing it, the level completed popup appears, and won't go away until you reset again. There's plenty of crashes in the editor, which makes it almost unusable until you've learned just which features crash the game.AND THEN THERE'S UPLAY.Uplay is one of the worst things about any Ubisoft game these days, and is the single reason I will not buy another Ubisoft game until they drop Uplay. First of all, changing your name from the automatically generated ""guest-XXXXXXXXXXX"" is a pain, and you won't get the one you want. And then you get to deal with the wonderful servers. The best way I can describe it: Do you remember a time when ""DLC"" was crazy, because there was no way you could download 10MB in a sensible time? Well, Uplay simulates that by taking 10 minutes to download a 10MB update. And then I got to wait another 10 minutes to sync my saves, and then another 10 minutes after playing the game for my saves to sync. I'd like to say I'm exaggerating, but I can honestly say that I'm not.But hey, it's all worth it, because it's totally preventing piracy (assuming you ignore the fact that it was cracked within a day). The thing that always gets me is that I'm sitting here waiting for the game to launch, and someone who just decided to pirate the game is already in the game, for free. It's a noble cause, but it's only hurting the people who are actually paying for it. They're just punishing legitimate players at this point.Basically, it slowly turns into trial and error. I guess I was just expecting more speed and flips rather than precision jumps with clunky mechanics. So if you liked Trials Evolution, you'll like this. If you like putting up with terrible DRM that makes you wait half an hour before you can play the game you payed for, you'll also like this. But with that said, it's $20. You're paying for a budget game, and it definitely does that title justice.Recommendation: Buy it during a sale, and don't expect to play it until after the sale, because Uplay will be slow as hell because of all the traffic."

The game is published by Ubisoft, i do not know why you would think they wouldnt put it on their own PC distribution service and account control service.Yes Uplay is sometimes broken, but those times are not THAT often, it happens  here and there, and Ubisoft doesnt seem to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ But really, i dont want to review the Publisher or the Developers, which both chose to run this game on the platform.The Game Itself:- a very skillbased ""racing"" game, where the point is more or less to drive through a track with no mistakes, only after that the time really matters- has alot of content (though the price with the DLC is pretty high, compared to a triple a title it matches though)-> User created content pushes the game forward to a pretty high replay value (which mostly explains my playtime)Most negative aspects about it:- lack of content of the original game (no dlcs) compared to evolution- no ways of communication directly through the game- the multiplayer is pretty lagged out (though it is much better than evolution)Overall, they needed too long for the game to be at this state (which is a pretty definitve version on how a trials game needs to feel like), it felt like a beta for about a year into it. The developers did not abandon the game though and continued to give (free) content for the players to enjoy. With this in mind, i can only say it is one of my most beloved games today, for its high skillcap and active community, which still produces some great quality tracks."

,Recommended,245490,9931811,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,DaJuan Energy McDaniel,"Trials Fusion is an excellent entry to the series. Here's why:RedLynx tried something different this time around, and it works quite well. The trick system is an excellent feature put into the game. It promotes replayability of tracks by having the user see how ""flashy"" of a run they can nail and show off to their friends. It's based off of the famous RedLynx physics engine, making it intuitive, nice to look at, and at some points, silly to observe what may happen during a crash.But beyond the trick system, there's even more in terms of the traditional trials game. There's the usual spike in difficulty, where the last few groups of levels WILL test your patience, skill, and sanity. The levels themselves still keep their usual charm; being put in wacky/amazing environments, seeing things interact around you, it's all here. The environments all look great and there's enough variety to keep you happy.Now there are trick runs, where you have to see how many points you can get on a special track designated for this new system. I like this, because sometimes you want to do tricks on the normal tracks, but you know it may hurt your time. It seems they're trying to cater to those who like to have a little fun in between the serious time trials, and I respect their approach to it. It works for them.Skill games are back, and they're as fun and silly as ever. I don't agree how they made them a requirement this time around, but it's not the biggest issue in the worldEach of the bikes actually has a specific purpose and will be used depending on which track you're participating in. This is WONDERFUL. I remember in evolution you would use one or two bikes, because the only things the new ones did was have more power. I REALLY appreciate RedLynx making each bike unique and useable.There's some really nice biker customization as well. Lots of cool, future-y outfits to choose from.I'm really excited excited to see where the DLC takes this game. Although the game had a less-than-stellar launch, I'm still very happy with this product, and cannot wait to play through more trials. It feels like a trials game through-and-through to me, and that's what matters. It's a quality product that will only get better with more tweaking and additional content. I believe this is completely worth your money if you are a fan of the series."

It took ubisoft around a month to finally listen to the community and release the multiplayer.In evlolution the custom maps were a blast making the game last forever, but in this one any DLC prop/part in a cusotme track requires you to have that DLC. So basically you need the season pass to play very many custom tracks. After paying for DLC which should never be in any game ever becuse paying for the rest of the game after you already bought it is bullsh*t. Ubisoft decided to release more DLC that ISN'T COVERED BY THE SEASON PASS. That is infuriating especially when they put in, in game transactions. After paying 20 for the game and 20 for the season pass which is reciculous becausericiculous because it is the same price as the game, and 10 for the other DLC that isn't included in the SEASON PASS. Now they want you to pay real money for fake money in the game that should be earned.

Most people would assume that it's some racing game about motorcycles but this is not at all the case. It's a physics-based puzzle trial system based on balance and speed control through some really tricky tracks. The whole dirtbike thing is kind of incidental as it's just a vehicle that works for the system. As you progress, these tracks get more and more tricky requiring ever increasing amounts of control. Great game all around but was not expecting Fusion to be as robust a game is it is. Amazing graphics and sound which is a gigantic leap over the original, and it has a soundtrack so good that you can't but to pump it up and groove to it. Really well optimized and a totally pure ""video game""."

You will also rage but it isn’t like most games because of the game mechanics it’s because of your ability, but this makes you strive for a better time and keeps you coming back to Trials Fusion.All impressive maps design, graphics Easter Eggs (Squirrels) bikes and customization and also challenges have been done brilliantly. Also after you have completed the campaign to your ability you can get stuck into user created tracks which further makes the game playable.The new addition to Trials Fusion which include the new FMX trick system is great too!Only a few minor downsides for me.. The voice/screaming of character gets quite annoying after a while although you can turn it off and the extreme track Inferno IV. That damn map!And obviously the biggest downside is Uplay!One recommendation which i would give is that you should use a controller as it is easier to control your bike.In summary this is a great game which you can easily rage but get addicted to.

The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. Once I had all of them cleared, I saw on Facebook that Trials Fusion was in the works, and excitedly waited for it's release. After pre-ordering this game, and launching it the first time, I was immediately disappointed. The soundtrack is terrible (maybe not a big deal for you), loading took forever, and the bikes/rider/maps/tracks/menus all look really thrown together without much thought. My opinion, of course, but if you're going to get a Trials game, get Trials Evolution: Gold Edition. That game is the SH**."

There's a solid mix of server problems (uPlay AND another Ubisoft connection, both of which can, and for me did, fail often) which immediately reset your saved progress (it's always-online), graphics problems, and start up problems; all persistent across both computers. More irritating, the demo worked fine after a bit of work, and the full game did not: the demo uses uPlay but seems to save itself a lot of trouble by not attaching your progress to your account.I love the hell out of trials.

76561198046311355,Recommended,245490,29348224,Posted: 18 January,all,Khronikos,"Trials Fusion has quietly become something of a minor masterpiece. With the normal content plus season pass and MAX DLC there are a pile of things to do in the game, and it should keep any player busy for at least a solid 40 hours. We haven't even touched the 20k plus community tracks. From the active online through to campaign and whatever else you need, there really isn't any way you could go wrong with the MAX edition, which includes all the DLC plus the new MAX stuff for 40 bucks. This will obviously drop in price on certain sales. I honestly have very few complaints at this point in time. So let's discuss a few things:A lot of the cranky reviews cite either Uplay or the newest DLC, released long after a the yearly season pass, as problems that make them feel angry and mad. Neither of these issues is even the slightest bit of a problem anymore. If Uplay is not running correctly for you in 2015 it's your own fault. I have absolutely zero problems with it and haven't had any major problems with it for well over a year. It's a solid service, if unneeded, and really it doesn't belong in reviews for this game anymore.The season pass has expired. It was never meant to be a free DLC for life kind of thing. Only an idiot would keep thinking that a season pass somehow connotates free DLC for life. The new content is suitably priced anyway. Taken as a whole there are literally no problems with this game. At its release I could definitely agree it was a little lighter on content and the price was too expensive for not having a functional multiplayer; as well it was buggy and unfinished. But that simply is not the case anymore. Everything you would ever need is now included in the game, but polished to a high degree.The unlocks are decent and the various bike upgrades and ability to change colors and wheels among other things is a nice feature to keep you busy. There are a decent amount of extras for those interested that kind of stuff. You can use acorns, the new currency, to buy special additions like new body styles, outfits, and faces. You also unlock a decent amount of stuff just from normal playtime with the original currency. Acorns currency can now be purchased for cash if choose to do so. Leveling up in game seems to grant a decent amount of acorns as well.The meat of the game I am very happy to say is very solid. Graphics have been given a large boost and it shows throughout the incredibly varied environments. With the season pass you have access to a multitude of different locales and each has its own vibe that is fairly unique. As far as comparing this to Evolution Gold well this one is a lot different. Fusion is more extreme, with the themes of the environments and tracks taking on a totally appreciated craziness that really never lets you down. Both games are worth owning.Evolution is more grounded, where as this one just goes for glory and throws in some very imaginitive and well-constructed tracks that take you from the fiery pits of hell to the most futuristic skyscrapers of an advanced civilization. And everything in between. There is no game that does racing quite like the Trials series, and the devs have seriously stepped up their game.There are the usual medals to earn, but there is also three achievements on each stage that can find you hunting down squirrels or activating secret switches for special achievements. These will keep a lot of people busy that have gotten their golds the first couple times through.Besides getting gold medals, the idea is that you may want to try and compete on the leaderboards. Cracking a top 5K time will definitely give you the challenge you need and should entertain the skill levels of all players. Add in some wonderful multplayer action and dozens of hours will pass before you get tired of this one.I run this in 4K with a single 970 on the highest settings and it mostly holds a stable 60FPS. A few drops here and there on certain courses. It's a beauty of a game for sure. It might have some nitpicks here and there, but for the most part no Trials game has ever looked even close to this lovely.All in all this is now a great game. Support for Fusion continues and multiplayer is still very active. So get on it. It's worth every penny."

Really, really pretty.- Still the same great Trials physics, bike handling feels almost exactly like the previous onesCons:- UPLAY-- This piece of garbage. BigPicture & COntroller -> Start any UPlay game -> Wait for Uplay updates & start looking for the mouse to click ""Start"". The day UPlay dies will be a happy one. Make a suicide pact with Origin please, why don't you.- Visuals over functionality-- Camera too often shows the scenery instead of the track you are about to land on-- Performance was never great with the Trials games, but because of the grat graphics and their camera work, Fusion performs HORRIBLE at times - which really sucks in a skill based ""pixel perfect"" thing, when you fail because of lag/hitches- ""Trick Mode"" is just bad. Right stick to perform stunts w/ the bike while in the air. Sounds nice, controlls horrbily. HORRIBLY.-- These levels are mandatory and mixed in with the normal Trials stuff and that sucks, because it just does not work wellI like trials more than I'd normaly publicly admit to, but this.. Yes, Trials should feel frustrating.But not because some Designer went ""Hey stop showing so much of the track, show the background, we spent a lot of money making this!"".They essentially broke their game with that attitude, about 50% of all levels I have played have had this.

This means that a) you need a superb gaming system (forget about the minimum requirements) and b) all comparisons to other players or friends are complete bs. This is a reaction-based game, yet anyone can just crank up the graphics and play in slow motion, taking twice as long to position the rider.

Me and my friends all bought this expecting to race eachother and have a laugh like we used to.Please add online multiplayer and fix this optimization issue my friends and A LOT of other people are having. Seeing as we had to wait longer for it to come out on PC I was expecting much better for a £15.99 title. Wouldn't even pay a tenna for this how it stands as of now.Don't get me wrong, it looks lovely and level design is outstanding. Recommend if your looking for a single player experiance, running on a good PC and have no attatchment to previous Trials titles. But not many of us are those people."

This game is way easier than the last and you never feel like you have to hold out on a level for a silver or gold because a)you always seem to have the medals to progress and b) you always seem to get silvers and golds anyway. Yes there is a connection between these two things but it just means that the game is not challenging enough. It wasn't until the ""hard"" levels that I really even felt like I had to do much at all with the controls.Sure, they give you ATVs and tricks but it doesn't mean much in the end. The ATV doesn't amke much of a difference gameplay-wise and the tricks are clumsily implementented.For players who haven't played Trials, go play Evolution Gold Edition or maybe the previous games (I don't know, only played Evolution).

If you have never played a trials game before then you won't understand why i think this one is a failure so go ahead and play it.)As a standalone game this would be amazing. I'm a big fan of the Trials series (go to hell Uplay and Ubisoft with it). However this one just doesn't stand up to the previus installments.It's clear ubisoft was trying to appeal to the ""new generation"" with all the techno bits and futuristic looking backdrops, which I guess is standard for Ubisoft nowadays isn't it?I really like the solid color art style in other games like portal or Mirror's Edge, but it feels kind of out of place her. That's nto to say it's completely out of place as it still works. but as a long time player I miss the gritty and harsh art style of old. Just my preference though.*Important* If you were hoping to find those unforgetably cool tracks like the one's from Evolution and HD then you will be disappointed. The tracks leave something to be desired and I breezed through all of them fairly easily. There's no Castle Crash or Gigatrack or Archipeligo. I rememebr most if nto all the tracks from Trials HD and Evolution by simply hearing the name but i couldn't even tell you the names of th first few tracks in Fusion. This is rather big for me as I really wanted the memory hook that previous tracks had given me.They give each difficulty a general ""Theme"" for example the second area you unlock is supposed to be in the city but I couldn't be less enthusiastic about the environments. They just seem copy and pasted together and I turned off the audio because I didn't find ""Cindy"" or that pother guy i couldn't bother to remember the name of.If this sounds like I'm calling Ubiusoft out on being the dirtbags they so desperately desire to be then you may be on to something there. But I still LIKE the game I'm just not in love with it like i was the previous ones, and if a sequal can't superceed it's predocessors then it's a failure as a sequel.But I am sure we will see more of Trials as Ubisoft has made it clear that there are no such things as standalone games anymore.Go to hell Ubisoft and takle your piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥excuse for a ""Client"" with youAlso i would be nice if steam had a spell check, I knwo that's lazy but I'm legally blind so proof reading is too much of a hassle"

However, I cannot recommend buying this if you are looking for a good Trials game.It is buggy, some levels are unbearably laggy (bad optimization) and the ""skill games"" from the previous Trials game are baaaack! And even more annoying than ever! If you want to play with keyboard, don't bother trying to do anything with those games. Ubisoft themselves wrote that they were designed for pad. But, these games are so lame that I can't be bothered configuring my pad.The levels (when they aren't laggy) are bland. There is no challenge. I play this game when I want to wind down... It's good for that. But if you are looking for a Trials challenge, you won't find it here.Also, you need to pay much more to get the other half of this game (DLC) and there is no multiplayer."

Here, try this super wheelie on the ramp 10 feet in front of you.The game looked so fun from the videos I've seen and so much promise from user-created tracks.

Red Lynx I discovered through Xbox 360 in the early 2000s back when it was just the stages of making their console titles for Trails, Trails is by far one of the best Bike racing games with its Creator program and vast community store of maps to download and play their is certainly no shortage of bike tracks you can check out and explore and also make your. While i never could figure out cause i mostly stuck with the HALO Genre, Red Lynx program basically you build sides and that took me to the point where i gave up on it and couldn't figure out how to make a straight path on a sideway screen but thats for players who have played Titles of Red Lynx.Now Red Lynx is coming out with more titles of Trail and DLC and the phone version such as Trials Frontier which is a fun game and have played many, many many times till the point where my phone is like "" HEY MAN PLAY SOMETHING ELSE!"" other than Red Lynx Keep up the good work in making more Trail Games."

I'm not going to complain about Uplay or say that the game isn't optimised correctly, because it plays wonderfully on my system at 60 FPS, ultra settings. There's really not much to Trials Fusion other than balancing your bike over different types of bumps, landing your bike correctly, and occasionally flying through the air to the next part of the track. Now don't get me wrong, there are neat tricks, solid physics, and a great presentation along with beautiful graphics. But even on sale like I got it, I'd say the $15-20 isn't worth it. Maybe at $5. If you want an awesome physics-based game where you do more than just grind through levels by shifting your weight on a bike to get over giant hills, etc., then I'd recommend you go play Happy Wheels. It's free, you can play it on flash, there is a far greater variety in vehicles/stages, and it's just more entertaining. I really love Ubisoft, but I have to say pass on this one."

You gain medals and coin that go to getting you new cosmetic items for your bike and rider, and well as unlocking further tracks for you to play. In Fusion, you now no longer have to just do trials tracks, but also FMX, where you can combo tricks on your bike, building up score in the attempt to get a higher medal.I have this game for both the Xbox 360 and Steam, and have already put quite a few hours into it. I am most definitely content with the game, and the future it holds. It runs smoothely (In windowed, I get some frame drops), without any issues when I have other programs up, and even though it has Uplay, I don't get any of the issues I have with Assassins Creed Black Flag.I definitely recommend this game, and enjoy it far more than I did with the previous installments. 9/10"

Hopefully this will be implemented soon as i am really looking forward to it and have been for a while now."

I fell in love with this series years ago on console, and for the most part this installment hasn't dissappointed me yet.  It's addictive. It's frustrating, but the feeling of satisfaction when you finally gold medal makes it worth the anger. The new FMX mode and 4-wheel drive vehicles add some slight variation to the old formula. The Community Track Creation has huge potential and some pretty good tracks have already been created, but sometimes the direction changes are clunky and completely throw off the feel of the tracks.If your framerate drops below 60 the game goes into slow motion mode, which can get really annoying, but with a decent pc and nothing running in the background that won't usually be a problem. Every other review has taken care of complaining about Uplay for me so I won't bother.  No Online MP, Local only (Something tells me we can expect to have to buy a ""Online Multiplayer DLC Pack"" in the near future).  ""Season Pass"" seems awful pricey (it costs as much as the base game) so the devs better be planning some massive DLC packs to justify that price, otherwise I'm passing on that for now.   The Commentator Audio gets VERY repetitive if you get stuck on a track.Overall, It's enjoyable with a few small flaws that can be easily looked past. If you liked any previous Trials games, or if it's on sale, you should definately buy it."

I ended up choosing no for some very key things in the game that just made it painful to play. But first the pros.>Good theme, like, they couldn't have done it better. The blend between nature and technology was blended perfectly and it does feel like it is part of a bigger universe.>Nice controls (more on that).>Frankly great graphics (again, more on that later).>Good menus.And now the cons. In the cons I will not be discussing Uplay. The DRM does cost you a few minutes in the beginning and (for other games) can be a huge pain. However, in this game, all you need to do is log in once when you first boot it up and it doesn't really bug you much after that.So, cons>For someone with a lower-end machine, this game will kill you. As I said, great graphics, but what it did to me was reduce the framerate down to almost nothing and made the game almost unplayable due to button lag. My pc isn't terrible, either. It can play almost all games above 60fps and only goes this low for games like Next Car Game (which is an excellent game), and even for that it still gets 15-20fps.>Multiplayer is a pain, unlike the previous ones where it was a huge part of the experience.>Lack of content, which other people have commented on.>""Season pass,"" which is required to add what content the game should have had in the begining. Plus DLC, which I am generally against unless it's something like the gods and kings expansion pack. Basically, its just Ubisoft being Ubisoft.And thats pretty much it. If you are someone who has seen trials videos and wants to get in on it, pick Trials Evolution Gold Edition. It is better in most ways and equal when it isn't. If you have been a fan of the trials series ever since it started, go on right ahead. The main con for me is circumstantial, so if you are really dedicated you can have fun with the game despite the other flaws.Edit: Forgot about the ""More on controls."" Basically the only thing that I was going to say on that was that the game implemented a trick system that really doesn't contribute to the game at all. A few challenges may use it but most of the time it just gets in the way, especially during the tutorial levels."

For someone on a shared internet this is crushing. Also it seems that the online matchmaking ISN'T THERE. I queued for 12 hours straight and it didn't find me a match. If these issues are fixed and the game given dedicated servers to handle the multiplayer (and if they fix uplay to let you play the game in the first place during AAA releases) this game would be fantastic. As it is the singleplayer is good but the multiplayer is LACKING a big selling point of the game and a big part of the reason I bought it. I would recommend trials EVOLOUTION as being better."

I've seen some complaints that the game is light on single-player content, and while it does seem pretty lean, you have to remember that Trials Evolution Gold Edition is actually a combination of two games in one, so it should have substantial more content.  Then you have the DLC, which I have yet to play or purchase, and it is disappointing that the content wasn't included in the main game.  I'm sure I'll buy the DLC eventually but I'll wait for it to go on sale.The gameplay is much the same as its predecessors, but the UI and game progression feels more modernized with the level-up system and the addition of level challenges in the single player career mode.  Of course there's the addition of trick courses added to the arsenal, which are kind of fun but still not as much as the main game.The environments and feel of the levels are a big change from Evolution, as Fusion sticks with a more futuristic setting.  It's a little more unnatural, but I appreciate them mixing things up, and I have to say that the environments have a ton of detail and are really pleasing to the eye.  The addition of Portal-esque humor between two robot AI characters kind of falls flat, but I still really appreciate the constant slapstick of your character rag-dolling at an end-of-level hazard.Uplay is still there, but it's a non-issue.  It's never crashed my game, and I haven't had performance issues.  I also can't speak to the user-content or multiplayer as I've yet to touch it.  The core of the game remains intact, though, and there remains little more in all of gaming as satisfying as passing a seemingly impossible level in the Trials series."

That's about the only time you can blame the game for the frustration it induces. One level in particular is the most searched variant of Trials Fusion, Trials Fusion Big Air.

If I wrote this review the day I got it and didn't purchase the season pass along with it I might have recommended it because back then it was good for the price. Instead you pay 20$+20$ for a game that seems to run more and more crappily everytime they update it, the dlc isn't exactly mind blowing for the price and it's been almost a year without the promised multiplayer. Originally, back when I first purchased it I could run it on ultra (my system is better than their recommended), but now I have massive stuttering and frame loss especially on the newer dlc levels. At this point I've only gotten 3 of the 6 promised DLCs and I am ready to uninstall it and pretend I never got it in the first place. Might even harass steam to give me back my money for this garbage.TLDR; You want to play trials? Go get Trials Evolution. In fact; go get a used 360 (if you don't own one) and get it on that instead because it doesn't have uplay stuffed up it's♥♥♥♥♥"

First, if you don't play for a while and want to start fresh, you can't. It's impossible to delete your Track Central data and start from a completely blank slate. Second, your times and ghosts aren't locally saved, so in order to beat your own times on the tracks, you have to have a cloud save, which cannot be completely erased. Third, you have install Uplay, a piece of software which basically duplicates Steam, in order to play."

Now while the game runs smoothly, without any ""slow motion"" or fps drops that others have mentioned my main issue comes with the advertising of this game on Steam.Upon purchasing the game, Steam reads:Single PlayerMultiplayerHowever, this is not the case. Trials Fusion only supports Local Multiplayer and from what I can find out on the web, they are only planning to add Multiplayer in the coming months which to me is false advertising. Whether this is on Steams part or Ubisoft I don't know but it should be made completely clear.I've now wasted my money on a game I don't intend on playing at all as I bought it solely to play with friends. I'll be seeking a refund for the title as this is just plain wrong.Also for anyone else reading, the game requires you to launch through uPlay, the more time consuming and irritating game launcher there currently is.

This was my first experience with Trials series (I did play Evo after this game to compare) and between the two, they are fairly equal. This game offers better graphics than Evo and the challenges are fun to complete as well. I went ahead and purchased the season pass as well (for $16 for the game plus all dlc, can't complain). This is not an easy game by any means, and to be honest, this game (as straight forward as it is) SHOULD be a boring game. However, it's not even close! I can spend 30 minutes perfecting a 40 second track, trying to complete the challenges, restarting the level 100 times, blah blah blah, AND still love doing it. It is exciting, fast paced and gives you a good laugh. You will get frustrated from time to time, but I can't think of a game where I haven't been. I have been having some issues connecting to multiplayer, so for that reason I would score this a 9.5/10. If Evo goes on sale ever as well, I will be purchasing that one too. If you are new to the series, then I recommend 100%. If you are a seasoned player, I suggest reading other players reviews and deciding off of their reviews as I have not had enough time yet to get into the heart of the game."

That is if your lucky and it didn't time out again. in this case you ahve to retry submitting your score if you managed to get a better time.Multiplayer is local only, which means forget about all the fun you had with evolution playing supercross tracks, it doesn't exists in this game.Regardless of all the uplay crap the PC version is still a mess.

The gameplay was as I remember, i.e., incredibly addicting and rewarding. If you were to compare stills of this game to the previous games, you could tell it looks incredibly better. But after I got past the introductory phase, I started realising how annoying logging into Uplay was. I also ran into frame rate problems. I'm not implying that I'm running a powerful system (my graphics card being a Radeon HD 7870), but compared to the smooth 60 fps I can maintain on medium settings in Metro: Last Light and Bioshock Infinity, I found the 40 fps and often 20 fps on low settings to be COMPLETELY absurd. I'm quite offended that the developers put less care to the PC version but I suppose it's my fault for assuming otherwise from Ubisoft. Although I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, I cannot recommend it to anyone without a more powerful system. The low fps is more than nauseating as usual but actually disruptive in the gameplay.

I figured I'd be playing it a lot over the summer and as a general timewaster, so I bought the Season Pass with it, for a total of $30.Honestly, I feel like I've wasted my money buying this game.Having never played any other Trials games, I have nothing to compare the gameplay of Fusion against. I do know that it has no online multiplayer, which is a major disappointment. Looking through other reviews, I can see that the game is apparently lacking in other places (lack of tracks, buggy trick system, etc.), but again, I have nothing to compare it against, so I can't verify these claims. In my 2 hours of playing, the core gameplay has been solid. However, it's been mostly unenjoyable, which brings me to my first major quip with this game:1. The game is horribly optimizedI started up my game to my rider rising up an elevator in the first tutorial level. It was going pretty slowly, maybe for dramatic effect. And then the slowness carried on through the level. and the next one after that. What was the problem behind this?It turns out Trials Fusion is hellbent on running at 60 FPS. If you can't run it at 60 FPS, the game merely slows itself down until every in-game second has 60 frames.The result? If you run it at 40 FPS, every 3 real-life seconds becomes 2 seconds in-game. 30 FPS? Your game runs at half-speed. 20 FPS? A minute-long tracks now takes 3 minutes to complete.Have you ever put an old game in your floppy disc drive of your computer and it runs at lightning speed because the game speed was tied to processor speed? Trials Fusion goes 15 years into the past to bring back this experience.And don't you worry, they thought of that one supercomputer that can run the game at 90 FPS, so the game caps at 60 FPS so it doesn't run away.All in all, after crippling the resolution, video settings, and everything else, the game ran at an average of 45 FPS for me, where it started off at 15. My GPU may not be the greatest in the world (AMD Radeon HD 7640G), but it gets the job done for every other game I've played at decently high settings. Trials Fusion at its lowest possible settingsstillbrings my GPU to its knees.2. uPlay is a piece of crap and attempted to eat my computerA little backstory here. I bought Burnout Paradise during the 2013 Summer Sale. Upon launching, EA promted me to make on Origin account, which I did. They didn't bug me any further, and from then on, Burnout launched through Steam and my Origin log-in was confirmed after launching.So why is it that Trials Fusion requires you to install uPlay, and that launching Trials from Steamonly launches uPlay?If I only had to make a uPlay account to play (like with Burnout!), it would be fine. But why do I need asecondgame-launcher just to accomplish the task of launching my game, Ubisoft? So launching Trials Fusion is clumsy and weird because it requires installing uPlay, which seems bad enough. For me, however, it was the start of my problems.A couple of days after installing TF, Flash videos stopped working, which required me to disable hardware acceleration to fix. Whatever, Flash is buggy anyway. And then weird black bars appeared near the top of the window when I was watching a Twitch stream. OK, maybe something is wrong here, so I'll run an antivirus scan. My computer crashed mid-scan, and then I got my first blue screen the next day. The day after that the most ominous thing of all happened. I was watching a video when it flipped to another screen that said, ""You can activate your operating system under the Settings tab."" I went back to the video, and minimized my screen to reveal that I could now see my OS and build in the lower-right hand corner of my desktop. At that point, I went to System Restore and got uPlay the hell out of my computer. It's been about a month since the restore, and to date, nothing nearly as spooky as the aforementioned things has happened again.SUMMARY/TL;DR:You may notice next to the thumbs-down that I have 2 hours logged playing this game. This is due to a combination of the problems mentioned above. In my short time playing Trials Fusion, the gameplay wasn't that good for me, because it didn't run at full-speed. I can imagine it would be a great game if the damn thing would run correctly and stop being so picky. Ubisoft has done a decent job patching their errors, adding things like ""better"" optimization and custom Supercross tracks. Until they fix the bigger things though, I can't say anything good about this game. In conclusion...-Only get this game if you're absolutely confident in your computer's specs, ESPECIALLY GPU-Don't expect online play anytime soon (because the poor slow-motion guy would be left behind...)-uPlay is a piece of crap-If your computer fights back after installing uPlay, you should listen to it-#4spooky-I like donuts :3"

It was a pleasant upgrade in graphics and gameplay and I am quite in love with this game. It has a range of levels across many beautiful vistas. I enjoy the skill games that throw some extra spice into the regular levels. The difficulty of those levels scales nicely from pretty easy (even for someone who is not particularly familiar with this style of game) all the way up to the excruciatingly difficult and playing with mates is better than it ever was. Hitting those jumps perfectly can be amazingly satisfying.A+, I love this game, buy it now.Pros:1.	Hundreds of free tracks online2.	A range of difficulties to suit everybody3.

Nonetheless, the motorcycles do not feel very futuristic.+infuriating difficulty+different behavior of the motorcycles match different level layouts+deep control system with emphasis on leaning the right way and breaking or accelerating at the right time; much deeper than those browser games+local multiplayer, sadly way more simplistic and uninspired than the single player levels-uplay-sometimes it is not very clear whenever a jump is a success or not because jumping often needs a special sequence of leaning inputs in a short ammount of time-stunt/trick system controls a bit wobbly as sometimes inputs are not accepted because of fast spinning (does that count as realism?)-game gets harder with your controller having a big deadzone. I cannot recommend Logitech devices-annoying menu design as it takes away from the futuristic theme and tries to sell you DLC all the time-game throws you out of a level if you need to many retries, erasing your checkpoint progressAll in all i can recommend this game despite it being an Ubisoft game. It is really fun after you finally are ingame and out of the disgusting and irritating menu screen.Keep in mind that this is the darksouls of motorcycle games so prepare to die."
