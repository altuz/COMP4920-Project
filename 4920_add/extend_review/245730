This game isn't even worth the effort of shovelling it on my lawn and I'm fairly certain if I did it would kill it. This game isn't necissarily bad if you've never played ""Flashback: The Quest for Identity"" but if you're seeking the nostalgia of your childhood, this game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off very quickly.The only thing this game has in common with the original is that the levels are very slightly similar and the main character's name is Conrad. The end. The game felt very ""dumbed down"". There are popups on the hud EVERYWHERE that say, ""Go here. You can climb this. Talk to him. There's only one path you can take but we're going to tell you to take it anyway!"" Luckily, those can be turned off. I decided to play the game on medium and found out immediately that the difficulty settings were made for console♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's a health bar, light falling damage, enemies attempt to tickle you to death, and healing stations are closer together than Starbucks. They also tried to add an RPG aspect by allowing you to gain experience, level up, and spend points in different skills. In a few ways this is good but mostly makes me ask, ""Why the hell would anyone add RPG aspects to a Prince of Persia like?""The controls feel similar to the original but they added an extra jump button and an arc style aiming system. The controls were definitely made for dual thumbstick controllers and then (horribly) modified for pc. Aiming is done by moving the mouse up and down to adjust angle and then moving the mouse left and right to switch sides. This gets annoying when you're trying to adjust your angle and accidently move your mouse too far to one side, causing Conrad to turn around and take it in the butt. If you have a controller to use with the game then it might not be that bad but mouse and keyboard controls get frustrating.Bug time! This game contains bugs. There were a few times while aiming that the mouse would become locked in one place and I had to right click furiously to get control back. There are also times when grabing onto a platform would cause Conrad to get stuck and stand in mid air next to the platform. I only encountered this a few times and it did not deter me from the game but then again it never happened during a part where it actually mattered.Playing this game does bring back warm nostalgic memories in the sense that I want to go dig out my old SNES and play the original game. Overall I feel like someone who played through the original once when it released is attempting to remake the game on age old memories. The only consolation I have is that I purchased this game during a Steam sale and didnt pay full price."

It was a huge mistake. There is pretty much nothing redeeming about the product.Let me break it down for you: the area design is bizarre and exploring is both frustrating and tedious. The combat is imprecise and the enemies (on Normal difficulty) rapidly become bullet sponges. The platforming is even worse. The jumping animation is downright laughable and is hard to predict. I ended up skipping the cutscenes due to the painfulness of of the story, writing and voice acting.Some of the level art is nice, but it isn't worth suffering through the rest to see it.I regret purchasing the game and I wish I had listened to the recommendation to avoid it. The demo doesn't really reveal many of the issues of the game so considered yourself warned."
,Recommended,245730,7358058,"Posted: 11 October, 2013",all,Chocolate Pudding,"From the publishing house responsible for publishing games that you have bought based on novel to game adaptations of a certain new york times best selling author, comes a remake of a game you probably haven't played before, because you're all like twelve, and don't know what's good.  Flashback is a remake of a much better game by french publisher 'Delphine' and it was a god damn masterpiece.  This game is still very much french, but obviously tries to capitalize on the call of duty dollars by having the character shoot all of the mans instead of solving all of the puzzles or discovering all of the mysteries.  the game is designed pretty close to the original actually, besides different item placement and much more numerous enemies to shoot with your dutycaller9000.  The story is also very much intact, though this time done through full motion video cutscenes with voice actors.  The game is still pretty nice, and besides too much shooting early on, and about the same ammount of shooting later on, it is more or less faithful to the original.  If you disagree, the original is included with this game so it's like you get that too incase you don't like this one.  If you play this game, be sure to play on hard, as easy and normal dificulties are ♥♥♥♥ing garbage.  I hope that ubisoft has plans to develop and re-release a remake of the sequel 'Fade to Black' so I can complain about that too."
,Not Recommended,245730,9200848,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,Cabadiah,"As a fan of the original game on the SNES (or Genesis, depending on your choice of console back then), I'm honestly pretty disappointed in this remake. The character's controls are completely different from the original game, which were slower and more deliberate and catered more towards platforming and careful combat, and yet the environments and enemy design did not change in order to reflect the change in controls. I found myself constantly running myself off ledges due to not being able to control my character's run speed, but I was also able to float around in mid-air and catch ledges in impossible and goofy-looking ways, so there was never any danger of dying due to fall damage.Fall damage was instant death in the original game, encouraging you to think about how to move about environments, and every stage had every jump and platform in the perfect position, and everything was exactly where it was supposed to be. In this game, all the platforms seem entirely worthless, and there is usually more than one way to reach the goal by simply hopping around randomly between platforms, and there doesn't seem to be a very intelligent path you need to follow in order to complete areas.Enemy placement also seems entirely random, especially in the first stage where annoying flying robots would shock you at incredibly inconvenient points, sometimes even during an autosave, causing you to constantly reload from death while having a stupid drone poke you in the eye.The combat is also irritating and unbalanced. Enemies are almost always attacking you, and there are few options when it comes to running away or attacking. Enemies with guns will shoot you while you try to climb up a platform to safety, as well as the flying drones shocking you and never giving you a decent opportunity for escape. It seems to me that the developers didn't realize that the slow, deliberate controls in the original also required enemies to be limited as well in order for the combat to be made fair. Even though you are given less limited movement in this game, you are downright crippled in several common situations, which makes it incredibly easy for enemies to exploit you and kill you in very cheap ways.Another grating annoyance in this game for me is the main character's dialogue and voice-actor. He constantly monologues to himself in order to give gameplay hints and witty banter, which is entirely unnecessary and really ruins the atmosphere. The dialogue in the original was simple, straightforward, and reflected the atmosphere of the game as being tense and dangerous. Having your character constantly crack annoying jokes when doing anything from using a healing station to killing an enemy really ruins the atmosphere, and I simply don't understand why they thought it was necessary to write the character in such a way. Another annoyance was having constant gameplay hints and camera pans to show you objects and enemies in order to hold your hand through the game. Game design like this is simply insulting and certainly does not follow the original game's example of clever, intelligent environment and gameplay design that encourages the player to think and experiment with the environment in order to solve problems.Besides simple design choices that I didn't enjoy, the game has a lot of dissappointing physics and gameplay glitches that make the game feel really cheap. Several times I would watch as my character moonwalks several feet after being killed by an enemy before finally falling to the floor, sometimes even walking on air off of a platform, and one glitch even made me unable to sneak up on enemies and knock them out (something you are required to do in order to complete some sneaking missions), due to the button prompt not appearing consistently.Ironically, in my case, Uplay allows you to immediately unlock and play the original game without completing any achievements, which I would prefer, simply because this game is very flawed and simply does not live up to the design of the original. Speaking of Uplay, this program succeeds in making playing Ubisoft games through Steam entirely cumbersome and annoying, which gives me one more reason not to reccommend this game.If you want a better puzzle-based platformer in the vein of Prince of Persia or Blackthorne, just play the original game, or any other game in the same genre. This game simply fails to deliver such an experience, instead trying to offer a shallow action experience with many inappropriate or broken mechanics."

Difficulty is toned down; for example a simple elevator puzzle near the beginning; there were two triggers per floor; one to move the elevator to allow you to go up while forcing you to jump over the one between that and the elevator to set you back a little, did they really need to dumb that puzzle down? No they did not. Puzzles are dumbed down and the level design feels rushed.I like the gun aiming system (Use a mouse, not a joypad for that) but then the tasks that require you to do it do not require thought as the solution is shoved into your face thinking you are lacking a brain. Graphics are quite nice but the background could have used more work but then again, level design feels rushed but I do like how the new conrad looks.I'm going to be honest here; the game is flawed yet enjoyable, but I don't reccomend it because it's my review and I hate it when a reboot/remake dumbsdown simple puzzles and rushes level design to a mess that looks cramped as hell; leveling up is a stupid mistake seieng as the original game was intended for puzzle/survival than being combat-based; I stil lreccomendd it if you want a good platformer that feels new/original that doesn't involve mario or any indie developers at all but if you want a real challenge; go play the original.Update: The 1993 edition is god awful, it's not the original Flashback at all; just some rushed recreation of the dos game with no music/sound at all and awkwardly placed controls you can't map. To make the recreation worse; they have it look like you are playing it on an arcade machine powered on outside in the rain with an effect to make it look like an outdated arcade machine (Thank god the 1993 edition is free)."

Apart from the programing flaws, there are so many control issues, specially if you play with an Xbox 360 wireless controller and there are many crashes, if you load the checkpoint several times (playing hard so you die a lot), the game crash every 4 times you load the same checkpoint, and sometimes the game just crash.There is the original flashback game that can be unlocked, but you play in a tiny screen, plus there are sound issues. An SNES emulator will do a better job.Good part is that playing and ending the game in Hard is really a challenge and can be a fun, graphics are good too, and music."

After six hours I wouldn't say it's the best game I've played, not either a game I put a lot of time in, but I liked getting flashbacks to a bygone era. The steering is more action oriented than the original and the story is changed a bit. I bought the game on sale on Steam and the low price justifies the six hours of gaming fun (completed it on Normal difficulty).

And you know what, it wasn't half bad. My biggest complaint would have to be with its voice-acting, which was just awful. Otherwise I felt the game was a decent-enough remake. I think a lot of the problems other reviewers had with the title was that the original game wasn't all that great to begin with, and the remake did little to fix the original's gameplay or narrative problems. Then again, the reviewers would also have cried foul had the remake strayed too far from the original, leaving the developers in a no-win situation.Flashback HD isn't a great game, but it's a good remake of an average title.

What I found though was that this game isn't as bad as a lot of people were making out. Sure, it holds your hand a LOT, but you can turn pretty much all of the assistance off.  The voice acting is absolutely horrible though and just pure cringeworthy at times - 'let's party!' when using a health restore machine. Seriously, Ubisoft?I bought it for 1.99 on sale and I'd say it definitely was worth that price. I'm only up to the first level where you return to Earth, and as stated, it's not a straight up remake, more an re-imagining of the original title. It definitely has it's issues though, like in the Death Tower levels, I couldn't use the health/grenade machines to refill, unless I moved the camera to be dead centre - if you didn't do that, pressing X did nothing.

But VectorCell made a remake of it in 2013 (published by UbiSoft)So, the main genre of this old game is action. If anyone mentions the term2D platformer from the 90's, to me immediately come to mind the followingthree titles: Prince of Persia, Another World and Flashback.The game is situated into the 22nd century, when a scientist Conrad B. Hart,finds strange machinations with human DNA in a IEG (former United Nations) -a company that rules the whole world. Each power is based on a herd of docilesheep that go to where it should be and whoever falls outside of this instrumentbecomes a little uncomfortable and the problem affected even our otherwise verysympathetic scientist, who is also the hero of this game. To fight with enemies youuse your gun, but you can also use objects from the environment, such as stones,which you can use to hurt your enemies.All in all, great game, great remake, great timewaster (as all games), but i might bea bit over nostalgic about this game (it was my youth)"

Out of This World/Another World was a rare pinnacle of side-scrolling platformer design, the sort by which few tried to emulate because it was so outside of the ordinary.  This small French company is practically unknown outside of the greater Europe area and I am very sad by this.  They released a game called Flashback which was the ""spiritual successor"" to OotW/AW.  The game plot isn't related, but it uses practically the same kind of gameplay mechanic and rendered everything in the same visually unique roto-scoped flat-shaded polygon engine.  The game has the plot of the movie ""They Live"" merged with ""Bladerunner"" and it was amazing for its time.Fast forward to here and now.  And this is a spirtual successor to Flashback.  It's a completely 3d remake of the original game.And oh boy, does it stink.  The controls are awkward and unforgiving.  It tries to have mouse-aim gun play mixed with cardinal-direction-only D-pad control scheme of the original game.  My character can only walk left/right and change elevation at select points, but I can fire my gun in a 360 arc?  It just feels odd and isn't well thought out, particularly since some enemies can ambuse you from any angle now instead of in pre-defined locations as in the original.The voice acting is bad, the sound effects are mediocre, and the visuals are nice at points but feel very flat.  All in all, this game plays and looks like a fan-made remake that somehow got access to a bit of a budget."

You might want to pick it up really cheap if you're into the theme, plus, you get the original game as a bonus, although it's somewhat awkward to play because it's done on an ingame console and there are no rebindable keys, so you might as well emulate it.Overall there are way better games out there, so if you're a person with limited sparetime, you'd be safe giving this one a pass."

If you had to fight more than one Morph at a time, you were in SERIOUS trouble. It was possible, but with a lot of dodging, moving and constantly getting a little hit in here and there. Here though? Not so much.The level up system seems tacked on.The last two stages were a repetetive chore to get through, and only because I wanted to see the disappointing ending.Anyway, this may seem like a huge rant, and...well, it is, but the game did have one or two redeeming factors.
