The game is going into ""1.0"" release next month and is being left to modders to finish it up. They claim they're going to fix bugs, but as I made clear in the review below, they couldn't even finish the A.I. during thier ""Alpha"" stage.This game is like an incredibly dumbed-down Dwarf Fortress in space. Key word being dumb.The AI has incredibly complex inabilities to solve their problems. They would rather let themselves asphyxiate in the cold of space than finish constructing the airlock that is filled with oxygen. Why? Because the unfinished part is a space suit locker. They were in space suits already.In a previous run, the builders refused to add onto the life support section because oxygen was running low (for some unknown reason) and so the whole crew suffocated.Another run, I had to tear down a door I placed. That destroyed the wall and converted the next room from an airlock into a reactor, and while trying to fix that, the builder simply never finished construction. The crew died because they had no airlock to exit and expand and there was a hole into space.The security have no sense of uniformity and would rather walk one at a time into a derelict and die continuously to the same thing.You can't place objects in 4 directions, only two. I don't know why 4-view camera controls aren't implemented yet, but its frustrating to deal with as you have so much unused space.It's a neat concept and can become a good game, but it is not at all worth your time or money. It is bug-ridden. It has very stupid AI. If the developers can create useful viewing controls and decent AI that you don't have to play around in a nit-picky manner, it'll be a fun, hard game of balance between many facets of every characters' needs and wants, and management of a space station."

I'll need it for my other projects.""- Tim ""3.3"" Schafer (Not an actual quote he made, meant to be satrical)Another title that's a stain on the early access program. You'd think a developer like DoubleFine couldn't mess up a PC game like this. Just take everything from Theme Hospital, mix abit of Dwarf Fortress in there add abit of originality and hey presto, you have a game. Not really though, as you've come across the bad reviews/recommendations for this game and there's alot of them.There's nothing good in this game, it's bare-bones as it comes. Unless a very,verytalented modding crew works relentlessly on this game it'snevergoing to be worth a purchase.Oh and one more thing; Recommending your own game through the Curator system isn't ethical. Stop that.Edit - 21/07/2015Wow, didn't realise that this 'review' would get so popular.I'd just like to thank everyone who took the time to click on that good ol' green thumb and bring to light the trash that is early access and greenlight games.

The AI even more so.There doesn't seem to be any dynamic events other than meteor strikes and random raiders which given the basic nature of the AI means that a lot of your personnell will be left dead and dying on the floor.  There was no effort put in to making the Random derelict encounters anything other than a randomly generated set of rooms to be a ""starship"" or chunk of space station and they pop into exisence randomly on the map sometimes popping in attached to your base.All in all it is a stable game which is sparse and empty that will hopefully be completed by mod teams into something a little more robust.However this only serves to prove that Double Fine missed the while point of what utelizing early access is for and clearly started this project with the hopes of funding it exclusively through EA rather than making sure they had the capital to put out a product.For the price its going for you'll get a better deal by either waiting for Starbound, Planet Explorers, or Space Engineers to get out of alpha and into beta."

And it reminds me of the Sims 4 or Sim City(2013)-Great idea for a gamelots of people have done building games, city games,etc, but Space Bases are few. The idea for this game is Perfect, now if only the game was...What Space Base DF-9 did wrong-Did not deliveron the Double Fine Games website they had a roadmap (now long gone) of things they said they were going to try to add. It was a big one. And yes i know that even they said it wasn't ""set in stone"" but it was used to get people to buy the game, and now only about 20 to 40% of those features are in the game, and it kinda feels like they tricked us.-Left the Game unfinishedDouble Fine Games the dev and publisher has left SBDF-9 to make another game and thereby make more money. They basically blame the community citing that ""not enough people bought the game to fund it"". Perhaps because the game is in an Alpha state at the most-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AII don't know about you but when i'm in a space base on the far reaches of the milky way, i get pretty damn♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when i don't have Five Star meals, or Gyms, or bars, or TV. So mad i start trashing my own Oxygen tanks thereby killing myself. What? You wouldn't do that? Well the AI in this game does that. Yep, if they aren't living in luxury they decide life just ain't worth living.-Not Worth the priceIf Double Fine Games was going to keep working on this, i would say this is worth the price, however they aren't so really there is no point in spending cash on it. Its not going to get better, its not going to get fixed, and its not a good game.-bugs and glitches that will never be fixedNot being able to build, Oxygen not being produced despite the fact i have Oxygen tanks and more, these are bugs and glitches that will never be fixed.-Made us pay for their failureThis is more of a issue of Double Fine Games itself. They the whole reason they said the game is being shut down is because one: Not enough people bought it, and two: they ran out of Kickstarter money. If they did run out of kickstarter money then STOP working on another game and spend that money on the game you sold us.-This is not the first time Double Fine Game has let people downAnother game by DFG, Broken Age was also misleading. The game is sold as a full game but it is like TellTale games in that there are ""Episodes"". Right now, a year after the funding for the game ended there is only ONE  episode, with a ""promise"" that the second one will be coming on ""sometime in early 2015""Who Space Base DF-9 is for-People who like wasting money-People who don't care about playing an unfinished game-People who buy games on sale-IdiotsFinal ThoughtsThe idea behind this game is amazing, and if worked on properly it could be a masterpiece. But it won't and thats a shame. Normally i keep supporting even bad EA games because i figure ""eh, they will fix it later"" i mean at the point i've already given them money, the best thing to do is hold on to the hope (however pointless) that the game will get better. There is no hope with SBDF-9, not anymore. And yes, modders could make it better, and they could make it a great game, but my belief is that if modders have to fix your game, and i mean Make it playable, then you've already failed."

I don't care how great the guys developing Massive Chalice are, they're from the same studio that scamed me out of 25 bucks.25 dollars, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't much. But there's alot of things I could've done with that 25 dollars, first thing that comes to mind is buy a case of mediocre beer.Now when I buy a case of Budwieser I expect certian things; I expect bland taste, I expect to get a mild buzz, sounds like a pretty ♥♥♥♥ty use of 25 dollars right? Here's the thing, I was never promised anything more.Lets expand on the beer analogy: instead of Budweiser, DF is now the brewer. DF promises me a pretty nice brew: nothing amazing, but something well worth my money. Having heard DF has produced some quality brews in the past I buy a case from the affable salesman. I take the case home, eager to try a fresh new flavor from the brewer I've heard so many good things about; then I open the first bottle. ♥♥♥♥, this bottle contains nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ fumes; disgusted but still hoping to at least drink my initial disgust away I open another bottle..........more ♥♥♥♥. So the evening rolls on with me opening up bottle after bottle of DF's ♥♥♥♥ untill the whole case is gone in the midst of my now pungent apartment I realize: that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at DF scamed me.I storm down to the storefront where I bought the not-brew only to find the signs down, the windows shuttered, and a note on the door: closed due to lack of customers.That's the best way I can think to describe my one and only transaction with DF, they sold me a case of ♥♥♥♥ and said the reason the ♥♥♥♥ was ♥♥♥♥ is because not enough people bought their ♥♥♥♥.

But between the horrible AI, UI, and overall game meta, not to mention lackluster developer support over the course of the last year I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anybody. Wait at least until beta to buy this, and only if they significantly alter the meta-game.As it stands the AI are imbecilic, the gameplay progression borders on unfair or unplayable even at low difficulty, and the game has a daisy chain of progressive bugs and glitches that functionally cripple your base the longer you play. Invisible raiders? Yes. Unhealable citizens? Got that too. Ludicrous pathing? Sure! Lack of transparency in regards to what you're placing into the game? Oh hell yes, have to rely on an oft-incomplete wiki full of speculations.You would be better off looking to ancient games like Space Colony, or Startopia for a game of this genre that works. (More in the case of Startopia) This is what bugs me the most, since I normally would expect good things from a Double Fine game, if only because I enjoyed Brutal Legend. But it is obvious to me that Double Fine isn't investing many resources in this game, and probably have no intention of doing so either.My prediction? A halt in development by Fall of 2014 when the dev team gets recalled to work on what is seen as more 'profitable' ventures. But maybe I'm just pessimistic because I've played games like this in the past with far higher levels of development from studios most people have never even heard of. (Okay, it's moving up into fall 2014 when I edited this and still no halt.. I can only hope that alpha 6 is some sort of incredible improvement.. But I won't hold my breath.)Spacebase DF-9 - 24.99Startopia - 6.99 (Space Base DF-9 could learn something about meta from this)Space Colony - Available on GOG for 9.99 (Again, something Spacebase DF-9 could learn about creating at least tolerably realistic social interactions in somewhat of a fun fashion.)"

Then apparently Double fine's collective brains fell out and they decided that since people had already payed for their game in early access they didn't actually need to bother to finish it.The release version of the game is fundamentally broken, and cannot even claim to be a working beta.  It's a half finished alpha they just dumped with zero consideration for their customers.  Most of the features promissed don't exist, or if they do are not functioning correctly.Issules include but ar not limited to:Spotty AI of both crew and hostile mobs.Exploring wrecks is almost pointless since the risk of loosing crew because they refuse to come back to the station after checking it is usually greater than any benefits you may get from it.  Plus the mining reources always run out far too early leaving gutting wrecks for matter the only way to keep a base running.Station power supply only works sometimes.The only way to satisfy the entertainment need of station crew is to put at least 2 televisions in EVERY room of the base (including airlocks) since nothing else was ever added for entertainment.The shield tech to stop asteroids punching holes in the base was never added, so you tend to spend half your time patching holes.Don't even THINK of buying this game, and if you want my advice, stay clear of anything else from this developer as they do not deserve to exist."

No I am not.  I have never dealt with such mind-crushing stupidity in any game of this sort, ever.  The stupidity of your citizens goes above and beyond funny and delves into the absolutely painful and rage-inducing.I'm talking about builders not building airlocks and dying from it, Techs not maintaining their oxygen recyclers, panicing when the lack of oxygen makes them suffocate, and then dies flailing around in circles - going into a raider/monster infested derelict one after another for the sole purpose of greed; the overwhelming desire to pick up some stupid, worthless toy and dying for it in a pile of their greedy dead friends, stamping on a roaring fire the size of a house and burning to death in a huge mass instead of using the fire extinguishers directly outside and in said flaming room - walling themselves into small rooms and dying, refusing to tear down the wall to escape or build a door,   Downright refusing to maintain the station, their lives, their jobs, or anything relating what so ever to order, because they'd rather bash each others brains out in some psychotic fight, or they'd rather have a temper tantrum because they need to keep the oxygen recyclers operational and they can't play with their rubber duckies.Yes, all of this actually happens, and it happens constantly.  It isn't some stupid trivial issue that appears once in awhile, it's literally ♥♥♥♥ing constant and it never ♥♥♥♥ing ends.  Seeing 30 people die one after another because they individually decided to stop working/cooking/sleeping to go steal a ♥♥♥♥ing trinket from a derelict near-by, and absolutely nothing I try to do can ♥♥♥♥ing stop them (Making them security and putting the deployment icon elsewhere, making them builders and trying to make them build, ANYTHING BUT DIE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING DERELICT ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR YOUR STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T).Again, this isn't funny.  It goes beyond funny.  It's unplayable.  It's literally ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable because you're actually trying to manage severely mentally disabled humans and aliens in a ♥♥♥♥ing space station.  If they don't kill themselves from suffocating, greed, or just random senseless violence and fighting, the almost constant raider attacks (that eventually culminates to a literal raider fleet, for no reason what so ever) will kill them.The best part is apparently the developers took the money and ran, haven't been doing anything with the game, ban people who point this out or mention it on their forums, and are making new projects/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the nonexistant money.This game could be really, really good if the crew wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and suicidal.  If they were competent and HAD PRIORITIES like ANY LIVING CREATURE WITH SOME SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION, the game would be good, REALLY good in fact.  As it is right now?

So, that's likely where the 11 hours I played came from. Consistently convincing myself that, in time, it would get better, more complete, and overall a product worth purchasing. I say that because this game even after “being completed” aka abandoned, is actually in a perpetual state of disrepair. Almost at every moment, you'll find yourself saying “wow, this game as some neat ideas. I'm looking forward to when they start working on it.” Alas, my fellow compatriot.. that day will never come. Everything feels if it was implemented on a whim rather than thought about and made with any intent of it working.. It's almost as if they treated it like a clipboard of various ideas. Relying on the name sake of the developer. Granted, Tim Schafer's renown stems from classics like Grim Fandango published back in the LucasArts days. The adventure genre being his forte.

I also trusted DoubleFine and Tim Schafer, being a respected studio and developer, to deliver an awesome product in the end. Alas, the development of this game seems to have been mismanaged into the ground. DF is abandoning the project and leaving us gamers with an unfinished buggy mess and calling it 1.0 release. There's about 10 hours of playtime here at most and quite frankly that is just not worth the pricetag.Update 11/12/14: I tried playing this game again after the 1.0 release. It still feels terribly unfinished. The new tutorial and goals system feel slapped together, lackluster, and unnecessary. I wish they would have spent the time adding more actual game content instead of these ""features"". Not to mention, the game is still very buggy. My first attempt at a base fell apart rather quickly after a derelict showed up. I set  a beacon to have my security guard check it out, who got killed by a bot. That alone would be fine as a possible risk of exploration, but then my other non-security personnel decided to go to the derelict ""picking something up"" (presumably the body) even after the beacon was removed. They all subsequently got killed, too. Nothing I could do would send them back to the safety of the base. Basically, I just got too frustrated to want to continue.

Unfortunately, Double Fine is now broke.- Tim Schafer announces the latest development build as the final release, takes down the webpage with the planned content, and releases the source code in a futile attempt to placate his former fans.- Tim Schafer goes off to further bankrupt Double Fine.tl;dr,DO NOT BUY.  This game is fundamentally broken and lacking in content.I realize game development can be expensive, but I think it's pretty obvious from this and the Broken Age debacles that Tim Schafer isn't particularly good with money. Maybe Double Fine's next project should be an Excel spreadsheet so he can keep track of expenses.Also, I really don't see how releasing the source code, or modding API, or whatever will possibly save this turd.  Modders are not going to want to spend time making a bad game adequate.  I think a complete rewrite of the AI should be the first thing to be done, but by the time they familiarize themselves with the code and rework the game, it'll be months from now.

,Not Recommended,246090,12839472,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Coppershoe,"While initially fun and full of promise, this base-building game quickly turns into a frustrating mess.  As a fan of the genre, I'm generally willing to look over minor flaws in base-building games, and when I first fired up Spacebase DF-9, I'll admit I let the excitement of building a space-station get the better of me.  Now, countless hours in, I find myself pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration and dissappointment everytime I boot the game up.The game begins by mousing over an imaginary galaxy to find an area to establish a new space-base.  While I dreamed of building my own Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5 at an optimal location, I found that I needed to spend 5 full minutes dragging my mouse around the galaxy map looking for an ideal location.  Rather than allowing the player to set start parameters, the designers force you to hunt the 2D galaxy map for 4 varying starting conditions, consisiting of generally unclear parameters.  Sure, levels of mining materials, a threat level, and a proximity to a warp gate seemed to make sense since I was a sci-fi fan, but through different playthoughs, they had only small differences.  The final and fourth parameter, Magnetic Interference, remains unclear.  This is because none of these parameters are ever explained, even during the tutorial.Once the game begins, regardless of the parameters selected, the player has but a few minutes to build a basic base before the three astronuats supplied run out of air to breath.  They must be assigned tasks, which, at first are dictated by necessity, and later by NPC prefence, which is shown via an assignment screen using varying degrees of happy and sad faces.The problem with building a basic base is that your resources are so low, no matter what world parameters you set, that you need to be near absolute barebones.  There is very little room for error.  Of course, once basic resources, like air, food and the ability to create building material are met, a player can always expand, and sometimes with ease.  But, this is where bugs, even in version 1.03 begin to appear.I've had my start point pressed up against materials which have made it extremely difficult to start a base.  I've had one of my 3 vital NPCs get caught on what little terrain there is at the start.  NPCs get caught inside fully constructed rooms until you place a door, which usually isn't bad, unless you go pet your cat for 30 seconds and then look up to find everyone dead.Or, in my last three games in a row, which inspired this review, have NPC's get stuck in terrain that was under construction, rendering the game a death sentence.  Since there is only one save, this requires a new base, which in turn requires mousing over the 2D galaxy for 5 minutes to find starting parameters...Once a player has a basic base up and running, the game begins to punish it much too soon.  Incoming asteroids, disease, incoming asteroids, raiders, incoming asteroids, and NPC incompatibilty all appear just a 4 or 5 rooms into the base.  Did I mention that incoming asteroids will hit your base and ALWAYS target vital systems?Once a base is established, NPCs start getting sad, angry or upset.  They all have demands.  Nobody knows how to please those demands.  I even doubt the developers know.  I have never found a correlation between the limited items I can place and NPC happiness.  I try to supply them with, say, Monitors.  What do Monitors do?  I have no idea.  Are Monitors cosmetic?  Do they increase Happiness?  Do they decrease stress?  No one knows.In summation:  The game works.  It does some basic stuff.  But, I get so frustrated everytime I bring myself to give the game a 8th or 9th chance than I'd rather watch watch seconds tick by.  Furthermore, I'd like to say that my faith in Double Fine is rattled - a company that once did no wrong has now done wrong."

Just read all the reviews others have given it.This game, given another year in development, could have been good. But the alpha version you get here is really frustrating to play:- Only one saved game at a time, and auto save only. So if anything goes wrong, that's all your time wasted.- Quite often when raiding a derelict (which should be a fun thing to do), oxygen levels will drop for no reason and kill all your guys.- A single raider can easily kill way too many of your experienced guys. Even in areas that are meant to have low threat levels and even when your guys are firing back (and because of AI bugs, sometimes they don't).- I've not noticed any difference in the threat level of the main map, because I can get raided once in an hour in a high area, and almost once a minute in a low area. It makes no sense and feels like the map rating wasn't connected to anything.- The AI has serious flaws, the most irritating of which is where your security team WILL JUST STAND there and get killed. Even 10 highly trained guys will stand right next to a raider and let themselves all be killed. There is also a bug where they get confused and refused to enter the base to regain oxygen, eventually dying.- You can't tell your guys to leave an area, which means that once you own a derelict it becomes a magnate for guys and raiders which is no end of trouble. For instance, When raiders retake a derelict, technicians and doctors will all float over and get killed. I know an emergency switch is used for this, but derelicts don't come with any.- You can't pan when in the building menu, which means you have to start all over again if the camera isn't perfect.- You can view oxygen levels, but not power levels, and is seems power units need to be close enough to power things. So you have to guess where power is going.- Oxygen leaks are impossible to spot sometimes if a ****ing raider blows out a wall that's not in an obvious spot. The O2 overlay needs to show leak spots.- Sometime when building a new base, oxygen recyclers don't work.There's enough game here that would be worth checking out if it were free. BUT, because this isn't on early access I can't recommend spending any money on it. There's just WAY too many game breaking flaws that end up ruining your time.The fact Double Fine thought it was OK to continue to charge money for such a broken game, and with no plans to fix any of it, they get a BIG F.U from me.

I suppose it was foolish of me to believe what I read/watched.As you probably have already heard, the game was not, and will not be finished.  The released game doesn't come even remotely close to what the website claimed was in production.  I'm actually a little surprised that Double Fine is even releasing what is essentially a demo for sale to the public, rather than just sending its funders an apology letter and a credit for a free game.It is shameful for Double Fine to call this a finished product, and the fact that they did so says a lot about their business practices as well as their apparent lack of commitment to quality.

I don't have to run a business and make decisions like ""let's pretend this is great when it's actually crap."" Sorry, DoubleFine, but you've managed to massively damage my opinion of you with the way you're handling this. I know you're just publishing GangBeasts, but there's now NO WAY I'm putting money into that until it's actually finished. And if too many people feel that way, will it stagnate and suffer the same fate as DF-9?-----I'll try to make an update to this review once the so-called-1.0 version comes out, and see if it's actually some working skeleton of a game.As it is now, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT ANY PRICE.It simply does not work as a game. Stuff happens and your base will die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just after the latest patch version, I lost an entire base to one raider, because the security team was either standing around and getting shot, or running away (and getting shot). None of them ever bothered to attack the intruder. Not even once. Your base will catch fire from asteroid impacts and your inhabitants will gleefully panic-run right into the flames and die, instead of grabbing the fire extinguishers you've placed across the base and actually doing something constructive. Someone will decide that they absolutely need to do floor pushups right in your airlock door, and then everybody will suffocate to death.These things are quite forgivable in an alpha game. Frustrating, but understandable. It's alpha, I get it. Things might be broken or unfinished. I'm fine with that. But if ANY of this crap manages to slip into the 1.0 release? That's just garbage.(Edit: Apparently The S-Word is too raunchy for a review. Sigh.)----1.01 UpdateIt has improved nothing at all.No. I absolutely do not recommend. It continues to justnot work. I started two bases today after the 1.01 patch, the one designed to ""finish"" the game. I see no significant improvements. Build orders are randomly followed, regardless of importance. Citizens start ""running away"" for no obvious reason. Random station boarding parties still utterly annihilate you base regardless of the number of security personnell you have assigned. Security teams clearing derelicts still seem to think that actually shooting the hostiles is a silly concept.But hey, at least now there's a tutorial! A rather unnecessary one, since the game mechanics are not at all complicated, and I felt were very obviously conveyed through normal play. The problem isn't the players misunderstanding the game mechanics - it's that the game simplydoesn't f-ing work.----FinalFinal recommendation:DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. EVER.Secondary recommendation:Never trust DoubleFine again. Only buy a product once it has been actually released, and you've tried it, and it actually works, and the community is being treated well. Do not give support (either financial or social) to companies that make bad decisions. And especially not companies that make bad decisions, then try to tell you how great their decisions actually were."

That left me down a person and made the early game much more difficult. In my second base, the seed pod didn't spawn and one of my colonists spawned stuck in part of an asteroid. I decided to just restart at that point. My third base is going better, but the AI doesn't work very well even when it isn't bugging out completely.

The AI is dreadful and has a habit of doing the worst thing possible, like suffocating when there's a working airlock and oxygen generators. It's not very likely that all of the issues will be tidied up in the month or so they had left on development.It's a genuinely great idea and with another year or so of dev time I could really see it shaping up to be worth the money.

I wasn't too concerned with the lack of available features or amount of glitches, as most of what I wanted was to be released anyway through updates leading up to the final release.Well, as you probably already know, the developers essentially shredded up their list of short/medium/long term goals in one night, and suddenly the game ""went gold"".It was a very disappointing turn of events, to see a title with such promise basically wind up as a hollow shell of what it could have been (and should have been, based on what was promised the gamer base by the makers of the game originally).Basically, don't waste your money - you'll get maybe a couple short, bugged-out playthroughs of the game but it's just lacking any amount of depth to really get you playing up to even half your money's worth."

Early expansion is a difficult grind struggling with a  crew that doesn't work into that mid to what I think is later game starts to drag on far too easily as it gets harder to manage even basic needs with the limited resources income.I admit it does sound nice, and can have promise - but it just doesn't seem to have enough behind it at the moment to get it there, or at least in the direction the game wants to go without doing something of a major overhault to some key aspects to smoothen the gameplay.Try it out maybe on a cheap sale, but this is definetly not one I'd be willing to reccomend at a higher price."

,Not Recommended,246090,23547688,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,BaD AJent,"Dissapointing....  Back when the game was in early development I fell victim to its ""appeal"".  I saw a game with potential and I was all and all hopeful.  In those ealier days the game was riddled with bugs and glitches, and when I found out they were dropping the game and rushing development, I was hopeful they would eliminate those bugs and glitches in the game.  So as a review of the official release of version 1.06 here is the breakdown.  I'll have a simple review and more in depth... or in this game... anger driven review...----- Simple ----The game is crap... It had so much potential but since it got the axe and a speedy release... it has so many issues.  I honestly tried to play the game again... but yet I wasn't able to play longer than 10 minues.  I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it's less than a dollar or given to you free.  It's buggy... rough to control, and just honestly crap.----- Angered Version -----Graphics:As this is not a ""Highly graphical"" game I wouls say they are acceptable.  The sprites perform actions that is befiting, and nothing to standoutish.  However in aspect of gameplay the ""isometric"" angle makes the game difficult to know exactly what is going on.  In the typical fashion the walls disappear in a way to allow you to see in the rooms, however being able to roatate the camera would be nice.Gameplay:This is where the game loses me.  Although the controls aren't ""hard"" they are difficult in there own way.  I've played many builder games, and most games play similarily with minor adjustments to the controls.  In more recent terms since the era of shooter games almost every game depends upon the W-A-S-D model.  This game doesn't stray too far fram that idea and it feels comfortable... at least until you start building.  At that point the game takes a turn for the worst.  Edge scrolling doesn't feel like it's in existence, so your dependant upon the WASD model, but once you open the construction menu, foul language fills the mouth as when you click with your mouse to select the item and press ""D"" to move your contruction item changes.  As soon as that construction menu comes up the game shifts from a comfortable WASD model to a point and click model.  This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't establish you could use the WASD in the first place....   So that is annoying.  Then it gets worse.  As you play you decide to speed up the game, and most games using some button near the WASD (tab, 123, something) changes the game speed, but in comes the mouse model, and you have to click the speed options.  Now I wouldn't have an issue with this, if it wasn't for the fact that when any ship arrived or any notification appears the game switches back to speed 1.... and DOES NOT RETURN.....I find it quite annoying because I'll be in the middle of waiting for my characters to build a room... then all the sudden a message... then the question, ""Why are my guys moving so slow""... then oh gotta click that speed... then the game goes NOPE... and another message.  It just continually pesteres you until you get so angry that you give up.AI:I don't normally judge AI as it's always an issue with all games.  It is always about finding that right balance between what the computer needs to process and what the character prioritizes.... unfortunately it appears that this game said, ""F*$k it... have the guys do whatever.""  And like loyal programs they do whatever.  You have absolutely no control over the individual character, so when your trying to finish that bed... your have to wait until the game decides... ""know what I think I should build that bed.""  But at that point your characters are now falling over because they are so tired... that they have no energy... then get depressed and not want to work... so now that bed will never get done.... it annoying the bleeping crap out of me as I was just trying to enjoy the game.Glitches and Bugs:Yes I'm bringing it up... as a ""fully"" released game you would expect most of the bugs and glitches to be taken care of... in fact thats what most of the follow up forums established... but know what.... turns out that your characters get stuck (dumb AI) and because you can't do that they sufficate.... yeah... so just started finished the basic build... airlock... air... and such... but oh no... two of my guys just sat there... doing... NOTHING... could it be AI? probably... but to me that's a bug.   But it's not the worst oh no... in my honest to goodness no opinion try I got ""invaded"" another ship attached itself to me, and I was assulted.  After killing the AI I noticed, Hey there is a gun outside...  Then I slowly watched one of my security guards go out to take care of it.... two shots later dead.... ok..... so what does the AI do?  ""Well he's dead... probably should take care of that... but naa....""  Guess where my miners had to go to get resources?  Right in the line of fire.... so there goes two of my miners...  Well maybe I can control a security... oh wait can't control the guys so whoops... maybe set a security point for them.... nope... dead... dead and dead.....  I'm happy they incorperated the guns for defences... but when a gun is established as enemy and even if you took over everything it appears that that guns still acts hostile....  My frustrations knows no bounds.Overall the game is fine.... just fine.... not great... not good... just fine.... if you want something new to distract you for 10 minutes... here is the perfect game for you... but don't buy unless it's on uber sale.... and by uber sale like... I dunno $0.99 per copy... or heck maybe if the company pays you to play... becuase honestly this game isn't worth anything more."

In its Alpha build, DF9 AI was rudamentary. It made bad, often comically bad decisions, and it was like watching a child grow and interact with a world we knew it would adapt to. Like parents, we told our friends the marginally interesting tales of how the children stopped to chit-chat about Moonbeef and whatever while oxygen recyclers caught fire and firefights happened around them. And it was funny because we assumed that it would improve with time, development, and attention.Then DF noticed. They thought this is where the charm of the game came from, and they pulled the plug. Our AI children stopped growing, and were now going to stay stupid. ""You enjoyed the stupid AI"", they say, ""and now that's where we decided to leave it.""We enjoyed the AI because it was temporary and had some amusing quirks in its broken state. Being forced to deal with the game in the shape that it's in is not fun. Building a base for inhabitants who don't know how to live in it is not a sim, it's an exercise in futility."

While not a deep as initially promised, there was still a good amount of things to do, and I could imagine just maintaining a large base over an extended period of time would keep me pleasantly occupied. Sadly, the final release is riddled with bugs and is not balanced very well, making it impossible to play beyond the initial stages of the game. The developers have said they will provide patches for the game, but thus far their updates have done little to improve the faults with the game and seem to have spawned new bugs. It is hard to imagine that they will have the time to actually fix the game properly given their claim to have run out of funding and their stated desire to wrap up support within a couple of weeks. At this point, avoid this game.UPDATE: It's now February and support for this game including bug fixes is officially over. Update 1.6 was DoubleFine's last patch, and they have stated on their own forums that no one is working on patches anymore. The above review applies to patch 1.6.

DF stated that it simply wasn't making enough money to warrant continued development and from a gamer's perspective, there's not much of a game to warrant purchasing, especially at the $25 price range. What we have here is a stalemate in which both parties lose. Gamer's lose money and the developer loses face.As it stands, Spacebase DF-9 does let you create a base and manage some resources, it does have some random events to throw at a player so that the game isn't completely boring however, there are no end game type things to work towards, no objectives to ultimately strive towards.  In five hours, a player can pretty much run into everything the game offers and after that, the game will just keep repeating itself.The lack of gameplay issue is compounded by the fact that the beta phase of game testing is being skipped over entirely.  DF is going to tack on a tutorial, wrap up some issues and then release the code in hopes that modders will run with their..un-game and make it better.What was supposed to be a game that was to be in continuous development over the next five years with gameplay tweaks and additions is now kicked out the door in its current shape.

Surprising and not great, but as said, I hadn't planned to anyway so I went ahead with a new real start.My hopes for the game returned, I enjoyed starting anew and building up the base and this time I had a plan for raiders!My plan... reassign every crewmen to security and overwhelm in numbers! XDNot great I know.. but it worked, though highly tiresome to have to remember and reassign everyone back to their old jobs as you can't assign saved positions to default back to.Then of course, things went bad again...I find a derelict ship, so badly laid out it could've been a rushed post-battle vessel from Galaxy Truckers.So of course, I decide to tear everything out as salvage materials.Unknown to me, one crew decided to remove the ships oxegen generator and then the door of another room from the inside.. leaving him stuck and likely gormless, as there was no notification of him being stuck.I'll admit a possibly mistake on my part: Not painstakingly watching and assigning each item removed one at a time, but when I tried that previously the crew had a habit of just heading off to bed or returning to my base for a minute to build some shelves I'd requested another builder to build, before coming back.. which is why this time I just left them to it.Anyway, I found Mr.Gormless and got him to let himself out of the room but before he got any further the oxegen in the ship got too low and it turns out people panic when they realise the oxegen is low (fair enough I'm sure).Unfortunately, this panic was apparently too much to allow the builder to obey my orders to rebuild an oxegen generator.Close to frustration I see my second builder heading over in a space suit to save the day..Unfortunately, Gormlessness is clearly contagious as our superhero stepped out of the airlock, went into a panic himself, rushed back into the airlock and flushed himself into space...So yea, there you have it.

,Not Recommended,246090,12142959,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Kail,"This game is kind of like Dwarf Fortress in space, a little simulator where you design rooms and manage the roster for your space station.  You don't control the citizens directly, but instead you put down work orders, and the citizens will handle it on their own.  You sketch out rooms and order furniture and so on and your citizens place it.The first few mintues of the game were a lot of fun for me.  You're kicked out of your life support pod drifting in deep space and have to build a little self sustaining environment with an airlock and some life support systems before your citizens run out of air (about 5 mins).  This was an encouraging first glance for me, because it's pretty hard and will probably require a few resets if you don't know what you're doing, and the systems seemed interesting and complex.  Eventually, though, I figured it out and started branching out, putting up a refinery to allow my miners to mine nearby asteroids, using the materials to build a residence and a bar and a garden and a lab and stock it with furniture.And then the game ended.I don't mean it dumped me to a ""game over"" screen or anything, there just wasn't anything left to do.  Once you've got a half dozen rooms down and functioning, which takes maybe an hour, there's nothing else you can do except wait for your science team to sloooooowly research some unnesescary upgrades, or maybe have your security team scrap with some raiders (note that this isn't an RTS, combat in this game is just a matter of setting a point for your security team to defend and maybe they will if they're not on break or hungry or tired or sad).  Sometimes a derelict will show up and you can... well, tear it down, nothing else to do with them really.If you've ever played Dwarf Fortress, basically imagine that game but with no workshops.  You can make rooms and designate areas and place furniture, but there's no crafting system, no economy, no trade, resources are all boiled down to a single currency which is used to buy everything from walls to furniture.  The game just has no depth at all, and it's competing with some of the most complex and deepest simulations on the market right now.The devs seem to have responded to this by ramping up the challenge, which makes things a bit frustrating.  Colonies can die from parasites before you get a doctor, waves of raiders can annihilate an underequipped security force, and once things start to fail, it's pretty much a chain reaction to an abandoned base.  Colonists freak out and refuse to do their jobs so vital equipment isn't maintained or repaired so colonists freak out even harder and things just spiral downward.  For example, if the air supply gets low, colonists will freak out rather than do their jobs, so if the area with the life support systems has air problems, you can't ever fix it because whoever goes in there is going to panic instead of fixing the air generator, and the problems get worse.  And this doesn't really do much to fix the problem with the game being short, because once you've got whatever it is you need to counter them, then they're not that big a deal.The 1.0 update added a lot of nice features, but the game still has serious issues with longevity.  There are still occasional glitches with draw order and some AI issues, but the game works pretty well mostly.  I've only played a bit, but pathing does seem improved and the interface does make things clearer now.I don't want to sound excessively negative, this isn't the worst game ever.  I had a lot of fun with it.  It's just really short, and the asking price is kind of high.  On sale, for $5, I'd say this is a good deal.  At full price, I don't think it's worth it.  I'd recommend looking at something like Startopia or Space Colony or grabbing something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress if you're not in love with the sci-fi aesthetic.  All of these games are cheaper, deeper, and more fun in the long term than DF-9."

You can watch the work come along!Except, it turns out, they basically have about two walls, and maybe a bit of tarp stretched over a corner or something. Not exactly inspiring stuff; so uh, they're having trouble getting any more people interested in it.Time to cut it there, they figured, we've made some money on this; let's wrap this up before we invest any more money into it. It turns out they were only planning on building a mansion. Planning! Obviously what we meant by that and what you thought were different things. Our apologies.But no worries! You have full use of the two walls and tarp. We never got around to adding plumbing, though, or electricity. Also, there's this hobo who keeps trying to shiv people. Finally, uh, the site is contaminated by deadly radon gas, (interesting, because there isn't even a basement) and some of you may have progressive pulmonary fibrosis.We'll leave a few nails and boards around, if someone wants to improve on things, though. Also, the president of the company is just as bummed about this as you guys are, except not really, because he's got a bit more money out of this deal!Bottom line: This company has made some good games in the past, but not recently. Early access might work with small studios, but when you've got 60 plus people to support, it doesn't seem as financially viable...

I restarted five times, and nothing, nothing works.I don't know what they did, but after the last 'major' update they broke the game, when I tried using my old base, everything was broken, my reactors, my production, everything.This was my first base builder game and I loved it, then, double fine did something wrong and broke it, I don't know what they did, but they broke it.This game needs a way to revert back to an older version so I can play this again, the only thing you got out of this game if you got it early on was a free crappy game to go with your payed game that was broken.Don't let this discourage you from buying other doublefine games.

I see other reviews talking about a Kickstarter and broken promises from Double Fine. I don't know about all that. What I can tell you is that this game has SO MUCH potential but never lives up to it. So many little things about this game hint at a larger story, at a more in-depth gameplay, at a game that could be but isn't. If someone could take the concepts of this game, with a living crew to manage and a procedural storytelling system and an expansive sandboxy space construction system, and actually FINISH it, it could easily be one of my favorite games.I want to like this game.

Dont get me wrong, I love his creativity just not his business practices.That type of Game Developer behavior cannot be supported as it is running amuck here on Steam's EA.

It MIGHT be worth a quater of the price IF the community gets into modding it to fix serious issues and add much needed content.MIGHTIF---I guess i should update this review now that the game has been released and has been updated to 1.05.I still play this game, and at the time of the edit to this review, i've invested about 70 hours into countless new games.The updates have helped a whole lot, but the game still has some playability issues:Doctors will often ignore corpses, which leads to bad morale, which leads to violence which leads to drastic crew loss.Raider events are too randomised, and can often lead to base failure in the very early game, or general drastic crew loss.The added raider mega-fleet event is a good idea in principal, but is vastly over-powered.Construction crew often take huge detors to the next block to be built when in space, which can lead to a new base failing, or causing unrecoverable crew loss in the very early game.Even with my reasonable system spec and the relative simplicity of the game, it tends to lag-out far too much.Generally; Base failure seems to be down to chance rather than skill.There are positives, howeverThere are mods appearing now, which is great. The community is addressing balence issues and adding reaseatch and similar.Workshop support is still very much missing, sadly.Overall:Has the potential to be a reasonable casual game, but really isn't worth the full price at all.

I bought this for 99 cents and I still fell ripped off. sure, it looks okay, sure, it has it's atmosphere but the game doesn't understand what a ""low chance of being raided"" means. I played one game for ~4 hours today and I was actually starting to have fun. theeeen raider after raider after raider, waves of the scrublords killed my workers, so I had to assign people who were not workers.. they were murdered, eventually my security was killed off and everything fell to pot. This isn't a strategy game, this is an exercise in futility and it desperately needs fixing. (but its not being  developed any more, ohnooes) And if you think I'm just being salty over this, I moused over the galaxy and found the most ideal spot I could. (which is near the galactic center) I was looking for the easiest of easy modes to get my feet  wet before I tried any of the other areas. And it was decently easy! uuuntil the game decided to start throwing raiders at me like they were party favors. seriously, I couldn't even keep up with  the info box because it was all ""hey, raiders. look, raiders. oh hey, guess what? raiders!"" Maybe there's some sort of infinite loop, maybe there's some sort of size threshold that this happens at but I never even got my population to 40. On top of all of this I was unable to do any research, medical or tech related. I couldn't assign anyone to do anything like that even though I had a huge research bay with 16 or so research tables and at the peak, 4 scientists.And can we talk about unhappiness? nothing  I did seemed to help them, they'd just go off and sulk and get into fights n stuff. All in all,  not as bad as Kirk Cameron's Saving Xmas, nor is it anywhere as awful as Depression Quest, but it has some serious coding and feature-related issues that really need to be looked at (if not by DF, then by allowing 3rd party patches to fix it.)"

The interface is very clunky and you will be lucky if you actualy do get a base up to specs.To begin with the game is so full of game killing bugs that 9 out of 11 games I played were ended NOT because of a disaster, but because of  a major game killing bug.  I even had to restart the game 6 times in a row one time just because there was a bug that was killing it shortly after launching..Moving on we now go to the general aspects of the game itself:Support 0/10This game was released in an unfinished state and is abandoned yet sold on here for $20 (at the time of posting)I can not give a game in this condition or state any kind of rating at all.  Moving on, the devs are not freindly at all and have banned people for expressing their opinions that the game was a piece of vaporware.  You can take a look at the discussion forums for yourself on this and get a good idea of just how much censorship that is going on and make up your own minds on this .Graphics 5/10I am really not impressed with the graphics.  They are not impressive at all and were somewhat below average.Sounds and Music 1/10This is an area that is bare bones.  Obvioiusly this area of the game also did not get fnished.  What little music and sounds that there are  annoying as it is repetitous.Gameplay 1/10I tried. No really I tried and I got 1 decent game out of 30+ hours which yielded  constant frustration from game killing bugs.  So I give gameplay a 1 because it was fun until the game was killed by a bug.Fun 2/10What time I did play that was not killed by a game killing bug was fun so I give it a 2 in this area.Price:  due to the bugs, unfinished state, and unfrinedly devs it is my opinion that this is one game that definitely NOT worth more than a few pennies.Bugs and Execution:  The interface sucks, the game is full of game crushing bugs.I hope this review has been helpful to anyone looking for a new game.

Generally the interesting thing about base building games is not about how you can create a utopia where nothing goes wrong, but how your base will eventually come to its inevitable end.Spacebase DF-9 fails to spark any continued enjoyment because of how quickly one can create a stable base without having to worry about anything bad ever happening. One playthrough was all it took to figure out all the kinks for the next time, where it is entirely possible to reach a state where everything simply balances itself out. This can be attributed to the fact that the game has a veryshortlist of features.Theshortlist of rooms have an incrediblyshortlist of items one can add to it, so constructing a base on the second playthrough provides almost the exact same experience. It is not surprising how shallow this game feels compared to other games from the genre, even before you are hit by the realization that the learning curve is really just a horizontal line.The random events and the citizens ""dynamic"" behavior do not add a lot of variety, which is something that also quickly realized as you build your base. Understanding the patterns of theshortlist of events the game throws at you does not take a lot of figuring out, which is not surprising given the fact that you can count these on one hand. To make things even worse, any negative event that can happen is easily preventable with the aforementionedshortlist of items at your disposal.The only challenging element this game presents, is the incredibly stupid AI that is set on destroying itself as early as building the very first airlock for the base. God help them if they are apart of your mining crew and there happens to be two airlocks to your base, because they are more likely to asphyxiate in space than they are picking which one is closer so they do not die.Again, all these negative aspects can be attributed due to the fact that this title is featureINCOMPLETEand will probably remain so, unless it builds a decent modding community (which is incredibly unlikely to happen given the current state). The keyword here isshort, as in the feature list, the amount of time this game was given development time until its ""full"" release, and any enjoyment you can get out of it.I would be lying if I said I had never been so disappointed by a game before, but certainly not with a game that I was so excited to see completed. In the end I, and several other hopefuls lost out on $20-25 on a game that will never be finished. And while they did not lie to us about ""silently pulling the plug"", but they certainly lied about delivering us a ""complete"" game. With them violating my trust, I will never be purchasing another early access title or Double Fine game ever again."

That simple statement moves the game from something that can be great to being mediocre at best. If this changes I will take another look at change my review, but as of now, don’t get it, not worth it."

It could have been great if it had been finished.It baffles me that a company like Double Fine, who have had a sterling record before now, could have done this.

You can plow through what little content is there in an hour and from Double Fine's last post it seems unlikely much content will be added for the ""final"" 1.0.--Spacebase DF-9 is an interesting play on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Instead of carving out a kingdom from rock you are inversely adding a ""kingdom"" to the vacuum of space.  Similar to Dwarf Fortress you are given little control over your citizens.  Instead you play the role of macromanager, assigning citizens to tasks and watching them go about their day.  Certain events will trigger at random times forcing you to deal with raiders, parasites, killbots, and meteorites.While all of this sounds fun in theory the problem is that Spacebase DF9 is competing with 10 years of Dwarf Fortress development.  As of Alpha version 6 there is still relatively little to do.  You can speed run through an hour of gameplay and basically see all that Double Fine has to offer, afterwards the game offers little reason to continue playing.

Throughout the alpha the gameplay did not change at all. Instead each alpha update added some tacked on crap that contributed very little to the game.GoodThe characters you construct a base for seem to have depth. They have feelings and thoughts and you can read about them and so on. The basic gameplay elements for a base builder are there and function.BadThe game seems to be caught somewhere between Dungeon Keeper and the Sims. Unfortunately, the emphasis seems to be on Sims gameplay. The station inhabitants have clearly had more effort put into them than the actual gameplay. This could have been a positive thing, as it is in the Sims which is a great game, except without a base and proper neccessities all your inhabitants will die. So you find yourself in a panic to build a base early, made all the harder by the fact that your workers spend more time socializing and posting to their ""spacebook"" than building things essential to survival. This is made even more frustrating by the single most terrible UI I've seen in a modern game ever.In conclusion, the game isn't finished. The gameplay in Spacebase is incredibly underdeveloped and clunky. There isn't even anything to do. You build a small base and then there's nothing. You could make a bigger base, but there's no reason to. There's no challenge. Despite a year and a half of development this still plays like a terrible demo."

And Double Fine has come out and said that this is all that there ever will be.Don't buy this game.  It's all build-up, no climax.  No challenges.

I mean, the game works and all but there are a lot of glaring problems with it.  After a few runs through the game, I couldn't help but notice that every space sector you play in has almost zero differences between them.  The astro density determines how much asteroid is in your area to mine from, which is appreciated, but it hardly makes up for everything else.  The threat level has very little difference, as it apparently suggests how often your base gets showered on by meteors and debris, while warpgate proximity indicates how often you get potential new residents passing by.  What is evidently missing is where Raider occurrences would be placed, since they happen fairly regularly.The Raiders themselves are stupendously overpowered.  The raiding parties vary between one and three Raiders that *will* decimate your population, no matter how well-trained your Security staff is.  The reason for this is because they tank damage like it's nothing while killing a majority (if not all) of your residents in less than five shots each.  The defensive turrets don't offer much by way of defense.  As the camera is locked to only one perspective, you only have the option to face the turrets downward (i.e. towards the bottom of the map) to either the left or right directions.  Seriously, you can't really use them to shoot at the approaching vessels since they have to be *inside* the base.The base amenities are also a joke as follows:- Despite having oxygen capacity for X number of people, the second I fill the base to capacity, the oxygen recyclers eventually fail as if I was overbooked (despite each recycler to be working perfectly at roughly 80-85% durability).  This caused my residents to panic and run around, abandoning all jobs and waiting until they either starved to death (because they used up all of the matter in stock) or waited until the next Raider party exterminated them all.- The bar doesn't offer much, since it's the only thing that works in the Pub zone.  I have seen neither the fridge nor stove used at all so they're essentially useless.- I set up a Reserch Zone and set a tech to research but my Scientist was busy doing everything else while on duty rather than actually research anything.Overall, the game pretty much sucks since each playthrough is just the same thing: see how big your base can get before Raiders kill them all.  And given how Double Fine's treating the game now, I'd have to agree with everyone else.  The developers are basically dropping the project and turning the rest of the game's development over to the community after announcing that they're releasing the source code for the scripts and pushing the game out the door with a 1.0 full release version.  Avoid this game and pick up somthing better instead, like the classic StarTopia or even Prison Architect (which I also have). Spacebase DF-9 is simply a waste of time and money."

There were bugs, and early access gripes, but the EA rule I use is that ""As long I can visualize this being finished, done, and fun, I can consider spending money on it."" DF9 met those criteria. However, as the game has moved abruptly to a ""release"", and with the complete stoppage of new features, Double Fine has fallen far, far short of even approaching their planned development milestones. Further, the lack of believable rationales, detailed explanations, or even breakdowns about why this came about mean that I can't in good faith recommend that you purchase this game, or any future titles from Double Fine productions until some form of publically disclosed management shakeup takes place.They reportedly raised approximately half a million dollars to develop this game. They then stopped development, citing financial reasons. They do not appear to have then offered any breakdown of where said money went. They are now confused, as people are angry and asking ""WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO!?"" The statements I have reviewed do not appear to show that this logical connectoin has been made.The final nail in the coffin was a ""AWESOME DEV PROCESS GREAT JOB"" timeline that was issued as a ""We're sorry we took your money, but don't pay attention to the archived feature lists we pumped for months about what we were going to do, instead read this sleek graphic that shows what we DID do! JUST DONT COMPARE THE TWO!"" Their conduct in this and other products leads me to the following unfortunate conclusion regarding Double Fine Productions:They simply are not a worthwhile investment for your consumer dollars. This is not the first time this endgame has come about for one of their product. That is not to say Double Fine is an intrinsically bad company, or that they cannot make good games. But I simply cannot justify spending money on early access titles from them now or in the future.At this point, Double Fine serves as an argument for Valve to more or less micro-audit game development companies, even basic indie ones, for management practices. Whether that is feasible or a correct response is a different matter, but Double Fine's performance definitely elicits that reaction. That or open up a ""Developer Review"" page to trash talk developers (This would also be a bad idea, but it is my inclination in response).A more reasonable option would be for Valve to construct a form of ""Warning Stick"" that it can publically shake at developers who mis-behave in such a fashion. A ""We're reviewing their sales agreement"" or ""We're considering yanking their priviledge to post on early access"" type of statement, to remind developers that Early Access is not a kickstarter equivalent, but is rather an opportunity to generate interest and feedback on your products."

The goals are pointless and more like achievements (get 50 people, kill 50 raiders, build every object).My 45 minute experience on the new 'release' included such highlights as:My best tech sufficating because they were outside shooting at nothing, and nothing that I did stopped them (changed role, cuff, send to infirm/brig)The 'holdables' littering that map from the countless people that just 'died' for bugger all reason.A part of my station catching fire, and 5 people dying because I locked the room down and opened it to space to clear the O2. What did everyone do? Jump in their suits and go around through the open door, start fighting the fire AND THEN GET OUT OF THEIR SUITS IN A ROOM WITH NO O2.Fire animation remains after the fire is extingished. Now my base has a bunch of camp fires around it.In a area with 'Very Low' raiders, had 10 raids between new colonists (not including the potental raids in the form of message that I know the answer to to make them not raid)Colonists are still stupidly difficult to please. I have to click through 3 or 4 menus to figure out whats wrong with them.Construction workers die pulling down a wreak because it had a alien in it. The alien attacked and killed a construction worker (who, I would like to point out I cant control to make him run away) dispite that fact that the 'room' the alien was in was open to space along the entire lenght of it. About 15 squares open to space. After killing my construction worker the alien ran FURTHER into the room, and only then was sucked into space.Raiders still use the airlock, which means to beat them: wait until the raiders desuit in airlock > pause > unzone room > lock door to base > open door to space > they get sucked out. There is no reason at all to ever fight these raiders. This is the single best way to beat them. And it sucks.Honestly Ive got like 100 more gripes just from the last 45 minutes I've been playing the new update, but I can sum it all up with:Game sucks. Feel half finished (because it is).

To my mind, there is no real point to the game. The whole thing about choosing where to have your base is very cool, but in reality there is little to no difference. There are lots of rooms you can put down, which is great, but I can find nothing to do apart from put all the rooms down and defend myself against the waves of baddies.Which leads us onto another problem: CombatIf I was to be nice, I would say that the combat was... flawed. The truth of the matter is that even when you assign people to security, and give them a place the have to defend, if they are talking or playing a game or eating etc, they will simply ignore you while the baddies are quite happily blowing the c*** out of your base.There are many bugs with game, including the priorities problem as outlined above.

I used to play Startopia (awesome!) and Space Colony (pretty good!) so I was pumped for another game of the kind.I like that the game does not take itself too seriously. You got funny dialogues, weird aliens, and spacebook. It makes for a comfortable feel too it. The colors are vibrant and the interaction between crew members are kinda funny.The ability to create your own base and style it the way you want is also very interesting. It makes for a unique base layout each time you make a new game.And then there are the things that bother me. First, for a base that supposed to feel like home, there's very little items you can put in a room. A potted plant, a monitor, a dresser, a rug, some shelves, and a couple of neon signs are your ONLY decorations. There isn't even any way you can recolor it so you're stuck with the same items in every room.Second, You can only rotate the camera from north to east facing. That will apply to every item too. It's really frustrating as it limits your design option.Third, There are still a lot of bugs or unfinished issues (that they might address in the future) No matter what you do at the moment, your base will fail either due to depressed crew members that results into raging and destruction of rooms and equipment or raiders killing everybody even if your security personel had all the upgrades available. Some suggested that you put a decorative object almost every other tile to stave off depression but we shouldn't have to do that. You also had that design issue wherein the item looks like it's floating rather than attached to the wall. Crew members can actually go behind it (i.e. Food replicator, monitor)Ultimately, I felt like I was ripped off. To put more context, Doublefine did say that they 'might' add more based on the development map that they laid out but with the current and future content (1.0) that will come out, it is wholly unreasonable for the 30$ they are asking. It felt like they just gave up midway through.The worst thing about this is that since they are giving the community access to the source code, they now wash their hands off it. It is now the responsibility of the community to make the game great. Oh sure, they said they'll be sticking around...for bug fixes.I knew there were dangers of buying early-access games but I couldn't stop myself. Now I regret it. Don't make the same mistake"

If they actually added everything they were planning, it might have been interesting. However, as is, it's simply not worth the surprisingly high cost. While the gameplay that is there is fairly strong and enjoyable to play, there's simply not enough for $25, and it looks like there never will be.Long story short, avoid this game at its current price. If you see it on a massive (like, selling for less than $5) sale, maybe try it, but honestly, there's really not much here, and certainly very little replayability. If you want a base building game but aren't neckbearded enough for Dwarf Fortress, try out Gnomoria instead.

Instead of finishing the job and building a door to gain access to the base, she preffered to starve to death.In summary, unless you see any news about much more development in this game, don't bother.

Double fine decided its done, so lets look at this as a finished productSpacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space. I know what youre thinking, I was hyped too. You can assign different jobs to different citizens and theyll like it a certain amount. Your citizens will scurry around and converse with each other about inane things like space mudcrabs. You can select asteroids to be mined, which works kinda. You can get other people to come by and ask to join your space-hovel, and supposedly they might even try to do other things, but that never happened in my playthrough. You can send you citizens to go and explore derelict ships, and they will find things. You can build rooms, and put things in those rooms, and your citizen will use them. You can give those rooms different named functions, and your citizen will use them for those functions. Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space.Pros:-Aesthetic: If you can count on Double Fine for anything, its that their stuff always looks good. The semi-retro looks of the interface and the hand drawn aliens look nice and stylized. Sending your citizens off to investigate a derelict ship is always a harrowing affair, as the ship is completely dark, with red warning lights flashing ominously through the hallways. Even if you have no idea whats coming, the atmosphere of the ship makes you anticipate losing a few citizens. One fult is that the play space looks very flat, even though your citizens, while in space suits, can go under your space-hovel, which was very confusing the first few times.-Sound: The soundtrack is short but nice. Ambient trance music has a soft spot in my ear canal, but I found the music very nice, even though it will be seen as repetitive to some. If you dont like, it, you can always mute it and play Eminem, or what have you.-Core gameplay: The game mechanics I described above are very good, and makes the base of a great sim game. I'll elaborate more on this in the negatives.-Fun alien designs: I like the designs of the aliens. I didnt see two aliens who looked exactly alike in my playthrough, besides the two humans I started with. Reminds me of Star Wars!Negatives:-It isn't Psychonauts. Lets all face facts, the main reason we all buy Double Fine games is in hopes of another wacky, fun game like Psychonauts. It doesnt need to be a Psychonauts game, it just needs to have the same spirit (Although, I'm still holding out hope that if I keep buying DF games, they'll eventually make Psychonauts 2). The plain fact of the matter is that this has none of that spirit. Spacebase DF-9 is as sterile a gaming experience as there is to be found. The most funny thing I did was purposefully suffocate my citizens in the bar. Forshame, Double Fine.-The gameplay is completely flat. As in grossly, sadly, boringly flat. If you have played 30 minutes of DF-9, you have played 30 hours of DF-9. With the exeption of the rare derlict ships, I spent most of my game watching netflix on the other monitor. Even the derelict ships suck in a way, since even with their mystery, it takes too much time and resource to explore and kill the monsters inside for it to be worth it, since all your citizens will be terrible at fighting. In other games, like the Sims 4, this could be remedied with patches and DLC, but Double Fine has no intention to patch or make DLC for this game, and so were tuck with the husk of a potentially great game.Ending score: 4/10. A passable game that works just fine but because of its pedigree should be a while lot better than it is. If you really need your fix of a Space Station simulation game, try Space Colony on GOG, if you need a Sims-esque game, just go back to the Sims. If you want a fun Double Fine game, just play Psychonauts or Brutal Legend again."

""Events"" are a tad too catastrophic and can easily lead to total failure (usually because AI doesn't do what it's supposed to, though). There is very little control over the space station's inhabitants' actions, there is no way to prioritize tasks. Occasional bugs will result in a lot of citizens dying for random reasons (eg, can't open a perfectly functioning door, or they won't come back from space when low on oxygen, and so on), whose corpses nobody will remove (again, AI failure). I'd say the AI  is what really needs some tweaking, right now.All in all, the game has a very nice backbone and quite some flesh, along with a few interesting quirks, but needs a lot (A LOT) of polishing yet.

I absolutely adore that game so I have bought almost every dwarf fortressesque game on early access.However, this game: Spacebase DF-9 is not a good game. Why? Several reasons, but most relate to really bad controls. To build stuff or select or anything is really fiddily because it has a hard time registrating where the mouse is pointing on the grid - so you have a really hard game just controlling the damn game. Also the UI is hard to understand sometimes. The citizens all have their own individual ""twitter feeds"" where they write what the think of your space station, but the problem is that it's hard to understand exactly what their problems are. The game is also very unbalanced so it's hard to get a space base running and the nature of space means that it's important to make sure that you build correctly the first time. More so than in dwarf fortress where you can occasionally correct mistakes or convert rooms. Here your items often take more than 1 space on a grid so you'll find that its harder to convert rooms to other things. Also the rooms needs to be substantially bigger and you cannot put stuff like beds beside walls because they need all of the bed's adjacent squares to be free.EDIT: It has been a long time since the developers decided to abandon this project. I think I speak for all of us who bought this game when I say that we're all deeply disappointed in them. We all think it's a scam, and that it was not finished like it should have been.

Post version 6 release, it now totally sucks.Why?Specifically the AI doesn't seem capable of managing the new functionality. Also the threat system is totally broken. For some reason in my ""extreme low"" hostility sector I get constant pirate raids (and I do mean constant. Like... 30 seconds after beating the last one there's another).  Or a meteor impact. The ""game"" (if one can call it that anymore) has gone from a space colony sim to a constant crisis.But more fundamentally... the brig system doesn't work right, nor the tantrum system. So first the brig system: enemies can often get ""subdued"" where they just stand there endlessly until they starve. If you have a brig, you can store them there instead. There doesn't appear to be any reason to do this that I can see. There is no benefit. Its preferable to let enemies starve, especially because sometimes captured enemies lose their ""subdued"" flag and simply walk out of the brig to shoot up your base again. Seriously... WHAT IS THE POINT? Also... did you guys even test this release?? Its almost entirely unplayable.Okay so now to the tantrum system. Colonists can get freaked out, wreck the place up, and fight with fellow colonists. Yet for some reason this happens to happy colonists sometimes. I suppose one could say they ""just snap"" or something but... once again, what is the point of happiness if it doesn't do anything? Bigger problem is after a tantrumed colonist is subdued they lay there and nothing happens. Even if you have doctors on staff, they don't seem to treat the person like... laying there in the hallway injured. It appears that the primary role of doctors is simply corpse disposal, rather than anything doctor-y.If steam had a numeric rating system, I'd give this 1 of 5 stars. Its really abysmal and should never have been released with the numerous game-breaking bugs. At least it was playable before."

The game had the potential to become an enjoyable simulator, but fell short in so many ways.PROS:The graphics are decent.The sound is fitting for the game.Most of the astronauts are not human, they are alien, making for more interesting looking characters.CONS:The game is very repetitive. After only an hour of gameplay, all the messages are the same, all your residents are saying the same things, everyone behaves the same etc. The game is severely lacking in variety.The A.I. is brutally stupid. Your colony can die because your mechanic is to depressed to fix the oxygen generators, killing everyone.There is quite a limited amount of things to build. Once you build each type of room, all you can do is keep making the same things as more astronauts arrive. No matter what, the gameplay is boring after the first hour or so.There is a lot of waiting, even when you speed things up.When you encounter problems, there is a fixed solution to deal with them. It gets even more boring and repetitive when you are forced to do the same steps continuously as the game progresses.It all comes down to is repetitiveness and a loss of interest.

And I cannot say that I squandered 9 hours of my life by playing the game, in fact I even had a good time. However, I have already exhausted all game play possibilites and all the content within that time - twice. Thus, it is highly disappointing that the developers decided to quit developing the game any further and have hitted the emergency exit button as of financial miscalculations by jumping from Alpha to full release by adding a tutorial, objectives and granting access to the source code (which is actually nice but even this cannot whitewash the feeling that I have paid money for a broken promise).If you like management simulations (and space), I would recommend it only if it is on sale for 5-10€ / 10$.

The game is buggy and has extremely shallow gameplay.I played the early prototype of this game that I got with HumbleBundle's Amnesia Fortnight bundle, I liked it the concept but it was clearly in very early stages. Sadly, what we have now is not very different, even though the graphics have been improved.DoubleFine was looking to cash in on games like Prison Architect. They even said as much themselves. They got investors involved (and successfully paid them off with the huge volume of Steam customers) and then when it wasn't as hot as they wanted, they cut development, did some more sales to lure in a few more suckers and then pulled the plug. In that order.Most of the people who hadn't bought it yet were waiting for beta or full release, but DoubleFine wanted to make all their money up front. Their business model for this title depended on it, and it is a flawed and presumptuous business model that screws over the consumer.""Obviously, spending more money than we were making isn’t something we can afford to do forever."" - Tim SchaferConsidering that in traditional gave development the developer puts in all the work up front, making the investment in themselves to deliver a great product. In this case, we, the consumer took all the risk. And they took none, while never intended to deliver a full game if it wasn't a pre-release hit with a cult following. Does this sound like a sane sustainable business plan to you? Well, if it does, then congratulations your name is Tim. And Tim, we can't afford to keep spending money on products that never materialize.I own Prison Architect and its a much more complete game, I recommend getting that instead. It lacks the character and personality of DF-9 and the setting and style is radically different, but its clear that they share the same underlying concept."

That doesn't mean don't pay attention to it, just don't put your money into it at this juncture.  The AI pathing is questionable at best (space requirments for individuals to navigate around larger items within the base is different considering the dimensions available). AI would rather sleep then do a job you have assigned them to; AI get's stuck within a structure with no doors or other forms of escape after you ask them to build it.Way too many individuals ask to your base than you are obviously ready for (I had over 10 within the first 15-20 minutes in one play attempt).

Updates are slow and add to the backend with new features that increase complexity, but don't actually add content or meaningful gameplay in any way. Worse, the developers have completely removed the ""Future development plans"" backlog from their website with no explanation. This is to say nothing of the numerous game breaking bugs and brick-dumb AI which have survived for release after release.And yet I could deal with all of that if the game were fun to play... but it's not. Games like its inspiration, Dwarf Fortress, are fun because of their emergent gameplay - the stories and situations which unfold around you are completely unique to each playthrough, creating a different experience every time you play. This frankly isn't true in DF-9, at least in its current state. Fire up the game and start on a random map and you'll have built and encountered everything there is to see in around an hour; there's no point in starting a new game since the same story unfolds every time."

Unfortunately, it hasn't had a significant content upgrade since I initially saw it months ago on an Evening with Sips episode or short series.  What is in this game is a wide gamut of bugs combined with sheer stupidity when it comes to the AI, arguably the most important part of the game, and they screwed it up.Not being able to build rooms, place objects, or cancel construction orders without having to move the camera around until the game sees fit to finally let your commands go through was the most common bug, and it persisted in being terrible from the moment I tried to start building a base to my eventual giving up on the game.  Random events seem to pull from a pool of maybe 5 different things, the most frequent of which was a ship encounter that featured a squeal along the lines of ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! WE FINALLY FOUND YOU!!!!!!!!  WE'RE COMING ABOARD THIS INSTANT!"" to which no matter whether you select to allow them on or not, you are forced to take on additional crew members, all of which will be more of a liability than a help due to their universally crap skills.  This will culminate in your base having to constantly expand its oxygen suppliers and eventually even building a second reactor, just to provide for these new idiots while avoiding losing your valuable crew members to oxygen deprivation as the wastes of space use it all up.Oh, and if you want to expand your oxygen room to make space for more recyclers, or any room in fact, make sure you set the entire station to become builders.  Because when you have four builders dismantle a wall, immediately head back into the base to go to sleep, and refuse to build the floor in place of the wall you just tore down, your entire base will asphyxiate and your builders will sleep themselves to death, dooming the entire station.  Absolute rubbish prioritizing and programming.Do not buy this game.  Do not buy Early Access games.

I also really like the ideas the devs have.BUT and that is a huge but...... I purchased this game like a trillion years ago and hoped for updates. But there are just minor ones like nothing happened.I feel a bit ripped off, because in the state it is, it is not really playable. The AI is just dumb as hell and it gets really frustrating (the citizens are like lemmings).And after a short time you have done everything there is to do. I'd say after a 100 minutes you have seen everything and it gets to the point where you are just tweaking your base or you are eager to fight the trials caused by bugs. I really tried to befriend with this game the way it is but it just gets worse, because the unfinished state and slow development starts to aggravate me more and more.Also there are a lot of known bugs, but they fix them really late or never. Who knows? The devs prefer to remain silent about nearly everything. I just read something about “We’re nearing our goals and the complete state of the game is not far away”, so I decided to write this and warn everyone about this. The way it is, this game could be a free to play iPad thing. I'd pay about 4-7$ for this max, given that I wouldn't know what I know now.For all the people, who think I'm just being pessimistic:Look at their Website, or the updates here at Steam. It seems like they are releasing updates labeled as huge success, which are little more than some minor bug-fixes (or sometimes a bunch of new ones adding to the old ones).And you can't know whats to come, because the devs decided to delete the ""Future developement plans""-website, which is a huge issue for me and just another indicator, that this game is dead and light years from being finished."

I will definitely take another look once it gets further along in its development cycle but as of right now it doesn't have much that you can really do in it yet.It has various props that could do something in the future (like a reactor) but currently the only real bit of management you have to do is mining and a little building (plus the occassional raider). You can't fortify your defenses really nor can you customize the space station as much as I would expect from a building management game.I'd pass on this game until it gets more content and substance.

I decided to pay up and try it out.Well, it was still very broken. Aside from the known bugs that weren't resolved, the new ""mood system"" introduced some hugely game breaking bugs and it was hard to progress very far at all in the game without having to restart for one reason or another.I frustratingly put the game down for the weekend, and only played it a few more times until they ironed out some of the more severe mood bugs by 6e-f.Once those game breakers were (pretty much) out of the way, I was able to successfully establish a base and build it to fair size before wondering the inevitable.. ""okay, now what?"" of an unfinished sandbox game. The derelict ships provide a little interest, but can sometimes be a pain to deal with. The breaches could be a very fun aspect of the game, but instead balance issues make them either ridiculously easy, or painfully hard with no real explanation as to why one way or another.This lead me to decide (as I have done with other Early Access titles) to ""put the game down"" for a bit, and come back later when they have added some more content to make the game more interesting and challenging to play.It is now two weeks later, and the lead developer has stated that they will be finalizing this game and releasing 1.0 in a month.This is a woefully unfinished game that is severely lacking in content. While the idea and core features seem real enticing, the truth is there really isn't much at all to do and I dont see the developer adding that much more before actual release.If you would like a ""space base"" type game, I would suggest an alternative in Startopia. Yes, it's almost 15 years old, but its funny and entertaining and actually has goals and stuff to do.

It sufferes from some very serious flaws however.There is no real tutorial or guide. I had to go to the Wiki to figure out how to really get started. Part of this is not really knowing what to do and part is many of the things the game asks you to do are hidden about 4 menu layers down without telling you WHICH menu trees they are down. Once you know the trees, they make some sense but it is puzzling for new players.The menu options need A LOT of work. It is not easy to understand what you need to do or how to do it. After you suffer through a few bad games of learning how to build an airlock, life support and the associated gear it starts to become fun.  Having the bulk of what you need to do hidden under several menu levels makes the trree feel lop sided. If I wasn't building a floor or wall, I was forever going down additional menus.Once you get past the start, it gets fun. Until you get a larger crew. Even if you give everyone the job they love to do, build all the comfort items and have everything you possibly can, your crew still gets depressed and sad. The crew want to be assigned their own beds but keeping track of who has what bed for 60+ people is not easy. Add to that the new people who come in and the people who die to raiders (or suicide in space) and you never know who needs what. The interface is increadibly clunky in this aspect.There is no way to direct anyone other than security and even then sometimes they just don't respond to a beacon. Critical structures that need building will often be overlooked for unimportant ones, equipment will remian broken while an army of technicians ignore them to chat with each other in the bar. This means the simultaneous building of objects is either best avoided (to direct workers to where you want them) or thrown to chance if something important needs to be done. Maintainence is best done by changin all technicians to builders and then reclaiming (destroying) degrading equipment and rebuilding it. When raiders approach, there is no way to direct non-security personnel away from an area. To be able to direct a worker to a specific task is such a basic tool it is amazing it has been overlooked.There are some notifications (information) that should be alerts (clickable). What good is it warning me that I have an airlock somewhere I haven't built something in if you won't take me to it? This leaves you hunting down building errors, that may not be your fault, when it should be a simple click and fix.The AI is very stupid at times. Workers will starve to death while standing in front of a food dispensor. Builders will build themselves into a room and then suffocate because they can't get out. You can't even pull them out before they finish because you can't direct them.There is no screen rotation. Sometimes you will get missing floor tiles hidden behind walls. They may have been missed in construction, they may have come about from damage (fire, space debris). You can drop the walls most of the way but sometimes they can still hide. Being able to rotate the map would help this significantly.For something that borrows so much from RTS games, it is a game that fails to learn from lessons RTS games had to learn as they matured. As a result you get a game that could be (and at times is) increadibly fun but is severly hindered by its lack of basic features."

I leave my original early access review below, but the character AI is still atrocious, there is no way to prioritize building, the security is still slow to respond to threats, the characters are just too dumb to live (Hey, this robot killed this guy, so I'll just go over and grab his body while the robot is still around), it is finicky to find a starting spot as there is no rhyme or reason to the colony select screen, the tutorial doesn't tell you jack, the construction controls are non-intuitive, you can't rotate the screen so placement of some objects is difficult, the builders build things in a random fashion (see point about prioritizing above), the aliens are only different in appearance, no trading available with ships, I could go on and on. I was hoping for a better version of Startopia, but this game is nowhere near that level. Indeed, it still plays pretty much like an alpha, and can not seriously be considered a finished game. Especially a game with no on-going support. Do not buy.________________________________________________________________________________Spacebase DF-9 is a very very alpha game. The AI just simply is broken. Having your characters die because they are all standing around in one room instead of doing tasks is not fun at all, and watching one lone raider knock out/off half your station plus all your oxygen recyclers with no security moving to do jack about it is just infuriating.

While updates were few and far between, I hoped that the game would eventually evolve into something better and deeper. Both the development scope that they posted on their website, and the hard effort which they put into the design of the game reflected that this is what DoubleFine originally envisioned.Unfortunately, game development doesn't always go well, and DoubleFine now intend to release a game which when ""finished"" will be fun to play, but scant on features and not worth it's £19/$30 price tag in my opinion, considering there are deeper games (with a bit more content in them) in the same genre as SpaceBase which aren't priced as high, and that people may get more enjoyment from. This is why I can't recommend people buy it.SpaceBase will hopefully be playable in version 1.0 after much bug fixing, and I can imagine it being a small and decent strategy game which will be quite fun, but unfortunately won't have a lot to do in it. Maybe if you really enjoy the genre then you'll like the finished version of SpaceBase, but don't expect a lot of bang for your buck - I hope DoubleFine reduces the price before final release."

However now it's going to be released as 1.0 with no beta, from like 6 updates in alpha for a 25 dollar game of which it's no longer profitable to work on.

You guys should run to the power supply and oxigen tanks to fix them instead of running around like headless chickens!An other problem is the Sims part of the game.

Your colonists could very well die of asphyxiation if you forget to stop them from doing whatever they were doing-a faction-based territory system that barely works, where you could very well f--- up the enemy base if you just dismantle a wall or a door while they attempt to invade you. This causes strange bugs all around.-Limited space and resources, you mostly end up relying on the so-called enemy invasions to dismantle their clutter so you can have anything, at a later point in the game.It's an interesting micromanagement survival game, and a challenging one at that, but it became so buggy and out of control that I couldn't see myself play any longer each session.

The door graphics still has a bug where the doors are other graphics instead of doors. The way the power usage on base works is unblanced, hostiles can plow through your whole base in nothing flat, the illnesses are unblanced; frankly everything is unblanced. For a supposedly finished game it is terrible. Don't waste your money.EDIT: (9/23/14) Don't buy it. Just don't waste your money on it. The bugs are still there and pathfinding is still horrible, possibly worse than ever. I can't play more than 30 mins before I rage quit over some stupid bug that is seemingly never going to be fixed.I was very hopeful when I reviewed originally, but with the annoucement the game is leaving Early Access still as broken as it currently stands is extremely dissapointing. I will not be buying from this developer in Early Access ever again.Original (8/23/14):Each update it gets better, but it has some bad bugs in it. I play on Mac and for me the most annoying bug is that the door images are never doors sometimes they blink between a chickenhead in the shape of the door that should be there and nothing at all.In this game you run a spacebase that's constantly falling apart around your ears. If the workers aren't killing themselves the raiders will do it for them.Currently you can only play one game at a time. If you start over you lose the base you were building. You usually lose the base to something stupid before you get to the point you would want to start over anyway.Everything needs worked on. AI, pathfinding, how the spacewalkers handle their oxygen timelimits (they ignore them and die last I played), how often metors strike, how the bartender wants to eat which jams up everybody as they wait on the bartender to be served who can't serve himself (only fix I know is to change the bartender's job to nothing which unsticks everyone and then change him back until the next time), how the builders decide what to build next, just everything.The game looks promising and when it decides not to kill me within the first 15 mins of gameplay I usually can have fun until the door images being wrong get to me or raiders invade while the turrents do nothing and I get mad. I open it after an update, start a new base, play until I rage quit, and wait for the next update to try again.My suggestion is to put it on your wishlist and check it early next year. See if the bugs have been fixed and even then only buy on sale."

Here's why I decided not to (followed by what I like):At its current state (Alpha 6e) there are a few bugs I consider gamebreaking.1. When exploring a derelict that for various reasons doesn't refill it's oxygen, citizens will walk around and even go there (!) - like technicians wanting to fix something, botanists if there is a garden, etc - until the oxygen is low at which point they start running around panicked. With no way to add oxygen, they do this until they die, often wiping out most or all of my security crew, along with a couple of other idiots who went there.2. I can't seem to get them to calm down after throwing a tantrum. Most of the time, they wake up (or when they're released from the brig) and throw another. Rinse and repeat until someone kills them.3. Technicians are quite useless at their work (which goes for all citizens, really, but it's most noticeable with the technicians). It takes forever to fix something.4. (Related to 2) It's too damn hard keeping your crew happy. I just can't seem to do it, at all!Ok, so that's why I would not recommend the game at this point. If these things are fixed in a coming update, however, I would definitely recommend it! Here's why:I really like the challenge it is to build a base in space. Things like broken or incomplete walls are suddenly a major deal. It's fun with the research letting you get better and I like that there are derelicts appearing that you can explore. I see much promise in this game and think it can get really good once the team has had a chance to develope it a bit further."
,Not Recommended,246090,10952552,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Voiderest,I cannot recommend at this time. The two biggest problems are the citizen AI and zoning. The citizens do the dumbest things and there is no way to micro-manage them to do what they really need to do. On more than one occasion I have had people die because they wouldn't build a door or they'd take off their spacesuit in the unoxygenated. The zone system limits what you can do with your base. You can only put certain types of objects in certain zones. This means you can put a life support system in the same room as the bedroom or pub. This is a pain when you are just starting out and can't really afford to layout an entire space station.A lack of content is to be expected but these issues harm the gameplay.

There is often no update from the devs for weeks at a time and the 'monthly' updates when they do come, late, are small.I have totally given up playing the game as after a couple of hours you've been through the same repetative cycle of building, loosing everything and starting again twice or more. There are very few item/rooms to build. One of the things I really have a problem with at the moment is the rediculous way it handles breaches. I can remove a section of wall then watch the O2 level in the room slowly drop off over a minute or so. This makes dealing with raiders hard as the security are next to useless and you best option is decompression which doesn't work.I hope they get all this sorted, there is so much potential here for a great game. But its not worth buying now while even the very basics don't work. For now save your money, there are more bugs than working componants it seems and every belated update just introduces more.I'm going back to prison architect for now, if you want an alpha builder, thats where to invest your money right now.I have heard the team is only 3 people, considering the funding sales in this game has already brought it I have to wonder if this is true, then how much they really are behind it.

Disasters like space debris and raider invasions happen fairly often, but your civilians have almost no way of actually responding to them, unless you make them a security guard and give them a beacon. And even then, only about half of them will do what you say. Then sometimes they'll start suffocating in space, but they won't even attempt to head back inside the station. And if you order them back in (by sending them either to the infirmary or to a beacon), they'll take the most roundabout route possible and still die. Once, I sent a worker to tear apart a derelict for extra scrap, but when he got on, he took off his space suit, so when he removed the walls, he suffocated.I really want to like this game, I really, really do, but the A.I. needs to be fixed desperately. I'm talking priority 1, above all else. Either that or give the player some sort of option to order any worker (not just security guards) to different parts of the station at will. Honestly, I was enjoying it for the first 2 hours, but the last hour I was tearing my hair out as the terrible AI constantly killed off my best people.I realize this is still alpha, and I expected some bugs. But my gosh, I expected the AI to at least be somewhat competent. If you're going to release an alpha, DoubleFine, at least have the game be somewhat playable.I'm sure my feelings for this game will change later down the line, but honestly this alpha has left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.

One starts playing and within a period of time there will be a 'space debris strike' aimed at your balls.  This doesn't feel like randomness, it feels like designers clutching at introducing adversity.The other problem is that the AI in the game is suicidal at best.  While building structures they will seal themselves into rooms with no air, or no exits.  They will do stupid things such as ignore danger when someone is shooting at them while building or destroying structures.Also and finally the game's biggest problem of all is that there is no 'border.'  Enemies enter anywhere on the base by attacking in the faux-3d of the game's world.  This means that there is no safe area, no main gate or wall.  The bigger your base gets, the more likely you are to suffer an attack or air leak where you can't contain it and you'll lose half of your crew to something utterly stupid.All in all, I keep starting the game but then I quit in disgust and frustration,  I see what they are trying to do, but it just feels very unsatisfying and annoying to me.

While the page fully warns people that this is still in its alpha stages it should not have been allowed to until at least a better running beta. As of right now the game is computer destroyingly broken as there are multiple problems with the game.The Intro: As of right now there is not even a full bare bones intro to this game. While when first picking the area you will settle in you see multiple aspects in the upper right corner which mean nothing to you. However it does give the player some heads up after picking it what everything means. That is the only good thing I can say about the intro as is. The next second you are placed in space with three aliens and a pod which can be broken down for scrap and a few minutes of oxygen for each to try and figure out how to build a base. While I understand people hate the idea of tutorials that really drag on I would have preferred at least something to give me more information. My first time playing my entire crew died because instead of building as I instructed they mostly floated around space and then began to panic when their oxygen got low because no one worked.The AI: Ok… Day One: Garry’s Incident I feel is one of the best examples of bad AI… this nearly reaches the same level of incompetence. In order for a crew member to do anything you must assign a job and where they will be in regards to some of the jobs like mining and building. While that’s fine by itself the AI doesn’t know what to do often times. They will lounge about the base or flat out ignore build orders or security beacons for when intruders come in guns blazing or fires because… I have absolutely no idea. The AI is unresponsive and more lazy than helpful and I feel like this would have been aided greatly by being able to tell them what to do The Sims style but the AI of course has free will… the free will to walk around doing nothing while I have set up a build order for oxygen recyclers which they need to live while their oxygen quickly is used up.Building: There is barely any direction as to what to build when starting but common sense plays a part here. Of course they need oxygen, food, and a way for more resources and while all those work when the AI actually does their job… the rest is very lacking. There is no explanation as to why a pub, or a reactor, or really anything is important beyond just common sense guiding my actions to make me build them because, they are there so they must be useful. After all if they can make their own food they stop eating the same stuff from the food replicators. But again things don’t seem to need reactors for power or crew quarters, or fitness rooms, or a pub since things work without them. Again direction would be nice here and even diversity since for example there is only one air recycler, no better one.There is more I could go on about and while I love Double Fine… I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone until at EARLIEST its full release. But even then I would wait a few months if this is any indication of what the full game will be like."

I wish it were a good game that had potential?  Cuz I would love me a Sim Starbase game.Cons:☒  Very buggy user interface.  I commonly had to ""trick"" the game to build an item by building another and then canceling it before completing it in order to get it to build the second item (which is the item I wanted in the first place).  If items overlap, then it is impossible to click on one or more of the overlapped items.  (Say if you have a claim-territory flag that is overlapped by an oxygen generator.)☒  Obtuse needs and wants system.  My crew fights and kills each other, and I am never sure why without carefully inspecting each cluttered needs/wants screen for each crew member.☒  I've lost dozens of crew without even really knowing why.  The notification bar fills up with tons of ""XXXX needs medical attention"" and ""XXXX is dead"" messages before I can even react to whatever is putting my crew in danger.☒  Your first base is going to result in dead astronauts.  So will your second, third, fourth and likely fifth.  Margins are extremely thin at the beginning of the game, so if you screw up in the least (such as build a room too small to hold a refinery, without knowing how big that refinery is) you have to start over.  There is no way to undo or fix a build mistake, so if you make any at the critical first few minutes of the game, then kiss your space-butt goodbye.☒  Zoning system is clunky and requires you to build a special-purpose room to simply place one item.☒  Annoying fixed view that cannot be rotated, nor is there a ""fade behind"" effect when someone or something is behind another object, so it's easy to lose people or things.  This will likely never change either, because while the crew are rendered as 3D models, it's clear the walls and objects are static sprites, and if the devs didn't account for rotating views at this point in the dev cycle, they probably never will.☒  Overall quite buggy.  UI elements end up becoming corrupt, crew get stuck in rampaging loops and can never be subdued, miners will drop ore in the middle of space during a crisis and never pick it back up, etc.☒  Feels very unpolished, and like an early WIP.  Expected more progress for this game since the last time I looked at it (about a year ago)."

,Recommended,246090,23886235,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Cromulons,"I'm sure everyone knows this, but I must include it on my review. This game has been abandoned by the developers.The developers are also expecting modders to finish the game for them...but didn't make a workshop compatability...*facepalm*. Seriously devs? so at the moment, there are very few mods out there and they are scattered all over the internet, and google search is no help.However, there is a new mod called ""unoffical patch"" to fix some bugs and add some features. I recommend you download that mod or be greeted with bugs apocalypse.Now lets talk gameplay.I don't know what they normally call them, settlers? austronaut? pawn? I'll just name it ""people"".Unfortunately, you can't move your people, which can be very annoying when raiders are on sight.You can assign them up to 9 jobs, some people are more skilled on certain job and also enjoy/hate certain job.The jobs are;Builder: self explanatoryTechnician: maintain and fixes objectsMiner: self explanatorySecurity: shoot hostile enemy, and follow security beacon that you can set.Bartender: Tends the bar which increase happiness.Botanist: tends the garden.Scientist: Make researches to unlock things.Doctor: Heal and cure diseases/illnessJanitor: Clean corpsesUnassigned: defaultPeople have needs, and they can go up and down shown on a graph. I don't know what most of these does to the person.Duty, Social, Morale, Stuff, Energy, Hunger, Fun. Those are the 7 needs of a person.People also have ""thoughts"" that you can read. Some of them are about friends and enemy they made, an object they built, or even a certain doom they are about to encounter. Thoughts really define them and I enjoy pausing the game and reading them.They also have a nice hand drawn avatar so you know what they look like and perks, if they have low self esteem or they are anxious, etc.Each person really is different from the rest and it's amazing how much detail they have. It's ashamed this game is abandoned.Now let's talk about building.There are 13 rooms you can build, and they are;Airlock: In and out of the space stationLife Support: For placing Oxygen machineReactor: for powering the entire space stationRefinery: smelting rocks into matter (money)Residence: Build beds to increase population limitPub: increase happinessGarden: Grow foodFitness: gymResearch: build research table for scientistInfirmary: HospitalBrig: prisonCommand: Threat monitoringUnzoned: plain old roomEach of these rooms have certain objects that can only be placed on that room. All objects (and wall/floor) cost matter to build.Matter can be obtained by mining rocks and smelting it on a refinery machine.To build a room, you need to inclosed it with walls and floors. If a wall or a floor is destroyed, and a person is in that room, they will be sucked into the vacume of space and die.Walls/floors and objects can be destroyed from astroids and raiders.There are random encounter in the game.There are people that you can communicate with that randomly pops up (when they are near you).If you respond to their message, then you can either gain a person or be targeted by raiders.This is the risk you need to think about before accepting their calls.There are also an actual spaceship that shows in your game. You can either send your security (via security beacon) or leave it alone until it leaves the game.Spacebase DF9 had potentials, but its been abandon before it can even fly. I really wish someone would make a similar game. SOMEONE PLEASE!That being said, would I recommend this game? Not on full price. Buy this game when it's 90% on sale."

Not only that, but the biggest problem is it is extremely buggy I have constant cadets either standing still in space or dieing of oxygen when its nearly 100% oxygen full. The worst comes from the fact that the starting part of the game is the most annoying. 8 minutes of oxygen fly really fast and with the current bugs it makes it more of a stressful panic to ensure that you just build an oxygen recycler then instantly a refinery. The game doesnt exactly explain all of this so it is up to the player to figure it out all which, if you are experienced with a game like Dwarf fortress you will be able to adapt quite well however, if you are not then this game will just make you want to unistall it and think of how much you wasted on it.In short, Do not get this game until they decide to speed up its development and fix its issues or bring out new things that will make the game more enjoyable in its current state it is not exactly enjoyable and in my opinion, I bought this during a hype and they are using the alpha business model excuse which I do not like.

There is no posted schedule or hint at when updates can be expected. It feels like this game is on the back burner and a one man team is working on it.

For now though, its not worth $25 to support a game ending development, wait till the price drops or modders expand it enough."

It has a lot of things wrong with it, and the devs dumped it before finishing the game. BUT some modders have taken up the challenge of releasing patches for the game anyway using its source code, and so far they've been consistent in their releases.The most annoying thing about the game by far is how your station residents are incredibly sluggish when it comes to doing anything. I've had two starts where everyone suffocated in their space suits because they took a million years to actually get around to building oxygen recyclers when ordered, and another where everyone suffocated because they refused to build an airlock to actually get into the mini-station they'd just built. When you order a squad of security officers to move to an area with raiders in, it's a coin flip whether or not all of them will actually go there. I lost one citizen and one of my two officers to a raider attack when one of the officers decided to - I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not - stand around playing a handheld game instead of actually doing his job and shooting the raider that just killed someone.It's quite frustrating sometimes, but worth the whole 69p I paid for it.

Basic playability is barely functional.At a base level in games, you generally want to know what you can and can't do, and a certain amount of intuitiveness is necessary in UI elements.You cannot place objects on walls if they face ne/nw (Isometric view). You cannot rotate a camera despite the 3D models, I spent about five minutes confused thinking no surely you must be able to make it face the other way? Considering objects are NECESSARY in one room, to go into another, (Two spacesuits in a room, with an airlock, to move out) the only answer is making gigantic rooms or a ton of small rooms. The tutorial doesn't really tell you to do this, and while you can then retry, and do it ""right"", it sets the tone for the game. You won't be using your intellect or planning skills, you will learn that the game isn't capable of some things, and how to work around it. There is no space efficiency, which is one of the key ""fun"" things to do in a base building game.Learning is of course a key part of games and design, but they should be learning mechanics not limitations.In ten minutes I ran into several of these little ""Oh. You can't do that? Or am I doing it wrong?"".I bought it because it was DoubleFine and it DID NOT say it was early access. I checked if there would be updates, and it says sure there will be one more, and then development is done.

I was looking forward to the inhabitants becoming friends, getting married, having kids, etc. At the moment it seems the only relationship types are ""friend"" and ""enemy"".The random events seem limited to a debris pummeling your station, raiders arriving, and new recruits arriving. Debris is easily dealt with by installing a fire extinguisher in each room, raiders will leave if asked, and new recruits offer to stay no matter how poorly you're running your station.I bought this game expecting to build my very own Babylon 5 or Deep Space 9, but it simply isn't anywhere close to being there yet. I'm very much looking forward to new features and improvements, but at the moment I cannot recommend this game. I do think that will change in the future if the game lives up to the potential of its concept.Edit: Since I wrote this, Double Fine has announced that they're leaving this game an unfinished mess. Stay away. Far away. And boycott Double Fine."

Many bugs are fixed and there are quite a few new structures avalible.Unfortunately becuase Doublefine only released the Lua Scripting what can be done is very limited in nature and many aspects of the game are being rewritten from scratch to make them more eaisly worked with.I dont reccomend buying Spacebase DF-9yet. In time that will change but there still are better games out there like Startopia.Origional Review:I previously had a negative review of the early access for this game due to various bugs, quicks and gamebreaking issues. I went into 1.0 with the intent of  viewing the game as a clean slate and giving it a fair chance at a positive review.Unfortunately though nothing has changed.The AI is terrible, and incapable of even the most basic levels of prioritisation. Crew will get stuck behind objects which is a new issue for the game this sort of thing wasent a problem in previous alpha releases. The initial seed powering system is still buggy. I had to rebuild the room around it 3 times before it registered leaving me with very little resources left to actually continue my station. The predicted resource gains from mining is completely inaccurate. It gave me an estimate of around 1000 or so and i got maby 200. The event system is still stupidly unforgiving and 9 out of 10 new game attemps will fail because of massive ammounts of meteor showers hostile invaders or generally just incompetent AI.The only thing i can tell they did add was a tutorial that nobody wanted or needed. For all intents and purposes the description of the 1.0 update is nothing more than a lie, there have been no bugfixes, there is no new content.Do not buy this game. No matter how much of a fan of this genre you are this game is not worth the cost. Dont make the same mistakes myself and the rest of the community that bought into this project."

76561197972440888,Recommended,246090,28320630,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,leadmecca,"I like this game, simple, dumb.  It lacks a lot of items, randomized events, and it's most likely when you really need an action taken like saving an incapacitated crew member, or fight back against enemies you are going to lose.  That is pretty much it, three things you have to deal with.  Bad A.I. that are stupid and the events of ships coming and going being either new crew or raiders, that's all.This is, sort of worth the price but sort of not, since it still plays like alphaware (even fan-patched, you want to do that) If it's on sale like $4.99 (or free/bundled cheap/$1) I think it's worth just a few hours of play if you want a really dumb space simulator that is pretty much rogue-lite if you don't absolutely micro like a mo-fo against any early first 15 minute rage quits.  I followed all the hype and bad blood and finally sitting down with it, (had it for awhile) I really like it.  If there was one thing I'd like added it would be abit more control with your crew, rather then somewhat bad hit/miss pathfinding and que actions. Like at least make one crew promoted to Captain and you at least can do everything on your own seperately and remotely while everyone else just does their business.Like I said, it's a more unforgiving repetitive rogue-lite experience with either very bland gameplay or very frenetic broken attacks and your crew just being dumb.  It won't be this sim that is easy or, hey build a base with hundreds of items beautiful space life thing.  The gameplay is somewhat vapid, and a bit weak in a few areas but to me it was okay for what it is, regardless of any pie in the sky promises.  I've certainly played far worse games that cost more and games that truly are shovelware/abandonware.  It isn't going to be evil genius, or dwarves, or even rimworld.  It's okay for an unfinished game.  Believe me, there are much much worse out there.  Out of 5 I'd give this game a 3.  Out of 10, I'd give it a 5.  Out of 3 I'd give it a 1.5You send a guy to a derilict and he dies, go send a builder to vape a few walls and kill everything inside.  You got miners/builders outside about to be attacked, switch to guards.  Use the alarms/beacons.  Put sentry guns everywhere, build air/power and research.  Then build.  That's about it, build another base layout, then another base layout. Most of all, get this game as cheap as possible.  Not more then $4.99 and certainly $1 is a bargain for you to waste an hour or 2 just to see how rediculous your crew will act.  They will leave crew to die on the floor with broken knees no matter how many doctors you have, they will fly around outside and do like one action and return with 7 mins of oxygen.  When the crew does work it makes you happy, when they all leap out the airlock to die like lemmings... well... ya, it pisses you off."

Two years after its release, it remains littered with bugs that devastate its playability. I am reccommending it because for what it costs, I think you're getting your money's worth.This game is very screwy. You've been sent deep into the galaxy to help seed the remnants of human civilization throughout space after the fall of Earth. You're not alone, you get help from nearby strangers in similar situations. You never get to actually take control of anything though, the people do whatever they want and all you can do it provide some guidance. More often than not, succeeding involves less strategy and skill, but simply getting lucky.With that said, I've been having fun with it. There isn't a whole lot to the game. I really wish they would finish it, or perhaps publish it open source so we could develope it further, because it has enormous potential to be an exceptionally entertaining experience.If you get it, you're going to notice a few problems right away. There are almost no settings. I think you can basically turn the sound on or off and that's it. The game's artwork is quite simplistic and usually runs smoothly, but the HUD menues are overloaded with special effects and animations that will make your framerate drop to crap any time they open. Once you've done the tutorial level and are ready to actually play the game, you may spend more time just looking for a decent place on the galaxy map to build your base than the time you spend actually getting to play. The whole game then gets quite confounded by the mood mechanics. While there are things you can do to help people be happier, and I've had lots of happy folks in some of my bases, they all inevitably gravitate towards depression and then stop working and everything goes to crap and the oxygen runs out and they all suffocate.Once you get to that point, you discover that there is no way to actually loose the game! Even with everyone dead and your base in ruins, you can still get new people on random chance and continue playing, even though they are almost certainly doomed.The whole game is wacky that way. It makes a whole lot of no sense. But, still, it's fun, somehow. As long as you don't think abut it too hard or take it too seriously, building one base after another while being hounded by pirates and metoeor showers and ocasionally having some suicidal idiot walk out the wrong door and drift away into space can be pleasantly amusing. This is a game you can just relax with and generally expect to fail at every time you play."

The character of your citizens, the flavor of the room types and furnishings, the banter with incoming vessels.Bugginess aside, the game is still very incomplete.  It serves to give you a taste of what the finished game will be, but it wont satisfy.  For Alpha 3 though, it's in a pretty good place.But even ignoring it's alpha state, there are some issues with the design I find a bit lacking.  Issues I'm not sure will be resolved by the official launch.  For instance, there is no vertical building.  Your citizens can space walk in 3D, but you can only build in 2D.  There is also only one material to mine and build with.  Some of the other issues I could list off are relatively minor, or things that they're likely to address for RC.  But these two core design points are things that fundumentally narrow the experience, and it's not clear if they'll be resolved.Ultimatley I say wait, unless you want this sitting in your library and eyeing you until it's finished (and I'll probably update my review at that point just to be fair),"

Then a wave of attacks hit (they often come in threes within seconds of each other) and I took out the first two no sweat with my five man security team with a combined star rating of ~14 out of 25 (which is quite good). Then the last raider boarded all by himself, and killed my entire crew.I was boarded by the main antagonist of a space pirate anime apparently.I would have researched better weapons and armor, but my two man scientific team were busy trying to develop anti-viral air scrubbers to counter the relentless spread of disease.My entire population was 18. 5 Security, 2 Scientists, 1 Bartender, 2 Doctors, 1 Botanist, 4 Miners and 3 Builders. They were all busy non stop. Also, they were all assigned to professions that made them 'happy' and I had every accommodation in the game available to them in abundance, but they were all still sad/angry. I had only lost one crew member to a sudden chest bursting that I don't think could have been prevented.I really want to play this game. It is really fun up until that moment that it becomes overwhelmingly unfair and you lose three hours worth of work. Maybe they made the game so hard to compensate for the lack of content. Every so often something comes along and takes out 90% of your crew. Then you have to build back up, thus 'adding' more game play. Not fun.I give this game a 3/100. I'm going to give it one more try because I am stubborn, but I have no expectations other than a severe cussing fit."

My play time is more than what's shown as I play offline a lot.The idea was sound, and I really enjoyed the game when I first tried it.  Obviously, I expected more as time went on since the game was still in development.  I also understand that development takes a long time, and isn't exactly the smoothest ride, so after a while I uninstalled and just let it sit for a while.  Seeing it just get officially released, I decided to check in on it again and find that, really, not much has changed.  I'm disappointed in the scarcity of things to do - it's a game of ""build each facility, bam you're done"", when it comes down to it, like the tablet versions of city builders such as SimCity/Metropolis/Anno/etc.  Just not much to it.I don't recommend it simply because it's not worth playing more than once, and I'm not happy paying for something like that.  Even the most single-player of experiences I tend to come back to after a while, but SpaceBase didn't have anything to it that made me say ""yeah, I'll pick it back up after I play this or that"".  Not worth a buy, not worth the time, especially given how lackluster the support has been over the period it's been available."

Permadeath is not a bad idea, since a careful strategist can beat the game and build the 'perfect' base farely easy. BUT the game still has some minor bags (once my 5 guards squad was stuck running on a wall wile 1 intruder was destroying my life support systems, another time the guard with low oxigen in his spaceswit didnt want to follow my waypoint to safty and prefered to suffocate etc). If i had only one save, I would had abandon the game in the obavo acations, writing a rage review.BUT: I reguraly exit the game and copy-paste the two save files at another folder, so I can paste-overwrite them agan later, to properly handle buggy or annoying situations. That, made the game a really nice experience: A more casual Rimworld type of base building.I strongly recoment if you go on with SPacebase, to get the unoficial patch 1.08. It adds things in the game and helps for better control of the guards (really useful).So, I recomment the game, but since the publisher is not supporting it any more and community/freelances do the job instead, I am a bit sceptic about the 10 euro pricing... Check on some gamply videos and comunity feedback, and then deside if you would prefer to wait for a high discount before purchasing this actually good game.(ps.

But as of now i do not recommend the game it has been very bugy and alway lands up mysteriously without anything happening the floor disappears just one tile and everyone is flying out into space or i cant place a door down even when nothing is standing in the way or built in that location another issue is the fact that as i progress in the game getting a bigger space station i land up with 30 or more people and i have about a ton of oxygen recyclers all in good status but slowly the oxygen just drops and everyone suffocates but i check to see if oxygen recyclers have a range to wich they provide air but when i built another oxygen room in so many places the issue continued so that didnt seem to be the case and im really sorry developers about this rating but if you can fix these bugs you definetly have a thumbs up from me and probaly many others too pls fix thx and keep up the good work.

If you want to buy it for $1 (on sale) and hope that several years from now the playerbase mod team actually turns this into a working game, go for it.But don't say you weren't warned. I bought this for a $1 knowing what I was getting into and I can't say I'm disapointed simply because I wanted to poke around and see what all the negative hype has been about. And the reality is, this game can not be recommended with a good consience.All the potential for a good game is here and than you realize your content ends shortly after figuring out how the controls work. There's no campaign, the tutorial is laughably poor at even explaining the basics and the sandbox play (which is pretty much all that exists) is laughably short before it becomes an endless loop.You start with a random team of 3 with random skills in a random zone of space with random resources and (almost) random difficulty. You have some minor influence over how to skew the randomness (by choosing different zones of space); but in the end the only real choice you have is:pick a dangerous area or pick a non dangerous area (or rather: pick an area where you cant play because you die instantly or pick an area where nothing happens until later and than goes into an endless loop of the same easily defeated enemies)I don't know, I had some silly fun poking around with it for about an hour but there's just not much here and while I applaud the playerbase mod team for making an effort at improving the game I know full well that it could take years before there's enough fixes and content additions to make this game playable.I'll probably replay it for a few minutes every year or so just to see if they ever do anything with it.Edit: And I fell asleep listening to the music while playing, which is the only reason it looks like I have some hours of play time. Content was over in less than an hour. The rest of the listed play time was watching the spacebase like a fishbowl or sleeping with the music from the game playing."

76561197980711569,Recommended,246090,14117568,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,Prost,"A pretty fun, unfinished, Sims-meets-FTL.Started playing about a year ago, during early access. Have played the game as it developed, up until 'official release'.The theming and art of this game is excellent. It's cute without being saccharine, the dangers of space are presented realistically, which somehow feels acceptably couched within the hand-drawn avatars and cartoon 3d models. I love it.The game starts off viciously (excluding the tutorial), dropping your three spacefarers off in the blackness with a small pod of resources and 8 minutes of oxygen. Within those eight minutes, you have to build a small space station that can support a oxygen-producer, and an airlock.All my astronauts suffocated before I was able to do this, and it was excellent.The game presented me with such a challenge, I was glued, it was excellent. The first time I successfully got my guys into that little pocket of safety,I felt like that scene from Gravity.And thus ended the difficulty curve of Spacebase DF-9.From that point on out, excluding game-breaking bugs (to be addressed later), the game gets easier and easier. Your first foothold allows you to establish resource collection, you invest wisely, and eventually you have a thriving base of about 40 personnel, you've run out of local resources, and are colllecting recycled resources from passing derelicts.Some playthroughs got to be so easy, I'd just start building massive space-station shrines, or just interior hallways that stretch across space to the next resource deposit, because it was fun.Sometimes, I'd have enough surplus to just install double-walls around my entire station, so when boarders attempted their namesake, they'd just drill a entrance into the interior bulkhead.There are some minor issues I have with infrastructure, for instance, for oxygen, the recyclers produce oxygen that free-flows through the station, but aside from that, there's no real way to control it. Usually it's best to center the recyclers in the base, and build the other rooms off as spokes, but if you have say, a long hallway, the oxygen just ceases to flow down the hall, since it's 'range' is too far. The addition of oxygen ventilation, and power conduits, would be a much appreciate increase in control and complexity.This game had/has such potential, if well balanced and bug-fixed, but there are powers higher-up putting an end to that. Developer Double-Fine has recently seen a round of layoffs, shorty after CEO Tim Schaffer announced that production would cease on Spacebase DF-9. While I've not gone through the process of comparing Spacebase's credits with the current Double-Fine roster, the coincidence is certainly suspiscious. Double Fine, who since Brutal Legend have been relying on Kickstarter and Early Access to fund their products, may have found that charitable funds are not an effective way to bankroll game development.Regardless, the premature cessation of development on Spacebase has it's noticable effects. Massive, game-breaking bugs still exist, that completely ruin the expierence.For instance, technicians are tasked with repairing damaged or worn-down equipment around the base. At it's peak, I had around 20 assigned, and I typically ignore them, as they automatically prioritize things to repair.Instead, I'm focusing on the Marines I've send out to a derelict to clear any threats. Surprise, surprise, there's a xenomorph on this derelict, and I haven't committed enough troops to deal with it. As it chases the final doomed marine around the derelict, it's tail flicks a door, damaging it. I sigh as I watch the marine die to the monster, when I notice that there's movement elsewhere in the derelict.A conga-line of technicians stroll through the airlock, ready to fix the broken door. As the alien rears it's head on the first, I'm frantically trying to do anything I can to get them back into the main base. But it's too late. They're all panicked, and it's not like the game has any system to give independant commands to a single unit. I lose half of my base's population to bad AI. This is not a one-off; it has ended essentially all of my long-running playthroughs.Other bugs exist, such as the game having trouble determining what is and isn't space, which leads to things like units being sucked through an interior doorway into a bedroom, only to hover there, trapped, as if it were zero-gravity, until they starve. Or the fact that something about scientists causes them to almost immediately 'go insane' when assigned the position, causing them to run around fighting other crew, and breaking things.Some of these bugs may have been fixed since, but they were present in the game when it went 'Final', so I am writing about them here.I really, really like what this game could be, and maybe mods will get it there. You'll noticed I've 'Recommended' it on this review; while it's certainly one of the most ambivalent recommendations I've given for a game, it's entertaining and unique enough to definitely be worth playing.Get it on sale, though. And don't trust Double-Fine to not release another half-baked product... definitely wait until the next title is complete before putting cash down."

The game itself offers good game play and a decent UI, the tutorial is standard, does the job. The only thing that annoys me about this game is that although the features the game has are damn cool and entertaining (at least for 37 hourish ahaa) it had the potentially to become one of the best but sadly double-fine as per usual started as being active with the alpha community but did the inevitable thing they almost always seem to do and screwed everyone by being half arsed and essentially slapping a for sale sign on an alpha despite many things 'in the pipeline' so they claimed (including workshop compatibility which would have only made this game even more fun to play, more features, more control, more events and ultimately a better game).

They dont do what they must, fight for no reason and die for that reason. 10/10 simulator of why idiots must not be around base. Ppl jump off airlocks, fight fire with bare hands - that's raw spacebase.Anyway, you're building yourself a spacebase. From scratch. You need to get Air recyclers, beds, medical care, food and later - garden-made food. For all of that you use matter mined out of asteroid chuncks. Ppl have different skills and job preferences. Sometimes you gonna get raiders, sometimes - derelicts with raide/parasites/killbots. You also need to research new stuff in order to survive. And in the end - fight off massive raider attack.For great idea this game had, it's a shame that the game was never finished, but with fanpatch and other stuff game is quite funny and can test your wits and nerves.

,Recommended,246090,16661650,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,PCGNeurotic,"Spacebase DF9’s 2,859 “mostly negative” reviews (at the time of writing) are probably more a testament to Steam’s ubiquity as a content delivery tool than to the game’s own (very real) problems. And it does have problems, to be sure, but depending on your outlook and how much you pay for it, they’re not insurmountable.Its gameplay appears at first to be something along the lines of the legendary Dwarf Fortress, Mucky Foot’s 2001 classic Startopia, or Firefly Studios’  2003 Space Colony, but its flaws – the result of a suddenly-abandoned development process – make it play more like a Roguelike. Your rather nebulous goal is to re-populate the galaxy by building endless space stations, staffing them with an ever-increasing supply of wandering space travellers and keeping them happy and safe from weird diseases, bloodthirsty raiders and each other. Material for building comes from mining asteroids or disassembling passing wrecks and derelicts, and your rooms and corridors are built and then assigned different uses – residential, life support, various social, scientific and utilitarian functions. There’s a strong people-management aspect too, as each new arrival at your base can be assigned to one of eight different duties, each of which will make them feel varying degrees of satisfaction or frustration, and each of which they’ll be good or bad at according to a 1-5 star system. In all respects, the UI is super friendly and makes juggling your people as easy as possible. Which is great, because you can eventually build gigantic structures with literally dozens and dozens and dozens of crewmembers. Crucially though, you have almost zero direct control over your people. You can only order them to report to the infirmary if they’re injured, and even then it may take them a while to limp their way over.At first, as you learn the ropes, each new game comes hard and fast. Death comes as a result of being ill-prepared to research a disease cure, or not having sufficient defences against a surprise Raider attack, or for any one of dozens of interestingly unfortunate and unforeseeable reasons (usually often as funny as they are frustrating). But the actual process of making your space stations is so much fun that the urge to immediately try again keeps you clicking, again and again, learning more and more each time, developing and abandoning new ideas and strategies as you go. Spacebase DF 9 is very much one of those Civ/Morrowind-type games that suck the hours out of your life without you realising. Be prepared for some really late nights if you decide to have ‘just one quick go’ before bedtime.Adding to this feeling is the game’s own save system, which by default consists of toggle-able silent autosaves and a Save and Quit menu option. Like a psychopathic lover, Spacebase DF9 doesn’t want you to be anywhere other than inside it, grinding at full speed. Played like this, the feeling is very much of a  Roguelike’s ‘one life, one death’ trip, and all of this helps mitigate the pain of being screwed by one of the game’s terrible bugs or imbalances.Yes, they are quite terrible, unfortunately. But in the twenty hours that I’ve played it so far, the problems have been all about imbalance and lack of tweaking, rather than outright bugs. One of the worst of these is the fact that the guns on enemy ships, once they’ve boarded you, remain ‘hostile’ even after you’ve killed or captured the invaders (sometimes they can even be reformed and will join your crew to start a new life), or claimed their ship as your own. Only by eventually disassembling enough of the enemy ship will you be able to cut off power to the gun, thus making it safe. But getting to the bloody thing can be a real game-breaker – these defensive turrets have great range and cut through people in spacesuits like a lightsabre through yogurt. It’s at times like these that the lack of direct control over your spacemen becomes a real tooth-grinder, and you can end up with piles and piles of floating corpses made up of the Builders who foolishly crossed in front of the guns to get behind them (in space, the AI paths in direct lines from point-to-point), as well as the Doctors who went to retrieve their corpses.As far as imbalance in the invisible numbers, the worst offender is the near-constant brawling that goes on. At best this leads to a trip to the brig to cool off for the aggressor and a trip to the infirmary for the victim. At worst, guns will be drawn, and people and facilities start falling. In-fighting is a result of a brilliant system of cabin fever that is determined by various things, including job satisfaction and a host of actual personal feelings and emotions, all of which can be monitored on the crew’s individual profiles. Assigning two people who hate each other to a double cabin is a recipe for disaster, while the sight of bloody corpses littering the place has an obvious impact on depression (especially if the deceased was someone’s friend). But again, due to the abruptly aborted development process, it’s one of several crucial, glaringly imbalanced systems. Which, unless Double Fine release the source code, as they’ve promised to but still not yet done, may never be properly sorted out. This is doubly frustrating because a lua-based modding system is present and correct, but so far nobody’s done anything with it.Like the similarly blighted and similarly great fun Aliens: Colonial Marines, it’s a game with a bad reputation that in reality is only partially deserved. Early adopters and those who saw the potential for a Dwarf Fortress in space have every right to be annoyed (and to make those thousands of “negative” Steam reviews). But for those of us coming to the game in its ‘finished’ state, and aware of the lingering problems, there is still much fun to be had. Double Fine’s original plan for the game was hugely ambitious, ultimately requiring much more funding than they could successfully raise for it (hence the truncated development). It was only unfortunate that they had already taken it well into the Early Access phase at USD 20 a pop before they realised this. But that’s one of the risks of public alphas, crowdfunding and transparent game development. Like condoms, no one's happy when they go wrong.If we’re looking at it in financial terms, then in my case I bought it in the 2015 Steam summer sale at -50%, or EUR 4.99, and have played it now for nearly 21 hours. My feeling is that I’ve had at least 20 Euros of fun from it, and that’s quite important. With some AAA titles costing nearly 60 Euro-dollarpounds and offering dozens of hours of gameplay, but failing to deliver even half as much fun, for a flawed gem like Spacebase DF9 to give you that elusive feeling of true, full-belly satisfaction is, I think, quite a feat."

I really wish someone would finish this though, it was really fun.I recommend this game because I believe in Double Fine and really want it to work out. I played the super early super basic demo a long time ago and it's came a long way from that, but still has a lot to go. At this point in early access, you're paying to help support the game's creation as well as beta testing it. There's a lot that needs work, but you can see where it's going.Some very weird things that happened:-A room got hit with a meteor, caught on fire, and they would just kind of use the room normally. I thought ok, I'll put a fire extinguisher in there. The guy walks into the fire, builds the extinguisher, walks out, room stayed ablaze until I quit for the night. They would seriously walk in, use the console to research something, and walk out. Hilarious, but buggy.-Ships would dock with mine, then nothing would happen. Nobody would come from the ship, nobody would go into the ship. Nothing. One time one of my people had a panic attack and ran into all the rooms of the docked ship that allowed me to claim them, but there was nothing in there.-I had to rezone the Brig to something else so prisoners would maybe leave there and get food instead of starving to death.-I had an incapacitated invader just kind of chill out in my main room doing nothing. I eventually forced the cop to put him in the brig where he slowly converted to being a member of society, but couldn't figure out how to unbrig him so he also slowly starved to death. Added food processor in the brig, they kind of just decided death was better, and died.I mean really? Those are bugs, but they're also pretty hilarious. I'm backing this game because it's fun, even in it's buggy state, and I believe Double Fine will hammer this stuff out."

,Recommended,246090,14894858,"Posted: 14 March, 2015",all,Jetpack John,"Going against most of the people here, it seems, I think DF-9 should get a generally positive review.So you know where my view comes from: I bought this game early in alpha because I had a DF coupon, but I rarely play early EA games.  Aside from a quick try in alpha, I have only played the current 1.06.  I also rarely look in the forums, so perhaps I'm less angry than some.  :)Bottom line: if you enjoy city/base/island-building sandbox games, you will enjoy this.I found exploring the game after a minimal tutorial enjoyable.  I had several false-starts and refined my base layout as I went.  Lost one decent early base when I learned the difference between tear down and vaporize: when removing a section of wall, vaporize removes everything including the floor.  Everybody was blown out before it could be repaired.The graphics and animation quality are quite nice as are most of the sound effects.  The user interface is also easy to use in most cases.  It has a few issues when it comes to placing objects, especially ones that go on walls.  Even though they might be hard to see sometimes, the game does not allow you to use the south-east and -west walls interior (hidden) side for object placement.  Turrets are one of the few items that can face in any direction and it can be difficult to place the turrent as it will jump from wall to wall.  There needs to be a manual method to move the selection tile-by-tile.  It matters where the turret's cone of fire reaches.The AI is perhaps not superb, but so far I haven't had any serious issues with it.  At least, not yet.  Pathfinding seems okay, as long as your base isn't riddled with paths because of doors everywhere.  Picking/keeping a good crew goes along way towards avoiding frustration.  You should also invest some time in keeping them happy.  It can be difficult sometimes, but all of the information you need it given in their tabs.Sometimes, though, the AI will do something really stupid or annoying.  Like avoiding the conveniently placed fire extinguisher in the hallway and trying to stamp out the fire.  It seems as though the extinguisher must be within the room on fire.Of course, sometimes it helps to discover or know the AI's priorities.  With builders, for example, it's rather easy to observe their work, or lack of it, and to figure out what they prioritize.  They tend to prefer building floors before walls, and walls before any indoor work, and so on.  So, if you have a room built and while waiting for it to be filled you plan on a new hallway, the builders will drop their indoor work and go add that new section of hull first.The game's biggest flaw, by far, then is the lack of depth.  Except for the residence and pub areas, every room has only a very small number of objects that you can place in it.  Researching does not alleviate this problem as you really just get upgraded versions of an object or an upgraded replacement model.  That's not bad, but it would be nice to have a number of topics to research (maybe based on your contact with alien visitors) that would give you new objects to use in rooms or maybe even a new room type.This lack of depth and seeming lack of forward progression after a point seem to be the primary reasons other posters give for giving the game a thumbs down.  These really impact the length of play and replayability more than they do playability, however.If the poor description of the game that I've given sounds like a genre that you enjoy, you'll definitely have some fun playing.  For how long I think largerly depends on how much you like exploring the mechanics of the game while you learn to play.  Experimenting with various base layouts for efficiency reasons or asthetics also adds some time and depth.Whatever the reason for DF ceasing development, it seems pretty clear that what has been delivered is a*platform*for a game.  But, of course, they were supposed to deliver a game.  Fortunately, the platform seems to be robust and moddable and even as-is provides a good amount of fun.Judging by DF's last announcement, I doubt we'll be seeing anything more from them.  I choose to be optimistic about the game's future, though.  The quality of what they've open sourced appears good enough that I think the mod community will add a lot to the game in time.  I wish DF hadn't dropped it, but they did and there are far worse states they could have left it in.The game does provide some long term objectives conveniently located under the ""Goals"" tab of the main HUD.  They are more like milestones, however, such as getting X number of crew, surviving the Mega Fleet, or killing X number of raiders.Finally, price:  It's definitely not worth full price given the lack of depth.  I would pay anywhere between $5 and $10 for it and feel that I got my money's worth.If you're looking for similar games, I would certainly recommend either Startopia or Evil Genius.  Startopia doesn't let you build the base, but you fill it and manage the station.  It came out some years back so it runs great on most any machine and it's a lot of fun.  Evil Genius has you building a base in your island mountain hideout.  You get to design the whole layout, rooms and hallways, similar to base building in DF-9.  Evil Genius has a lot of depth as you take on nefarious missions or as you build booby traps into your base to catch unwitting good guys.I hope this provides a sufficiently objective view of the game.  Keep in mind that I'm still playing and making ever larger bases, so it's possible that there are some issues I've yet to encounter because my population hasn't been large enough."

It shows how you can assing characters to specific jobs and accumulate ressources, manage characters mood, set up different rooms that serve different functions and so on.  There is only so much you can do for now and once you've set up a good base, you can pretty much wait it out forever so there's no real interest.But the alpha game does an excellent job at demonstrating how rock solid the core elements are. Everything is intuitive, characters do what they're told, unexpected roguelike events come to break the monotony and the game already has a certain charm to it. Given how the basic elements are so well done and so stable, it's easy to see the potential of the game, they can add layers upon layers of features in futur updates and their roadmap is in fact already impressive.I can see that game becomming very complex in the future and each base you build could be very different from one another. Here's an interesting idea, at some point, why not give each base you build some kind of purpose or mission to accomplish and give members of the crew some kind of personnality system od background stories and random events. That way players could make their own little stories with character having romance or hatred or jealousy or mutiny or aliance and friendship and brotherhood and so on."

It has a good ways to go, no question, but with the regular updates the author has been doing (every month and a half or so) plus his response in fixing the major bugs themselves, the game is obviously being supported and actively developed.In short - if you can sit and watch an ant-farm (yes, I can... dunno why, but I can) like any other sim game, you'll be OK with this.

With version 1.0 on the way and a general air of abandonment from DF, I'm less keen to recommend this. I still load it up now and again and lament the missed opportunity...================I'm offering up a cautious recommendation here. This game is very promising, while still being far from a complete experience in its current state (Alpha 5d). I bought it on the strength of it being made by Double Fine, who I think have a habit of putting out some really fun games. The recommendation is partially based on their reputation.As other reviewers have mentioned, the UI is great and the overall aesthetic brings to mind 70s/ 80s SF such as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or Dark Star. Having said that, the devs should really set about implementing some goal-based gameplay soon enough. It seems an odd move to put it out in its current state since there's not the level of freedom for it to act simply as a light space survival sim. There isn't really enough depth at the moment for the player to come up with their own objectives beyond not dying for long enough to build a space-pub. In its current state it looks like you can try out all the space- decor and experience the space- mining and space- pirates in a fairly short stretch of time. Basically, I love the content so far and I'd like there to be more.I really hope there is continued support and funding on this project. There have been a few negative reviews on Steam but most people acknowledge the potential here.

The result is a really fascinating environment where the player spends as much (maybe more) time observing than controlling.

If you answered yes to two of the previous questions you should check out Spacebase DF-9. Even though this is an Early Access Game there is still enough playability and fun in it to occupy hours of your life.Basically you build a space station or as the name suggests a Spacebase. You do this by laying out rooms and zoning them for specific tasks. At first you'll need an airlock and a life support system so that your virtual Spacebase residents can breath. As you play, you'll discover that you need to expand, and that takes resources. You'll need to build more rooms and different types of zones to make your Spacebase function. Things like refineries, sleeping quarters and pubs. Yes, they have pubs in space.To add to the gameplay each of your Spacebase residents has his or her special skill set. You need to assign them tasks based on their individual skills or train them in new ones, if you wish. As they get better at their tasks the station starts to hum along nicely. As you progress, you'll discover that the natives get restless and you'll need to attend to their complaints and unhappiness by building new rooms or maybe mixing up their work routine.All that is enough to keep you busy, but there is more. Every now and again a spaceship will pass by. They can be friendly folk and join your Spacebase or they can be your worst day in space. Sometimes you can weasel your way out of sticky situations but eventually something is going to rain on your Spacebase. You'll need to prepare for that eventuality and defend your Spacebase if you want to hold onto it.This is an Early Access Game and it’s in Alpha 4b as of this writing. Even so, there is plenty of fun to be had with this game. Double Fine Productions, the developer, is actively releasing updates. They are shooting for updates on a monthly basis and that’s good.Now I don’t want to mislead you. I’m having a ton of fun with this game, but it is and Early Access Game and it’s still in Alpha. That means it’s not for everyone. The game isn’t finished. It’s not even close to finished. It’s Alpha. Don’t buy this game expecting a polished game. Even if you have Beta tested before, keep in mind that this is pre-beta.That said, this game promises to be something extremely fun to play. If you want to be in on the ground floor and watch, as well as give feedback, as the game develops then you should definitely pick up a copy of Spacebase DF-9. It’s okay, the waters warm, jump in.

I am glad I got SpaceBase DF-9 on sale for about ten bucks, but it is definitely not worth twenty. I suggest waiting for it to go on sale if you want to try it out.In SpaceBase DF-9, there's no micro-managing. The A.I. take on a life of their own once you give them a task so it can get rather frustrating. And most of them are very, very moody, which affect their work ethic severely (ugh). They're fairly stupid at their current stage of development, so you can expect to lose a base very quickly - regardless of whether you're playing the game correctly or not. And if your base doesn't fall apart right away, it will eventually. It takes quite a while to understand how each A.I. functions (due to their personalities) and how to work around them.Even with all that said, it's a very fun game. I have fun, anyway.

While building walls and floors still seems to be prioritized above everything else, tear down or vaporizing unused areas is still prioritized above building other objects. I'd love to see a queue that I can prioritize, but failing that, at least making tear down/vaporizing last in the priority list would be an improvement. Even better than that would be only deprioritizing those tasks if they're part of unclaimed structures.Some other issues I've noticed:- Occasionally people will get stuck in airlocks and eventually suffocate- There are sometimes odd placement issues with room objects randomly getting removed from the building queue, or sometimes not being able to place an object in a place that you should. I've had this happen with research consoles, beds, and rugs--------------------------------------Original Review--------------------------------------This looks promising, but in its current state, is not very fun to play. Most of the issues center around not-very-effective AI:- In order to keep your base functioning, you need technicians to keep all the systems in repair. However, the technician AI is TERRIBLE, and there's no way to force a technician to repair a specific machine. The only way I've been able to play is to keep my base relatively small. Once a hostile docks with my station and as a result, adds more machines, it's an unrecoverable downhill slide to all machines eventually breaking down, no matter how many technicians I add. I've also seen my technicians attempting to repair broken machinery in areas I'm deconstructing, which is a huge waste of time.- Your citizens need to eat. They also need to sleep. If they go to the bar to eat or drink, and the bartender isn't on duty, they'll wait until he is. Even if the bartender is, himself, waiting to eat or drink. The bartenders will not serve themselves, nor is there any sort of timer that allows them to give up and move on to do something else. There's also no way to force a bartender to go on duty. When your citizens get stuck waiting on food, it makes it very easy to start a downward spiral (especially for technicians) since they obviously aren't doing their jobs if they're waiting for food.- Defending against intruders is incredibly unreliable. From what I can tell, you're supposed to assign citizens to security duty, and use a beacon to make them congregate in a specific area, either to explore or defend against intruders. In practice, they seem to take an ""I'll get to it when I'll get to it"" attitude, even when their comrades are getting gunned down around them.- Sequencing building instructions is irritating - things seem to happen only in the order you enter them in - once you put in a request, there's no way to prioritize it against other requests, except to erase it and do it again, effectively putting it at the end of the queue. The exception seems to be building walls - those seem to get built before anything else.- Citizens coming in and out of airlocks will occasionally kill their comrades by an ill-timed depressurizationGiven this is an alpha, I'm guessing/hoping these issues will be smoothed out, but as it stands, it is more frustrating to play than enjoyable."

Once you build the rooms that are availabe you are done.  Add goals:  Build a docking station to get an economy going, Build warp gates/black holes for travel and trade.

Random Debris fields are not really a challenge.  Add a couple of fire extenguishers and you can over come them.5. Infirmary is useless.

However, the bar only serves food from crops which are taken from a garden. those crops are grown in a differnt room and need their own staff to manage.

First game, I ran out of minerals before I built my refinery.  Whoops.  Second game my guys finished the building, but then wouldn't enter it, despite everything being apparently in order.

While no walls or floor were visibly damaged, the oxygen dropped to 0% and everyone died.I can't say the game is just flat out broken, but it sure feels like it.That being said, the potential is there... they just need to get this out of alpha.

The game also currently lacks any tutorial content, so you'll need to learn by playing or look for outside information.  There is enough there to enjoy, although after a few hours you'll probably reach the end of what's available and need to restart keep it from getting boring.There is minimal micro-management options available in the game (you can assign jobs to people and tell them to go to the infirmary), so you need to be careful how much work you queue up since there is no way to prioritise it.  There are other mechanics that don't work so well, such as sending security personel to derelict bases to investigate: the bases always seemed to be hostile and I would end up with some of my people dying.  I found it easier to deal with these bases by getting a builder to knock holes in a few walls to vent the atmosphere first.You can already see some of the humour that Double Fine is known for.  Each person has a SpaceFace feed where they make notes about their day.  There is humour in some of the game mechanics, such as doctors getting rid of the dead bodies in the same matter refineries used by the miners.It'll be interesting to see how the game develops."

The game it self has left early alpha and has became a full game already, now i will emit this game could of been worked on alot more then it currently is. The game many 'preset' areas that you can pick from, but each area is actually randomized as to how it's looked. i played in the same area two times before and the asteriods was layed out different, i had different encounters and much more.Now alot of people are non-recommending this game simply because they don't see it being complete. now i do slightly agree there, but there is alot in this game you have to spend time playing to actually find. one example would be there is more research than the ones you can get at the begining once you build a research lab. Random data cores can spawn with derelict ships which have random chances to apear. so you could get a late game research earily on or just get a low grade research.When double fine released this into full game, they had said it wasn't to the level they wanted, they wanted to do so much more with this game but they wasn't able to do it. So instead of just scrapping the game entire like some people believe they've done. They have actually given it to us... to the people of the modding community to create things for it that they would like to have seen in it. Many games have been made alot better thanks to the modding community, games that have had more things than this one even. Yet Double Fine has still been doing updates to the game to balance the game and less bugs to the game.As for actually gameplay, the game runs fairly smooth and there use to be many annoying things that happened in the game. But the game does have random generation, so you wont have the same game twice. one game you could have an entirely peacefull game, never running into Raiders, or Aliens let alone other things. while one game you could get hit near the begining and get slaughtered, Which this is slightly factored by your chosen start location, for some has more likely hood of one thing than another would. Example: One section has tons of asteriods and rare encounters, while another has medium asteriods and very common encounters.all in all, i actually believe it's a good Space Station Building simulation game, that many people wouldn't of thought to make, the only real bad thing of this game is the Ai i will emit mainy on the builders, if you want to remove spot in a room or anything be prepared for massive pausing and quick selection, for they will try to kill them selves at times, though i have never had to unbuild anything, because i never seen a reason to do so unless i was doubling a room, which was easy to save my builders. If You think when placing security markers that something is wrong and your security isn't going to the location, it's because either 1. their asleep. (you can't wake them up you gotta let them sleep for as long as they wish). 2. you actually don't have any (pay attention to the jobs you assign) or 3. There is no phyiscal way for them to reach the location.I will emit this is the first time i've done a review for any game, but i believed i needed to after seeing so many negative reviews that was for reasons that in my opinion didn't fit as a good full on review of the game. This game is still a nice game to play on the side, and in my opinion once the modding community actually starts making mods and more if they haven't already, this game could become even more interesting just like Double Fine is trusting us to do.i personally would rate the game, but i'm not good at picking right numbers to what i feel it should be, it's not a game you'll want to just spend hours apon hours playing, though sometimes when you start you'll get a bit addicted.. untill your space station is killed and you rage. but you can't live forever."

I know this, so either take note of my review or shut up.For those who actually want to read my review, I say in short this game is good if you like base management, but buy it on a ridiculous sale.The last game I played that could be compared to this is Prison Architect, so I'll compare to that. This game has its ups and downs, but I found that Prison Architect became a bit stale after a while; build fast at the start, expand for new prisoners, work on efficiency. Rinse and Repeat. Not that it wasn't good, but that's the gist of it.Spacebase Df-9 on the other hand, was a somewhat evolving base management, and a bit of tower defence thrown in when raiders visit too. Once you get the hang of it, you need to constantly adapt your base to make room for new people, keep up with the component decay and so on. One of the hardest bits (albeit interesting) I found was defending against multiple raiders. If you can manage to defeat the raiders, you're then left with a depressed crew (that don't want to work) that needs to repair the remains of the station and hold out until more people show up... or more raiders.I honestly haven't seen any game breaking bugs yet (touch wood!). Bodies stick around for ages, but with enough doctors they get moved over time. Components decay rapidly, but with the right balance you can keep them in check until you research better things. And yes, research takes ages too, but it's helpful if you're around long enough to finish it.All in all, it can be problematic, and there are plenty of issues people have talked about, but with patience and taking the time to learn the game, it can be pretty fun. Maybe a 7/10 from me, buy it on a very good sale."

If you're not interested, then maybe go buy psychonauts or one of their other bigger games as those are superb.I got it when it was on sale, and my persistent habit of bothering to speak in places where what I have to say has gone unsaid means I am going to get downvoted horribly by those same loons.Gamergaters, you're on the losing side :)"
76561198325245237,Recommended,246090,28662138,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,menubar,"This game gets an 8/10 from me. It's a really relaxing game when taken for what it is. I am reviewing it as version 1.06 Mac OSX no mods installed. I had a free version for months before finding it on steam for 99¢ and just had to buy it to encourage the developers just a little bit with my tiny contribution. I would easily pay $5 bucks for it.You're basically thrown into space, given 3 guys and very little resources to start building your space base. In the beginning you need to start as small as possible, building just the bare necessities. Once you have a small (3x3) airlock room, another room just large enough to hold 3 oxygen recyclers, and a room just large enough for a matter refinery, the rest is a piece of cake.The game is 90% relaxing, mining and building, welcoming new (weird & silly) inhabitants, and pretty much trying to keep everyone fed, breathing, and happy - or as happy as one can be in a fragile domicile in space. You need to begin early considering how to protect your base from bad guys that pop in periodically, and asteroid impact damages.Aside from the few (easy) dangers, it's just a relaxing sandbox style building game where you can be creative in making a space base to be proud of. The interface is pretty much well organized, which is an aspect that many games like this get wrong. I enjoy the weird types of characters/aliens and their thoughts and interactions.Many people complain about the AI being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but you have to pay attention to what each character is good or bad at and by what degree they would suck at a job. You have to assign them to duties they are good at and actually enjoy doing. Some are good at a job, but hate doing it, so yeah, they'll stand around playing games on their pads instead of doing any work, unless you assign them to a duty they enjoy. I find this aspect completely adorable, as it really adds to the immersion and how you feel or care for each individual. I also love the names - imagining how an alien would pronounce his name written as ""Uneekly (nicely)"" - that sorta thing.It's currently (for the past several months) been my favorite game for when I just want to relax and make a creative little space base. The few, easy dangers add just enough of that random aspect to keep you on your toes and influence the shape and direction your base takes. Have lots of good tech guys and your base will run smoothly - put lotsa gun turrets all around the outside walls and you'll be safe enough to survive a large attack that eventually happens. And just have fun building and watching how your inhabitants get along.My only complaint is - once you get a VERY LARGE base, things go bad fast. Machines start failing, catching on fire, destroying themselves everywhere, no matter how many techs you have to fix them. But I guess this is just a sign that I've gone way too far with this base and should just start a new one, haha.Lotsa people be hatin' on it, but it's been one of my favorite, relaxing games that I keep going back to."

All they talk about is how double fine abandoned spacebase DF-9 (which is true, but that doesn't really qualify as a reason for bad reviews.). Honestly, the gameplay here is a bit glitchy (a doctor carries away a dead body but still shows corpse, etc.), but I myself enjoyed this game (until I moved on to other games), mostly because It looked somewhat like prison architect, but less just spamming the HIRE A GUARD! button (not that I own that game, but I have played once or twice, and thats where a lot of my time went) and more problems to take care of. Now, onto the gameplay besides the prison architect style building stuff. 1: more controlled problems. In pris. arch., all you really need to worry about is food. Here you have emotions, job liking, oxygen, sleep, and nothing more that I can remember. 2: uncontrollable problems: in prison arch., you have riots. Here, you have brawls, meteor strikes, fires, betrayals, parasites and raiders. nuf' said. I like this game, so I hope you read this actually sensible review, and buy spacebase DF-9."

So as It is now I really enjoy the game, with no bias of previously reading dev posts of false promises and what could have been. What it is right now is a modern version of a god game where your in space.... think dwarf fortress meets the sims with a dash of spacestation sim. It does have its bugs and it is a shame that they still exist in the full 1.0 release but I am confident they will patch the problems over time.As for everyone being hurt by how the devs represented themselves, the game, and double fine, (after reading the many reviews on this game) It really does suck.

However it is still lacking. The base building is a little hard to get used to but works well, there are no clear markings for what does what when you try to build an item. No way to move items you place. Lots of bugs including: engineers don't like to repair things. all your oxygen recyclers can be at 0% and they wont bother with it (same with doors) until it explodes half the time. For so reason security officers wont move to the beacons you place, but when they do they usually go outside under the base at the spot the beacon was placed instead of inside so it's VERY hard to defend your base. Works wont work half the time. Lastly in regards to bugs my middle room for no reason what so ever went down to 40% O2 and all my guys got stuck in the room next to the air lock (which had 70% O2). So I quite and came back hoping that would fix the bug, and every single room suddenly went to 0% O2 and half the people were already dead. the other 98% suffocated. saved and went back now my rooms are back to 98% O2 and 2 people survived. then one became a parasite and everyone died can't retake.Now that's a lot of bugs and problems yes.

I still recommend playing it, but I feel like at this point, any new games I start will play out pretty much identically to what I'm doing.It seems like there's a good structure for a game, but it doesn't take much time at all to get a pretty decent, stable population (until raiders or parasites come along and decimate you). Medicine could be fleshed out more. Science and technology need to be fleshed out more. Facilities should be upgradeable in some capacity — better entertainment facilities, better food replicators, whatever. A bit more of a personality to the citizens would be interesting.

It was a promising game, but decidedly incomplete. Knowing that the developers have basically given up on it changes things: my thumbs-up review before was based on its potential. This thumbs down review is based on what it actually IS -- a half-finished game with a lot of interesting ideas and nothing much for the player to do with them."
,Not Recommended,246090,8433883,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,BOT Rob,"I really loved this game, but the sheer ballsiness of the developers on this project has caused me to have to flip my thumb downward. Instead of continuing development on this game, a potential gem for simulation games, they're finishing their current tasklist then moving it on to the community to complete the game. I could see this for $5, as a personal project from someone who doesn't necessarily need the money, but not from a renowned developer like Double Fine.To avoid railing on the devs, who actually did a fine job(bah dum tiss), there are quite a few things wrong with the game itself.Pros1. The few stylized art pieces of the game, especially the character portraits are really charming.2. Base development is very interesting and lends a lot to imagination, since the base can be torn down and rebuilt as well. You don't even have to keep oxygen in the rooms. :)3. The music is pretty catchy.4. The UI isreallyclean.Cons1. Citizens sleep for an unreasonably long time. A bit over 4 minutes wouldn't be much time IRL, but considering that the game isn't running on real time, it's basically like taking a member of the community into a temporary community. If there's a tiredness stat, there's only one static way to rejuvenate it, and it takes forever. Might as well just skip making beds in the first place.2. Raiders and other attacks are completely devastating to a young space station. Not necessarily a con, but having to stop working on a base expansion in order to tear down a docked station is a bit discouraging.2a. You can't tweak any of these settings - meaning that raiders, pirates, parasites, (I don't believe Killbots are there yet), and meteor storms just happen.3. Personal inventory is hastily implemented. Essentially it's just a clutter simulator now.4. Space beds take up too much room, making personal bedrooms an undesirable solution. Yes: you wouldn't want to join a space station that doesn't give you a comfortable place to live, but I doubt that's a necessity when you're just trying to keep your people oxygenated.5. No ability to customize characters or furniture.6. Spacefrog logs tend to take up a lot of the dev log, but essentially it's just text-based in a personally unused section of the character profile panel.7. Once your base is maxed out, there are few activities aside from keeping your food chain going, keeping oxygen/energy machines going, and patrolling the base. No hostile interaction, no other space bases to communicate with, no overworld map for shipping minerals back-and-forth, no super-future tech. Just more of the same, with decreasing intrinsic threat.8. If you don't play by the dev's rules when entering derelicts, they're completely bugged. For example: if you want to enter a derelict by punching a hole in the wall and sucking the raiders out into the vacuum, then the derelict will remain hidden by the fog-of-war. You'd have to rebuild the wall then explore it with a security team (good luck if anyone's sleeping). After that, if you unclaim the rooms then they'll go back into FoW, iirc. There's an oxygen generator on the derelict? Oops, looks like your base's oxygen support counter just incremented and you'll need to unclaim it and quickly destroy it, good luck if anyone's sleeping. Or you'll need to unclaim it and wait for it to destroy itself, or get to it before it can go back under the FoW.Basically, imagine if the Prison Architect guys quit this time a year or two ago. The game would still be fun and playable, but there would be just such a lack of depth.This game isn't done. There is an entire host of ideas and game mechanics than can be iimplemented to make this game a true genre piece. Instead, the devs are just going to quit on it to go lurk behind some other title hardcore simulation fans probably won't buy.Bah.-----Old ReviewSpacebase DF-9 is probably one of the best build-it-yourself management games I've played in a long time. You're able to build any kind of station you desire in any pattern, lending as much or as little to design and preparation as you'd like. The game is an early access, but the devs have laid out a lot of functionality that's going to be added. For fans of this genre and as an early alpha, this game is definitely worth picking up."

Lot's of bugs still exist and can ruin a run pretty easily such as oxygen not filling rooms right. This causes your people to get stuck due to air pressure differences, or recently one I found with making large bars. I made a bar large enough to hold a good proportion of my population only to find that all my people will wait for ages to get served. Even if the bartenders are asleep, they can wait up to two minutes or longer at max speed, neglecting their duties of building and maintenance. Eventually they all died because the oxygen recyclers all broke down causing them all to panic instead of fixing the issue. The A.I. really needs to be updated to react better to situations like this where they need to get their job done over waiting for dinner and schedule who does what and when they are on duty.Edit: As of recently, this game which was updating at a steady pace has now entered 1.0. Unfortuantly the company running it decided it was not making anymore money, and was not worth it in the long run. Buyer beware, what you pay for now is what you get, and that is a game with many features mentioned during develpoment left out."

It needed more work, more polish, more fixes, and not only was this not done this was a conscious decision by the company to not do. This is the problem of early access epitomized, do not buy this game. My love for the game and what it could be pales to what it is."

There were so many planned features that really made me excited for the game, even in the early stages with the lack of content it kept me entertained for hours on end. Unfortunetly Double Fine has backed out of development and handed over all of the source code to modders. This means the game will most likely never be finished. At it's current state it's not worth the $20.01 USD they are asking for it. It's unfinished and i'm sure it still has bugs. Spacebase DF-9 had to chance to be an excellent game, a fresh take on the base building genre but Double Fine dropped the ball. Now that the game has been handed over to modders 95% of people don't even know whats going on with the game. Is it being updated? Expanded? Abandoned completely? No one is sure. If you don't mind dropping $20 on an unfinished game just to play it and wonder what could have been it's a decent play for 2-3 hours. After that the game just stonewalls as you run out of new things to do. Sure you can keep playing to see how big you can get your base but it simply becomes repetitive and tedious.

The soundtrack is enchating as space scenes are. You start with 3 characters you can only lightly influence. Each one can be assigned a task within the spacebase, they are: botanist, bartender, builder, technician, security, miner. (Botanist grow food for the bartender to serve in a pub, the others shouldn't need explanation). Each person can perform each task at a level granted by skill. So it allows an opportunity to manage your labor resources as well as material resources. After while you will slowly build a  base of up to 100 or so people if you can survive impacting debris and pirate raiders. Opportunities to plunder derelict ships will give you bonus space or resources. While definently a playable alpha build, you can probably do just about everything in eight hours, more content would make replay value more substantial. Overall impressive game, can't wait for the finished build. *Edit I have to change my opinion to negative because the game was published seemingly before it was finished."

,Not Recommended,246090,13349375,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,Unknown Zombie,"Playing this game will only frustrate you. This is a management game that is set up in a way that should minimize micro-management of your denizens and let you concentrate on the bigger picture. The citizens of your base are expected to be able to make decisions on their own using their AI. Unfortunately, their AI is nowhere near complete enough to make this feasible. Quite often your entire base will spiral out of control because of events that are set in motion by something a citizen did or did not do because of poor AI.Because the game was apprently intended to lean away from micro-managing each citizen, you are powerless to make a citizen do something they are neglecting to do and you cannot stop them from doing something you don't want them doing. There just are no means to give individual commands, which causes too many problems to make this a fun game. Far too often your base will die off for reasons completely out of your control because one person was hell-bent on doing something wrong.One example: I've had a base sent into a depression spiral because my doctor kept deciding that she would rather lift weights for hours instead of pick up dead bodies that were accumulating from repeated raider attacks. The numerous bodies around the base put everyone into foul moods causing them to constantly fight one another, eventually thinning their own ranks so much that I could no longer defend against raider attacks. All of this could have been avoided had I been able to force my doctor to pick up bodies. Instead, all I could do was watch her and hope that she stops lifting weights long enough to pick up a body or two on her own.Another example: I've had a base where a small fire killed every single crew member because each and every one of them insisted on attempting to stomp the fire out with their feet instead of using the fire extinguisher posted right beside the door to the room."

That then drags morale down and people don't work as hard,THEN, when the end game comes (not that we really wanted or needed 500 Raiders to fight maybe 50 people IF we get lucky.) we'reROYALLYscrewed, as there are 5-10 people left on our base to fight an onslaught of raiders before we can get Dark-Matter reactorsAND ORNova Class Turrets (only learnt of those puppies recently) Not that they help much in the scheme of trying to get them researched when everyone is off dying for no reason.TheOTHERbig problem I have, is when I just start a new base because my last one ended as stated I above, is when I only have about 5 people tops, a small base that's barely functioning,AND BAMsomeones managed to encounter a Face Hugger and now there is a God Damned Parasite on my base killing everyone because they're so damned tired since I couldn't get them any beds yet because I'm only 5 minutes into the base and everyone is busy being Scrubs.In conclusion: This game was fun once upon a time but now even if offered a refund it would not be worth it since time invested in a failed project.out of 10 you're owed at least 30 Points, Why 30? because if you were owed 72 Points that would be sus with my Name.Rating: -30/10-----Vinditator1972"

The AI is awful, It's crashy  it's buggy and while they claim they covered the list of things they were going to include, the full list (that they tried to delete and replace with an abridged version) was considerably bigger, and you can feel from the game alot of the ""Completed"" items could have had several layers, or further sophistication, but instead were there as a superficial ""tick the box so we can say we delivered"".I cant even compare this to the MOO3's in terms of promises that failed to deliver (Maybe Outpost comes close?) although the ""let the modding community save us"" is VERY MOO3. I am VERY interested to see what the modding community can do with the game, but I can only echo the others here to say DONT BUY IT!! Get a friend to share it or torrent it first, or wait till it's $3 in a Steam sale - in it's current state it is only good of an evenings entertainment.The thing that makes me FURIOUS instead of dissapointed is several other groups (i counted at least 3) were looking to make a similar ""Build your Spacestation x resource management x roguelike"" games around this time, but the graphics for SB-DF9 made all of them say ""Nope!

This resulted in them slapping a poor excuse for a tutorial onto the game and fixing only a handful of the hundreds of bugs the game had and releasing it.  They stuck around for 6 more patches fixing even more bugs, and the game still has dozens of bugs.They released the source code expecting modders to finish developing the game and continued to sell it for full price.It's still being sold, incomplete and extremely buggy.This is the game that dragged Double Fine's reputation into the dirt, and rightfully so.If you choose to give them money (or get it elsewhere, as it's essentially abandonware at this point), you will have a few hours of fun, especially if you loved management games of old; but play it longer than that and all you'll experience is complete frustration at the bugs and the general incompleteness of the game.

I'm hating myself right now.Please don't make the same mistake as I did unless you are rich or something >_>Thanks.[edit] I just realised the price is now at £7 when I purchased it for £19. Genuinely disgusting."

But the developers abandoned the game during early access and just released the game with a couple of bugfixes. It's a broken promise. So please don't buy this game and support the developers for what they did.

This is a pre-Alpha at best.  It's broken.  There are tonnes of half-finished conent in the game, and a bunch of artifacts and features that were included but have no current use.  It's just not fun.2/10."

I simply can not reccomend anyone buying the game."

I would still reccoment rimworld over this anyday. But I am still reviewing the steam version only so it's still a 0/10 because i is unplayable without that update.

If something is wrong, like your people dies often, other people will not work good and can die soon tooBut if you have a nice base, it will be OK, and the only problem will be Raiders (or not a problem, but additional matarial for your base)"

The workers in the game rather talk to each other than doing there duties - and this means of course, that your whole base just die in front of your eyes, even you try desperate your best to organize the base-crew  - but when only a very few will follow your orders, of course it must end bad … and in every game!I do have understandings for the fact, that is not an easy thing to do, to program a game – but this game has been for sale on Steam now for ages, and even so, the programmers of this game, still won’t lift a finger to fix the errors – so, shame on them, and shame on Steam for selling this game full of errors … it is so sad that the gaming industry is so greedy and obscene!"

Instead of a game, this is an example of the worst and most intolerable abuses of early access.  That this was done by Double Fine only makes the jab that much more painful.  There isn't enough content in this ""game"" to be worthy of the title or even to be judged as such and the sequence of events leading up to now make this more of an artifact to be remembered about how bad things can possibly get and a reminder of how you should never trust a single word published by a developer and judge the product in your hands as is."
