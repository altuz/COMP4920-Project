Im a Survial Horror fan, consider myself fairly seasoned to be honest, Ive seen a trend of these POV games, i.e. Slender, Scratchs etc. So, I figured what the heck right? Give this one a go. I gotta tell ya, Its scarey. THIS GAME IS *&$#@^* SCAREY! I didnt think it would be, I mean, Im from the Resident Evil (Old School Res not the new stuff), Silent Hill and Doom generation. I get sleepy durring the Exorcist, I love Horror, but its been dry for several years now. This game, is Epic, from a horror point of view. If you kill the lights, toss in some earbuds and put yourself into this game You .. Will .. get freaked out at least some what. I found a few parts that I was thining ""Okay, just ignore it, and move on"" ... then something ELSE would kick off. Its not all in your face either, some of it is subtly, some of it is straight sick, and the rest is just very, very well done. My hats off to this game and its devs, I think a lot of AAA developers out there need to take a look and pay attention to the details of a TRUE Haunting experience. If your like me and are a fan of Horror (not guts and slashers for eye candy sake), true  Horror, and if you have a little back knowledge i.e. Demonology, Paranormal Investigation, seen The Exorcist or the Conjuring, then you will LOVE this game.This is also the first review I have ever felt compelled to write on Steam, and I have been a member for years! Im sure its just one huge run on sentence, and my spelling sucks ... trust me I know, but the point remains the same, your reading this because you are interested in this game, and if you are interested, then stop waisting time and BUY it! You will not regret it and you wont be able to stop playing it .. except maybe to turn the lights back on if your that type of person ;P"

The only truely cliched part of the game is the story behind the haunting, but the majority of the scares are quite interesting, in my experience. I don't know why, but the game has received quite a lot of hate on the internet; much of which is from people who don't realize that the game is an alpha or people who want to look tough as though they're not scared. The majority of the horror of this game is from the terror of not knowing what will happen next, and when something does happen, it's often not what one expects. It's this type of horror that made games like the first 3 Silent Hill games so great. I reccomend it to anyone who can stomache the pre-release jitters and is a fan of horror."

This game has been in my library since 2012 and is a perfect example of the early access beast rearing its ugly head.It was started by a 17 year old which I was quite impressed with at first. But that teenager has since married and started a family.We have waited patiently for 5 years to see some sort of meaningful progress on this game and there really hasn't been much at all. I REALLY wanted to believe in this project. But I just can't lie to myself about it anymore. It feels like it has become abandonware at this point.There are always promises of big changes coming, but after 5 years most people still can't make it beyond the beginning area. That's pretty alarming.Updates come every 6 months at best(the last major update was Dec 2016) and change very little about the game. Aside from updating to Unreal 4 engine, the only real changes that have been made are only tweaks of the current system.Judging by what he's said on the forums, he has a lot on his plate so he probably shouldn't keep stringing people along or charging $10 for a game that he doesn't have time for anymore. In my opinion(and I expect there are some who will disagree which is fine), he should just scrap the project entirely or hand it to somebody who actually has time to develop it and move on with his life.That being said, if you are interested in a 5 year old early access game that only gets updated twice a year, go for it!"

It has a lot of potential, but would be better suited under the guidance of more experienced developers. These devs are so indie they're still in their teens. They have no sense of geometry either; so prepare to have a midget's viewpoint and explore oddly shaped rooms. The scares were good at times, but were otherwise silly and immature. I would recommend it only after the game reaches it's true final form, if that ever comes."
76561198036976650,Not Recommended,246300,11626175,"Posted: 10 August, 2014",all,The FaZe Clan Leader,"This is one of the times that I with there was some another option other than yes or no when it came to recommending this game.  I personally like the IDEA of the gameplay and the concept, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that I love the general gameplay as it stands right now either.  Hopefully that'll make more sense as you continue to read my review, but let's get down to it.In terms of graphics, it actually looks pretty decent for an indie game.  I've seen some people saying that their computers couldn't handle it...but I've got a Nvidia Geforce 610 GT and I managed to run the game with just about everything on whilst also getting some pretty decent frames, so seeing as how this is a 'work in progress' I'm sure that subject to change...for the good or otherwise.When it comes to the camera effects and the SFX and whatnot, I'd say that's mostly where the game shines at in terms of graphics.  The distortions are done pretty well, there's some haze if you try to look at something in the distance, and the colors even begin to seperate when it rains (I.E. the water causes the camera to see Red, Green, and Blue).  Now, all this being said, there are some flaws here and there.  Some examples would be some textures looking...a bit outdated/out of place, randomly changing pictures (And not in the good way either...as in the paintings seem to be actually changing into something completely different before my eyes at times.  If that's part of the game, then just shoot me a message, but I'm pretty sure I saw one of those Michael Jackson paintings literally morph into one of the bathroom paintings.)There are some things that I did kinda gripe about in the game that others might say was just me nitpicking, but personally they kinda stood out a lot.  For one thing the perspective of your character is...odd.  I feel like he's taller than the viewpoint may imply, as referenced by the furniture and whatnot, but whenever I attempted to interact with something I couldn't help but feel like I was incredibly short.  The rooms could have been a bit more interesting in my opinion, and the design of the house just felt...off.Now the sound is one of the high points.  Listening to the game via my computer speakers doesn't do it enough justice, so I normally use my headphones when I play this game.  It does a fair job of immersing you into the game via sound, and it does help to make the game more atmospheric/scary.When it comes to gameplay, the premise of the game is pretty basic.  You go around the house and record the strange occurances that happen there, or don't happen as the case may be.  You've got your flashlight, and you've also actually got a time limit on how long you can stay up before you have to charge your camera.  If you don't make it back to your bedroom before the battery hits zero then you die.  You can go around the house and collect/read the letters left behind by the previous owner, as well as learn the history of the house via the laptop, or you can learn about our main character's background.The story is nothing special at all.  It's actually your typical 'Haunted House' type plot.  I understand that the game is supposed to be, more or less, of an homage to Paranormal Activity, but the story could really have been a bit less cliched in my opinion.  Not that you're required to even figure out the story, as you could just play the game without ever picking up a single note.The scares aren't very scary.  I jumped due to...well, jump-scares, but that's it.  I never felt real-deal fear while I played the game, and some of the scares just felt a bit forced and really typical for me.  I get that they're dynamic to help make the game stay fresh, but that only works if the game continues to scare you...that never really happened for me.This isn't going to affect my decision on how I'd rate this game, but if you came here with the expectation that the game would have fairly frequent updates...well, then you may want to look elsewhere.  As you could probably tell from the patch-notes about, the game hasn't been updated since April.  I don't currently know what the creator is doing as of right now, but I had heard that he has tried to fund the project through a website other than Kickstarter.  I currently don't know the name.Personally, I don't know if I'd recommend this game as it stands.  I liked the idea/concept of this game, and I'd very much like to see how much farther it'll go during development, but as it stands it's just an alright game to me.  It offers nothing new in the way of gameplay, story, or otherwise, but at the same time the premise of the game is pretty appealing to those who like to try out new things.***EDIT*** 7/1/15So I've checked this game every chance that I've gotten since the latest update on New Year's Eve, and...nothing.  No updates, no latest news, nothing.  As I've stated before, it's not a bad game and it shows promise...but what's the point of promise if it just doesn't deliver?Seriously, I've just about given up on the game at this point.  I could seriously care less about the game being converted to UE4.  Why not finish the UE3 version of the game first and work on the UE4 version second?  It'd certainly give us all something to do."

,Not Recommended,246300,21949753,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Paranormal is a first person, ""found footage"" style game where you play as artist Mattel Clarke. Mattel has been witnessing strange events in his house, and has come to believe it is haunted. In an attempt to capture his findings, he sets up video cameras all around his house and utilizes a handheld camera for capturing POV shots.Now, Paranormal was one of the first games that I ever bought on Steam. Back in 2012, the game looked promising and interesting, and I also had no concept of ""Early Access"" since I was new to PC gaming. Back then, the game had significantly less content than it does now... however, it has also been in Early Access for almost five years. There is only one guy working on the game, which is why the development process is taking an excruciatingly long time. On the flip side, after almost five years, you would expect a game of this caliber to be nearing completion; on the contrary, Paranormal is far from it.Instead of finishing the game as it was, and then working on an upgraded version, the developer decided to put the entire project on hold while he transferred the content to Unreal Engine 4. In the base game, you walk around and try to trigger paranormal events. Once your camera battery is nearly drained, you head back to bed and see the cameras set up around the house; you're able to flick through them in an attempt to catch more spooky activity. Once you wake again, usually something, or rather multiple things, in the house has changed. You rinse and repeat the process until you come to an ending. It took a solid year for anything more than one or two endings to be added, and initially Paranormal was only about 10-20 minutes long, per playthrough.Now, the newly added portion of the game is all done in Unreal 4. It has awesome visuals, great voice-overs, it's set prior to the events in the base game, and it supposedly has some pretty cool paranormal events. Unfortunately, I couldn't get that far in my play of the new content for one reason; the head bobbing is so atrocious that I seriously felt like I was going to be ill. I'm not a person who gets motion sickness at all, but I seriously had to stop playing after about 10 minutes. If this is taken out, or at least made an optional feature, I feel that the experience for some people would be a lot better. Likewise, there is still some optimization that needs to be looked at, as I did find my framerate fluctuating between 40-60 quite consistently.The reason that I cannot recommend Paranormal at this time is, to be quite honest, I personally feel like we will never see the finished product. The developer has a lot of work to do by himself, and he has a busy life that draws him away from working on the game quite often. There's great potential to be had here, and I'm extremely hopeful that one day there will be a finished product. Until I see this game nearing release, with more of the content tied together, I can't give this one a thumbs up. If you don't mind investing in Early Access titles that are going to take a long, long time to come to fruition, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, just hold off for a while. I'll be updating this review at various intervals of the games lifespan, however there has been no update for over half a year at this time.Rating:3.0/5.0- Average, can take it or leave it.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

You are the protaganist who is investigating the hauntings of his new residence using a camcorder. You have to walk around the house to pick up any unusual activity (believe me there is a lot!!!) and rest every now and again to ""charge"" the recorder. As you play through the game you are gradually introduced to the story of what had happened in the house with a host of jump scares to keep you busy. Playing this game alone and with headphones is highly recommended to get the full effect of the this ghost simulator and I can guarantee at least one spine tingling moment. It is a game where both the seen and unseen can play tricks with your mind."

However at this current stage of development I find the game to be rather basic and generic, with its limited gameplay, controls, writing, and even audio and visuals.Unfortunately the biggest let down for me was the horror part of Paranormal. Perhaps it is just a case of me having been desensitised by years of playing survival horror games, but I find the scares on offer here to be rather dull – they are all just too clichéd and expected, with your usual “ghost appearing in the mirror for a second” and “water turning bloody” type fares.

You get to watch a game be developed and in a way help it to be better. Now the gameplay. If you like movies like Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project then you will enjoy it. Yes, you could call this game a gigantic cliche, but the developer loves the material so much that it is almost a reminder of why we love to be creeped out by this kind of stuff. As said, the game is a work in project. Graphics are dated (personally I like it that way) and will be updated, new content is being worked on, and the story is getting more fleshed out, but what is available now is worth playing. I am looking forward to watching this game come full circle."

A Game where you play as an artist who lives in a house Haunted by a paranormal entity and with your video camera you have to go around the house and capture as many paranormal things as you can. The jumpscares are little overdone at times but its still scary. Looking forward to updates.

You could even let your character start sleepwalking and do some creepy stuff in front of the camera. like staring at the wall like a zombie and talk with creepy voice.further on i hope to see some smoother graphics and perhaps some more stuff in the diffrent rooms. makeing it more like a house where someone could realy live."

Paranormal was thankfully one of these games. I thoroughly appreciated how the haunting changed in sequence each time -even though there were several things I saw on a regular basis in most outcomes and very few times there were outcomes that never happened to me again. The environment and interaction is immersive, beautiful, and definitely eerie, making one feel progressively helpless, even if you begin to learn more about what you are being haunted by. Kinda sad ultimate ending (in the basement), not sure how many ""final""/""true"" endings there are, but it was still good. Controls were easy and comfortable, some discoveries were repetitive but still rewarding (as you didn't know what the next event would be) and the mannequin in the picture on the wall that got closer each time still continued to disturb me, no matter how many times I saw it. Very well done game -I hope to find more like it."

This game truly brings out the fear of the supernatural, and its story really makes you feel like your deeply invested in the character and makes you want to solve the mystery. Now with those things being said, I'd like to add that this game is not complete, and it's latest update was a few months ago, I really hope they don't end up scrapping the game, it's suppost to have in total of 3 different areas to solve mysteries in, theres only one out right now. It has beautiful graphics, and a lot of jump scares and other parts that really are just creepy. The character model (i say that because Minor Spoiler: theres only one person you see) isnt that realistic, but it gets the point across and almost adds an old-fashioned scare (honostly I think the thing that scares me the most is the one character) and the graphic glitches in the game are expected (its still in beta.)

Paranormal takes on the elements and features (sounds, effects, visuals) as the Paranormal movie trilogy. It's your Blair Witch Project type of set up - found footage, you know the type. The plot is simple, you document paranormal activity in a house and try avoid being killed by enviromental and accidental mistakes. For isntance: You have to sleep to recharge your camera's battery. If you run out of juice before you get to bed, you will probably end up dead. The game also uses sound efx to set a scary atmosphere. Footsteps, doors closing, items breaking, shouting, crying, etc. Plus we cant leave out the roaring sound when something ""paranormal"" is about to happen. As for replayability, each experience is different. Objects are located in different places, things happen in some play throughs and don't in others.

I think that the glitchs in the game play that is the current version is frustrating at first I had issues logging in and had to improvis for a while. But the story  how it only tells parts each play through makes it very addicting to say the lest. As soon as I beat it I had to play it five more times to figure out the whole story and fin all the trophies.  On a side note Is the  basement door intentionally glitchable?  If you walk strait at the door it will block your path from the inside. But if your in the basement and walk backwards  you can walk freely among the house and create more chacnes for trophies and event to be generated in a sort  of force reset each time you walk into a new area. Also since you go into the basement and walk out you get unlimited battery life so instead of havign a feeling of urgency you can take your time and make the game engine work for you.  But  I thought maybe the door glitch and the unlimited time was a hint of a easter egg to show the next level or somethign hidden in a secret room? You had me walking backwards  on the entire map for a while seeing if it was a tip or something,  then i tried the rock and halo  glitching items.  But i didnt find  any hidden room (if you hide one. )  this si truely  the best game i played for far this year thank you for creating a very immersive game with all the right elements!"

No replay value - example: One Late Night - The same experience every time you play.All these were great games, but for the reasons listed they lost appeal. In my opinion, a horror game should constantly suprise you with every playthrough, completely immerse you in the enviornment with intriguing sounds and visuals, have a good story and plot, and be simple in mechanics, hud, and objectives.Paranormal did all those things and then some.

The laughter was easily worth the low price, but if I were looking for a horror game, go something more mainstream."

Pretty disapointing. A game like this should of stayed free. I appreciate the developers work but really?

Early Accsess game are always cool, because the game get better and better. To me I could care less how long it takes them. In fact I love watching games grow and Early Accsess give players the chanse to help and watch a game being built. A game you wate for and just buy takes time too but you dont see it like an Early Accses Game. So, if your getting Early Accsess games then you singh up for a long haul, so dont conplaine.To the dev keep up the good work you have a really good game going. I say take your time this is yours and thank you for letting me be apart of it. Congrats on all the new life changes dont forget to enjoy that too. I am excited to see what you come up with next."

,Not Recommended,246300,10025168,"Posted: 5 May, 2014",all,Kuehnau,"In 'Paranormal' you play as an artist who has rented their own personal studio where they can work on their art without being disturbed. But then you start to notice you may not be alone in the studio, no one believes you, so you decide to try and collect 'evidence'.You don't actually collect evidence, but the developer uses it as an excuse to make your point of view through a fuzzy, crappy, pixelated video recorder that no one should have any business owning in 2015.The entire game involves you wandering around your studio, trying to find proof the house is haunted. As you spend more time in the studio, you'll find little tidbits of information that help you slowly understand the haunting and the story behind it.The studio is crampt and small, making exploring the house a very short affair. What is supposed to attract you is all of the paranormal activity happening in the studio.The game boasts re-play-ability by having 'randomly generated' events happen. The issue is, after the first or second play through, there isn't really anything random about it, the events that happen are so few and varied you may very well start seeing the same thing happen during the first play through.Obviously, since this game is in Early Access, it's unpolished. But I wouldn't even use that word with this title. The last time I played it, the game had parts of game play elements that were scrapped, but never removed, the game had two title screens, one of which doesn't work or save any of your options properly.If you want to believe what the author says on the game's forums here, you'd be lead to believe not only has he fixed several bugs, added in new content and added in a demo for the Unreal Engine 4 remake, but I didn't see any of that. Why? Because right after the title screen the game locks up every, single time.This isn't an issue of my hardware, I got a great set-up that plays current gen titles just fine. The issue is with the developer, his programming and his progress with the title. At this point, I just consider this lost money. If the author reads this, I wouldn't mind you buying a game for me from my wish list to make up for the worthless garbage you sold me."

I think all the thumbs up are by the creators.-The graphics are horrid on a top of the line machine with everything up as far as it goes-While walking it randomly does some kind of motion to simulate something (no clue what) and makes me want to throw up.  Not fun.-You are eye level with the kitchen counter and dining room tables like you are 5 years old-its not even a little creepy in the 14 minutes I played before stopping to keep from throwing up due to motion sickness from the random camera bobbles-14 minutes in and I am fairly sure I will just uninstall this and figure I wasted $10-no the fact that it is pre release does not give me any need to check it out again laterI really liked Slender the Arrival, the first Amnesia, and Day Light.

Have you ever seen camcorder footage that looked like that? I really doubt it.Also, the options menu...pretty atrocious. I've never played a game where the options menu looked 100% different in-game and in the main menu. Toggle buttons don't work, often crashes the game. Voice acting and all that are good, just needs tweaks that could make this game work really well. Just...not for the price.The price of $10 is absolutely terrible.Wait for a sale if you're gonna buy this game."

I cannot seem to load different aspects of the game, and automatically load into The House scenario. Within the house, the game will freeze now and then, textures will pop in and out, and sometimes the game randomly crashes to desktop. While the premise is interesting, it is not worth the price until all of these extremely game breaking bugs are fixed."
