The Steam version fixes this, and has no DLC or microtransactions at all - all the heroes are included in the game, and it doesn't even have the consumables store anymore.The Steam version also includes a bunch of the bonus maps/mini-campaigns added in updates to the iOS version after launch, with the promise that the rest are coming soon in a free post-launch update that will also add a new bonus campaign exclusive to the steam version.My only small disappointment with the steam version so far is that there's no way (that I can tell) to add a keybind to call the next wave early. There does seem to be some sort of nonfunctional keybind-manager in the game launcher, so hopefully that's something they'll add soon. (UPDATE: This is no longer true - there's now a keybind for this!)Kingdom Rush is, in my opinion, the best TD game out there, and this Steam release is the definitive version. At $7.50 it's a steal (I can't tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game), and I strongly recommend it to anyone who even remotely enjoys TD games."

,Recommended,246420,8596524,"Posted: 6 January, 2014",all,jacobvandy,"Kingdom Rush is fantastic. I've played a lot of tower defense games over the years because it's one of my favorite genres (ever since it was invented on Starcraft/Warcraft custom maps), and this is right up there in the top 5 of all time. I first played it a couple months back on Android after it was featured in one of the Humble Bundles, and it is the only game out of that bunch I played for more than an hour or so. I literally would step away from my gaming PC once or twice a day to go lounge around with my phone and play this... It's that good.A lot of people are concerned about microtransactions in this game because that was the main way they made money from the mobile app, but the new PC version is completely different. You don't have to buy heroes, and the gem store -- which was still intact in the premium version I played on Android despite having all heroes included -- has been removed. So in addition to rebuilding the game with the Unity engine instead of porting the Flash version, they've re-balanced the difficulty of certain levels or challenges that used to be really difficult to complete without consumable power-ups.Don't be fooled by those complaining about the $10 price tag (or $7.50 currently, at launch). A free, outdated browser version or cheaper mobile app with microtransactions is not in anyway equivalent to the brand new PC version. You could play them as sort of a demo to try out the game and see if you like it, but then you should come back to Steam and buy the best and most complete version there is or will ever be. Ironhide Games has put a lot of work into making the game look good at high resolutions and of course the interface and controls have been updated to support the keyboard & mouse. New content updates are on the way (for free), and they're dedicated to quickly fixing bugs and refining features. I'm happy to support them for their efforts in bringing a great game to the greatest platform, and once you get a taste of this TD, I think you will be, too."

Some people may consider this a negative (amagad paying $10 for a game I can get for free?) but I consider it a positive - the free version is easily accessible, treat it as a demo or play it whilst waiting for this version to go on sale.Kingdom Rush on steam is 100% worth the cost for the amount of entertainment it will offer."

There really isn't much to complain about here other than difficulty, but if you're asking me, it's a total plus. The main campaign maps are great and challenging and most people should be able to get through them, but the true test comes after you've completed them. The bonus content is phenomenal. There's more to winning than just sticking towers on the map. You must strategize, realize what types of enemies are coming from where and place your defenses accordingly - and sometimes, that isn't even enough. I can't praise the devs enough for their effort in this department. I've only got a few achievements left to grab, but I've enjoyed this game the entire way.

I don't say that because 'free is always better,'  no, I mean when the game was free it was engineered in subtle, but noticably different ways then this version for the PC.  I see all these glittering reviews, claiming this is the best TD evar.  Really?  Which version where these people playing?  The free version they've played to death, or the PC version that has a load of problems?I've played the free version ( the one that had locked premium content ) on PC, and it's the superior version.  Why?One : Hero units.  The game needed to be rebalanced for the hero units, and they added mechanics that honestly, weren't needed.  The free version was engineered in a way that you -didn't need hero units to play the game -AND- win-  I could beat the game without a hero in the orgininal, now I need to.  Got some issues there, because the enemies are buffed up to make up for the heroes simply existing.Not only that, but the melee heroes are pointless.  Utterly, and completely, pointless.  If you didn't swap out to a ranged type hero when the flying units started showing up, then the exploding demon type enemies will have pointed out how useless they are.   And, on top of that, the ranged heroes have a plethora of abilities that are just synergize better with the towers : Abilities that slow, waylay, or simply stop an enemy for the towers to wittle down.Two : Complete reliance on acing levels to have the necesary upgrades to succede later in the game.  Now, it's no big secret that beating level one means you can play level two.  Here, though, you -need- to ace level one, so that you can have the upgrades that will make the game 'easier' later on.  If you simply beat each level, say getting one or two stars a pop, the game is significantly ( and un-neccesarily ) more difficult later on.  Because that makes sense, right?   And in some cases, you need to do the challenges to get more stars to... you guessed it... have the neccesary upgrades to have a better chance of beating the game.  So what's the magic solution?  Repeatitive game play forcing the player to redo earlier missions over and over again in the hope of acing the level so that you get the upgrade points you -NEED- by the end of the game.Three : Problems with upgrades.  Specifically, if I try to do a challenge level, it takes upgrades away.  Towers cost full price, or don't have the buffs you spent so much time earning.  Why is that?  Isn't the challenge hard enough already?  'No hero.'  Okay, get that.  'No barracks, no hero.'  Okay... I'd... kind  of like to have the buffs I earned.  And honestly, I don't know if the upgrades even matter in the long run.  Do the top tier upgrades even function?  It'd be nice if there was an indicator that the top tier 'chance for double damage' arrow talent was working, an exclamation point over an enemies head if they take double damage would be nice.  'Spiked Armor?'  Does it even work?  I can't even tell!Four : What I'd like to call 'The Korean Problem.' Now, you all know the meme 'Koreans play video games better.'  This game falls prey to this, as a in the last third of the game ( and the bonus content ) are incredibly difficult, requiring precise tower placement, upgrade, and unit movement.  In fact, I have no clue how in the heck you beat the swamp level.  The boss wave is ludricrous!  How is swarming the lanes with enormous amounts of enemies supposed to be 'challenging?'  This just tells me there's -one- way to place and upgrade the towers in many of these levels.  -One-  How is that supposed to be 'fun?'    Any answer that revolves around 'look it up online'  means the game is an utter failure.  I've played far better TD's that offered challenging experiences -and- allowed for more freedom in tower placement.Bottom line, this game isn't worth 10 dollars.  It isn't even worth 5 dollars.  I could play the game for free, and have far more fun, and not need the heroes or bonus content.  I feel ripped off.  And if you bought this game on Steam you've been ripped off too.Oh.  And PS ~For anyone that wants to leave a comment about the review, please spare me the subjective stand point of how much you loved the game.  Subjective means 'opinion' and everyone's got one.  Objective statements, on the other hand, are not opinionated in anyway.  If you want to leave a comment, then do so, but at least try to have a better leg to stand on then 'oh, poor you, you couldn't beat it?  you must have been stupid'  Because that's a great way to start a conversation right?"

,Recommended,246420,10953291,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Praxis-[CE],"Kingdom Rush is definitely one of the most fun tower defense games I've played. There is a nice variety of tower upgrades and the enemies change up often enough to keep things interesting.  Maps, tower placement, varied paths, rally points, and the characteristics special to different types of towers and units give the player the opportunity to outwit the enemy with tactics rather than just by overwhelming enemies with sheer power.Unlike the mobile versions, the Steam port has no microtransactions. All the heroes and upgrades are unlocked as you progress through the campaign. It also looks like the developer releases new content and campaigns here every few months, which in addition to the multiple challenge modes on each map gives a huge amount of gameplay. Also, finding the easter eggs is a lot of fun, and it's clear from those and the achievements that someone's got a sense of humor.This game wasn't even on my radar before I saw half my friends list pick it up during the summer sale, and I'm so glad I jumped on the bandwagon and grabbed it too.Now if I could just walk around without humming the music in my head...FREEDOM!"

They've obliterated the microtransactions in the game and KR legitimately feels like a TD game for the PC.After completing the game in a little under 18 hours, here's what I think..Pro:- battle system is refreshing all the way to the end of the campaign- the various towers and specialties are introduced at a proper pace- the bonus stages offer adequate challenges (although a difficulty selector would be great)- game has absolutely no microtransaction gimmicks- the art is vibrant (dem colors man)Con:- the new units introduced in the bonus stages are not too special (they were predictable to an extent)- at one point, the units got stuck outside of the map and reduced frame rate by a lot (can be fixed with RoF)- rain of fire spam and hero usage make the game much easierOverall it's a good game.

While the Protector series of tower defense games remains my favorite, Kingdom Rush is one of the highest quality games in the genre you can find. It remains a classic of the genre much like GemCraft and even the Bloons series because more than anything else, it emphasizes fun and strategy.Kingdom Rush is highly colorful and has dashes of humor, and is an absolute joy to play. You will make your way through a light-hearted campaign, collecting stars from levels (awarded based on how well you do in each level) to unlock upgrades. There are way more stars available to collect here than you will need, keeping frustration low if you cannot ace a particular level due to the fact that you can simply collect stars from other levels. Some levels are very easy or fairly simple, while others are a challenge and can have you repeating them using different strategies until you finally surpass them.Towers have multiple upgrade paths that add to the strategy of the map depending on the routes you choose. You can also bring heros along on the regular campaign missions out of your pick of twelve (unlockable through the campaign) that can move freely on the map and can move throughout the waves to where she/he is needed. After beating the campaign, you gain access to a few more maps that you can play. It also deserves mentioning that after beating each campaign level, you can try out two different modes of play on that level to earn additional stars (these modes are more challenging and have different rules).My only complaint about the game is that it is so short. Depending on your skill level, difficulty level, and whether or not you are interested in the additional modes, you can beat the campaign in a number of hours (it took me a little less than ten). Because Kingdom Rush is currently $9.99 full price, I think this still makes it a good deal dollar-per-hour-of-gameplay wise, as I have not beaten all the levels with the additional modes selected. Completionists can expect to get dozens of hours out of the game, and the replay value here is sky high. After beating the game, it remains fun and diverse enough to warrant additional playthroughs down the line. Unfortunately, Kingdom Rush is just so fantastic and fun, that regardless of how much content it offered, it may never have felt like ""enough."" I suppose that's a good problem to have.For tower defense fans like myself who don't agree that tower defense is overdone and will play any game in the genre, this game is one of the best. For those who aren't normally fans of the genre, this is one of the few that you will most likely enjoy. Kingdom Rush is one of the pinnacles of the tower defense genre and I would recommend it to all fans of casual strategy games."

You will likely not spend more than 20 hours on it even if you are a completionist. As far as the Tower defense segment goes there are games out there that will give you more value for money.MacroKingdom Rushis a cutesy approach to a tower defense game set in a straight forward cartoonish fantasy world. The involved reading is limited, to the point and has some fun parts to it but the game leaves you to figure out stuff yourself after the first mission and given its overall simplicity that’s perfectly fine.The addition of a hero unit to your tower defense setup helps work out little weaknesses in your defense or allows you to mount the occasional offense together with some summon-able re-enforcements. Given the controls though the hero needs to be re-selected constantly to use efficiently often tempting the player to just use it as a roadblock at critical intersections or resort to tapping space continuously to keep the thing moving (A simple way to rebind the key was not found).The game is very much linear (especially in the beginning) and levels are static so if for some reason you get stuck or bored you probably won’t pick it back up again after you quit even if you do decide to throw different heroes at it.The controls lack mouse support a little and while this is not a huge issue it does add a bit of superfluous clicking to the game that could have been avoided. The heroic and iron modes available after you finish a level restrict you further to give you more of a challenge but regularly do this by taking the unique aspect out of the game that give it it's edge over other Tower defense games (i.e. no more hero unit, see below).The developer(s) did put some thought into the achievements adding a bunch of small little Easter eggs to the game that are straight forward to discover and add a little bit of a reason to look outside of the paths the monsters travel on.All in all I enjoyed my first 10 hours in this game and I am happy with it mostly because I bought it when it was on sale. If there ever is a DLC added I am not likely to buy it and re-visit this game since as far as tower defenses go there are far superior options available. I am not entirely sure how people manage to put in more than 20 ish hours in this but if I find out I'll be happy to update this review."

Be it games that follow the classic ""watch your towers destroy a ton of enemies""-formula, like the Defense Grid series or Super Sanctum TD, while others tried to get the player more involved, like Orcs Must Die and it's Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter Hybrid gameplay or the Sanctum series that mixed TD with First Person Shooter and an emphasis on Coop.Kingdom Rush is your classic Tower Defense game, where you watch the landscape from above, place your towers, upgrade them and hopefully put them on spots so all the evil monsters don't reach the Exit.The game is set in a Fantasy Kingdom (so expect anything from Spiders to Gnomes to Ogres and Knights) as enemies) that is presented in a cute, comic art style and features a lot of humor with tons of references to movies like Army of Darkness (the mages in their tower quote „Klaatu Barada Nikto“) and during fights there are little text bubbles with words like ""Pow"", basically taken straight from 1966 Batman series. It's charming and thankfully not overdone.On your journey, that leads you through forest areas and snow landscapes, you get coins by beating the missions which you can invest to upgrade the Towers, the Knights and your Spells. Unlike other games in the genre, Kingdom Rush is a bit limited in it's towers. You only get 4: The Archer Tower, the Barracks, the Magic Tower and the Artillery but it's enough and you can not only upgrade those up to Level 3 but also turn them into specialised towers. For example the Archer Tower can later on changed into a Musketeer Garrison or the Ranger Hideout, both of them have their advantages and disadvantages, so there is a learning curve in this game ot find out how the upgrades are and what works best in each mission.Next to that are the spells. These can be activated and then have a cooldown. One is the reinforcements which spawns 2 pretty weak fighters but the cooldown is short and the other is Rain of Fire which, after you selected the target area, sends down a couple meteors.And the last thing at your disposal for defense are the Heroes. You unlock them one by one by playing the Campaign and they are different in their type (like a Paladin, an Archer or Thor) and their abilities. You can send them around the map but they're best used right at the exit to kill any enemy that might gotten through your defense lines.The game is fun and as expected, thanks to all the upgradable towers and the Heroes highly addicitive. The only criticism i can bring is the missing endless mode which is something that should be here since it's a standard game mode in Tower Defense and the music is a bit on the boring side, it's not bad but it doesn't stand out either.All in all i just can highly recommend this game to every fan of the genre."

On first sight, I wasn't sure I liked the tiny sprites, but I soon started to love them. A lot of screen-space is given over to inert scenery, which seems wasteful, but I think it is down to the origins of the game on mobile phones and tablets. You need plenty of space when you're poking your finger at a tiny screen. I can vouch for this, having now played 'Kingdom Rush: Frontiers' on my phone. Fortunately, there is no 'pay to win' in the Steam version of Kingdom Rush.The game is tongue-in-cheek fantasy, with all the cliches you'd expect. The hero characters include a mine-planting dwarf, an overweight king on a sedan chair who throws food and drink, an ice queen, and a gnome riding a pair of robotic legs with buzz-saw arms.Just because it looks cartoony, don't think this game is a push-over. Even on casual, beyond the first third of the game, the levels are quite challenging and require you to adopt an appropriate strategy. Your tower building exploits are enhanced by upgrades that you earn, which can be freely redistributed. You also get to choose which hero to use on each level, which can make the difference between a successful outcome and abject failure. Another key skill is calling in waves of enemies early, for which you are rewarded with a few coins towards your building costs and a reduced spell cool-down.Overall, this game is very good fun and full of humorous characters. It's the best TD game I've played after Defense Grid 1&2."

If you like the genre, you will certainly love Kingdom Rush. If you do not... well, maybe it's still worth a try. And you may end being converted eventually, who knows.Pros:+ Nice, cute, charming graphics. Tiny little details everywhere to be amazed at.+ Full of Easter eggs for the nerds.+ Extremely solid gameplay.+ Huge variety of ennemies.+ Light micromanagement to keep you entertained through the different waves.+ Plenty of different environments, maps, and missions.+ So fun it fails being repetitive (even if it's a TD).Cons:- Might be repetitive however after many hours of playing.- Last wave sudden defeat might be infuriating (tough unstoppable bosses with just a ton of lifepoints makes me sick).- Lot of unuseful stars to earn for nothing (at least we could use them to purchase artworks).- Achievements in late game could have been more interesting.- Heroes keep you busy without adding much in the game mechanics.Verdict: Amazing game. Crown jewel of Tower Defense games. One of the shiniest game on Steam. Don't miss it.Nothing feels rushed with Kingdom Rush. Everything is nicely polished: Gameplay, graphics, jokes, heroes, balance... Most of the TD games, trying to mimick Kingdom Rush, awefully pale in comparison (Evil Defenders, feel concerned). Most negative reviews argue that it was a free flashgame on Armor Games, so that paying ten euros for it is a little too much. You know what? It's still a free flashgame on Armor Games. Steam version is just cooler, because it's Steam integrated (cards, achievements, Cloud saves...). And there is much more content added since the time I was playing the flash version, especially a real lot of new missions, which are all  super great, with a lot of new ennemies with new, surprising specifics which all add a twist to the game. So, yes, I said ""new"" three times in the last sentence: It's the clearest sign that the devs have done an amazing job with this game.So, what are you waiting for? Freedom! To battle!"

,Recommended,246420,8776334,"Posted: 19 January, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Kingdom Rush is one of the most fun tower defense titles I've ever played. It has charming, cartoony graphics and the addictive gameplay we've come to know from games as Defense Grid and Pixeljunk Monsters. It isn't a big game, the main game exists of 'only' 12 levels, but there are several bonus levels to be unlocked for those that can't get enough of it. These bonus levels are actually quite tough, let me tell you. I had to retry them multiple times and still wasn't able to finish any of them.Anyway, there are also heroes to be unlocked and, thankfully, these are all very different from each other. Switching between them makes the levels less repetitive and makes them more fresh, even though nothing has changed. The hero can make the difference between victory and defeat and is a must if you want to finish the levels without making any mistake.Of course, using your buildings wisely and upgrading them as you go is just as important. The tower upgrades are done in a fun and exciting way; upgrading eventually allows you to make a choice between one of two towers. So, for example, an artillery tower can be upgraded to a tesla tower or a missile tower. After that you can start upgrading the skills of these towers, so you can upgrade it to have a bigger blast radius, things like that. Very well done.Kingdom Rush wouldn't be a proper tower defense game if it didn't have boss fights and luckily for us, there are several bosses to be slain during the game. They're usually slow enough to kill them before they enter the base, except for maybe the last boss, which I won't spoil here.Additionally, the game has a few fun easter eggs/achievements that can be found by clicking on random things like a fish in the sea. It has no use or anything, but it's cute nevertheless.I think I've told you pretty much everything there is to tell about Kingdom Rush by now. Kingdom Rush is a brilliant game that needs all of our support. Like, right now. Go get it ![Rating: 87/100]"

It is common to play 20 minutes on a level, only to lose on the last wave because you were unaware what was coming, then you have to replay that entire 20 minutes in order to try again the part you didn't pass. Fail again, spend another 20 minutes getting back to that point.I have almost 50 hours played, of which 25 is probably replaying the same thing I did over and over to finish a last wave.

For each of the 13 levels, there are three available modes (plus two game modes: Easy and Normal) — Campaign, Heroic, and Iron; every level also has their own restrictions that decide which towers you can use and the max level they can be upgraded. The Campaign mode provides 20 lives, but Heroic and Iron mode offers only one life, essentially making the game many times harder.There are four tower types — Archer Towers, Barracks, Mage Guilds, and Artillery Cannons. There are also eight tower upgrades that vary from Rangers to Barbarians. In addition, there are also 18 tower abilities that you can equip including Teleport, Poison, and Sniper Shot.There are 30 monsters that range from Ogres and Yetis to Necromancers and Demon Hounds. Many people have a hard time memorizing each enemy’s ability, so there’s a handy Encyclopedia for the incompetent.The best part ofKingdom Rushis the visuals. In fact, the graphics are enjoyable to watch. Whether its mages dropping a lethal curse on crazed ogres, or troops in hand-to-hand combat with demon dogs, it’s a visual treat. On that note, the SFX are definitely worth mentioning, because when you activate Reinforcements, for example, a great voice actor actually yells out “Reinforcements!”, which is a great add-on to the experience.Kingdom Rushis one of the best tower defense experiences I've played.

Easy to learn, fun to play, goofy little animations, and lots of humor -- the dwarves that man the Tesla generators are especially hilarious (""Toasty!"").  Towers are upgradable with lots of cool options.  The only thing that's weird about this game is its difficulty curve.  There are three difficulty settings: casual, normal, and hard.  I played the entire campaign on normal and got 3 stars on most of the missions without too much difficulty.  However, once you beat the normal campaign it unlocks a bunch of bonus missions...and this is where the difficulty suddenly ramps up.  I couldn't beat most of these on ""normal"".  On ""casual"" some of them are still insanely hard, while others are totally managable.  Other than that, it's a great game.  It only cost me a few bucks and it's given me 19 hours of fun already.

If you're unsure about paying $10 ($9.99) for a game, try it free online in a web browser.  The money you spend on steam gives you access to a much better engine (rather than playing on flash).  The game runs smoother.  In addition, you have access to heroes and Ironhide Game Studio (the publisher/developer) has reported the expansion content will come at no additional costs once completed.As others have said, I first played this game on a tablet.  I'm not a fan of microtransactions.  It upset me to see awesome content (like heroes) which I had to pay to use.  This has all been fixed in the steam version.  People might argue well what's the difference between micro transactions and buying a game?  Either way you are still paying money.  The difference is one group of people doesn't have an advantage over others (granted not an issue in a single player game) and I know how much I'm paying up front.  Microtransactions can add up real quick and before you know it, you've spent more than the $10 it costs to buy the game on steam.  Thank you Ironhide for listening to your fan base and bringing this to steam."

Also they even change the level art, so that it's clear that the battle is happening after your previous battle on the level, which is nice.As for negative comments-I feel the tesla tower is a bit disproportionally powerful, leading to less freedom in tower selection than seems appropriate (I doubt there's any level that couldnt be beaten simply by focussing on tesla towers (money allowing) - this is not true of other towers)-There's a bug with the credit scroll speed once you've beated the first part of the game."

As a port of a mobile tower defense game I didn't have high hopes, but it exceeded my expectations. The sound and graphics are smooth and appropriate and work well together.There really isn't that much new or original here. They didn't really rock the genre. But itisextremely well-executed. And there's even a bit of story thrown in if you're willing to read the descriptions of each level, which shows some extra thought and care that went in to constructing the game world.That said it's not without problems. The first is just that there are some glitches that pop up. Most are related to achievements (perhaps because they didn't exist in the mobile version?) but there are a few game breaking ones. At one point enemies just stopped coming for me. I walked away and came back a few minutes later and they still weren't there. The game wasn't frozen - I could still interact with it, the enemies just never came, and therefore I had no choice but to restart the entire level.And the game sorely needs a fast-forward or speed up button. If you're doing really well and planned things out then enemies can seem aganozingly slow and waiting for them becomes annoying. As this sort of feature is pretty standard within the genre I'm honestly surprised that it's nowhere to be found in Kingdom Rush.Also the difficulty in some of the DLC levels is simply far too high. Most of the normal levels felt challenging while fair, but a couple of the last DLC levels got very frustrating and made me feel stuck. It's never a good feeling to work for a long time on a level and have no progress to show for it.The RPG elements and some of the quirky towers and sound bites are definitely pluses. Along with the different hero choices and large replayability offered by needing to complete levels multiple times, I'd definitely recommend it if you like a simple version of a polished tower defense game."

I know it took them a long time to roll it out, but I hope the proof of the market helps them to roll out Kingdom Rush Frontiers even faster. No offense to mobile and tablet releases, but they suck, and I enjoy sitting at my computer with my face glued to my screen and not to my phone (I'll save that rant for another review).

The combat functions ads a suprising amount of tactical depth and interactivity to the game. The challenge maps force you to raise the bar in your tactics and force you to think differently about the courses, which is what challenge maps SHOULD do. The difficulty curve does spike later on but the fact that you can increase your upgrades via completion of challenge maps makes you revisit old maps before completing all the normal maps and can actually teach you important tactics. All in all a solid game with great art style, and ultimately a good pick."

I feel there is some game ballencing issues, As you move on, It feels like it's getting easyer, Then one level will catch you out and keep you annoyed for hours.I like the creation and use of Heros, But after the first run of levels you will never get to use tham again, I like the skill tree, But you can max out everything quite early and from that point on only have stars saved up for what?!?I will always reccomend this game, But for every good point I can think of, I see a bad point to counteract this.I personally give this a 6/10 Easy is not easy."

I have it on my phone (and its expansion as well!) and now I have it on my Steam account.This is a tower defense games with quite a relatively small arsenal of towers compared to other tower defense games (4 basic tower types that eventually branch out into 8 different towers at maximum upgrade level). However, despite its simple mechanics, the variety of enemies as well as the level design actually contribute to a very fun game. The great cartoon art as well as a number of memorable voice acting lines don't hurt, as well. (""Reinforce!"")For those not in the know, there are free versions written in Flash that you can access at the above websites, and are available for very cheap (~$1) on mobile. This Steam game is a complete rewrite of the game using Unity. Why should you care about buying this when you can get it for cheaper elsewhere? There are a multitude of reasons, so read on and judge for yourself.* No microtransactions. The most noticeable difference is that you can get all the heroes on Steam just by playing, whereas on mobile and the Flash versions, you will have to spend way more money than what the Steam version costs to get all of the heroes beyond the three that you unlock with game progression. Granted, the game is designed in such a way that you don't really need to buy heroes to win. (As a note, it appears that the last three heroes have not yet been released on Steam, but will appear in a future update.)* High-def art and full-screen resolution. The overworld map is much more stylized and beautifully detailed than the other versions. If you don't like playing on a small Flash window or a small mobile screen, the Steam version might be for you.* Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. If you're into these, then this game is for you. The achievements are of particular note; it is actually not difficult to achieve them, only time-consuming (for a few of them, at least).* Premium content in terms of maps. There are a bunch of levels and mini-campaigns in this version that you needed to purchase in the other versions. Also, an exclusive campaign will be released in a future update.Once again, use your best judgment as to the choice between free and paid versions. My recommendation, however, is BUY this amazing game and support the developers."

It is a clever tower defence packed with original graphic style and mechanics that demands creative and truly strategic approach to the game. I really liked these small Easter eggs that you can find on different levels. Some of the levels allow extra opportunities like freeing a giant yeti that will help your towers in fighting incoming waves of enemies.There is a decent variety of enemies. Sometimes they spam you with their numbers. On other occasions they regenerate health or ignore certain types of damage. There are few to none universal combinations of towers - you will have to be always ready to send reinforcements and upgrade your towers.All in all, no map seems to repeat others, every level is intriguing and intense.I am really sad that developers couldn’t port the sequels (Kingdom Rush Frontiers and Kingdom Rush Origins) to PC.

They have limited strategic depth and they feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. Yet, Kingdom Rush offers a lot more than that. With 8 different towers, some of which are completely new to the genre, heroes, interesting bosses, challenging levels, all make you play a tower defense game for 30+ hours. You can't find anyone on the internet that can say Kingdom Rush is not fun.However this is an expanded version of a game that was already available on Armor games (flash), IOS and Android.The flash version is basicly free with some content unlockable with money (and some not existing), and mobile versions are $0.66, again with content unlockable content with money (but all the content exists in this version).I wrote this before on the forums, I can paste here as well. Here are the differences of the Steam version from flash and mobile versions:* The graphics (map and battle) are enhanced compared to other versions. There are a few minor control additions.* There are no micro transaction in the steam version. Meaning, there's nothing you can buy in-game even if you want to.* Not all content is unlocked from day 1. You unlock everything by playing through.There's no other way in the steam version.* In the Steam version, there are stuff that are not present on the Armor games version. The same stuff is present on the mobile version but is subject to extra money - which sums up to way higher than $10. So if you want to play with stuff (some heroes and some extra levels) not present, mobile or flash versions will be cheaper for you. If you want all the stuff in, Steam version will be cheaper for you.* In the Steam version, when you finish the 12 level main campaign, you unlock 2 x 2 level mini-campaigns + 3 other solo levels. Most of these levels contan unique bosses.* Buyers of the Steam version are also promised one more 2 level mini campaign, another solo level, a new full campaign with unknown number of new levels, new towers, 3 new heroes for FREE. These are labeled as coming soon.* Kingdom Rush Frontiers is not included in the Steam version, neither is promised for free. It will probably be either a paid expansion or a standalone game if it ever gets released on Steam."

If you have not and you are looking at Kingdom Rush as your first foray in to the tower defense genre, you should buy this game and I will give a short, very basic run down of tower defense games for newcomers. Essentially, TD games boil down to this; build towers (your defenses) to stop the increasingly difficult waves of enemies reaching your base. You will start each level with a set amount of lives and 1 live is equal to 1 enemy making it through all of your defenses and reaching your base.  In Kingdom Rush you are able to build a variety of different towers from archer towers, wizard towers, cannon's and a barracks.  All of these towers can be upgraded, for example a Wizard Tower can be upgraded to have spells which teleport enemies further back down the path to give you some more time to deal damage.The art style is great and it compliments the game very well, In my opinion.The audio is nice and at times it can be pretty funny.  Hearing your soldiers from the Barracks yelling ""Freedom!"" or your Wizard Tower shouting ""Might and Magic!"" adds something to the game.All of the content is unlocked within this one purchase and there is no microtransactions to be seen here.  All heroes are unlocked by simply playing through the campaign.On the main game screen, a new area with new levels will be added in eventually.  However, this has apparently been there for months and no update has appeared as of yet.This game is easy to learn but it can be extremely difficult to master.  The difficulty can ramp up fairly quickly, so make sure to pay attention to what the earlier levels teach you about your towers.I highly recommend this game, one of the best TD games there is."

No change... So I went back to hard... No change... There was/is no visable change in difficulty from ""casual"" to ""hard""... First problemSecond Problem: So after figuring out that difficulty wasn't going to change anything I tried the map a few more times until finally I crushed the map with a configuration... So I replayed the map trying other configurations and nope... got crushed... So I went online and, you guessed it... For most maps there are maybe 1-3 different ways to beat the map shown in a ""memorized placement"" style of gameplay... Now to give you an idea of how frustrating this can be, you are placed on a map with around 6-12 places to build with 4 different buildings to choose from with 2 variations each... This ""trial and error"" could and literally would take more than a dozen reloads before finally figuring out.Third Problem: You have no idea what is going to spawn before it spawns and those defenses only do well vs a single type of enemy... Yep, so they could spawn a million spiders on wave one so you drop some archers down only to have them spawn entirely archer resistent troops on wave two and you guessed it... RELOAD TIME!What these three problems create is an UNFORGIVABLY frustrating experience that frankly IS NOT FUN! You want to play this game? Literally look up the guide in Steam, watch the video where he shows you the correct placement of towers click ""go"" and win... I mean, you can spend hours in trial and error trying to figure out that one correct placement of towers on your own but you will find yourself with the same positions at some point regardless!The game played gorgeous, the addition of movable heroes was brilliant, the gameplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Period.PS.

If anyone else can think of more negatives I will add them, as issues are resolved I will take them off the listing.1) The game does not have a send next wave hotkey yet, this is quite annoying especially when you are trying to get those few extra seconds to cooldown your meteor strike.2) Game still does not have cooldown timers for reinforcements and meteor strike within a seconds counter, you have to guess at how much longer.3) Heroes do not gain and keep levels (some may like them loosing it every time I do not)4) Their is no way that I know of to preview the skills of the heroes before taking them into battle, I should be able to see how much actual life, dmg, shielding, and such that they have instead of once again having to guess.5) Some heroes are still subpar (mainly the melee heroes) they need some love.6) You can not access achievements, encyclopedia during battle, I personally don't remember all the weaknesses to the enemies.7) The vetern mode has been taken out of this version of the game, I know some people maybe happy about this, but if I have to replay a lvl I did once before I usually want to do it in vet mode for that last star I missed the time before.8) Encylopdia does not have the ability to roll over a skill for one of your towers and see what it does.9) Hugely limited on the button commands, I do have a keyboard and 2 mouse buttons please give more hotkeys and possibly a use for the right mouse button or at least make it so I can customize the controls, would be awesome if I could do everything with my mouse.10) No benefit from having bought the game on other devices, would be nice if the devs would have given us more of a discount for being loyal customers, many people have bought this game on multiple platforms. Least give us a bonus level or two or something with game launch."

A MUST HAVE for any tower defense geek.Yes it can be played for free on Armor Games and other sites but the free version does not come with all content.

They scaled or remade them properly!- Actually requires you to think about what towers you will be placing and where you place your defenders.- Hero's & bosses.- Upgrades (we all love upgrades through game-progress).- Allows you to start waves early.Negatives (at the time of writing, which is shortly after they released is on steam):- Lots of bugs including levels where the bosses get stuck or become unkillable. On some computers it doesn't even seem to be playable at all.- In my opinion the controls are horrible. As if they ported it on a really cheap budget.

Great, colorful graphics and animation, high polish!Lets see about those towers! 4 towers, 3 upgrades each and 2 ""Ultimate"" upgrade choices for each tower. And every Ultimate tower has at least 2 abilities that you can purchase! To give an example: the Archer tower shoots rapidly at land or air targets and has a good range. Every upgrade increases range and damage and upon reaching Ultimate level you can choose to turn it into a Ranger tower or a Sharpshooter tower! The Ranger tower has Roots  that can AoE stun and damage many enemies around it and Poison Arrows that deal a potent DoT to whatever they hit. The Sharpshooter tower has the longest range in the game and gets Headshot that deals massive damage or outright 1-hit KOs an enemy and Shrapnel Blast that deals massive AoE damage.Thats just the Archer tower! The other 3 tower types all have their upgrades and 2 Ultimate tower choices!Now, we also have to talk about the Barracks towers. Kingdom Rush was pretty much the pioneer of the barracks type towers in which actual squads of soldiers will come out of them and stand on the creep paths. These soldiers will then block/stop enemies from moving while they do battle! You can, in an area, choose where the squads will gather to protect certain parts of the path! The soldiers have their own hitpoints, damage and once upgarded to their Ultimate forms they can gain all sorts of special attacks and defensive abilities!The enemies are also increadibly varied and Kingdrom Rush sports some of the most interesting enemy types out there. Seriously, they send a new type of enemy at you on almost EVERY single level. Every 5 or so levels you'll get a boss battle and ooooh boy some of them are pretty intense.You also get special Heroes that you unlock as you progress through the campaign and they each have at least 2 special abilites. For example Alera Windrunner summons a tanky sabrecat and has a multishot ability that fires 4-5 arrows at groups of enemies. Heroes can level up to 10 in every battle and will do more damage and power up their abilites. You can freely move them about the battlefield to help out where its most needed!Whew, well, don't want to make this much longer so I'll just say that if you like TD games you really can't go wrong with Kingdom Rush unless you absolutely have to have tower mazing - of which their is none in Kingdom Rush. The Steam version comes with all DLC unlocked and will be strongly supported by the devs with new content and goodies!"

,Recommended,246420,8616491,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,SusieQ,"I have played this game on Kongregate, iOS (both iPad and iPhone versions), and now this Steam version as well.First of all, if you haven't played Kingdom Rush before, why not? This is a great Tower Defense style game that has all the usual elements you'd expect, such as upgradable ""towers."" Sure, there's only four different kinds, but they all serve the traditional TD roles, and you have some choices in how to upgrade them as well through the gold you earn in battle and the stars you earn from beating levels. The gameplay itself can be a bit difficult, especially as you progress to later levels, but it is never unfairly challenging in my opinion. The cartoony art style may or may not be likeable, depending on personal tastes, but the graphics are certainly done well. Plenty of content here for people to enjoy given the cost of the game.Now that we've established that the game is a good tower defense game, there's ultimately the question of which platform to buy it on. There's always the free version that (I think) is still available on Kongregate, but it is a simpler, older version of this game that most likely will not be updated anymore. There's also the iOS/Android(?) versions that cost $1.99/$3.99 or something around there for the base game. If you just want to just play the game, both of those versions are probably ""good enough"" versions for the casual gamer.However, this Steam version does have some goodies that, personally, made it a buy for me. There are the promised extra levels and heroes, which are coming soon, and that's certainly nice, especially since they won't be available on other platforms. All the heroes that cost money in the mobile versions are also available for ""free"" (well, you have to buy the game obviously) here, which saves quite a bit of money (buying all the heroes on iOS costs well over $20, for example). Even though the graphics are technically not any different, they do run at 60 fps, as long as you have a decent enough computer.What if you already own the mobile versions? Is this new version worth getting? Again, the promised extra content might be nice, though its obviously not completely clear how good it will be. I would personally suggest that you try the Kongregate version first or the iOS version when on sale so that you get an idea of how much you like the game. If you like those versions, I would suggest getting it on Steam, as it will eventually have new content that you might enjoy as long as you like the rest of the game.To bring this long review to an end, Kingdom Rush is a fantastic game. The only decision you really have to make is which platform to get it for. If you are short on money or just want to dip your toes in casually, so to speak, the Kongregate and iOS versions offer a good enough experience for you. If however, you want the complete (eventually) experience or just want to support the developers, get the Steam version. Either way, play the game!"

All quite nicely balanced: you won't be hard pressed to abuse every single option given to you in a level, but it'll require thinking and planning to get a level right (especially so on challenge levels)."

Best of all its not addicting because of some grinding or some nasty up leveling rpg mechanic. No. Its addicting because it is so good. Oh and it has a great amount of content. I especially love that there's a difficulty setting and that you can play each level 3 times with different waves and conditions.Only bad thing about it is the lack of a speed up function. Some x2 game speed button. I could not find anything else that I find bad about it. Apart from it being done at some point perhaps?A minor design ""flaw"" I see in the lack of target priorities for towers. Quite often powerful shots are wasted on worthless targets. Or splash damage towewrs target single units instead of the blob next ot it. But thats almost nitpicking.I spent 50 hours in here and had a blast.

Hopefully it'll be improved with the next few updates.Uniquely cartoonish art style with bright colors, intense but untiring music, and all those lines and quotes always keep you entertained in its easy, funny way.

It was a fantasy tower defence game and it started out as a Flash game and later on it camed to app and to Steam. Steam is a little bit better than Flash because it had more levels and towers were fixed. The game had memorable enemies, memorable towers, good Music, allot of refences (like Bombardiers said Hail To The King Baby) and also had Landskapes that fit well with fantasy. The Villian Vez´nan is a stereotypical villian but i still loved him, i mean he doesnt do anything and sends his enemies but my good his a fan Of Many Villians and Dark side users. His the icon of the entire Kingdom Rush Series and had many appearances in other video games like ToToTemple. You can also get steam cards wich has only 5 cards to make a stamp. Big bertha is my favorite tower not because it has Rockets and looks better than tesla its because it wrecked the entire enemies and i use tesla when dealing with Hordes of enemies but most of the time you need to use Tesla.Pros+Good level design+Good music+Memorable enemies+Steam Cards+Towers are great+Even More Memorable Villian Vez´nan+Good graphics+Funny+You can fully complete the entire AchievementsCons-Heroes (the only best heroes out there are Oni, Hacksaw and Elonora)-Some towers are overpowered like Sorcerers and Tesla-Some towers are least used like Big Bertha and Musketeers-Early levels music is pretty blandThats all to say but ill have to say Its actualy my opinion the best tower defence game of all time and later on theres gonna be a sequel.

This game is polished to a shine, and balanced to perfection. Being a big fan of Tower Defense games, balance is always an issue for me. Not so here. Everything has been carefully weighed and priced (via gold to buy towers) to make it seem tough but fair. The early levels teach you everything, and it slowly escelates into an all-out rage-war that will leave you screaming and hitting the ""try again"" button because you were so close to winning that time. Its addictive, has a steady (though unforgiving near the end) learning curve, and the boss characters that show up are just amazing. Its packed with easter eggs (perhaps a few too many, each tower has recognizable lines and there are things hidden on EVERY map), good dialogue and excellent voice acting. You even unlock more levels when the campaign is over. Worth every penny of my mere $10 that I had to pay to get it. Two thumbs WAY way up, this is a buy!EDIT (After Finishing the Game)=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=So, having finally finished 100% of the game, gotten all the achievements and such, I have to lean back and philosophize for a bit. So, what is the general thought when it comes to this game as a whole? I wonder why barracks just become useless over time. That's 1/4 of the game right there. I wonder how much work went into balancing such a wonderful game, and how many hours got devoted to making it just so, because it shows and I love it. I still like to gush over the Citedal, Fungal Forest and the Rotten woods-- those are my favorite levels by far.My favorite hero is Thor, though to beat some of the harder levels you simply have to change heroes. Which makes sense, I think.I got over 40hrs of solid entertainment out of this, and it is certainly worth ever penny I paid for it. A gold standard of the genre."

(note to devs - make heros upgrade as you level?)but still a fun little turret game to sink a few hours into if you want, so yeah, I reccomend this game."

,Recommended,246420,8658499,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,Lillieah,"What can I say about this game other than its fantastic. The version created for steam trumps the iOS version by far, with no additional costs for heroes, premium content or microtransactions, if you're a TD type of person or ever thought you wanted to give it a try, the Steam version of Kingdom Rush is for you.Let me begin on the first day I was introduced to the flash version of this game I ended up being hooked. It was so easy to get into, gave me hours of entertainment and laughs and even some aggrivation whilst trying to figure out how to complete each level with 3 stars. By the time I had finished the original campaign mode of the 12 levels, I couldn't believe that a game such as this one, with the graphics, gameplay, voice acting, music score and overall enjoyability, was free! I felt like it should've been worth something!Which is what happened with the iOS version. However... I'm not a fan of purchasing a game only to have a ton of microtransactions needed for the full experience. Premium content wasn't included, no heroes etc. That wasn't a good way to go about it in my books at least. Left much to be desired...That is why the day it released on steam I had no reservations or hesitation on buying it and diving right back into it. Now it included all the premuim content and all the heroes and has a promise of more to come ontop of that!The Steam version's gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. I only had one hiccough on an Iron Challenge level with a certain enemy getting stuck on the edge of the map for a few attempts. The issue eventually resolved itself, but Iron Hide has been very good about providing bug fixes to this game in a timely matter so I expect that'll be fixed over soon.The graphics for this game are fantastic! Each level has its own attention to detail, the NPC's and enemy's movements are smooth and while some might argue the cartoonish animation is childish and unappealing, I beg to differ! I absolutely love it!The sound in this game is amazing! The music in this game is simply stellar. It brings the right amount of emotion to each level. When I hear the boss music que up, I always felt my pulse quicken and the sense of urgency rise as if I needed to pump up my offense and defense and quickly! Any game thats able to do that with a simple musical score is worth your time to look at. Not to mention the voice acting! I nearly died the first day I upgraded my Dwarven artillery to the Big Bertha, added a rocket only to hear ""Yippie Kai-yay mother *BEEP""! I remember going out of my way to upgrade my dwarven towers just to be able to hear that one line over and over. And still to this day I get a giggle out of it.I just finished this game 100% now on all levels and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I had hours, hours of enjoyment! And I will definitely play it again and again, not just because I want to see how I could complete each level with different strategies, but because it is simply fun!So granted there are some bugs with the game so far, the purchase price of 10 bucks is so worth it! I mean, there are so many people who are willing to throw 50 bucks or more out the window for games that are absolute garbage and here you have the chance to get a great game with high replay value for 10 bucks! It has great graphics, great music, great acting... you can't get much better than that!"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

This is the actual in-game map. The difference being that it is animated in game.Excellent challenge level - the basic campaign was finished by myself and my wife with equal level of enjoyment. Then the game offered us - with a free update - additional minibosses on the same map. The challenge there spiked and it was precisely what we needed after killing the main baddie.Excellent enemy design - regular armored guys, spider queens spawning spiderlings as they go, flying enemies... I could go on, but this would spoil your fun. Go there, prepare your defenses and patch them up in panic mode as something unexpected happens.Excellent level design - levels start out linear, only to quickly become mazes with multiple entry points and tunnels. This forced me to rethink my defenses many times. Rarely there is a single chokepoint that one can fortify the hell out of and win the game.Good for all ages - friendly graphics and very user-friendly interface are what makes this game good for different players. You can be a hardcore guy like me, doing all challenges on all levels, or as my wife who plays as much as I but casually. Nobody gets lost in the interface, graphics do not mislead.Many save slots - I like the fact that game does not mix saves together. 1st save is mine, 2nd my wife's. We can play the same game and not overwrite our progress.Game rewards dedication - finishing a level perfectly gives more upgrade points used to improve your towers. Then there are two additional, optional challenges for each level, totalling to additional 66% of value of the original, perfect score. What I am saying here is: if you buckle down and finish additional challenges then you can upgrade your towers more for the later stages.I bought this game, I bnought Kingdom Rush: Frontiers as soon as it appeared.

I blew through the whole thing within the span of a couple of days. I was browsing around Steam when I found this here, and asked myself, ""Why would anyone buy this? Don't they know it's free at Armor Games?""Well, I did some reading, and supposedly they added some content and some DLC, so I went ahead and bought it. After all, even if the extra content was bogus, it was still an amazing game worth paying for, and I definitely wanted to support these guys. I was pleasantly surprised with how gracefully the game aged. They applied a fresh coat of HD paint to the game, and addedHeroes, whom you pick up along the way.Heroes aren't just a gimmick either- they add to the game in a way that the game actually really benifits from. You select one before your battle, and you can guide your hero around the battlefield wherever they're needed most, which gives you more to do than just sit there and watch your towers work. In fact, I completely forgot about the reinforcements button after the addition of Heroes.As my favorite Tower-Defense title, let me tell you that if you played it for free at Armor Games, it's still entirely worth the buy, especially right now since it's marked down by 25%. Great work Iron Hide. I'm completely happy with my purchase, and I encourage anyone who's looking for a charming but challenging Tower Defense game to give this one a whirl."

It is an interesting, unique take on tower defense with lots of fun to be had. However I can't recommend this to anyone for a lot of reasons.First of all it's a mobile game that was ported to PC and it was ported very poorly. It is riddled with a lot of little bugs that hurt your ability to play the game on PC. One example is the poisoned arrows upgrade for ranger towers should always prioritize non-poisoned targets over poisoned ones, and should also prioritize targets that CAN be poisoned over targets that are immune. Well, they don't in the PC version. This bug has existed since release and was never fixed. It changes your strategy for dealing with some things because on the mobile version when it's working perfectly the poison upgrade makes the tower shoot necromancers only, ignoring the skeleton swarms around them, to kill them off so they stop summoning more. In the buggy, broken PC version they shoot skeletons and the skeletons are immune to poison altogether.Second, it is unsupported. It will never have any of it's bugs fixed, it will never have any additional content added. The developers used this as a one-time cash grab and now they have washed their hands of steam altogether. The mobile version has an endless mode where you can just go wave after wave until you're defeated and let you try to get on the leaderboard for having the best strategy. PC version didn't deserve this feature in any form. Very disappointing since it's the most fun part of the game on mobile after you ""finish"" it.Third, you can play this game for free in flash online on many different websites. The flash version has 3 of the heroes in this version, but allows you to purchase additional heroes for money. However these additional heroes are entirely not needed, the ones you are given for free are more than enough to complete the game on the hardest difficulty in every mode. This version only has about 7 or 8 levels that the completely free version doesn't have, and again, you can purchase those bonus levels if you desire.Despite playing the flash version, when I saw this on steam I bought it up quickly because I loved the game and thought I was buying something worth buying. But after the fact I found out they won't be fixing any of the bugs, they won't be adding endless feature, and they're also not adding the newer kingdom rush games to steam or PC at all, and lost all faith in the company and am sorry to have given them a single cent of my money. But it won't happen again.So to summarize, everything enjoyable about the game you can play for free online, buying it here only gets you bugs and problems and less features."

The information may not be correct anymore and apparently they have patched things into the game since.  Please keep that in mind when reading this review!  I still recommend the mobile version thoughoriginal review:The mobile version of this is far superior.  They've taken the microtransactions out of the original game(Frontiers still has them) and the ability to earn the gems as you play to get useful items to make the harder levels more manageable is nice.  Something on top to earn even if you don't perfect a level.  The PC version not only lacks these(I can't imagine trying some of the endgame bonus levels on hard without at least one extra gold bag to start me off with or an ice wand), but it also has frankly unacceptable load times, with the average for me being 45 seconds or so.  Which is ridiculous for a glorified flash game/mobile game on a pretty strong PC.  Being able to hotkey reinforcements and such is a plus, but it doesn't outweigh the handiness of the touchscreen.  I made it a bit over halfway through the campaign before deciding the PC version's not my thing.Get the mobile version.  IOS or Android, either one is fantastic.  I would recommend not getting this on PC though."

However, you get almost as much with Kingdom Rush (the free flash game or the iOS $1 version) or Kingdom Rush Frontiers. This game's difficulty starts off painfully easy, then quickly escalates to agonizingly hard. The strategy guides (Yeah, I watched them. This game is HARD!) on the official website are for the wrong version of the game, so they don't always work (such as, in the final levels, the player in the video uses premium content exclusive to the free flash version). I love this game, and would play it for hours, but it has very limited gameplay unless you are very good at it. Don't waste your money; get it on iOS instead."

Some try to be visually fun, some think they need to add something to the genre and some feel like a simple flash games.  Replace ""some"" with ""this game"" and you've got a grammatically difficult sentence that is accurate none the less.The flash game references is a little unfair, as this game really does have solid visuals and quality execution, but at the same time it seems that there's nothing it gained from being a standalone game apart from the ability to charge people for it.Kingdom Rush is fixed position tower defense with the addition of a ""hero"" that can roam around the battle field (at your direction) and activated abilities to throw down some temporary defenses or a fireball from the heavens.  Progressing is had during the rounds by upgrading your towers and your hero leveling up (levels that only persist for each game) 'causing him/her to do more damage and have a greater amount of hitpoints.  Progression out of game is served by spending stars (1, 2, or 3 stars are given for successful completion of a level, based on how well you did) to increase the strength of towers or powers.In total, there are about twenty levels with your typical late-game unlocks for harder mobs or sudden death (single life) runs in that level.  Level design has your typical duel entry, duel exit, splits, joins, bypasses that you've seen in other fixed map tower defense games.Kingdom Rush is unexcitingly typical tower defense.  It may sate that occasional tower defense game, and while it may be a fun play on a tablet, that'd only if you compare it to the poor quality of the tower defense in the Android and iOS ecosystems.  I'd call this a buy at $3.  It's well drawn, but simple.  Level designs lack inspiration.  Progression lacks anything new or intriguing.Visuals 5Gameplay 4Slant 3Overall : 40"

It has 4 possible towers and all the positions for tower placements are made for you.There is an archer tower which fires fast but does light damage, mage tower which pirces armor units, siege towers which do aoe splash, and barracks which produce units to block creeps.There is no slow towers so you have to rely on barracks to block creeps so your other towers can do something. Barracks only spawn 3 units so if there are more than 3 creeps coming then they will walk on by. The siege towers are useless because of the lack of slow. There is no point in aoe in this game. The mage towers are also lacking since they are much slower than the archers and armored units are few and far between. The strategy is reduced to spaming archer towers and barracks. Pretty boring.It does have hero units ala some Warcraft 3 td maps but you bearly control it. You tell it where to stand and it does everything else on its own.You have 2 hero powers. One to spawn 2 units and the other to summon a small firestorm. Both of these powers quickly become useless unless you upgrade them. However, upgrading them means you arent upgrading your towers which makes it stupid.The story is nothing to talk about. Its toled through about 2 sentences before every mission. Throw away.All in all this TD is extremly basic and really shows its mobile origin. If you love TDs you might be ok picking it up on sale for a buck but otherwise leave it be."

I played Kingdom Rush online and beat it several times, including all the challenges at different difficulty levels.  But this port to the PC has not only removed some of the more interesting aspects of the game, but they apparently decided to ramp up the difficulty to an impossible level.I'm not a beginner at Tower Defense.  I've played and beaten just about all the TD games on Steam, but this game is just relentless.  Even worse, while the old online version allowed you multiple strategies to victory, I'm becoming convinced that each stage has only one layout that can be successful.I am maxed out on stars (as much as I can get) on the Dark Tower map and I cann't defeat this stupid wizard that I used to destroy online.  So I turn it all the way down to casual.  It STILL doesn't help.So after having to play through 4 different defeats after 15 waves each (let's say wasting 20 minutes a pop) with different tower layouts I have no choice but to look up a walkthrough to see the one and only solution the developers obviously wanted me to use.I guess in the age of Dark Souls and Super Meatboy you can forgive the devs for thinking that hard=great.  But I bought this game to support them since I enoyed their online offering so much, not to smash my head against the wall in frustration because I haven't solved this puzzle game masquerading as RTS Tower Defense.Very, very disappointed.And it's one thing to 'git gud', but it's something else to be force to either grind endlessly in a vain attempt to unlock the single loadout that will lead to victory on CASUAL or just have to learn the combo from the internet, thereby defeating the fun of a tower defense game.  Also, thanks devs for not allowing saves anytime.  I love playing 15 long waves over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  Just couldn't code that in, huh?"

You just choose one and position it around the map. This kind of change was carried over to all parts of the game I feel. Most in-game tower upgrades are ineffectual, as are the out-of-game upgrades you spend points to unlock. I never felt like anything I did made my game any different from anyone elses. This would would have been fine if thats the kind of experience they were aiming for, but based on its predessor, and how many different methods they have the potential to allow customization in, it seems more like a badly executed RPG system, not a well balanced even-playing field kind of thing."

,Recommended,246420,11972272,"Posted: 3 September, 2014",all,Donkonky,"The truth is that I have had neither the patience nor the skill to become a decent player with other attempts at various Tower Defence games. The difficulty of the TD genre  is well known, and just like a MOBA (but in a different way of course) the learning curve is as steep as it is long.This is the first, and perhaps most significant, success of Kingdom Rush. It eases you into the difficulty, being neither pedantic at your noobishness nor too quick to assume you've picked up the knack. This is not a polite way of saying ""it's easy so I like it"": I've been beaten by it on multiple times, but only because I've done something wrong or miss-timed a tower upgrade.Its other positives are numerous and substantial. The art is blissfully cartoony and likeable whilst never being too childish or stupid. It has many references to other games and films, and although some of them are a tad clichéd, they still raise a laugh or two (""THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!"" being a tickler) But most of all, it's a joy to play. When those 3 stars pop up after a perfectly handled wave, you feel a great and long lasting sense of accomplishment. Fending off the numerous and widely varied enemies is great fun: watching hordes of Bandits and Goblins crumble in seconds to allow your towers to focus on a lumbering (and hilariously cute) Ogre really gives the player a sense of ebb and flow which continues to grow in vigorousness and length as you venture deeper into the campaign.To summarise, Kingdom Rush is brilliant and enjoyable game. Whilst purists of the genre may argue it is a little simpler than some of its peers, I feel this is no bad thing. It pulls off a balancing act of fun and challenge that very few games even get close to mimicking.Highly recommended to all."

The Steam version plays great with a mouse, and plays just as well on my Surface 2 Pro tablet, using the touchscreen.  This version of the game is a little different than the iOS version.  There are not 3 difficuly settings per level/game mode here.  There is also no Store to buy power ups, and you don't earn gems from completing levels, to buy said power-ups.  However, this version allows you to unlock all the Heroes, through completing levels, and there are no in app purchases in this version, which was required to acquire the majority of the Heroes on iOS.  That being said, this version is tuned a little differently, which i liked, since it took me a few weeks to complete all the levels.....where as you could do so, in just a few days on iOS.  I'm looking forward to the coming updates to this game, and curious if the sequel will be released on Steam too.If you like good tower defense games, you will love this gem.

I'd like to say it's completely worth the purchase, just to get away from being a browser-based game (which I hate, to begin with).  I hadn't played the original before this version, so I offer no insight into improvements/changes, but, this game is definitely good enough that I will buy the sequel when it arrives (all while ignoring the browser based version).I am no expert on TDs, by any means, but I found that this one offers good challenge mixed with the option of improving your ""build"" by completing harder versions of a mission.  I managed to beat every level on every difficulty without youtubing, which I consider a bit of an accomplishment.  But, for those wanting to do this... there are two levels in particular that are going to leave you scratching your head on how to conquer one of the expert versions of.  One of the levels feels more like luck to beat than skill, but I'll leave it at that.In conclusion, however, if you do not own this game and have not played the browser version, or want a better platform from which to play a good version; definitely buy this game."

However, when I found out it had been greenlit on steam and there was going to be a full HD version with everything included plus bonus content I knew I had to buy it. Only thing is that a sequel is already out on iOS, Android and flash game websites but not steam. If you are going to charge more for the game on steam then these other mediums then steam should have priority, or at least close release date (ATM it's been 8 months and still no news).Other then that the game is amazing. The cartoon graphics and animations are sweet, the game is easy to learn but hard to master. While it does get challenging it's not unplayable, just tactical (i'm on about the extra hard modes).

The gameplay is fun, some maps are actually tricky, and overall it's pretty well balanced and fair (just ignore the usual forum grumbling of people that don't really pay attention to the enemies and then die to them).It's a kind of mix between the more passive tower defenses (build everything, watch) and the active ones (build stuff to slow enemies, then mainly kill enemies yourself, such as Dungeon Defenders) and hits a pretty sweet spot there. Your main interaction with the game, aside from building towers, is summoning a pair of grunts that can hold enemies back with a short cooldown, summon a small rain of fire with a long cooldown, and finally command a single hero to move around.There is no mazing, because your towers aren't built on the lane the enemies walk on, but you can also build a building which spawns soldiers, who will attempt to hold off the advancing orcs, wolves, et cetera.And it's fun. If you want a pretty relaxed tower defense game that needs you to think some, pick this one. It sure has the gameplay to be worth it."

Do you spend on the cheaper options? What about when you can branch off? Do you upgrade the barracks to barbarians or paladins?

I paid an entire $1 on Armor in order to get more points to spend and extra campaigns. yes, an entire $1. I know, it's a lot of $$, but it was worth it.Seriously though, Kingdom Rush is hands down, the absolute most fun I have ever had playing a standalone TD, flash or otherwise. The campaign is well done, well written, and so much fun to replay that I literally can not stop playing it in every version I find it in. This Steam version works perfectly, and though slightly different from the previous flash versions, in very small ways, the gameplay is flawless. You will find yourself replaying maps in order to get that perfect 3 star score, in order to use the points earned to fill out your point sheet and get better towers.I wish this version had the Hero level up system like the previous flash versions had, but it's a small quibble. Overall, this game is almost perfect as a TD. It has variety of units, variety  of strategy, and customizable towers. It has well written lore describing the situation and map for each step of the campaign. It's just a very fun TD, and one every fan of a good TD should play.As another Reviewer stated, ""Kingdom Rush is well-designed to be challenging, yet not needlessly frustrating."" Perfectly stated.  It's just hard enough that you probably won't get a perfect 3 starts your first time on any given map. Yet, you will enjoy playing it so much that you will most likely replay each map numerous times in order to get a perfect 3 star score.The art is just as enjoyable as the gameplay, though the sounds do get repetitive quickly. But that's really my only (small) complaint. Buy it, play it, love it. It's just that good."

The goofy graphics and simpler audio support this as well. That said, this is one of the best tower defense games that I have ever played. The mantra of ""keep it simple, stupid"" is extremely obvious here, and used to wonderful effect. There are only four tower types that I have discovered so far, each with a four-tier upgrade system, and the stars you unlock by completing levels actually go immediately toward your choice of upgrades. Despite being kept relatively simple, the tower abilities and upgrades allow quite a bit of customizable defense.After completing each of the basic story playthroughs, missions have challenge modes that limit your ability to use certain towers, or prevent upgrades which have been unlocked past an established tier. The challenges are just that - not insane, but not necessarily easy. Each challenge CAN be completed. I also have yet to play a normal level that feels like an unnecessary, punishing grind.For a mobile port, I'm very glad that it actually plays like PC game. Unlike others, notably the Fieldrunners series, this game does not require you to post to twitter or facebook to earn extra stars or to level yourself up more quickly.I bought this game on a whim - and I'm definitely not disappointed in the slightest."

That comes from a guy with about 200 sitting installed on his PC.Kingdom Rush offers everything I expect from a tower defense game and more; it takes the genre from the base flash games we all played in the school media center as children (which it once was- thanks to the devs, and congratulations for making it this far! I've been a fan since Armor Games.) and improves upon it to truly make it a genre and a game worthy of Steam.Kingdom rush gameplay is very entertaining, and the wide variety of towers and options made available to you in upgrades outside of levels provide for an individual experience- you decide what strategy is most important to you. Activated abilities can save your rear-end in a close call, or you can use them liberally and as a backbone of your strategy. Footmen can be deployed and placed at your command to stop incoming enemies and maximize the effectiveness of your towers. Towers all provide a wide variety of upgrade trees, allowing for many different playstyles; do you provide your footmen with stronger melee, or do you provide them with ranged abilities? Do you provide your towers that extra zap potential, or do you instead have them push enemies back down the road?Though the tower defense is at first glance a seemingly simplistic genre, Kingdom Rush makes it something you can sink days into. I've played through the full flash title, and I bought this copy because I was so fond of it. This Steam copy also provides many more levels and intricacies, such as heroes you can command and chose to fit your playstyle.Kingdom Rush also provides some astonishing art in my opinion. The game looks terrific, and has an individual indie look to it-and not the hipstery-indie kind, the genuine, we-made-this-for-fun-and-sunk-our-sweat-and-toil-into-this kind.I can't reccommend this game enough. Kingdom Rush is one of my favorites, and I hope to see more astonishing work from the devs in the future."

,Recommended,246420,13933065,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Metalsand,"A surpringly well done, fun title with touch support and actual challenge on normal mode.I searched for touch-screen capable games so I could have small games to play on my tablet.  I didn't think much of Kingdom Rush at first, because the graphics and first 5 missions made it look like a generic mobile tower defense albeit with some interesting mechanics.  However, when I got to around mission 10, I couldn't just hobble together some defenses based on my favorite tower.  I had to actually think, ""Okay, based on the mission description, what is the best combination of defenses?""Despite having most of the research points earned from previous missions, it took me almost 8 attempts to beat that mission.  It wasn't due to unfair difficulty, or personal ham-handedness.  Every attempt was me throwing together all sorts of combinations of research, towers, heroes, and progression in one strategy after another until I found a strategy that worked, and it worked WELL.  It was extremely satisfying too, because even though the strategy was refined through practice, the level was STILL challenging.  A perfect clear requires a perfect strategy, and perfect management of the map, and despite getting a 2/3 star rating it was...hectic.  There were few moments where I could simply watch the battle unfold, because there were constantly things I could be doing, whether it was reevaluating my hero/soldier placement, using abilities based on enemy type and movements, or examining my defenses to allocate funds.All in all, this game is easy to learn, hard to master.  On the surface, the mechanics are fun and simple, but if you dig deeper, you'll find that the developers have balanced every defense you have with an enemy type.  No one tower is a ""go-to"", and situations can change in the blink of an eye if you aren't careful.  I may not be much for TD games, but I highly recommend this if you like macro-managing strategy games but don't feel like playing a huge one like Sins of a Solar empire for example."

You dont maze in this one, just use the designated area's to build 4 kinds of towers.Archer, Magic, AOE and soldier towers. You can also use a hero that moves on the map freely and you have the ability to use 2 kinds of powers. 1 is a rain of fire and the other one is to summon 2 soldiers that cant move but stand their ground.Using a hero and 2 summoned soldiers is a good way to stop the advance of the enemie. Because walking enemies must attack ground units (towers will never be attacked). If you place your units in close range of towers, they can shoot at the enemies the soldiers are also attacking.The maps are diverse and sometimes hard to beat, but when you play the map a couple of time you can find the weakness of the enemie and adapt to it."

Some are bad, some are okey and some are pretty darn good. This is one of the latter.The game is pretty easy to learn, even if you've never played this type (Tower Defense) of game before thanks to simple controls, easy to understand mechanics and in-game hints. Difficulty starts out very simple and then scales upwards as you go at a satisfying pace.Controls are simple, you use your mouse to click where you want to build structures (pre-defined locations) and when you want to upgrade. There are quickbinds for your spells (1 and 2) as well as your hero (space), allowing for fast selection when needed.Graphics are cartoonish, colorfull and very charming while animations aren't next generation they're still very satisfying and fits the theme. Not many graphic options except for resolution (1920x1080, weee!), windowed and a quality level although I think those cover all the relevant things.The sound is pretty good and can be adjusted in-game.As far as gameplay goes this one will give you quite a few hours of tower building and monster killing thanks to the campaign mode and, once finished (or during), you can go back to completed maps in order to complete the Iron or Heroic challenges (same basic map, new waves, new rules, 1 life!). There are more or less hidden achievements during some of the maps as well as whenever you complete a map you earn stars which can be spent on the world map in order to upgrade things.Many unique monsters, several bosses and a dozen+ playable heroes have kept me entertained for 25h+ ^_^So, all in all, I'd say this is a great game, giving it a 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played"

Nothing ground-breaking, but everything polished to near perfection.Unfortunately Kingdom Rush lacks two features that would leave this title unrivalled. Firstly, 'Cloud Saving' isn't supported and thus replaying after reinstallation can be a pain. Secondly, there is no 'Steam Workshop' integration and thus the chance to create and play user constructed levels is non-existent.Nonetheless, Kingdom Rush is the best 'Tower Defence' game in years.

I never imagined that they would be able to improve it so much as to be able to sell the game on Steam!This is a Tower Defense game, meaning that you have to strategically place buildings (There are four buildings to choose from) in locations so the waves of oncoming enemies don't overrun you (get to the other side of the map). The game offers three modes for each map, each giving you currency to upgrade your abilities, buildings and your heroes.Probably the best part about Tower Defense games in general is that there is always more than one way to successfully beat a level, so if you want to beat down your enemies with only arrows, you go girl! (or guy ;p). Unfortunately sometimes a single type of building, despite how many times you upgrade it using the money the monsters you kill drop (which you don't need to worry about picking up thank goodness), won't be sufficient in beating said level. You'll need to adapt sometimes.What sets this game apart from the other Tower Defense games for me is the beautiful art style. I am not a huge fan of pixelated games, though I will try them if I hear good things about it. Another thing are the heroes and their unique abilities to help you in battle, as well as your own abilities.Reviews for this game are generally overwhelmingly positive, and rightfully so. This game is perfect for that coffee break during work hours, or for sitting at home when you want something casual yet challenging and stimulating at the same time.

He told me to check it out in an email and gave a link to the free version. I loved it, and I think I finished it. Tower defence games are one of only two genres that I actually like as a whole (the other being platformers), so I might give this game credit where credit isn't necessarily due, but the point is that it's good.You get four types of towers to defend your... defendable... things with. I'll describe each one briefly:-Barracks: Barracks train soldiers called footmen who block enemies paths. The main draw is that they slow the enemy down to allow more hits from your ranged towers. Footmen are the only units that can die. They deal melee damage, which is affected by armor.-Archers: The barracks can't do everything, though. That's where ranged towers like archers come in. Ranged towers do most of the damage usually. Archers do melee damage for some reason (think of it more like physical I guess?), which means their damage is affected by armor. The thing is that they're faster than footmen and have more range. They stay in their tower and shoot things from high up, so they can't be killed/destroyed by enemies like the footmen can.-Mages: Magic has a unique type of damage--it's not affected by armor. This makes mage towers VERY useful. They do more damage than archers, too, but they're slightly slower. Even so, I prefer mages to archers, usually. There are enemies that are resistant to magic, though. Just like archers, mages are ranged.-Artillery... cannons: Artillery is ranged bombs, basically, that are shot into the air and rain down on groups of enemies. The explosions do damage by area instead of by enemy, which makes them good for taking out groups of weak enemies. They're slow and expensive, though. I think they do melee/physical damage.I should mention that there are flying enemies that will go right over your footmen. You'll need a good ranged defence to fight them. You also get meteors and reinforcements. Meteors are for emergencies and do a lot of area damage. Reiforcements are like free extra footmen. Finally, there are heroes, which are characters you always start with. You can only have one hero at a time, but you pick which one. As you can see, there's some depth in this game. I'd recommend this, especially if you like tower defence."
,Recommended,246420,10968579,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,erg,"I don't even know how to articulate how good this game is to me. It's so polished. So fun. There are like 20-30 stages that have three different difficulties that force you to use unique strategies. The gameplay consists of paths with preset locations upon which you can build towers. There are four tower types and each has three upgrades and two specializations each. Each specialization has its own set of upgrades. The depth of tower upgrades reminds me of some AAA RTS games. The enemies consist of orcs and wizards and other generic baddies with varying resilience and counterstrategies.A lot of tower defense games rely on tower placement as gameplay. Towers in Kingdom Rush have such a diverse set of utility and manual management that placement may not even be in the top 3 strategic priorities. You have a fireball spell that you cast yourself, and you also have a hero of your choice for some levels that you manually move around the map and engage enemies. You can also call two reinforcement warriors into battle at the location of your choice on a 20 or 30 second cooldown. So much to micromanage. The onslaught of enemy hordes is relentless, so you are constantly fighting an uphill battle that requires split second analysis and action, sometimes even sacrificing towers to fortify another path.I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys tower defense and also to everyone who doesn't enjoy tower defense. You may be surprised how fun this game is for you."

Not every game should be ported from tablet form to a full PC game. However Kingdom Rush has already established itself as a major player in the tower defense genre. Before you point out that I paid real money for a game that is literally available for free on websites like Kongregate, there is a reason to buy it. In the app version there is loads of premium content that one has to pay for separately. In the PC version you get the full game, no exceptions. So, if you have it on your tablet or phone is it really any different? No. Not at all. It's the exact same fun game.Kingdom Rush takes the existing TD genre and gives it character. For such a simple little game there is so much content to it. And if you are looking for that next challenge look no further. Kingdom Rush is a deceptive game that fools you into believing you can do it then crushes your dreams two minutes later. However there is a bigger picture. You can upgrade your overall tower abilities and skills as you beat more of the game by earning stars. And it gets better, you can respec your skills freely whenever you wish. So if a level calls for just arrow towers as a strategy then max out your arrow tower strength. But if another level needs every tower then respec your skills to balance out your strength.The game is also full of fun easter eggs and achievements that are meaningless but just add more character to this already full game. There is also a hero system that will come in handy. As your hero makes kills on the field he/she/it will level up and gain strength and abilities. You'll have several of these heroes to chose from as well and the best part is that most of them are like 2.99 in the app. Its insane. The game is visually appealing with a fantastic color palette. This may be easier on a touch screen though as I lose some time with my mouse and keyboard.Second Opinion: I'm not paying for a free game..."

I remember playing the flash version when it first came out, and I have completed this original Kingdom Rush about 10 times with flash, mobile and Steam. I have also completed Frontiers about 5 times and Origins 3.What is the game about? Well, you need to strategize your limited amount of towers on the different maps so no enemies get to the end. Different towers and enemies (and heroes) have all different abilities, so you need to be careful with your upgrades.The Steam version of KR does lack the endless modes and the ""item bag"" of the mobile versions, but hey, we don´t need cheats here don´t we ;)? I would have enjoyed this game much more if they added the endless though.So yes, buy this game even if you have played the mobile/flash versions, it´s gonna be worth your money and time. Also consider buying Frontiers, who knows, if that goes succesful we might get Origins on Steam too. ;)"

The first chunk of the game is pretty easy to learn and easy to win. But, once you approach the latter levels in the game, it get's really hard and it could take hours to beat one level after multiple attempts. It's good to see casual games give that level of difficulty without becoming overly difficult. The game requires a good amount of skill and long term planning to be successful. Also, there's a fair amount of content available here. You could easily put in 15-30 hours before you're ready to move on to another title.

I usually have a rather high expectation on the extent of unit-variety in strategy games, but the array of towers in Kingdom Rush has overwhelmed me with joy.After finishing the main story (probably takes around 8 hours for most average players of the genre) there are many more missions that involve the events subsquent to your victory against the forces of evil. Finally, all missions can be played in 2 hard modes (apart from the difficulty setting!) that restrict use of upgrades and prohibits certain tower types.I praise the developers, it's THE Tower Defence game."

Whether that's for better or worse is your decision.I recommend this for any tower-defense lover. The gameplay seems very unique and fresh, and although some challenges are longer, you are usually active on the battlefield which makes it less about placing-and-waiting and more actual playing.(note: ""time played"" display is inaccurate.

This game was the first tower defense game I've ever owned and I really went all out on getting everything perfect. Easily addicting.One thing that I absolutely loved about this game were the achievements. The developers put in extremely appreciable references to pop culture which was great but the best part was all the achievements were well within reasonable achievability. You don't want to have to spend 10+ hours for a single achievement. That's not rewarding; that's a chore. I completed all of them for the very first time for any game that I've owned simply because they were reasonable enough to get and I had fun figuring out how to get them.

At first I wasn't sure if I'd like it since I don't think the in-game photos do it justice. But I took a chance and, boy, did I never regret it. The graphics are cartoony but don't let that dissuade you as it did me at first. The gameplay is solid (and quite challenging at times) and is every bit as addictive as, say, Plants vs. Zombies. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a neat little diversion."

I can't wait to bash through the sequels.  Hopefully the gameplay is still just as balanced and well thought out.I also just wanted to say that I love how super-generic the game is up until you you max out the towers, then it goes EVEN MORE super generic with all the classics!!!  Dwarven artillery, eleven archers/human muskets, barbarians and paladins, it really does hit all the major points.Even the bad guys are hilariously classic."

Selecting the most appropriate hero is a nice addition to the gameplay.  There is nothing ground-breaking here but plenty of re-play value. I tried very hard to get three stars on the initial main campaign but was unable. 7/10.

All in all great game, only one thing about it (and I don't want to undermine the sales here) is that you can play a free version. Granted it probably has less features (I can tell it looks better and has a much nicer campaign map and ""battle"" maps). If you like tower defense games you will probably love this one."

76561198363890430,Recommended,246420,35029081,Posted: 17 September,all,meangreenmutha,"Cute tower defense game that should be picked up on-sale (I go by this for creed for every game).The main campaign probably has a story-line, but I wasen't paying attention.  By the title I'd assumed we're tasked with saving a kingdom from an evil wizard.  At the end of the campaign I fought a wizard so I think it was a safe bet.  Obviously the story isn't what keeps a tower defense afloat, so does it have it where it counts?  Absolutely!Kingdom Rush is a bright game that sports 4 basic towers types that each have 2 specializations for a total 8 unique towers that can be upgraded as you progress.  Players also have the luxury of a hero character (that can level up to 10, but the level resets each stage) to control in addition to a meteor strike, and infantry support abilities (which can also be upgraded while progressing through the game).The game has a large enemy variety with some maps including sub-boss and boss enemie types.  The game also includes many colourful pop culture references to keep things interesting.The real meat and potatoes of the game comes from the heroic and iron challenges of each stage.  These challenges may lock out heroes and/or entire basic tower types for the duration of the map.  The enemy waves will also be different coming in either 1 large wave, or 6 waves for the maps in addition to your handicap.Kindrom Rush works as a casual game, but can also provide a bit of a challenge if you want it to."
,Recommended,246420,35034927,Posted: 17 September,all,Mr. Matt,"This is one of the better tower defenses I've played. It's challenging, but good tower selection and placement, combined with upgrading smart can lead to vitory. It's not super difficult, but definitely made me work for some flawless victories al throughout the game. I'm pretty sure there were a couple of levels I couldn't ace at the end, but I had a good time from start to finish, and I definitely recommend this one if you're into tower defense games like I am."
