The game is now at a point where you have darn near everything you could want. Great graphics, excellent gameplay, it's what you had on your phone or wherever you played it. The graphics are a tad different and the future promises are quite nice!No real problems to speak of in my opinion now, the game used to have quite a few but now it's totally worth buying."

You will pull your hair out with frustration as 3% of the world survives your onslaught because you were not quick enough to shut down vital organs. And finally you will learn that Greenland is magical place filled with people that always wash their hands, import nothing and travel nowhere."
,Recommended,246620,18960899,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Grizzy,"Plague Inc is a rather satisfying simulation in which the player's goal is to infect and kill off the entire world. Just exactly how the player chooses to tackle this is up to them.GameplayThe player can choose to slowly infect the population, remaining undetected and non-lethal, and then strike once much of the world's population is infected by evolving lethality to kill fast and unexpectedly, making it difficult for the world to react and cure it in time or just try to kill the world as fast as possible which usually results in losing the game as many of the more isolated countries such as Greenland will shut their ports and airports making it very difficult to infect them.ContentThe player is not presented with just one disease type, but many. These disease types range from a neurax worm which allows the player to manipulate infected hosts to their advantage to the necroa virus which allows the player to unleash a devastating zombie apocalypse on the world. It doesn't stop here though as there is a rather extensive community workshop with countless unique diseases thanks to the scenario creator which is available to every player who owns the game.More comingThe developers of this game are also working on a multiplayer mode which will see two players battle it out to see who's plague is superior. The game is also regularly updated with new content and bug fixes.ConclusionWhile Plague Inc is not perfect, it offers great replayability with different ways to beat different scenarios and higher difficulty modes which can really challenge the player. The price is rather steep so I would suggest waiting until the game is on sale to get the best value for money. 8/10 - Great game."

Symptoms include a serve headache, coughing, excess saliva and mucus forming at the mouth and nose. Sensitivity to noise and movement is also heightened, mild aggression is also being reported. Within the hour, police respond to over 18,600 calls, all of which describe paramedic casualties resulting from the hostile sick.At 0520 Hours, another health emergency is issued and all flights in and out of the Shanghai, and her neighbor cities has been suspended until further notice. The number of infected tops a million and a half hours later: the number of deceased has yet to be confirmed, even the media doesn't know.At 0945 Hours, the Chinese Government requests assistance from the CDC, a leading health institution of the USA. The Chinese Government informs the North American institution that all cases reported outside the ""Epicenter for the Outbreak"" have been quarantined, and that all of whom who may have come into contact with an infected person are under a mandatory isolation. Furthermore, all emergency procedures implemented into preventing the spread of disease, have been activated with a 24/7 curfew placed in Shanghai.The CDC team begin their analysis of the infected persons under isolation. By this stage, the mystery contagion has caused a mild necrotic breakdown of its host’s tissue, extreme hemorrhaging and a serve migraine bordering extreme aggresion. The streets of Shanghai remain calm for now, the police stationed at checkpoints throughout the city keeping a cautionary eye out...nothing like this stays calm for long...Of the 24.1 million, a micro-handful of individuals who are asymptomatic (Unable to show symptoms) were on thirteen different travel routes before the Flight Cancellation Procedure was activated. Twenty four individuals, that's all that's required to bring modern civilization to its knees and palms...Day 3 sees the ""Previously contained outbreak"" spiral out of control as protesters march the streets. Quickly, China's biggest ever riot quickly forms and within hours, Molotov’s are being hurled, riot police beat their shields with their batons as they represent supperiority, all the while the contagion is being actively transmitted from person to person, the infected becoming cannibalistic in nature. The national press gets whiff in the Chinese media storm of the CDC team being evacuated after a serious altercation with the patients they were tending too.Similarly cases of the same uncategorized, contagion begins appearing in Jakarta, Indonesia's capitol city. Yet, there's remote cases appearing in Sydney of Australia, Rome & Paris of Europe, Los Angeles, and Brasília, of the America's. Soon, within the matter of a single week, these cases lead to dozens cannibalistic massacres & the lockdowns of public hubs, from hospitals to hotels, the number of calls the police receive regarding ""Zombie attacks"" rapidly increases by the hour.Weeks 1 & 2 saw a major involvement of Law Enforcements globally. From out of control rioting in L.A, to an Australia S.E.R.T team entering a quarantined hospital in Brisbane, for once the Government of each affected nation didn't see a positive resolution to the situation at hand, for once, they were genuinely scared because nothing they were issuing was working.Week 3 beginning sees 57 different Armed Forces being mobilized across the globe, the soldiers in their armored trucks and light assault vehicles taking to the streets as Martial Law is mentioned persistently in the international media. In nations such as the USA, the National Guard of each state is given detain on sight orders by the President himself, as companies of Guardsmen patrol each and every major city from the West to the East Coast. Rioting ignites everywhere where it wasn't before. Looting and arson is sporadic, but is seldom mentioned in the media as they frenzy over the prospect of genuine zombies. More and more, people in each suffering nation, are disappearing by the hundreds. Murders and cannibalism are common mentioning’s across the international media spectrum.Mid-way through Week 3, two thermal nuclear explosions occur in Beijing and Shanghai of China. Everyone had forgotten about the Chinese because they've been caught up in their own homegrown outbreaks. 37 million people in China die alone in the two separate detonations. The Chinese were hopping, preying, that the nukes would work and wipe out the two most heavily infested cities in the world, but the attempt is a failure and the infected run rampant. Big military nations like Russia and the USA, view through orbital imagery the shouldering remains of two desolate radioactive cities, the skyscrapers in them reaching up to the heavens as they smoke, their blackened husks on the verge of toppling down.Week 4 and Russia closes it borders indefinitely. With few cases reported so far in Putin's country, besides the massacre's in Moscow and St.Petersburg, the Russian's believe they're safe and will hold out while the rest of the world goes to hell around them. All of Europe does the same, each nation closing their borders to refugees fleeing the ruins of their home countries cities. Safe Havens that were constructed in an effort to protect the healthy and prevent the infected from getting in, whilst under the guard of an entire military battalion, begin collapsing as millions of infected breach the ""Safe"" Havens walls, those inside, for the majority swell to meet the ranks of their new brethren, while the remaining minority simply become food for a persisting, unsatisfied hunger.China goes dark on Day 28 of the Pandemic. Quick followers include all Asian countries on the mainland. Then the Indian Sub-continent. Most of Eastern Europe goes black as if someone turned the power off. Scatters of Western European nations fall as silent as the grave. Turkey, Greece and all of North Africa ceases to communicate. The last communication from Australia before its silence was that the ""Power Players"" in charge were making a retreat to Tasmania. New Zealand goes quiet hours later. Quickly, the rest of the world falls asleep into a never wakening coma. From Space, the planet that use to appear vibrant with light and modern civilization, is dark and dead.The last few nations to shutdown global communications included Russia, certain areas of the USA close to the Rockies, Canada, Norway and Poland. Then the world was truly dark. No city lights ever coming back on. The undead crowd in the streets like resident locus, swarming here and there in the millions.This is what I visualised as I manipulated the Necroa Virus and brought havoc & destruction to human kind XD. I've watched a lot of Zombie movies/tv series and read more than your average amount of apocalyptic zombie or doomsday disease novels, so my imagination whilst in-game may get a little to much into overrdrive. Just watching your disease spread from one nation to the unfortunate next, witnessing from a god-like prespective multiple countries attempting to restrict your diease's transmisson, from attempting to create a cure to shutting down airports, sea ports and forbidding forigen travel because the risk to their society is to high, and failing!

There's plenty of upgrades and different pathogens to choose from.  The issue comes from one giant flaw in my opinion; there's only one strategy that really works.The game is basically a race between your pathogen's ability to wipe out the humans, and their ability to cure it.  As soon as they notice the symptoms of your disease, they will begin to work on finding a cure.  This can happen very early on and the more people you infect/kill, the harder and more fervently the humans will work to cure it.  There are in-game ""upgrades"" you can purchase with your points to slow the humans, but they are laughably under-powered; reducing their progress bar by a measely 5-10% and costing you dearly in points. This might sound like a challenging mechanic to be conquered in an epic battle of wits, but it's not.  The gameplay is very limited as far as thwarting the humans or slowing them down, only offering a few one-time-use options for reducing their progress bar.  This is in leiu of the fact that should even one of the numerous island nations close their borders before they are infected, you just lost the entire game. This happens VERY often.  Unless, as I mentioned above, you use the strategy below.The ONLY strategy I have found that really works is keeping your disease hidden from the humans by keeping it from presenting with any symptoms until 95%-100% of the population is infected.  You then use all of your banked points and flood them into symptoms until your disease is incredibly lethal, and then sit back and watch.  If this sounds boring, that's because it is.  You are literally just sitting there looking at a screen for 10 minutes clicking around a few times.  Pretty dissappointing for a game with so much potential.I really gave this one the old college try, but it retains its entertainment value for far less time than I spent playing it.  $15 is better spent elsewhere."

There are still missing features, most notably the Necroa Virus type, Tutorials & Scenarios. But allready the game is highly playable and damn addicting.You are a plague, you infect people and evolve and the aim is to infect and kill everyone on earth in the end. There is strategy involved in picking the right mutations for your plague, keeping a low profile, not killing too many before you are discovered and later killing them fast enough before they can develop a cure for you.There are several different plague types, Bacteria, Virus, Prion and more. They require different ways to evolve them to be sucessfull. The Neurax Worm which was added with the last patch was the most fun for me. The hunting for achievements was fun as well, altough alot of them arent implemented yet.The game originally was made for mobiles and is now ported to the PC. It feels pretty good and polished for a port.If i had one negative thing to say about the game then its about the bubble clicking, which gets tiresome and annoying after a while. Also it feels a bit too pricey, ~10 Euros would have been a much fairer pricepoint in my opinion.You can get a mobid kind of satisfaction out of beeing sucessfull in this game, knowing that you just wiped out a whole planet. I just couldnt resist getting it, and overall i am sure i got my moneys worth out of it.As long as you dont expect deep strategy you will have a good time with this game.Its a nice timewaster with suprising complexity below its shell."
,Recommended,246620,15705421,"Posted: 5 May, 2015",all,Tom,"Plague Inc.: Evolved; let me first start out by saying, this is exactly how the Early Access model should be done. This game is an absolute treat to play.The main idea behind the game, if you don't already know (I’d be surprised if you didn't to be honest), is to develop, mutated and transmit your very own disease. You can choose which symptoms you would like your diseases to have, how you would like it to be transmitted around the world and many other different options. There are a number of different kinds of diseases you can choose, my favourite has to be the zombie plague; each of the different modes offers different symptoms, abilities and ways to transmit your creation as well.The graphics are essentially a 2D world map; you don't need anything else for this game, the UI and HUD are very nicely put together and you can get all of the information you require within a key press.Each of the different modes have been carefully crafted so that no game ever feels the same; this game really makes you think, would this symptom thrive in these conditions? How can I get my plague to travel to the other side of the world when all of the airports are closed? The possibilities are endless.The game can also vary in difficulty; each different mode has 4 stages of difficulty; and boy oh boy does it get hard in the brutal stages. You are best of cracking out a guide if you want to tackle some of the harder stages.I have played about ten hours so far; this has enabled me to complete all the different types of diseases and modes on offer, done a couple on Brutal difficulty and worked on a few achievements. There are still roughly 100 more achievements to collect along with the scenario modes to play; and given that they game is still in early access, I fully expect there to be more content added soon too.I can 100% guarantee that anyone will enjoy this game; it’s a perfect pick up and play game but you can also get mind numbingly deep into the inner workings of diseases and plagues without having to do six years in medical school.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Like reading the cliffnotes of ""all about disease""-Entertaining in exactly the same way smallpox was, take that as you will.-Replayability is hugely limited due to the limited nature of the game.I'll admit to enjoying it the first two times through the rest of it wasn't so enjoyable.

Timing plays a huge role in evolving and deevolving traits depending on the type of infection.  For instance, if your plague is too severe before you attain widespread infection, humans will begin working on a cure before you have time enough to infect everyone.  Conversely, if you are too wide spread through transmission abilities, you might not end up with enough DNA to be lethal enough before a cure is found.The Planet of the Apes add on is very interesting.  I'm still experimenting with it but unleashing a virus that makes apes more intelligent and combat humans is quite entertaining.

It helps provide the ""Pandemic"" feel with an eerie tone. It is actually pretty good and I reccomend you obtain the OST.Now to the game, first, you must choose a reigion to begin in. Some reigions, such as Norway, are a single country. Others, like China, are many countries, (People's Republic of China, Chinese Taipei, Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan) and Canada owns Alaska, for some wacky reason. After that, evolve ways to spread and evolve symtoms. After that, well, you can guess what to do.There are a few difficulties, such as:Casual - For new players, or those seeking a quick game. Nobody washes their hands. Yuck.Normal - Average Gameplay. 67.3% of people wash their hands.Brutal - Everybody washes their hands.

There is also Online play, Scenarios made by Ndemic, and by the community. Even you can make a scenario.Oh yes, did I forget to mention alongside the normal pathogens, you can use the Necroa Virus, a Zombie Plague, the Neurax Worm, a worm that can be used to enslave humanity, the Simian Flu, a virus that gives Apes intelligence, or the Shadow Plague, a virus that, uh... well, I haven't played it.Just buy the game already!"

But hey, maybe it's actually worth the money?The game is an advanced version of the old Flashgame Pandemic II, which was a great game of it's time and I truly enjoyed playing it. Actually, that's the only reason I decided to get Plague Inc anyways. Now, Plague inc is a bit more advanced then Pandemic, no doubt. The mutations system ismore complex, the graphics and algorythms much superb...But it doesn't add much else.Once you figured out the basic route, the game is literallyjust clickclickclick-wait-win. Every single time. The different plague types only change that at a minimal level.Look at my game time. I havejust finished the game, unlocking the cheat plagues (those giving you godmode anti-cure or unlimited evolution points). How? Just by doing the same thing a dozen times over again, with every plague the game offered.And that's it. And they charge 14€ for that.Now, a big point for me was the Multiplayer mode. I could really see potential replayability value there...BUT it's not even remotely implemented yet.So, my resume: Great concept (duh, they imported it from a great and innovative old game). Fun gameplay. But goddamn repetitive and no further content to keep you playing. In it's current state, 2-3€ sounds like a nice price. If they really go up ahead and add a GOOD multiplayer mode, I'll gladly change my review. But till then, don't buy this.PS: Quick update:They STILL didn't add the promised multiplayer, but instead keep throwing in 'more different plagues' that play usually exactly like any of the others, adding nothing new to the game.PSPS: 6 months later, they ACTUALLY added a multiplayer. Albeit I feel trolled by the fact it's not the 'human vs virus' multiplayer I was actually hoping for."

,Recommended,246620,24830183,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,RothX,"Plague Inc Evolved is a strategy game about creating and evolving a disease that will infect and ultimately destroy the whole world. Upon discovering your disease, scientists of the world will attempt to cure it.Breakdown:Great things:-This is the biggest pro in my opinion: there is something for everyone here. It is a great casual experience for people who aren't big strategy gamers. My friend who claims to dislike ""map games"" loves this game. Hardcore strategy gamers and fans of the genre will also find fun here. I, for example, play tons of 4X and grand strategy games, and I love this one as well. The harder difficulties and scenarios (custom and official) can provide great challenges and interesting strategical situations.-Fantastic difficulty curve. The game is very easy to learn, and provides a fun challenge to master it at the hardest difficulties. The jump from Brutal to Mega Brutal is pretty big, but that gap can be filled by harder plagues or scenarios. The game never has to feel too easy or too difficult.Good things:-Good variety with the main plagues, official scenarios and custom scenarios. I will say that the ""normal"" plagues (bacteria, fungus, parasite, and prion) all feel very similar to each other, but even with that in mind, there is still a good amount of variety in the main game. Some of the official scenarios are very interesting, and can provide a large or small shake-up to your normal strategy. However, I will say a large portion of the scenarios don't feel all that different from the main game or each other, which is why I put this under ""good things"" instead of ""great things."" But there are so many scenarios, you will definitely find something interesting.-Custom scenarios are great. The game allows community members to create their own scenarios and customize the world, events, and the plague itself to create a unique experience. When you start to get a bit bored of the normal stuff, there are basically ENDLESS custom scenarios to play. True, not ALL custom scenarios are good, but custom scenarios are produced so often, that is is viable to only have to play really good ones. And the editor is very intuitive and explains everything very well, so it easy and quite to fun to create your own custom scenario. I rank this as ""good"" instead of ""great"" because the editor doesn't provide THAT much variety, and (last time I checked) TRULY unique plagues like the Necroa virus and the Neurax worm, cannot be created in the editor. Granted, they would be difficult to create, but many communities have dedicated creators who put time and effort into creating cool content for the game, and I have no reason to believe this one is any different. Anyway, you may feel that none or few of the custom scenarios feel meaningfully different from anything else.-Clean and intuitive UI. You will never be befuddled by this game's UI. It is not over-complicated, while still providing all the information you might ever want. As well, it looks very nice, and has some nice aesthetic but not distracting touches, such as a cool picture of your pathogen, and what an infected body might look like.-Concept: It is a very cool and interesting concept to manufacture a plague to infect and kill the whole world. The only other game I know of that has a similar concept is Pandemic, but Plague Inc has much more depth I would say.-Sound effects are pretty cool and fit the theme of the game rather well. There are enough to feel satisfying, but not so many that you get annoyed.Okay things:-Main graphics on the map are pretty good, if simple. You can zoom in quite far and see some detail. However, you would never want to do this, as there is never a reason to not look at the whole map, as you might miss something, so you might get a little tired of looking at the same thing all the time (besides the UI screens), although admittedly it is satifying to see everything slowly turn red!-Music is a bit lacking, but not bad. The main ""music"" creates the feel the game is going for, and is mostly ambient noises. I'm not sure if actual music would fit this game well, but nevertheless, I cannot rate the sound here as ""good."" It is a short loop, and there is not much to it, but since it is just ambient, it won't annoy you, I wouldn't recommend muting it.-Multiplayer is pretty meh. There are two multiplayer modes: Co-op and competitive, which I really like. They are pretty different, so I will start with Co-op.-Co-op mode involves two players controlling separate plagues on the same map, and they can work on separate regions, or the same, and they can buff each other. However, multiplayer seems to function very differently than singleplayer with changed mechanics, and yet the game doesn't seem to tell you this, so we floundered a lot in this mode, despite both being very good at the singleplayer modes. Even when we won, most of the time, one of the plagues got eliminated early on and the other one did all the work. Also, pop-ups don't seem to appear as much in multiplayer, so I had my plague 50% cured without even noticing that the cure started.-Competitive is fine, but it feels like a race, like we might as well just play singleplayer and see who wins first. Interactions are limited to several evolutions that can ""sabotage"" the other player. Some of these are very major and can change the whole game, but usually the other player will just do the same to you, as they are pretty much forced to, so it still feels like a race, just under different conditions. Also, the victory conditions are changed a bit: you don't have to kill everyone, just infect everyone, which is a big negative for me, as it feels like half the game is just missing. You can also win if the other plague is eliminated. As mentioned, you can sabotage the other player, but this victory condition almost always feels like you won because the other player messed up, and not because you did well, so can be a bit unsatisfying. I have mostly mentioned negative things, but that's not to say that multiplayer isn't fun. It is still Plague Inc, and all the previously mentioned positives still apply, it just isn't quite as fun as the singleplayer mode for me. However, big disclaimer: I don't have many friends who play this game, so I haven't actually played that many multiplayer games, so my opinion on them might improve as I come to understand them a bit better.Bad Things:-This game's only real con is that it can get a bit repetitive, but that can be a big con.-The game lacks any real variety in its events, and doesn't have that many to start with, so there is very little variety created by in-game events, and even the ones that do happen seem to barely affect anything in the game.-For many of the plagues, the EXACT same strategy can be used, and it can feel very repetitive. However, this isn't a huge con, as many of the more unique plagues and scenarios can change it up quite a bit, but it will still feel prevalent as you try out different things.-This is sort of a subset of the repetitiveness, but it is the biggest issue for me: Most of the symptoms feel the same. There are many symptoms in the game, but for most plagues, they consist of: Increases infection rate, increase death rate, or slow down cure research. Different tiers of symptoms will do this at different levels, but still feel the same. It can be fun to think about how people are affected by the actual symptoms you are adding, but from an actual gameplay perspective, many feel exactly the same.OVERALL RATING: 8/10 - Worth buying at full price.The pros heavily outweigh the cons, and you will definitely get some fun from this game.This review went way longer than I intended, but hopefully it was helpful to you!"

Either go for a smooth killing spree or struggle with cure progress.This game also features A LOT of upgrades for each disease (there are quite many of them which you can unlock).Come to think about it, it's a strategy game. You start somewhere and expand until you take over the world. Or in that case, kill everyone (though it's not always necessary).There is also a multiplayer mode. Both versus and co-op are fun to play and can give you quite a challenge.I'm not really sure what else I should write about this game. Maybe workshop support? Millions of custom scenarios and an editor to make your own? Yeah, I guess I should mention that either. Oh wait, I just did.

76561198091615336,Recommended,246620,13160321,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,A Shinx with Night Goggles,"I got this game on my tablet and it was pretty enjoyable to play. Glad to see they're adding some new things to their PC version. So lemme just recap the good things:- You can name your disease ""Cuddles"" or something ironic like that- You act as the god or scientist on a sattelite, upgrading the abilities, symptoms, and the types of spreading of the disease while watching over the world, making sure your virus spreads by any means necessary- Any player can play this game pretty easily once you get the basics handed down. If you're just a casual gamer like me then just go to casual mode, or if you like a challenge and realism go to Brutal mode to test your knowledge on how a disease outbreak can destroy the earth (in the game of course :P)- The game itself doesn't require a good PC to run, I'm running this on my laptop which has a medicore graphics card and it still runs fine with no issues.- Loads of information on the screen, both based on your disease and world events (news, cure research, activity, etc)- The disease tree allows the player to add a more personal touch to their disease and it doesn't force you to stick to a certain pattern to win, contradictory to what I just said it all depends on your knowledge on how an epidemic starts. For example: a disease that can only be spreaded through water and hot climates will eventually be cured if the traits are kept that way because the world is smart in this game.- Diseases in the game have a pretty ""realistic"" nature. If a disease can be spreaded through kisses and hugs it can do that. Be careful though, humans are realistic too, and will eventually thwart your plants by stopping people from hugging and kissing each other eventually. Plan your diseases carefully and upgrade them to the best of your abilities, or personal taste. Make sure to stop the humans from finding loopholes to your epidemic by finding loopholes in their ways of curing people or at least stopping the spread.- Controls are pretty straight forward, just point the mouse and click. No need for mulitple key bindings if you don't want too, but that's up to personal preference to dictate whether it's good or not to have a game relying on a cursor most of the time.Now lemme recap the bad things:- Trying to attempt this game in real life (by that I mean actually starting a real disease) will get you in big doo doo- If you can't understand what disease is and how it spreads, as well as basic disease terminology, this game may be difficult for you- Blindly picking stuff from the tree is bad, I've been there and had my disease stopped on Casual difficulty (the easiest difficulty in the game). Reading IS required for the game since the symptoms and diagrams provide you with hints on what each symptom and trait your next choice have and how they behave.- Recap: Reading is required. Not too much but you need to at least have a basic understanding of reading and some big words. If you don't like reading, then this game isn't for you.All in all this game is great! I hope they keep developing more things to add to it. Been a fan ever since the app came out for phones and tablets, still a fan for the PC version :D"
,Recommended,246620,26037103,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,the_rock0123,"I purchased on sale for £5.99, though it is well worth the full price £11.99 on the basis you’ll get hours of entertainment out of this over time.  I bought as a casual game I was half interested in, but it turned out to be a huge surprise in just how good this game is. I thought it would be a basic strategy game; and the controls are exceptionally easy (basic) to learn.  But, for a game that looks easy, the underlying strategy is deep.  The idea in the game is to create a virus and spread it around the world, all the while the world governments’ tries to cure their citizens.  It sounds easy and basic, but the complexity comes from knowing where to spend your limited DNA points – do you focus on improving how well the virus spreads between countries, how well it spreads within countries, how strongly it makes people ill, or how fatal the disease is. But you also need to spend DNA points on ensuring cures take longer, and making your disease resistant to the cures. Then, add the complexity, that you need to focus on shutting down countries in order – focus on those that are most quickly developing cure research against you.  Each country could have many unique needs; is the country wealthy, poor, hot, cold, arid, humid, etc.  Each DNA choice affects how well the disease spreads in an individual combination of country. And to make matters worse for you, you have to know how well your disease will spread via boat or airline.  Warning: some islands will simply shut off their ports if they notice the disease is strong. Greenland is particularly isolated, so is Iceland. So if you can’t spread your disease you will lose the game.  You’ll also lose if you kill off people too quickly (doesn’t make sense at first), but you’ll realise you can’t simply spread a horrid disease as there’s a risk people could be killed before transmitting the disease to other people.  A potentially better strategy, you want to spread a mild disease first, and then ratchet up the symptoms so they kill, without leaving it too late that the population can make a cure.  Good luck!  This looks a simple game, but it is a fun, exciting challenge, that is very addictive with one more turn (try/game) feel.The game is real time, but has a pause button and pauses on important news. I thought in the tutorial the game played too quick even on the slowest level, but in my first game I got used to this speed and see why it works. The interface is very nice and adequate for a value game, providing news flashes from around the World, country data, cure progress data, your virus data, and shows planes and ships moving around the World from port to port.Oh, and if you master all this with a standard disease, try the scenarios. Fancy running a group of infected apes against the population? The scenarios add NEW features: Managing ape colonies, building them into a human fighting force and disease spreader. The “Planet Of The Apes” scenario may be for you.  No doubt they’ll be Zombie symptoms to create as I progress the game.There is also variety in starting standard games as there are “loads of bonuses” you can unlock to start games with, so viruses are unique for each game.  And there are over 100 achievements to strive for, from relatively easy to very challenging – hours of fun trying to get them all done.Because this was cheap, is unique, fun, addictive strategy, deep for how simple the game seems on the surface from its UI, it’s a 10/10, for a game you can enjoy over an hour or two each evening. MUST BUY for strategy fans.  You will know (if) you like it after 2 hours, so no risk if buying through steam – just get a refund if you don’t like it. I’m sure you will love it though and see this is a keeper to come back to again and again."

I spent about 50 hours in game (counter shows more but idle and so on..) and that's about how long it took me to do all of the achievements. And these get really hard in the end! But it adds to the fun for me. For people who are uncertain as to if this game's worth the money, I recommend just trying out the phone version. Yeah, the content on the mobile version is largely the same, but due to the nature of touchscreens and the capability of phones, it's rather dull on phone - I feel. Sometimes you just lack the tempo to do certain tasks in a certain speed on touch, while on PC it's much easier with all the hotkey and mouse controls. It's simply more manageable. Aside from that, on mobile you have to pay for ""DLC"", while on PC you get everything for 14 bucks. Also you have triple speed here on PC, while only double speed (max) on phone. To everyone saying this is a slow game, I recommend upping the game's speed, you'll have your hands full with work, especially on higher difficulties.If you're the kind of person that's not even interested in playing a game to it's fullest, someone who's like ""yeah I'll try every mode out once on the easiest difficulty and move on"" then no, this game probably has very little to offer for you and thus rather low value in regard to it's price.As for the multiplayer that's still in development; I feel multiplayer on a game like this is needless. But apparently, people seem to enjoy it (unlike me).

Otherwise, the game meets its own goal but I can't recommend it since it's painfully static and repetitive. I spent 2 hours playing it but it felt more like 20...Too long partThe game has very fascinating background and it's very exciting to discover everything it has to offer at first. But as you go on, you realise that while the content is wide, it's also quite shallow. You basically spend your time staring at a world map and some pulsing red dots progressively expanding over time.There are also red, orange and blue bubbles to pop every now and then, which in all honestly seems like a very very desperate attempt to make the gameplay look more dynamic. I imagine this whole concept works amazingly on mobile devices but it's just not good enough on a PC.Another way to spice things up is various events which occur in a more or less random fashion. Most of these are opportunities which can be abused to spread your disease faster. Problem is that these events tend to happen on the other side of the globe and you don't have enough resources to react in time.I also feel like there is a huge gap in the difficulty levels, asNormalcan basically be beaten by not actively doing anything at all whileBrutalseems almost impossible in comparison. If humanity starts working on a cure and you havent infected every single person on the planet yet, you basically lost the game because you usually don't have enough resources to deal with the cure development and security precautions. AtBrutalandMega Brutaldifficulties the discovery feels very random which is what makes it so hard and infuriating.Fun thing to note is that island countries become impenetrable fortresses once the cure development starts and you haven't infected anyone in there yet."

When you first start out, you probably think stealth is the best way to go, until you hit Brutal and your only option is to go hard or get cured. Pretty much every plague type has a mechanic that requires tweaking your strategy, to the point where if you play blind, you have to play several games just to understand what kind of angle you need.If you're coming from the mobile version, as I did, I would definitely recommend this version. It's not a direct port, more of an upgrade that breathes a little life into a game all about murdering everyone on the planet. Now, I haven't played it as extensively as the mobile version (I bought it on release to support the dev and never played it until recently WHOOPS), but just playing a few co-op rounds with a friend has definitely made this worth it, and the added Workshop functionality means more screaming for everyone. And, IIRC, all updates are free.A late update: the Shadow Plague is nice, but a little easy once you figure out how it works. Still, the new achievements (even the non-Shadow Plague ones) are relatively fun to get, so not a bad addition at all.Pros:Great bubblewrap simulator.Beating Mega Brutal with bacteria and almost no genes feels really nice, okay.It makes you feel really smart with all these big fancy words wow look at them all.Easy to alt-tab out of, for all your alt-tabbing needs. Probably to look at a guide and cry. No judging here, man. That Necroa virus sure iskiller. (Yes, you can hang me now. I've made enough bad jokes.)The news reel and random events are kind of great. The game has just the right amount of humour for being a game about pathogens.It just has such a nice draw to it. Makes you feel like a mad scientist kicking back and watching the world burn. (Sometimes literally. What is with these nukes, mate.) A+ ego boost.Cons:Greenland.I'm probably on a watchlist now somewhere, tbh.Being able to infect everyone after you get noticed didn't really feel right until I remembered standard precautions even in 'rich' countries is actually really poor because no one follows them as rigorously as they should. Not really a con about the game, just a little bit of an unsettling revelation.Greenland.Sometimes when you make a mistake, but still obviously going to win (ie, no cure prgoress being made), it takes forever for the game to finish. I've only really noticed this with the Necroa virus because of the zombie mechanic (I'm a scrub I know I know), so it isn't something that happens often, but it's my only real complaint.I personally just strongly dislike the Necroa virus, which only grows the more I play with it. It's very gimmicky, cured easily (I assume to encourage your inner necromancer.), and just generally the least fun of all of them, even when zombies do start. Since it's part of the mandatory progression line-up, this becomes even more noticeable. I'm not sure what could be done to balance it, though my general frustration suggests buffing the lethality of the few non-zombie symptoms it has.Maybe it's just because I'm playing on a glorified toaster, but the Steam overlay keeps glitching out and closing on me. I'm going to do some testing on this one as soon as I can. This isn't a game breaker, though.This is my toaster. Stupid toaster. Can't even toast toast.Greenland.So go get it.

I don't think the game is bad at all, like many people I originally played this game on my cellphone and found it quite entertaining.  The whole game is here and I really have nothing against it or it's strategy.  Heck, it's one of the few mobile games I liked because it actually fit the medium it was made for.  And yet, that's the core of why I cannot recommend it: The game was better on mobile.This experience is tailored for a small touch screen.  The point and click gameplay was fast and fluid on a tiny screen but clunky on my HD display.  The interaction with your virus was a detached experience on a small screen as you played the observer tinkering with the virus' evolution.  The 'pimple popping' gameplay made sense as a way to pass time as you watched your virus spread.  On the big screen?  It almost comes off as insulting.  The simple evolution of your virus makes sense when you have ten minutes to play, but it feels empty at my desk.  Perhaps because I knew it as a time-wasting mobile game that I don't want it on my desktop but here we are and I really just don't.  I hoped that they'd make use of the big screen somehow, maybe take some risks and update the game.  I did not find that to be the case.Honestly I'm not recommending not buying it, I just don't think it's a good desktop PC game.  It barely surpasses it's flash roots.  And since you ~can~ play it on a cellphone or tablet, well, this may not be the worst port of a cellphone game to the PC but at the same time it's hardly better for it.  The pick up and play is gone.  The swift menu navigation is gone.  And I don't remember this on mobile, but an endless flood of tutorial messages drags things down further.  It's good for a few minutes of your time but do you really what to boot up your computer, log into Steam and kill ten minutes?  Maybe it is.  To me, all the gameplay which made it fit the mobile genre feels wasted and for ten dollars you could easily buy something far more interesting."

IF MY OPINION CHANGES DRASTICALLY OR WHENEVER THE GAME IS RELEASED FROM EARLY ACCESS, I WILL REWRITE THIS REVIEW.Do you or have you ever despised humanity? Do you like video games but you're tired of the same old shoot em ups? Do you want something (fairly) new and unique? Well, my friend, this is the right game for you!Create a disease from a variety of disease types (which you have to unlock... fun), select special traits for your disease (also unlocked... more fun), select your difficulty, and infect Patient Zero. You then choose some skills to evolve your plague to make it more lethal, easier to infect others, or resist outside forces (i.e. temperature and drugs). Unfortunately the governments of the countries aren't very keen on the idea of you eliminating the human race, so they'll shut borders, airports and harbors and try to cure your disease, so you'll have to race against the clock to infect the world and evolve enough lethal symptoms to kill the world. Rinse and repeat.The gameplay is fun, there is a bit of strategy on choosing which country to infect, whether you want to be able to infect by air or water first or if you want to invest some points to get bonus infectivity in colder countries. More strategy comes when you get traits for your disease, since they add bonuses to infectivity, extra DNA points, and a couple more nifty abilities. Each disease has some varying traits, like virus evolving frequently, biodisease being so deadly you have to suppress the lethality, nano-virus being built in with a kill switch that you must race against, and there are much more. It's worth it to unlock the diseases, since some of the cooler ones like Neurax Worm (mindcontrol) and Necroa Virus (zombies) are unlocked a bit later and it's always fun to mess around with those. There are also random events that happen that will affect the game, making each experience different.The display looks nice and it's easy enough to see what's going on. There's a cool little body chart that shows you where in the human body your disease affects. You can see what's going on in all countries, how they're combating your plague, how their cure research is coming along, and if the government is still stable there or if it's falling apart.There are also scenarios where you mess around with stuff, mostly stuff like little to none plane transmission, a mirror version of Earth where all of the countries characteristics are reversed, a virus that's DNA is damaged, affecting its transmission, and some more. Steam Workshop also makes an appearance, letting you create your own scenario. The communuty for this game is pretty large and I can see multiplayer being popular when the dev releases it.There are some problems I had with the game, most of them small however. Mostly minor stuff like Portugal being part of Spain, Alaska being part of Canada (to be fair, the dev makes fun of this in an event so I dont care about that :P), Hawaii being nowhere to be seen yet, minor stuff like that. I can see this game becoming a bit repetetive, but it hasn't become that for me yet. One thing I would like to see, though, are different... I guess maps, you'd call them. Stuff like the continental USA with all of the states instead of the whole world, the providences of Canada, a map where the melting of the ice caps has flooded the world, stuff like that. That would make the game more replayable.Regardless of any criticisms I may have, Plague Inc Evolved is a breath of fresh air with plenty to offer and more to come. 9/10. Never has a game made me hate a country for no good reason like this one has. Goddamn Greenland... Anyway, get this game now. It's worth it even at the full $15 or your regional equivelant. Just know that this is an Early Access game, so the game isn't complete yet. However the dev updates frequently, so it could be coming out of Early Access soon.

All of them are really nice additions that (with the exception of VS Multiplayer, arguably) help boost the game's longevity, the same way new disease types have done for the mobile version.For the most part, you're gonna be staring at one of three screens: the map screen (showing the disease spread), the disease screen (where you can purchase traits with accumulated DNA), and the world information screen (showing the measures being taken against your disease as well as progress towards human extinction). Anything you can think of is shown, even as graphs detailing your statistical growth, the percentage of population infected and dead, and the cure research conducted and needed.A little thing that's making it more enjoyable to play through is just reading through the symptoms and trying to imagine what unholy suffering I'm causing to the humans, slowly appearing on the map as darkening red dots that stop shuffling about as they poop out their organs.

Incubation period and the human immune-system for instance does not play a part in this game at all. It was a huge letdown that I came away from this game having learned absolutely nothing about real-life diseases whatsoever.In a nutshell you get some currency with which to buy disease-symptoms and method of infection, and then you monitor how that plays out in a sort of world-sim.

You are able to name your own Virus. You start off by picking a country, From there you will have to make a nice infection. You can choose to spread the infection with birds, Rats, lifestocks and other things. Your Virus will be able to evolve (Over time by itself) and become stronger. Getting  more deadlier and even protection to yourself. You have to click on the bubbles that will show up (If u want), to gain some more virus points. Which you will be able to spend to make ur virus more deadlier. The stronger your virus, The faster you will be noticed and countries will fight back by developing a cure. You can sell virus evolutions. It's pretty useful if they are useless and wont have any affect anymore. However you will only get a little bit of Virus points back in return.  DESTROY THE HUMANITY!You can name your own virus.Games are short but alot of fun!Addictive.There are alot of different game modes.There is a Tutorial.Music is alright.Graphics is alright.You can fast forward and pause.Steamworkshop.You can save and load game.No fast country information (To see if they are a hot climate or cold, on the mobile its a simple tap and you know it).MULTIPLAYER.There are 2 different modes in the multiplayer mode. There is Versus and Co-op Mode. There is a a small tutorial about the multiplayer, they are explaining the Co-op and Versus mode there. You can play online or playing with 1 friend. The servers are NOT IP BASED. They are all dedicated. There is also a different ""unlocking system"" The unlock system is only for the multiplayer, It's the same as single player, So that means single player and multiplayer have both different progress. If you unlock upgrades in single player 5 times, These will NOT be unlocked for multiplayer. You can only unlock all multiplayer upgrades in the multiplayer mode. There is a level difficulty and you can choose a disease name. - Pausing and speeding up will send a request to the other player. He needs to accept this if you wish to make it happen. Finding Online matches will NOT take too long.  I will explain a little bit about these 2 modes.In Versus mode: Your goal is to infect the entire world, You do not need to kill everything in order to win. But you can win by killing off the opponents disease hosts or if his disease is cured. The DNA Bubbles will give you points, If you are the first one that will click the bubble you will receive extra bonus of DNA. Killing people will give you extra bonus DNA aswell.In Co-op Mode: You both need to infect the world and then kill them off, (Same rules as in single player) However the enemy/Humans are far more difficult then they are in single player. You will receive bonus DNA if both diseases has infected the same country. If one of the players has lost and their disease has been fully cured. You can help your team mate by sending out ""Activate abilities"". You can still get points and help him upgrading and evolving his disease. You can also click on the Bubbles to receive DNA.Other things.You are able to play this game for free on the mobile playstore. But its a bit buggy sometimes. I do suggest to try this game for free on the mobile store before you are going to buy it on steam. Just to know how the game is. See it as a Demo.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10"

Plague inc was originally an iOS and android game and has now come to PC via Steam early access. Now you no doubt know what the game is all about so the purpose of this video is to inform you whether it's worth your hard earned cash.Developed by one-man developer Ndemic Creations and released originally for mobile devices in 2012 Plague inc went on to be the 15th most downloaded paid iPhone game of 2012 in the U.S. (and 18th on iPad). In March 2013, the game went on to win multiple categories of the Pocket Gamer Awards, including Overall Game of the Year.The game itself is a plague simulator, the object of the game is to infect and kill the entire world's population. Once you have selected what type of plague your going to use, be it bacteria, parasite or a myriad of other options. You then go on to select where you plague will start by selecting a country of your choice. Throughout the lifespan of your plague you can evolve it, not only increasing its infectiousness but also it's lethality. You accomplish this by purchasing various so called evolutions with DNA points. DNA points are earned naturally by the plague spreading but also by clicking the DNA and infection bubbles that pop up on the world map as the plague spreads.As your plague spreads and starts causing fatalities, authorities will start to take notice. At a certain point scientists will begin to research a cure for your plague and then the race begins to see if you can kill the populace before a cure is developed. You can hamper the cure research progress by popping the research bubbles on the main map and by also purchasing evolutions that hamper research development.I really enjoying Plague inc on my iOS device last year, I thought it was a fun little title that had some replayablity but it certainly was not a core game. So it begs the question is this title worth $15 of your hard earned cash? And before the complainers out there say, well you can't critique an early access title, I'll say this, if your asking money for a product, I'm damn well going to find out if it's worth the money for people or not.In its current state on early access, it is not worth your money especially since only the main game, which I might add is the same version as the mobile game, is available. Why spend $15 dollars on something that you can pick up for less the $3 on your mobile device. That being said there are some new features coming to the game like multiplayer, speed run mode and scenarios but even then will it be worth it?For me personally, to make the $15 really worth it, this game will have to produce a great multiplayer experience. The multiplayer needs to add what the single player experience lacks, re-playability. While the cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes do sound like fun, I do doubt it will hold people for long. I think the single player could have done will some rework too, if it was me, I would have added some micro gameplay elements in there to add to the experience. Everything in the game is on the macro level, I would have added in some new levels. For example like in spore where you start of as a cell and as you grow the level gets bigger, what you could have done here is start of in a town of a country, the aim would be first to spread your plague across the country, then the game would go onto the world level.I really feel that small changes like the addition of levels would have really added to the game and make spending $15 for what is essentially a mobile game, a more justifiable purchase. I'm not saying that Plague inc is a bad game, on the contrary its a very fun, if not superficial simulator. I simply feel that in its current state it is not worth $15 of your money, once the additional features are added especially the multiplayer, it may be worth another look. But for the time being, I'd wait either until full release or if your just interested in the single player, pick it up on your mobile device."

In a weird sort of way, looking up information about the virus actually inspired me to finally pick this up.And I'm glad I did!To summarize, this game is basically a simulation of the transmission and evolution of a disease. You control transmission methods, symptoms, and abilities with the object being killing everyone before a cure can be created.Thinking about your decisions is crucial. Can't just kill off everyone immediately because it cannot spread. Cannot make it too passive because the cure will catch up to you. So, you have to find a balance.While it may be a dark premise, which might put some off, the game is pretty solid. Hoping multiplayer is on its way soon.Added bonus: You give your disease a name.

Only awesomely enough it's the same cost as all the DLC for that game combined.Plus looking at the prospect of Co-op and even Competitive Multiplayer, Custom Scenarios (likely implemented via the workshop) and the existence of Speed Runs, a Leaderboard, and even a virus not currently featured in Plague Inc. The Simian Virus as a reference to the Planet of The Apes series.You start with Bacteria, Then Virus, and later control Fungus, prion and even my favorite and one of THE EASIEST plague types in the game, The Neurax Worm, a plague that is essentially a brain worm (Alpha Centauri's Mind Worms, anyone? :D) tha can either kill or mind-control, allowing for a second victory alternative.Whichever plague you start with, the object of the game is to kill all of mankind, save for the Neurax Worm which can turn all of humanity into a slave race (which in my opinion is better than killing them all).There are 7 plague types, and they all play differently, although a couple feel or act similar, no single plague works the same as another, which is the important part as nobody wants to play an FPS where 60% of the guns all act the same, or an RTS where 5 units are literally the same thing with a paint job.There is easily a wealth of content as the game itself is fairly tricky with plague types like the Necroa Virus, a plague that can turn people into zombies.... or just act like a normal plague... which doesn't work as well as when a zombie, you have abilities you can use.If you oppose Evolution, or find killing humanity in a simulation wrong somehow, or you don't like Simulations or Strategy games... Then this game isn't for you.Otherwise, if you're okay about either point, or like any of them, then I highly encourage you to get a copy of this game, It's loads of fun, allowing for more than 6-24 hours worth of gameplay if ignoring the achievements.To get them, I'd imagine that number would triple easily.This game's a blast, I personally see it as a 7/10 in it's current state, it may easily rise in the future as I just cannot forget future features like Co-op, which I am absolutely ecstatic about.So yeah. 7/10, once leaving Early access, I will come back and redo this review."

Simply put, if you enjoyed Pandemic, theres no reason to hate this game, it's better in everyway.The music is good, however it can get repetitive at times.The graphics (If you can call them graphics) are nice and bright, and everything stands out so you know what is what, nothing blends in.While Pandemic had 3 diseases, this game HAS A LOT more and creative ones, plus thanks to the Steam workshop, theres pretty much an unlimted amount of diseases you can play as, plus if you want to make your own, it's very easy to learn!The game while simple and repetitive, it's still a lot of fun and has a lot of Easter Eggs in game, including a Minecraft reference and more.However theres one downside for me, and that's you unlock some of the content by playing a disease in a specific difficulty, this sounds good, but most of the time from my playthroughs, some bullcrap keeps happening like the following.I never get enough DNA points to stop the cure OR get the upgrades I need.The game has an♥♥♥♥♥pull and the cure sky rockets while the upgrades don't help at all, they barely help.Some upgrades feel like they do nothing, for an example I got an upgrade to increase lethality, but people die at the same rate as before.If my disease has nearly no severity, it will get spotted no matter what... this is really unfair when I have a PIXAL amount of severity and I pretty much lose when I just started the game.When I try to play sneaky and spread then kill, I keep getting random upgrades because my disease is evolving, this can help, but most of the time ruins the game for me.I would have prefered to have all the stuff unlocked at the start and have ""Beat this difficulty with X disease"" just as achievements, rather then having it locked.Overall it's a fun and basic game, if you enjoy Pandemic, theres no reason to say no to this game."

And while that is largely due to the fact that I don't want to try Bioweapon again, it is also illustrative of why I recommend this game so highly.  You don't have to be good at Plague Inc. to play it and have fun with it.At its core, Plague Inc. is a casual game.  You pop bubbles with your finger or mouse, tap or click to choose how your disease progresses, and that's it.  However, where this game differs from most casual games is that the developers have created layers of strategy and complexity over that basic framework, layers that individual players can freely embrace or ignore as they see fit.  If you don't particularly care about factors like how many uninfected countries have dry climates as opposed to wet climates or how to best target the countries that are advancing cure research, then you can simply ignore them, play on casual, and evolve whatever you feel like.  However, if you are looking for more challenge and depth than the average casual gamer, then you can crank up the difficulty to normal. brutal, or even mega-brutal, and carefully plot out which combinations of symptoms, transmission vectors, and other abilities will lead you to victory.In short, Plague Inc. has something for everyone, from the most casual of casual players ro the hardest of hardcore gamers, and I highly recommend it.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go swear and flail uselessly at the new Shadow Plague disease type some more."

Sounds morbid? Well, it surely is!Upon launching a match you'll first get to choose the disease you want to play - you'll also get to choose one of four difficulty levels - the least one being really though - even for long term players. After this you'll skip to a map of the earth and here you'll get to choose a starting country and from there on you gotta use the skill system (3 skill trees which differ - depending on your disease - all of them using DNA which you'll gather during the match) to overcome the obstacles which the game will throw at you. You'll develop more efficient transmission/resistance abilities to spread further and infect more people - as well as symptoms to spread and later to kill. The setup is very realistic, with a ton of countries, climate zones and random events to make every match you play unique. Note that every match is 45 minutes to 2h long - depending on how you're playing. You're able to save and revisit your match at any given point.At first you'll only able to play as bacteria but upon winning a match you'll unlock the next disease-type. You'll also unlock genes to modify your diseases to make them more resistant to their environment and to generally strengthen them (this enables possibilities to differ in strategies andYES, there IS a zombie disease).I should mention that there aren't any graphics aside of the skilltrees and the map on which planes and ships are moving around and infection bubbles popping up - but those are enough to make it an entangling and fun game. The soundtrack is very good - and there are sometimes slight noises like coughing or children playing depending on how far your disease has spread. In the end everything is silent - a pretty sinister and strong impression if you'd ask me!I should also mention that there is a enjoyable multiplayer with PvP and  Co-op and a scenario creator as well as tons of archievements and scenarios - most of them for more experienced players!This game is extremely fun despite having such a scary background and I really recommend it to you if you're interested in diseases and tactical simulations with much freedom and many ways to approach your goal!"

Your choice of pathogen and genes will affect your gameplay.The challenge of the game is to try and beat the game with all kinds of pathogens, they have different types of mutations that you can research with some unique attributes and abilities.The game is a tablet/mobile port, which is noticeable by some of the UI but in this type of game it isn't really an issue."

Did not regret it in the slightest.Unlike most strategy games, you REALLY have to consider how to indirectly make your virus (or disease) wipe out humanity. Every little choice matters, and can affect you in the long run. What I love about this game, is that humanity doesn't die easily even on, well, easy mode! They'll fight it till the end, and it's fun seeing who'll win. You or the world.Every feature is unique, and I haven't seen a game like this in a long while. Everything that happens is recorded, you will get News of the latest events until your virus becomes deadly (or known) enough to make countries start worrying. It's realistic too since countries will start coming up with ways (news wise, or strategy wise) to stop your virus from killing everyone. It doesn't even stop there-The more you unlock, the crazier (or creative) it becomes in you wiping out humanity. Extremely fun, plus the game is nice enough to let you speed things up since it can take awhile for the infection to spread country to country. Best way in taking any mode on is to make your virus spread quickly without hurting people (even a cough will make doctors eventually look into curing it.) Luckily you can devolve your virus's symptoms so that it doesn't end up drawing attention. Not to mention you can name your virus anything, and a LOT of events can occur in which your last run didn't activate. I somehow caused Japan to have a nuclear plant explode ... and that's just 1 out of the 103 events lol.I give it a solid 9.5/10 and it's just in Alpha. I cannot wait till it's fully done.

There can be a lot of strategy involved even at this stage as you’ll gain resistances to certain effects, but at the same time you may have trouble infecting other countries. There are numerous factors to take into account such as airports and harbours, the climate of the country, if the country is rich or poor – poorer countries will be less capable of dealing with disease – and if the country is an island.You gain DNA points periodically over the course of the game and you’ll gain more by infecting new countries, popping DNA bubbles on the map and generally just spreading your disease. Devolving certain symptoms also yields a refund of DNA points if you need them. Symptoms, transmissions and abilities (such as resistances to drugs and certain weather) all cost DNA points.Each pathogen is distinctly different and each one require different strategies. Bacteria is the most basic pathogen which is easy to master, viruses can mutate very quickly and can quickly get out of control and funguses are hard to spread. Some pathogens also have unique gameplay modifiers to them such as the neurax worm – which can manipulate minds. The neurax worm is able to develop a trait that allows you to fly infected planes to uninfected countries. The necroa virus allows you to control zombie hordes and send them into other countries.Plague Inc. Evolvedcan also be played on 4 difficulty levels – casual, normal, brutal and mega brutal. Normal mode is the most realistic interpretation of how a disease might spread as the game treats 67% of the world’s population as regularly washing their hands and doctors only work a standard amount of days per week. Sick people will also be ignored.Higher difficulties have 100% of people washing their hands, doctors working non-stop and sick people will be locked up in prison.Plague Inc. Evolvedis a mobile/PC port of a game to PC that is done right. Really a great game for the money.THE GOOD- Insane number of factors being simulated- Great customization options- Easy to pick up and play- Humorous scenarios- 10 Different Disease Types- 20 Unique ScenariosTHE BAD- Co-Op matchmaking is defect- Low replay value for campaign missions8/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD |GREAT| AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

,Recommended,246620,13854570,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,Dusty Bronco,"Definitely worth the $15. If you've played this game on iOS or Android, skip this paragraph. Plague Inc is a world-ending virus simulator. It started out on iPhone a few years ago and was a huge success. It consistently topped app charts, had a number of really cool free updates, and it just gives you so much to do. The CDC even liked it enough to meet with the app creator and discuss how to make it more realistic! In this game, you control a plague (bacteria, virus, fungus, man-made plague, brain worm, and more...there's a lot to choose from). You choose where the virus begins, and you watch as it spreads across the world. You control what vectors the virus uses, how the virus defends itself against temperature and medicine, and what symptoms the virus produces (oh, and I'm just going to use ""virus"" as shorthand for ""plague"" just because I'm more used to typing ""virus""). There's a lot of strategy involved, whether you try to create a nearly invisible virus that, when detected, it will be too late or if you try to create a virus that becomes scarier and scarier as it spreads and just overwhelms cure efforts. The game has been balanced to really support both options. As you infect people, new countries, and kill people, you gain DNA points that you use to alter your virus. The scarier that your virus is, the more you're rewarded with points, but the more that every scientist in the world focuses on curing you. Don't worry, however - the game does a great job of explaining everything to you. Whereas a game like Pandemic can be really intimidating with all of these different medical terms (even one for runny nose - are you kidding me?), Plague Inc prefers to use the common words for symptoms. You're not overloaded with choices (but there are enough for you) and the impact each DNA change has is clearly shown (such as infectivity, lethality, and how scary it appears to the world).For those who have played it on mobile, not much has really changed. Each plague is unlocked after beating the previous one, there's the world map, unlockable gene bonuses, etc. However, it doesn't really look too polished as of yet. The UI feels outdated and inexplicably cheap. I almost feel like I'm playing a flash game in my browser. The UI is mostly functional, but has a lot of empty space. It also has some elements that are just for show rather than solving a purpose. For example, a bar graph to the right of the country status indicator (the main bar on the UI) has different colored bars that don't represent anything and don't move. I don't know why they're there. It's still early access, so that may change. Also, every country has a picture of it (mostly just showing people and buildings, maybe a landmark). The pictures look like cheap CGI (god knows why - there's no shortage of real pictures of locations), but there are maybe 10 - or less - pictures used for every country in the world. I don't mean that, say, Sudan cycles through 10 pictures. I mean that Sudan, and ""West Africa,"" ""East Africa,"" and ""South Africa"" (along with most of the rest of the continent) all have the same picture. Cheap CGI with nothing moving. At first I thought it was a neat touch, but that kind of shallowness stands in contrast to how fleshed out the rest of the game is.On the upside, each plague type has its own 3D image that reacts as you upgrade it. It doesn't change as dramatically as the neurax worm on mobile, but it will stretch out and rebound a bit when you upgrade it and wince when you devolve a feature. I think that's pretty neat, and it doesn't feel as cheap. The DNA upgrade menu is definitely an improvement. Also, the world status menu has been solidified and now has all of the important info on one screen. That's a huge improvement.Also, this game has Steam workshop integration, meaning that people are submitting their own plague types. I saw one for a Hank Hill virus earlier today. It looks like people are going to have a lot of fun creating and customizing their own plagues, and I think that's great!In summation, it's the same as the mobile game, but with a new UI (with its ups and downs) and steam workshop support."

It also helps that it takes a while to unlock all of the different types of plagues. The news headlines are amusing. I like to read those while I'm waiting to get more DNA points. Oh yeah, sometimes it can take multiple minutes to save up points, especially early-game when you haven't infected very many people yet. Also, as a pedantic person it bothers me that you can become ""antibiotic-resistant"" as a virus. The game obviously isn't supposed to be scientifically sound, considering it contains zombie viruses, so I'll let that one slide....I always feel slightly guilty when I win a game, too."

(Some of you will probably recall cursing Madagascar for ruining your runs on it. Yeah. That one.) PIE is similar (in fact, I suspect its ""casual"" difficulty setting is based on that game), but a more well-researched and broad title. You start with nothing but bacteria as your plague of choice, but victories will unlock gene modifiers (for starting boosts) and new types of medium. That last chunk is where the craziness comes in: sure, viruses basically play like a more mutatable bacteria, but then you begin unlocking the real weird ones, like a fungus (such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to spread...), or mind-altering worms (suddenly, the goal can go from ""kill the world"" to ""enslave every living thing""), or nanobots trying to thwart their kill-switch... the list goes on, more are still being added, and each plays distinct from the others while keeping the basics of the game, so what you learn with one can carry over to the others.If you worry it's just going to be a pushover, play with the varying difficulty settings or some of the mutator genes you get for victories. Figure out what types of symptoms combine to make you more effective, or take on the double-edged sword of being incredibly mutation-happy. All of a sudden, your disease isn't communicable ENOUGH, and your hosts are dying before infecting others...I really dig this, but you've gotta keep in mind, this is a dark game. It's a frighteningly-realistic simulator of ending the friggin world with disease (or worse). Victory is literally a mass extinction in most scenarios.

I've been through everthing that's available so far on brutal difficulty and it does serve as a decent challenge keeping you gripped.  Depending on your disease as well completely changes the gameplay aspect, so it doesn't feel repetitive.I guess the only thing that will put people off is there isn't much to watch per-say, however there isn't anything quite as satisfying as seeing your disease spread across the world and infect everyone.I'm looking forward to the multiplayer aspects coming in as well, be interesting to see how those pan out!

I browsed on the Steam Store one day and found out that Plague Inc. moved onto PC.The PC version is far different than the smart phone Appilication version. This version looks a lot better (since computers can handle MUCH more than just a smart phone) and feels more smooth. The concepts are about the same.The PC version is a vast improvement since it's appilication version. Graphics have obviously improved. Some little things they've added onto the game really make a difference in setting this version from the app.It's a lot easier to (if you're not good at geography) locate where countries are in the world menu. I'm very good at geography, so that was never a problem for me in the first place, but its a very nice addon. The diseases themselves have animations, and the water in the world menu has animations aswell, thus making the game look prettier. This game, like the app version, is very addicting.Overall, this game deserves best, and even though it's currently in early access alpha, I still rate it a:10/10."

So tired of Steam being so cluttered with expensive mobile ports that make it hard to find actual games among them. Then I read the positive reviews, here. Put it in the back of my mind. Fine, maybe it's decent -- but I'm not paying full price for this. Maybe when it drops to five bucks for awhile, I'll try.Something spurred me to make the impulsive move to eventually buy the game, anyway. And I played it. And . . . it was good. It was really good. Not perfect and lots of room for more compelling and complex additions, but . . . a really solid improvement over the old flash game or the iOS game. This is the way you need to think about making a port to PC. This is the attention and consideration that should be paid.If you haven't played this type of game before, go check out the mobile version. If you like that, you're likely to enjoy this a lot, too. If you couldn't stand that, the PC version might not be for you. In other words, if you liked the original, this is more of that - and better.Overall, $15 might still be a little pricey for this type of game. I think $10 would be ideal. It shouldn't be a deal breaker, though; if nothing else, put this on your list and come back to it when it's a little cheaper, if you are hesitant."

Plague is a very simple type of game wth very complex mechanics, Easy to learn, yet challenging. I'll start with the pro's then move to the cons.-PRO'S-Variety of pathogens to choose from-Each pathogen has its on quirks and methods of killing-Each pathogen requires you to take a different approach to transmition-The BGM tends to draw out your inner bio terrorist and really allows you to immerse yourself into the game-The many adaptations and genes to each pathogen add more replayability to the game.-As far as I can tell, There are no bugs (Atleast for me)-the game can be either fast pace or slow depending on your playstyle.-Devs so far seem to be activeCONS- there is a part where you will need to grind early on pathogens to achieve genes to assist you with some of the pathogens that cannot be transmitted as fast on a large scale. (This is very minor)-Games like this struggle with replayability, though this game trys its best to conquer that, after 12 hours of playing it can be a little repetitive. While every scenario and every game prevents different challenges, you find yourself trying to conquer the same feats (Transmitting your virus to the same island countries...Damn you greenland)SUMMERY-While Plague is still early access, the content is def there, the game is very enjoyable and coming from a major in patho and microbiology the simulation is very accurate to what you could expect in real life scenarios. $15 is a well worth it. My hats off to the devs, I apologize for my grammer, punctuation, run ons, spelling and blah blah blah.. its 6am and I have been spreading aids for the last 12 hours. and on that note...

They also have unique scenarios that you can play which are difficult. The downside to this game is that it gets repetetive. If you do not have the willpower to keep trying again after failing 4 times then this game is not for you. You can cheat and look up guides to kill the world. Also this game is time consuming and if you don't pay attention you can miss valuable resources.

You can even make your own scenarios and download other people's scenarios through Steam workshop, and there is a multiplayer mode now as well. Basically, there is just a lot of replayability. Now the UI, which is what you interact with all the time while playing this game, is simplistic and could use some improvements here and there, mostly in terms of aesthetics, but it works very well. The audio is good, but I think it could use a bit more variety. This game is still in early access though, and I've kept that in mind, and it is a very impressive game, even at this stage.TLDR;+ Lots of content and extreme replayability+ Realistic+ Steam workshop integration+ Very good multiplayer- The UI could use some improvements9/10"

Normal, some people wash their hands some doctors work so they might discover the sickness.

All the skills (from avian transmission to projectile vomiting) are useful, and while some strategies are more prevalent than others, there's no be-all-end-all way to win the game like there is in Pandemic 2. I'm ten hours in and I'm still finding new ways to win against the odds.The visuals are vastly improved over the mobile iteration, with red transmission dots forming across the world map as countries fall victim to your plague, 3D renders of your plague hovering in the menus, and image feeds of the cities popping up as they descend from normalcy into chaos.The devs will be adding online multiplayer, Steam Workshop support, and tutorials (amongst other features) in the upcoming weeks/months, but it's more than playable now and I definitely recommend it if you loved Pandemic and want a superior version of it."

You do not add any symptoms as they cause the plague to be discovered (and quickly cured).  This renders most of the symptoms pointless- as you don't dare use them.  Once everyone in the world is infected (which normally means waiting for greenland which is very cold, and very isolated) you quickly turn the disease lethal - from totally asymptomatic to a heart stopping, system killing death machine.  You then buy the abilities that stop or slow research and watch the world die.The main wrinkle is mutation which will randomly generate symptoms for your disease- there are basically two types of diseases, ones which allow you to cancel those and get resources back, the other that costs resources to cancel.  First type is very easy, second type can randomly screw your run by mutating before its fully spread and starting the cure clock."

It's brutal-especially on the difficulties of the same name haha. This game is about creating and mutating various plagues to wipe out mankind. You might not think it, but this is actually a great game to play with a group of friends. It's perversely satisfying when you and a group of friends get together and simulate various ways to wipe out humanity-whether it be with an ancient brain controlling worm, a prion, a mechanical bioweapon, a simple virus or bacteria.They even added more plagues than that which is a large part of why I love this game so much. It would have been great as it was, but they weren't satisfied and added a vampiric plague that allows you to create vampires and enslave humanity, or you could wipe out the world with a zombie apocalypse, and they added a Planet of the Apes type plague that allowed you to mess around with the idea of using sentient apes to destroy humanity. The amount of thought and depth they put into each of those three new plagues impresses me and is the main reason I will always come back to play this.It's a great game whether you're looking to just kill a couple hours, or trying to game all week. There are a bunch of scenarios that let you play out various situations either made up or from history to keep you interested if you get bored of the main game. Scenarios like the black plague, or an infectious happiness disease. This game even has multiplayer so you can play online with your friends or other people. I haven't tried it out yet, but I know it has both co-op and competitive modes for whether you want to work with or crush others online.I also like that it rewards you for completing games by unlocking additional genes to implant in your plagues to help give them a boost (help them spread faster) in certain environments or help them remain unseen for longer. These are essential if you're going to try and beat any of the plagues on their highest difficulties. Seriously-this game is beautifully difficult. The genes aren't necessary for normal gameplay, but they do make it easier and more fun to try to more manually direct how your plague spreads at first. For example: I like starting out in Saudi Arabia or India. They're both arid, hot climates and I often give my plague a gene boost in arid climates and a boost to spreading by land because they are both connected to a ton of landmass and arid climates. However, I could also have chosen genes that gave my plague a boost in cold and/or humid climates to help my plague spread once it leaves it's starting environment. Since all your plagues get a slight bonus to the environment type they start in (makes sense, right?) it might be more beneficial to me to plan ahead and help my plague out in climates that it normally would be fairly ineffective in.All in all, if you like a good strategy game and the idea of wiping out humanity in any way appeals to you-I recommend trying this game out. It's worth your time and money whether it's on sale or full price."

Odds are your on Steam on a laptop or desktop and want to play a real game. This just doesn't cut it. On the phone its great. On here, its the phone app just bigger with some clouds and some added information screens. Certainly not enough of an upgrade to warrent $14.99.I'm sorry but seriously, fifteen dollars? I have games I paid less than 5 dollars for that are more involved with better gameplay and graphics than this. Again I can't say it enough, on your phone or pad, yeah this is a great game. I loved it, still play around on it when I'm killing time. But here, it's just not enough.Basically you have a world map, pick a country or area and start. As the game goes, clouds move some, boats and planes move around the map, and you occasionally pop bubbles. Sometimes you will have popped enough bubbles to evolve your disease, this part is just another couple of screens with a skill tree, oh and a simple animation of your disease, that will change as you evolve it, you rather will grow as you evolve it, no matter what you chose the picture will change the same way. Illusion of choice. Just not a very good illusion. My other issue with this game is the fact that when you start you can only play as bacteria, you have to beat the game on normal with bacteria to unlock the virus, and so on and so forth. So if you bought this game thinking about making some nanovirus from the future...yeah your not going to be doing that for a while. Cause you will have to unlock it and to do that you will have to play as certain things in certain styles. There are only a couple of for sure ways to beat the game with each type so instead of having the freedom to play as you want, to unlock everything you'll have to play very paticular ways. Again the illusion of choice.Now on the bright side of things, this is EA and the game will have features and things added in later. Thats great, I suggest maybe then you wait to buy it till its released. However, I'd take real close look at the screenshots, what you see is pretty much what you get."

I was slightly skeptical if a PC version could actually be any different and more enjoyable. Currently, it's holding up better than its iOS version and the regular updated with fresh content keeps me regularly coming back to try them out. Apart from that though the replayabiltiy seems to lose its appeal after you've completed each plague a couple of times ( unless you really care about completing each disease on the hardest difficulty ).Sadly the scenario mode doesn't really offer much difference from playing as a regular plague, albeit with a few preset evolutions and different human interaction. The real stand out features are the Neurax Worm and Necroa Virus, both of which work very differently to the regular plagues. Whereas each disease follows a similar concept, evolve symptoms and transmission until you've infected most the world, then start killing people. The Neurax Worm & Necroa Virus offer different methods of completion, taking control of humanity through the Worm, or driving the human race to extinction through zombies with the Necroa.The Simian flu is essentially an altered version of the Necroa virus created as a tie in for the Planet of the Apes move, I don't have a problem with it, and its definitely a nice addition, but it all feels a bit too familiar after you've turned everyone in to a flesh eating zombie a few times over.Overall the game is definitely worth purchasing, even while its in early access, although you might find yourself a bit bored as you approach the 30 hour mark, the frequent updates will keep you regularly coming back to try out new features and try your hand at the scenarios again.8/10+Regularly updated, simplistic design, cool plagues, Zombies- Gets boring after 24 hours or so, scenarios are a bit basic."

The Mobile version caught attention of millions of players when it was released and was a world hit game. Fans enjoyed and loved the game. Why? They had a reason to be. It was an amazing and well developed game. You, the gamer controls a pathogen that infects a person and starts to spread. How your pathogen evolves is based on your choices and how you want it to be. A stealthy pathogen that spreads around slowly and stealthy to destroy the human race or a killing machine that kills everything it touches. The devs made the game even better by adding different kinds of pathogens, all the way from bacteria, all the way to turning humans into friken apes.Now this game was not that hyped because it seemed like plague inc for the computer. Not really different. But they suprised us. The game featured better graphics more scenarios, even a future multiplayer in development. This time they  even brought in a scenerio character for the players. Making the game even better. In conclusion, Plauge inc. Evolved really did, evolve. It brought many different new feautres to the game making the game great with many new options to the player that make them even more superior in the game."

Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death.

Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus.

I do not have any major issues with the game but for the unlocking of the Modify Genetic Code, to make it a little more easier, not to much, but a little easier to unlock for future plagues.Which I don't know if James did fix that or not, but that just my opinion and 2 cent in with this review.

And by now I mean it has been there for 10 months.The game costs 15 euros but it is free on mobile. Is it worth it? It makes me think about Fruit Ninja Kinect. Is it worth it? Well... do you want to play it on PC? Are you a streamer or a Youtuber? Did you get it from the Plague Inc boardgame for free? Then yes.Alot hasn't changed from the orginal game. Sure, it looks alot better. Not just graphics vice, but it overall feels more PC. It isn't just a game slapped on PC with the developer saying ""GIVE ME MONEY. But does it have 15€ worth of improvements? Lets see how the game works first:You start off by selecting a disease. When you win with that disease on normal or above, you unlock the next disease. Each one has its unique play style but they all basically work the same. Once you have selected your disease, you can move on to choose your starting country. WHY IS ALASKA PART OF CANADA? Once you have chosen a country, the game begins. You can upgrade your disease by giving it more killing power, more infectivity or making people think it is dangeous. Your disease then speads over the world etiher by land, boat or plane. Once people start dying and see ""Hey, theres this new disease going around! Lets deal with it!"".Now there will be a country that will be the main or the head of the research that tries to find a cure to your disease. The more damage you do, the more they invest in research. They can also block you from entering a nation and infecting it by closing the borders or executing the infected. There are many ways they can block you but a disease always finds a way, like infecting via birds, rodents, bats, water, air or livestock. They send these planes to get DNA or something, burst their bubble and kill each and every last one of them!. One match can easily last 30 minutes and its really fun.Thats the game in a nutshell. Theres also this very unique mode, the... the disease from The Rise of the Planet of the Apes. That SImean flu thing. It is very fun, you should check it out. Infecting apes and humans. It is a bucket of fun.But back to the main issue, is it worth 15 euros? Well you can go to the leaderboards or make your own custom scenarios, speed runs, CO-OP? This game has Co-Op!? Unfortunately I have no friends who own this game, so I can't really talk about it. Is it wort 15 euros though?I wouldn't say so. I have to say that this game isn't an game you will play actively. It is a phone game. It is a fun distraction, it is a game designed to be played while waiting for the buss or when you nothing to do. Despite all these new updates, it isn't worth 15 euros to me. Maybe to you. But I recommend you buy it on sale, like I did. I got it for 7,50. I think it was barely worth 7,50. 5 euros? Must buy. 7,50? Eh, I mean it is a fun little game to play. So I think I will give it a pass."

Today I am bringing you a review of an intriguing little Simulator-type game called Plague, Inc. Plague, Inc has been around on mobile devices for a while, and on Steam since February 20, 2014. It is still in Early Access, but Publisher/Developer Ndemic Creations is VERY active, having just recently added the highly anticipated Competitive Multiplayer mode.(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)Video Review:https://youtu.be/60mmrRezNlEThe ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Great game, good casual way to pass time OR you can ramp up the difficulty and give yourself fits. Highly replayable. Active Devs. Another 4/5 on an incomplete game? Yup. Worth $15 easily.The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:I picked this game up a long time ago on my iPhone and loved it, so when it came to Steam I picked it up about a year ago around Xmas. I stashed it away, awaiting it's release from Early Access. Well, I couldn't wait and the newly updated Multiplayer mode gave me an excuse to review it anyways! Now, I didn't review the MP mode simply because I wanted gamers to get a feel for the actual game itself first. This game is a simulation game where you are trying to spread a disease and essentially wipe out mankind. You get points to evolve your disease in different categories (Transmission, Symptoms, Abilities) to try and help it spread and eradicate humanity. Meanwhile, the world works against you by crafting a cure, shutting down airports/harbors, etc. Pesky humans, you'll find, are quite resiliant. As you play and get better at the game you unlick different types of diseases and starting genomes for your disease. There is a lot here and this is all fun on it's own, but then you incorporate things like Steam Workshop, User Made Scenarios, Multiplayer and the like, and the replayability shoots through the roof. The best part....they aren't even done yet and are obviously very active in the games continued development. Hop on board now, this is not one to miss. 4/5 easily, even in it's incomplete state. There is MORE than enough to play here, nothing game breaking going on, they just keep adding more and more awesome stuff!! Well worth the $15!Happy Gaming!!!"

I bought this game with high hopes as I played the original pandemic games as a child and was highly addicted to them for a while, but naturally I forgot about them and moved on. Now several years later a full steam release with polished graphics, new pathogens, more tactics and more realism? Yes please! The only thing I will say is at this point in it's development it is not worth it's current price tag, once they add in the mind control worm and zombie virus I have a feeling that will change. So in short, if you are looking to dominate the world as a deadly disease that cannot possibly be stopped and wipe out the human race in it's entirety, there is no better or more fun way to do it then Plague Inc Evolved (Either that or you could just manufacture a deadly disease and do it yourself :P)"

I had some fun with it, but I never played the mobile version. If you did, you're probably better off with that one, since this costs a whopping 15 bucks and doesn't really offer all that much.In PI:E you are a virus or bacterium or whatever you wanna be. Your goal is the eradication of the human race. Sounds like fun and actually is for a short time. The main game consists of several different scenarios from simple viruses, bacteria to mind control worms and ""ape flues"". In theory this all sounds very interesting and different. In reality though this is where the game just falls off, because every scenario is more or less the same with some minor differences (the Simian Flue is actually the most interesting since you can actually create ape colonies, have them fight and transmit the disease, etc.)The core gameplay, however, stays the same. You pick a starting country (preferably with access to planes and ships) and then click on various bubbles to get ""DNA"" points with which you can increase the virility, severity and lethality of your plague, as well as develop certain immunities or stronger transmission via birds, insects, air, etc.The problem is you don't really see the effects of these choices. You can mostly just guess what you might need. Let's take Greenland as an example: It's only accessible by boat (potentially birds I guess), is sparsely populated and pretty cold, so it's imho the hardest country to even infect. You need to invest a lot and the costs are constantly rising after each upgrade. ♥♥♥♥ you, Greenland.There's also a lot of RNG involved since your plague can mutate randomly, which can ♥♥♥♥ up your whole plan, leading either to a too quick discovery by doctors or killing people too quickly before everyone can get infected. You can ""devolve"" these mutations, but that costs DNA points as well...*sigh*.When your plague is discovered you can only hope that you can infect everyone quickly enough since there isn't much you can do to slow down research other than investing in particular traits if you get enough DNA points, which becomes ever harder the longer the game goes on since you mostly get them from infecting new countries. Fascinatingly, once the cure is found, millions of people are healed quasi over night and you lose the game almost instantly.PI:E is not a bad ""game"", but it's more of a time sink than a real strategy game imho. I can't imagine what playing this on brutal would look like...casual was already annoying enough. Might grab this for a steep discount."

(along with bacteria, which is what you start with to infect the world and wipe out the human race), but this game is a lot deeper than it first appears.  In a way, it's kind of like Risk, in the sense that you essentially need to infect (capture) each state on the map, and then wipe out the humans before they have time and resources to fight back, but the challenge is that unless you do things just right, a well laid plan can backfire pretty easily.Having said that, I've already dumped a good 20 hours into the game so far, and it keeps me coming back for more.  You get to know when you've blown it and have to do the game over after a few raounds of play, but eventually you figure out what strategy you need to do to win with the particular plague you are given.  At least partly.  There are enough randome elements thrown in such as unexpected mutations, unexpected actions such as the pesky humans putting filters in aircraft which can hinder your ability to spread.  Getting to the islands of Greenland and New Zealand (among several others) can make or break a game.  If there are ANY humans left alive at the end, you lose, full stop.But I would say this game is very well thought out (and appearenly a hit in it's previous mobile form) and even though it's not finished it's one of those games that just keeps yanking you back for more.  Just ONE more try, just one more round, and to me, that's when you are getting your money's worth in a strategy game.If you like risk, chess, or any world domination type game, this is definitely one to check out.  One warning, it's not finished yet, so there are still features like custom scenarios coming.  But don't worry, you have to get through multiple plagues to unlock all of them, and then you have to actually beat the game about 10 more times to unlock all of the buffs that you can get for your plagues at the start of each game.I don't know about anyone else, but I look foward to playing a few rounds each night.

This is either going to be extremely awesome, and make the game worth every penny of the $15, or it'll be a huge let down.I highly recommend picking the game up. Either now, if you're feeling anxious like me, or wait until the full release hits so you aren't all antsy for the additional features to unlock. I might also add the summer sale is only a little ways away, and if you're like me you still have plenty of games to play from the winter sale.I'm glad this made it to PC. It's much more enjoyable compared to playing on my phone."

I was pretty addicted on getting everything completed on the mobile, and after i finished most of the things it was a big boner killer. Then now, the computer Version arrived which was a breath of fresh air :)The Game is very pretty graphically, i also love the themes in question of trying to help to Donate to certain non-profits in-game making the gamers aware of what goes on. The game is basically just like the Mobile version but in a Prettier and more detailed Version . You get to understand the countries, weakenessess and strenghts of viruses better, the spread of the virus looks way cooler, and there's also everything unlocked (not having to buy in pieces like the mobile version)Overall, i enjoy the game a lot and for now i give a 8.5/10 for the game.What i would like to See enhanced/Improved?More Music tracks, more viruses/Evolution. Maybe a Virus versus Cure mode Online?(thats just a wild dream), Some perks on the way you can play mechanically.Its a Early Access game so i do have high hopes for the future :) Keep the great Work!"

The well-done simulation and realistic reactions of the world really sets it apart as it's not a no-brainer where you can easily kill everyone.Different plague gives you different opportunities, challenges and adaptability. The most fun is the plagues that are created completely differently in how they work, and seeing how different mutations and evolution stages affect both the virus looks and the way it works is a complete satisfying experience.The introduction of camera feed was an awesome step in my opinion, although I did hope it would have been more than still-pictures of different situations, I still enjoy it. All the different challenges you can undertake also gives it an amazing replayability.Definitely worth a buy.

I wait with a lot of impatience for a multiplayer, a full plague and scenarios editor, the possibility to create or fight the disease online. A few plagues are more original than the others, and the game would need more of these. Some can control minds, send back humanity to Ice age, transform peoples in zombies or even recreate the Planet of the Apes. THIS is what I want to see, because the usual plagues like bacteria, virus, nano virus, prion and bio weapon are honestly quite similar and boring. Fighting boredom on this game is important because all the real animation is just a world map and a few photos of the capital. The game really needs some real time videos showing the evolution of each threats and deceases on every countries to make it immersive.Buy it, you are safe, just do it, have fun with the lot of possibilities and trophies it propose yet, and give a chance to these developpers to show you their best, I support them for the work and help they already done, and i really invite you all to do same, you have nothing to regret.

If they (the human race) cure you, or you run out of living hosts, you lose.The ""nastier"" your disease gets, the harder the humans will try to develop a cure.There are several different plague types (virus, bacteria, bio-weapon etc), and each has there own quirks. For example , a virus will mutate rapidly (possibly developing to be too nasty before you have infected all that many people), while the Neurax Worm can either kill or enslave the humans.Each game only takes an hour or two, and it's both entertaining and (to a degree) educational.If it has a downside, it's that the strategy for all disease types is broadly the same - you want to infect as many people as possible while trying to limit the ""nastiness"" of the disease. Once everyone/most of the world are infected, then you can ramp up the lethality.But even with this consideration, the game has a large amount of replayability, as wins unlock new genes for you to customise your disease, and the different plague types each require a somewhat different strategy.

There will be times when those bloody secluded Greenlanders or New Zealandfolk simply seem to refuse to get infected, and nothing is more frustrating, but when you get it just right, and watch it spread like absolute wildfire...very satisfying. Also, as someone who works in retail, destroying the human race is usually the ideal way to blow off steam after a hard day of work.I should mention this game started off as a smartphone app and has been ported to PC.

The game comes with more features than the mobile version, like Versus Multiplayer(recently came out), Scenario Creator, Scenarios from other players as well as sharing your own created ones. Ndemic Creations also plan creating the Co-op multiplayer, which may get interesting... unless you know that you have no friends that play Plague Inc. Evolved...Graphics are much more advanced than in the mobile version, along with 3d zooming in, each country has their own picture.Most of negative reviews which say ""Almost every type of disease has almost the same grid"" - did they try scenarios? Some of the scenarios have entirely different symptoms, transmissions and abilities, some of them just change the gameplay a bit.This game has no DLC(yet), while on the mobile version, to get Necroa Virus, Neurax Worm, Scenarios, you need to pay some amount.This game is also really informative if you think.

This time it's Greenland that distrust everyone and close their port at the slightest whiff of any symptoms.The game is educational on both the infection spread and the geography of the world. And probably anger management.It's an early access game, but there is still plenty to do. I've not touched the scenarios yet, but the interaction with players on the design is a big plus.With the main game, it feels like the difficulty may be a barrier to some players and that locking content is a bit off putting when you lose your first normal game as you feel like you'll never be able to unlock anything whatsoever. Once you've got a rough strategy going (and playing games on casual unlocks helpful extras) of sneaky sneaky, kill 'em all before they can even think about starting a cure, you'll appreciate the subtle differences of the different plague types. Then will begin to find the game much more enjoyable and will start developing your own favourite techniques, such as, mega hordes of zombies invading the irritating surviving country, nasty symptom combos and mind control.The save function is useful as well, in case something doesn't go quite right or you just want to boot up a 100% infected world and wipe them out in whatever way you see fit. Whilst the world menus seemed useful, I didn't find myself using them much. Maybe they just need a little more polish. Who knows?pros--Lots of features-Steam workshop-Variety-Value for money-Quick to load-Easy to pick up and playCons-App style means it feels like it should be played on a touch screen.-Endless frustration at eagle-eyed researchers"

I am always jumping up and down like a 2 yr old on an Extreame surgar high, waiting for the next update to bring the Necroa virus or the workshop. I reccomend this to players who like flash games on the internet and strategy games.But there are a few things i have against this game.Its way easier than the original mobile game and i could beat it in under an hour again if you dared me to. I beat it in 6 hours before, and the other 2 hours ive played it is just re-beating it all on mega brutal,(which is waaay to easy for the hardest difficulty) and messing with the recently added Neurax worm.(which again, is still to easy and ive beaten a bunch of times)If it were me, i would rate this a 7/10 or a 6/10 because it is really fun at the beggining but you can beat it in 30 minutes if you really try. I personaly cannot wait until it adds the workshop. It would make tons of oppertunities for extra gameplay. Who knows what people could come up with? (The Last Of Us fungus? hint hint.....) When they add that, i would probrably change my 6 to 7 out of 10 to a 9 to 10 out of 10. The gameplay would never end with millions of players uploading and developing their own custom diseases for others and themselves to enjoy. Again, who knows what could happen? What could you create to infect the world when it comes out? *coughs* ugh.... man i dont feel good....*dies*EDIT: For most of you who are saying ""wel dis gaem waz 1 dallar on da app store hur dur"" the plague inc app was free when you downloaded it, i know. the reason why its 14$ here is because they give you ALL the special features you would have to BUY on the app version, free. If you bought everything on the app verson, it would be about 14 to 20 dollars. So technically, 14$ is a fair price for a game that gives all the dlc to you on purchase :p"

This game, while not action-packed, is definitely for those who love strategy. This game has plenty.Don't be fooled by Casual and Normal difficulties, where it first appears that the strategies are all the same. The real challenge lies in Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties, where everything you do has a serious consequence. At those difficulty levels, each plague becomes unique, and managing them to beat the cure is no easy task. You really have to plan and think your way through each, and even then random events can derail you.

I'm really not into the bubble clicking thing but this can be removed later in the game: I still feel this may turn off more ""serious"" strategy gamers with it's free mobile app feel and that really I don't think that it adds anything in terms of game-play: I suspect it's there to add a sense of urgency and to keep the player's attention focused, but I really think that it would be better replaced with something that feels a bit less cheap.That being said, there's clearly a lot of depth here. The game ramps up the difficulty pretty quickly and there are a good few options for altering the core game pretty significantly.I've not felt particularly interested in sustained gameplay: it hasn't totally grabbed me in all honesty. Personally I find that the fact you can play through a single player game in a half hour or less very appealing. I recommend the game on this basis, that it's a good quick strategy fix. I'll be putting more hours into thisBut it's pretty unique as far as I can tell and it's a worthwhile addition to any strategy gamer's collection.EDIT:I've noted the comments below and edited this review accordingly: further proof that you should probably research something before low-rating.I do stand by my original comment that it still feels like a free-to-play game, albiet it a very nicely presented and polished one. My main gripe was the bubble clicking thing and since that is something you can get around I've changed my recommendation. I still think it needs to be removed for the reasons stated above."

Cool game.Cons : after 10 or 20 games, you will find it a bit repetitive, as it's quite a small game. You unlock some bonus, but game remain the same, then you can play in multi-players. Some end game failure with harbors locks are not really realist, and it make then impossible to win.

You are fighting against a simulation of disease response by human organizations. Your goal is to kill all humans before being cured. Your methods are choosing Transmision vector, Symptoms, and resistance to climate/drugs/research mutations. The choice of when to mutate how is interesting and fun to experiment with as you interact with the simulated global population. Expect to lose often as you feel out how the game responds to stimuli. Games can be very short, and there's a mild clicker aspect to keep you engaged in what would otherwise be a very hands off game.

At higher difficulties, random events can make or break your entire evolutionary course, though not without cause or justification.Despite the difficulty of certain viruses (mainly the Necroavirus, in my case), I never felt the urge to look up a walkthrough. The game never got frustrating or repetitive, no matter how many times I clicked retry. Each time, I simply had to think harder and try new paths.Being a science type, I love the non-frustrating complexity that comes into play in this game. There are so many different things to try in terms of symptoms, transmissions, and now scenarios. Even after you've completed each disease, there's so much more to do. Highly reccomend it."

You start by infecting some people, then you start infecting every country and finally kill everyone.

Intuitively, you'd think there are only so many times you can destroy the world with your pathogen of choice in a 10-30 minute rampage, but you'd be wrong just like I was.When I first got the game, there were the standard pathogens to choose from - Bacteria, Virus, Prion - and I'd proceed to destroy the world (Greenland notwithstanding) for 15 minutes at a time in single-player. I played for maybe 4 hours in 15 minute bursts, but soon grew bored.A year on my GF bugged me into installing it on my old laptop so she could play it.I looked over her shoulder and saw she was entrenched in a multiplayer battle, her disease fighting to destroy the world before her competitor's, actively seeking to spend her precious little DNA to sabotage her nemesis' pathogen and strengthen her own. I swiftly took the laptop from her and played for the next 4 hours straight.In my absence, there was now a fully-fledged multiplayer mode - versus or co-op. There were new diseases - Neurax Worm, Simian Flu, Vampires. There were scenarios that forced you into abandoning your tried-and-trusted strategies and finding new ways to kill everyone.I later found out that many of these changes had come long after the early access period was in the rear-view mirror, which brings me back to my original point - the devs are great.After its full release, the devs could have moved on, taken on new projects, made more money, but instead they stayed to ensure Plague became a 40-hour game, not a 4-hour game. The reason you'll see reviews that state the PC version's supremacy over the iOS game is because the iOS version is pretty much the Early Access version, comparable to the one I first alluded to - fun for a while, easy to pick-up-and-play, but not the game you sink hours into - whereas the devs continue to work on Plague (Steam version), adding new content and improving gameplay to this day.This is the only game I've ever bought twice - I bought my GF it so we could play together. I don't recommend doing the same, or if you do avoid Versus mode, because it caused several considerable arguments when one of us did something underhanded to expediate our annihilation of the free world at the others expense. Stick to Co-op.This game has my highest recommendation. I believe it is one of the most content-rich games available (considering its price) and, given a reasonable chance, could be enjoyed by nearly anyone with a Steam account."

,Recommended,246620,29591832,Posted: 30 January,all,Paladeus,"Hidy hidy,It's a fairly simple game, but some of the scenario's are complex-enough in nature that you can't just start this and then let it run like clicker games (""Time Clickers"", ""Clicker Hero"", etc.) A large reason for that is because you have to click to earn your consumable points (""DNA Points"") to evolve your pathogen and, you know, play like you're God with a magnifying glass and the population of Earth are ants.Dislikes (first, since few):My only TRUE dislike is how there's not a tutorial for some things. For example, Zombies aren't too difficult, but the vampirism plague took me a while to figure out (if you're like me and try to figure it out on your own. Otherwise, Youtube has got many ""Let's Play"" and tutorial videos that explain things as others have figured out.) The tutorial/how-to option in the game has the basic information, but not much detail other than enough to get you started.Likes:You'll singlehandedly be responsible for ending life on Earth. No pressure. It's not like you'll have nightmares over the horrors you'll unleash upon the populace.There's a wonderful learning curve, even if a little steep for some pathogens (I still haven't beat vampirism.)As you beat normal and hard difficulties, you'll earn modifiers to help your plague along at the start of the game, which makes planning things ahead a bit more fun.I've not played the custom scenario aspect of the PC-version of the game. To be honest, I had this on my phone for a good deal longer than from the computer. That said, I've seen some general negative comments about it, mostly in bugs and the like, but the overwhelming number of comments appears to love that aspect.For myself, as long as I'm not in the mood for adrenaline and just want to relax and have something to do, this is a good game. 9/10 (About the same sort of fun level for me as Peggle, chess, checkers, etc. Some strategy, and trying to stay ahead of the 'enemy'.)-Paladeus"
,Recommended,246620,28553763,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Draggo,"Pros:-Challenging in the greatest way possible. I usually find games that provide somewhat of a challenge, but not enough to really test your abilities and get you thinking of what to do differently. This game has that extra challenge that gets you thinking of new ideas and tricks.-The ability to create your own virus and give it unique effects that you can generate in the game. I do recommend playing  the game first and understanding what does what and such before experimenting with this tool. It will make creating your own virus much more fun.-Different plague types that really change up the gameplay, there is tons of clones of this game that fail to do this, and usually each type of plague in them play a similar style, or can be beaten using the same strategy. With this, each plague plays drastically different than the other.-Unique Scenarios that depict real life plagues or something completely random to occupy you after you beat the core game.-The ultimate feeling that will please all sadists knowing you are killing off all of humanity.Cons:-The Fungus plague type is extremely boring, and if you get too impatient (Which probably will happen) it will anger you to the point you will throw your controller because it has been 6 years and you finally infected everything, only to end up losing because you dont have very much DNA. So to get around this, only increase the infectivity a little, and let the game infect everyone THEN when you save enough, Get to total organ failure, and then you should win.-I really dont have other cons personally, if I play this game more and I find some other things personally tedious, I will add them.I recently bought this on PC, and I will say it is definitely worth picking up if it goes on sale, It is quite the upgrade from the mobile version, which is good, but doesnt feel as massive as this is. I have already pumped 22 hours into this game, which is a rare sight for me since I do not really play games any more. If you like a challenge, and you like moderate paced action, this game is for you."

Control your spreading, evolve your symptoms, evade the research for a cure and exterminate or subjugate the whole population on Earth through a world map interface.PROS+The mechanics are rather interesting: you are tasked with leading a plague to infect the whole world (and generally kill all mankind in some gruesome way), you choose your starting point and then use points to buy ""perks"" that adapt your plague to various biomes and situations (i.e. giving it more resilience to medications or allowing birds or else to spread it), develop various symptoms and resist to the inevitable research for a cure that will eventually start. It's cool, and well thought out.+There are multiple plagues that require different playstyles. Some are generic, some mutate on their own or travel slowly, others require being very fast in order not to accidentally kill all the infected before going worldwide, and so on. Necroa virus and the Planet of the Apes plague are particularly awesome and different from the standard plague, but Neurax Worm is also fun because of its double ending.+Achievement hunt is fun and satisfying, though it may require a guide to unlock some rather random events that lead to an achievement. Completing the plagues at the highest difficulty available is also a great challenge that increase the title's longevity for whoever likes its gameplay.+Workshop community is active enough and brings to the table many new interesting plague scenarios that further improve this game's appeal and variety.+Interface is simple but clean and enjoyable to look at.CONS-It can become rather repetitive after some time. After all, it's one mechanic, a brilliant one sure, but one only. Once you get used to infect the world and develop symptoms and other thingies, doing it again and again can get exhausting, also because a single playthrough may take quite some time to kick in. As said before, higher difficulty levels and custom scenarios by both developers and steam modders increase this game's longevity, but only to a certain extent for non-hyperfans.-At some moments, it can be rather boring to play, especially in earlier stages when you slowly start infecting some people and gain points veeeeeeeery slowly. Sometimes i just stared at the screen doing nothing for like 45 seconds, which may not seem much but when there's nothing interesting going on there it's quite some time.-Once the plague has been discovered and a cure research has started, mostly all the (expensive, point-speaking) things that a plague can do to defend itself are either lackluster (like barely reducing the research completion percentage) or seemingly completely worthless. It's rather frustrating when you invest some precious early points to ""slow down future research"", and then it still goes lightning-fast (like 1% per second, which is a lot, trust me) when it fully cranks up. Stealth playthroughs, in which you first infect the whole world then develop all the deadliest symptoms at once, are the more viable option, but they're also slow, boring and somewhat unrealistic (seriously, it doesn't matter if it has barely any symptoms, if something infects the whole world a cure should start ANYWAY).Plague Inc. is an atypical ""strategy"" game (it was born on cellphones, for the record) with simple but addicting mechanics and a good amount of gameplay variations, as much as its limited interface and its unique but one-dimensional playstyle allow. If you like what this game has to offer you'll play it for quite a while."

Then you start devolping symptoms and in no time the world is taken over by your creation!The ""Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"" or CDC said that the game ""uses a non-traditional route to raise public awareness on epidemiology, disease transmission, and diseases/pandemic information. The game creates a compelling world that engages the public on serious public health topics"". They use also the models themselves to see what would happen as well and bigger red dots I think are based on real world populations.

I'm going to be going to school for infectious diseases so I'm kind of biased when it comes to this genre but I really do believe others will find it as fun as I do. This version is a lot more complex than the free online Flash game (I'm not sure whether or not it's made by the same people though) that has the same concept. If you liked the Flash version then you'll love this. The Flash one, however, get's kind of boring once you've beaten it the first time but Plague Inc: Evolved allows you to unlock items and options that increase the depth of your gameplay. By doing this, even after you've killed all of humanity once, there is still tons left in the game for players to want to come back to. Unlike the Flash version, you won't get bored after your first time winning as there will still be so much more to expreience. Instead of giving you all the options right at the beginning like the Flash version, you actually have to work for things in Plague Inc: Evolved. So far I've played around 36 minutes, which on the Flash version would have been long enough for me to beat the entire game, but with Plague Inc: Evolved 36 minutes is only enough to expreience the very beginning. I think one of the other really important features of this game is that, although you don't need to have a high end PC to play it on its highest settings, it still looks beautiful. If this is the kind of game you're into (puzzle, statagey, infetious diseases) or you enjoyed the online Flash version then I highly recommend buying Plague Inc: Evolved... you won't be disappointed. It's well worth the $15."

Evolved sets you, a human being behind the keyboard, in the world of viral outbreaks, bacteriological contagion, and man-made epidemics set from whatever date you start playing all the way to years from now, in which your virus can either destroy or be destroyed.The game offers various scenarios with your choice of different types of plague to choose from. Each plague has a genomic upgrade, unlocked throughout your playtime, which could make your plague superior. After that, it's all about location, location, location. Any country can start this epidemic and every country can be infected, but no country is safe.Currently, as of Aug. 4, 2014(the date of this review), it's under construction to include a few new ways of transmitting diseases, to symptoms that could resemble everyone's favorite apocalypse, to abilities that could hinder the efforts of curing diseases, but that's not all. You will be able to create NEW SCENARIOS in the custom scenarios slot. You can mutate the common cold or make Bedbugs become the prime transmitter of your disease or redo the black plague(even though that's already a scenario in the game) which kills in a month.Overall, the game is not complete, and with current games all for flash, bang, boom, instead of thought provoking gameplay, you won't keep entertained if you're simply a COD fan.

Plague inc is essentially the same game except presented much better and with far more in depth features that lacked in the flash game.Plague Inc evolved is simple and easy to navigate. This however does not mean the game is at all easy to beat, it is very challenging and unrelenting in handing you defeats for poor strategy choices. This is a good thing. This isn't a menu game you would find on facebook that rewards you endlessly and gives no consequences for neglectful choices and behaviour. A victory in this game is something that is relished and feels authentic as a seal of approval, proving your strategy works. Its also very realistic (in the default state of the disease only) I find it very enjoyable reading the news headlines and seeing how each nation reacted as new studies and new symptoms of the disease surfaced, The visual cues below showing how much chaos you have wrought on a nation is also very satisfyingMy experience in Plague Inc Evolved is a very positive one, I myself have bought this game for a few of my steam friends and they all agree this is a very well made game pointing out the same good qualities that i had mentioned previously. The choices among different plague scenarios and types as well as the ability to tinker the starting genetic make up of your plague can radically change how the game plays out forcing you to adopt a new strategy that was counter productive in a previous version of that same disease.Visuals are good, the music is great and sets the mood of your nafarious goal quite splendidly. It however relies heavily on imagination playing off the description of symptoms and side effects of combined symptoms. Those that aren't great at visualizing things in their mind probably won't enjoy the game. Those who want live action probably won't enjoy the game. For those who do like using their imagination. You will be pleased when you read that your disease has begun making people defecate themselves in public due to diarrhea and insanity spreading the disease much more quickly. The Types of diseases are quite staggering and they continuously add more all the time so its always going to be fun. The only complaint I have on the level of realism is simply the homogeneous properties of a nation, All of the nation is subject to to certain environmental and cultural effects that simply make no sense to me. Sure China does have the biggest cities out there, but that doesn't mean that the whole country resides in urban areas. If they wanted to improve this, they would change the game from nation initial infection to something that illustrated city to city infection as well as how pervasive the desease spreads through water ways, the wildlife and rural communities more realistically. This would make the game eerily more realistic as well as the amount of information at your disposal require true thought processing and strategic planning. Instead of losing simply because Greenland closed its seaport, You would lose because your pathogen had difficulty traversing cold rural areas due to lack of mutation to infect local wildlife. Untill they implement that, I wouldn't call this game perfectI myself find myself sinking an hour into this game each day simply cause most games require a time commitment that sometimes you simply don't wish to spend. This game will bode well with those who are going cross country in their car or on a plane flight or simply killing time as you make up your mind on what you want to do next.I would highly suggest this game to anyone. It is fairly cheap considering how many hours I myself have put into it, and how many more I plan to. It is also a simple game that can be played almost anywhere due to the lack of processing power it requires. If I were to give this game any rating it would 4.4 out of 5"

One downside, however is that the game will get very repetitive, and once you finish all the disease types, there is almost no replay value other than for achievements. The scenarios do mix things up a bit, but it still will get boring fast.My personal rating: 5/10. Fun, but repetitive."

The graphics are great, and it's easy to learn. It's an improvement of the iPad game too. For everyone saying this game is too expensive, it isn't. The game is worth every penny (for me)."
,Recommended,246620,9312233,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Raizo,"Already in early access I'm absolutely enjoying this game.Since I've always liked games similar to this like Pandemic 1 & 2 it's hard for me not to love this game too.It has a simple mix of laid back strategy, chance and punny humor.The gameplay starts off by of popping little bubbles, as if it was on a phone, (it originally was), in hope to give you enough points to make some effects on your plague, varying from symptoms to transmissions and ""research complexity""... And then you wait (speed time up) and hope you don't get your plague detected before you've spread out at least a little, as your ultimate goal is to end humanity by killing everyone.Of course this comes with variations of diseases and parasites which changes the play style, each with their own advantages or disadvantages which may prove challenging.The addition of pretty graphics are alright, yet it does not enhance the gameplay.The music and atmosphere is sweet and generally just fits with the theme without being uncomfortable.Overall it's pretty solid, but could still use some improvements which seems to be worked on.I'll list a few things I did not like from the time I did this recommendation:Low variation of symptoms: Many diseases and parasites has the same ""symptom tree"" with the exception of the new Neurax Worm which is unique and absolutely brilliant. Amazing to play with, not so much the others as it is mainly too similar and dull.In-infectible countries: You may be playing the game, having infected the entire world with only one tiny island with closed borders and ports, yet it becomes completely impossible for you to infect the country with most plagues once this happens, immediately deciding that you won't be able to win. Even though, logically it would still be possible for the disease to be carried there, regardless of border control.Common geography: I've noticed a few countries have been fairly detailed in some areas but a bit too vague in other areas by calling them after the biggest country, then overlap the smaller neighboring countries, Yet it would have been more appropriate, for instance ""the balkan states"" which is absolutely correct, not too vague and not too detailed. While you see Germany overlap five different countries. Instead better naming would had been Southern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Britain, Balkan States (even though technically still Eastern europe), etc.The pricing: Having to pay 30% more in Europe and only half price in Russia doesn't seem all that fair. If the pricing had a smaller percentage difference, maybe it would be more attractive globally.Still.. It's a fair game which I consider worth the money in contrast to its entertainment value."

In this game, you ARE that organization, making the perfect organism to wipe out human life on the planet and selecting Case Zero, before a cure can be synthesized.  My first bacteria took just over three years to kill everyone, whereas my virus took just over a year...kinda freaky.

A strategy game like Civ with unlimited potential and real time strategy where every move you made would make an impact. That is certainly what Plague Inc evolved tries to be, atleast.After almost 10 hours in this game I've come to the sad realisation that there is very little depth to it. You gain DNA points -the points used to upgrade your disease - overtime as you infect/kill more people, and also from occassionally clicking on little pop up bubbles on screen. You can then use these to add Symptoms to your disease, manners for it to spread and to increase its resistances to certain climates or being cured by the humans. This may seem interesting at first, but once you figure out which upgrades to use the game really has little strategy involved and is more so based on probability and luck.It is also worth mentioning that this game leads you to believe that there is much more content than it actually has, in the main singleplayer, that is. You start off with Bacteria and can see that there are other disease types you can unlock once you beat certain difficultues with Bacteria. Now you may think that these other disease types would have much different gameplay to them, making the game diverse and complex. Wrong! Every disease type is practically the same with a few minor adjustments.To give this game some credit though, it is fun for the first 5-8 hours or so when you don't really understand the game's underlying mechanics. You can sit there and be an evil mastermind, watching humanity crumble before you as you upgrade your plague. Not to mention its hillariously amusing to name your disease after something stupid due to the in-game pop up's you can get.Is it also important to mention that this game does have Steam Workshop, and thus there is a surplus of player content to go through. The player created levels are far more entertaining that the ones the game gives you (and a lot more creative!).If you're buying this expecting a strategy game with the depth of Civ you're going to be disappointed. If your intent with this game is to just have a good time laughing at popups like: ""Furries to Eradicate Humanity!"" then I would say go ahead and buy this. I just do warn that this game isn't that entertaining after awhile, and I would advise buying it on sale rather than at full price. It's definitely not a ""must have"" game for your Library."

OK, seeing as how at the time of this review it’s still under early access, you still can have some fun killing all humans with your own custom cup of Germs.The point of the game is to infect the whole world and kill everyone at any pace you wish to attempt it.

This game is fun yet simple if you enjoy watching Death occur many different ways with all the news reports saying what Countries are in total anarchy because of your attempt to infect the world.Each time you attempt to play this game and you kill all humans you unlock new different types of DNA to generate for your precious Plague to start with.

Developing the disease, working to thwart those trying to save themselves...I sort of felt like a supervillain.And I loved it every second of it.Nano-Virus was a bit difficult to beat, considering how the world started with discovering it. It pains me to admit it took me three tries to beat it. But, once I did, things went smoothly. My favorites, out of all of them, had to be prion and biological weapon. Bio Weapon was difficult, mainly because the first time I tried it, people died faster than they got infected. It was balanced out by some of the mutations it could go through, especially with what they eventually lead to.The achievements are hilarious, and aren't insanely difficult to get like some other games I've played. I've recommended this game to a few friends, and I look forward to seeing how the game develops.As for anything negative to say about the game...I wish the multiplayer was up and running....That's about it.Looking forward to what you guys have coming in the next update!"

,Recommended,246620,9232068,"Posted: 23 February, 2014",all,Just a Walnut,"Sum up - Good - Expensive - iOS portPlague Inc. is an iOS game around the $5 mark (or your regional equivalent), in saying this a price mark up of $10 is not something that a lot of people may think kindly to but if you do enjoy death simulators or something that involves logical thinking with SOME dynamic game play, pick it up for the $15 or wait for the sale.The game involves evolving a plague (many to choose from) to eradicate the human race. The gameplay is created from number crunching and strategic thinking towards the extinction of the human population. Graphic quality is not great in this title, little is able for customisation but the requirements for the title to run are quite minimum.This is an early access as stated before and buyer should beware of this. Many game states and even options are still under development and only those who want to be involved in the development and social process of the game should buy it pre full release. Features such as multiplayer and scenarios are not completely functioning.There are two tiers of multiplayer in my opinion; the first consists of leaderboards and the social network sharing, the second tier consists of the incomplete multiplayer mode which can only speculate to be a completive mode that heads you against another player in real-time (hopefully).Game play itself is identical to the iOS predecessor; you infect one country to begin with and mutate/evolve the plague to achieve total annihilation of the human race and ultimately winning the game. At the end of the game scoring does occur which allows you a placement on the leaderboards.For more information do check out my Perception check video on this title!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGuHpx5gHQs&feature=youtu.be"

,Not Recommended,246620,30436433,Posted: 10 March,all,TheMetalOne,"-Assuming you're already familiar with this game-It's a good game, but you should just get it for your smart phone.It's the same game, minus some cosmetic stuff, and pre-set scenarios (mostly created by fans, NOT the dev...who has added nothing worthwhile to the PC release of this game). It's better to just get the same game, but be able to play it wherever you are.-For those NOT already familiar with either version of this game-In essence, this is a strategy game. Your goal is to infect, and kill, everyone in the world. You choose a type of disease (bacteria, virus, nano-virus, prion, fungus, etc.) and choose where you want the infection to start. Outside of the scenarios, each disease starts off the same way: no symptoms, easily controlled by various environments, and low infection rate. Each disease offers it's own unique benefit. As your disease slowly grows from a ""patient zero"" type thing, to something that more and more people have, you earn DNA points.These points are used to purchase upgrades for your disease; allowing you to indirectly control the effect the disease has on people, and how fast it spreads.The strategy piece of the game can be broken down into 3 catagories, different levels of which cause the world's population to take certain actions.1- Infection. If you upgrade your disease to be particularly infectious, it increases your chance of the world discovering the disease's existance. If your disease doesn't do much, it isn't much of an issue to get discovered. But...2- Severity. Increasing the symptoms of your disease can make it more infectious, causing it to spread quicker. The drawback is these symptoms almost always have some effect on how serious the disease gets taken. Something that only causes sneezing and a rash isn't going to cause too much of a fuss. However, once you start going for the more severe symptoms (such as ""Immune Suppression""), people are going to start trying to cure your disease.3- Lethality. The most severe symptoms can cause death, at varying rates. Once your disease starts killing people, the world will take notice. Borders, airlines, and ports can be closed to prevent further spreading. You will also have to race against the clock, as the world closes in on a cure. There are ways to delay, or reduce the progress of, the cure.There are also random world events that have an impact on the game. Too many to list here. A tutorial at the beginning of the game will go more in depth, but this is a good overview of what is going on in the game.Frankly, I've played the hell out of this game (mostly on my phone). I love it, and recommend it. Just don't bother with the PC version, unless you're one of the few people who don't own a smartphone. There's just no other reason to choose this version."

It's actually really hard to infect everyone, humanity is struggling to it's last and it's struggling hard.

You're basically using that ability to wait for the fungus to not be infecting hard to infect areas to use it.Second, it doesn't really make sense to limit the ability of the humans to develop a cure based on how many humans are left.  Sure, you might be killing off doctors, but just because there are only , say a billion humans left, that doesn't mean they can't cure the disease any slower just because there are fewer humans left.Other then that, it's really a indepth cool way of learning how diseases can work."

76561198054760998,Recommended,246620,9256145,"Posted: 25 February, 2014",all,Sherlock_Hemlock,"Plague Inc: Evolved is the port that cramped iPhone users have been waiting for, featuring all of the latest updates from the App version and has been well executed for the wider PC audience.Although it's obvious that little has changed between platforms, because even on the PC this game will boil down to 'Click the bubbles to get points --> spend points on upgrades --> win'. Hopefully in the ongoing steam updates this game will branch out into new areas more suited for PC gaming, which it is more than capable of doing. There is little going on here in terms of a plot, because of its iPhone roots but again we can hope this will be addressed.Having said all this, this game is incredibly addictive and although the £11.99 price tag is quite steep (as with most Early Access titles), you'll soon forget what was spent as you'll keep going until the game has been played, start to everything unlocked.Essentially, you play as some mystery overview character who can freely create diseases, whether they be based on bacteria, viruses, parasites, etc. etc. and you can freely infect 1 person anywhere on the planet, following that it's your job to evolve the disease by spending ""DNA Points"" to help infect more and more people across the globe until you've managed to wipe out the human race.Yes, you heard me right. It's not enough to infect everyone on the planet with some incurable nonsense like the common cold, but the game is truly won when you've evolved your pathogen of choice to have some pretty horrific symptoms and attempt to wipe out the entire human population.There are various difficulty levels but regardless of which you choose, trying to achieve your goal is a challenge. This game bills itself as a ""hyper realistic simulation"" of what would actually happen which means you have to think of and respond to various scenarios, these range from fairly obvious (some countries having better healthcare than others) to more complex (the Olympic Games means alot of people being gathered together in one place, ideal place to spread the disease). These little variants and the specific characteristics of the pathogens gives this seemingly simple platform alot of variation which will keep you coming back to finish it and check out the new updates.All in all, a good game, limited by the fact it's a mobile port, but will hopefully evolve into something more suited for PC gamers.6/10"

Players must design the most lethal and effective plague possible, with the darkly satisfying end goal of killing every human on earth before they discover and cure your engineered disease. Your infection starts off basic, but can be mutated regularly to infect and spread more rapidly, or to be made more lethal.Gamers that can look past any moral qualms will find an enjoyable and full-featured pandemic simulator. To keep replay value high players have seven disease types to choose from, each with their own special gameplay wrinkle. Viruses mutate on their own, sometimes introducing unwanted high-profile side effects like vomiting, for example. Fungal Spores, Bacteria, Parasites and other disease types each have their own specific hook to figure out.I had a hard time putting Plague Inc down, despite the game’s copious amounts of downtime and bare-bones presentation. It’s exhilarating (in a grim way) to see your rate of infection climb into the billions thanks to perfect planning, and then mutate in killer traits like Pneumonia and Fever to secure the end of human history."

Like when your plague is spreading and infecting quite alot of countries. I find that the countries close down the airports and public buildings a bit too late because by time the AI made that decision the half of the earth's population is already infected, so their action is not that affective, thus making it too easy, I guess that is the only flaw that bothers me at this moment in time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The concept dates back to 2008, maybe earlier. This is by far the most refined version out there. At the time I am writing this, the 8th disease type, the Simian Flu, has just been released. The game is very nice, but unfortunatly lacks a lot of replayability. Because of this, many of the reviews you see, the reviewer only has 5-25 hours on the game. For all the other games you could get for $15, this one is tempting, but not the best thing. A good comparison, as far as game time, is CS:GO. People put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into that game. Some will even have hours in the thousands. You can simply get a game that will give you more hours of enjoyment other than Plague Inc. That being said, Plague Inc. has potential that has so far been realised. But charging $15 for it seems a bit overcharge for 5-25 hours of gametime. You are, however, getting exactly what you're planning on receiving if you decide to buy this game. If you can spare the money, go for it. If you're at a cross between this and another $15 game that is popular, like The Forest or CS:GO, get those games instead."

If you win, you repeat the same process with very slightly different mechanics to the upgrade and deployment mechanics, but everything is basically based around a system of control based on clicking some random coloured bubble pop-ups every so often and then, every couple of minutes, making a very basic and obvious upgrade for your disease based off of what its gimmick is today.You don't need a Steam account to play flash games this basic, certainly not or $15."

I'm unsure where to place my recommendation. I had fun playing the game but there are many problems that I think the devs should know about and work on to make this game a more pleasurable experience instead of such a frustrating ""bang your head against the wall"" game.First I'll just say that this game is a great concept and has many interesting prospects and is an interesting perspective on how dangerous viruses and even bacteria can be. Having said that, there is a great deal more that could have been incorperated and perhaps can be incorperated with add ons and updates. Also, the system set up for the game that deals with infection vs. human scientific research needs to be fixed or further developed...Here are my issues with it on a scientific and gaming perspective.1. Scientific research rates compared to the amount of death and mental manipulation that the plague is capable of; They are unrealistic and frustratingly so.Once humanity is aware of the disease and it is infecting everyone, as soon as I start unlocking symptoms that effect the brain, the research seems to pick up faster instead of slowing down, which does not make sense whatsoever. If the entire world is infected and the human brain is directly targeted by the virus (plague) shouldn't research speed slow waaaaay down to a slow crawl as a result, not pick up as if humanity had a sudden spurt of super intellect in desperation? I've made everyone basically incompitent to the point of retardation and somehow, science still keeps cruising by as if nothing happened with only a 10% cut down on research percentage and it crawls right back up in a matter of seconds. This is very frustrating and highly unsatisfying...to be so close to victory and be cut short by an unrealistic program/system...2. Infection rates during multiplayer co-op are painfully slower than they need to be.I can't tell you devs how many times I played the game on multiplayer, cover the rest of the world, lose my co-op partner, have only one country left, have all the transmission abilities, and the last country either dies faster than my disease can infect or my disease is cured before I can infect everyone in that one. last country because the people of that last country somehow have the immune defenses of a fricking God...Yet the rest of the world is infected on a normal level. Just doesn't make any practical sense. How can the last humans on Earth, with no defence against a disease that doesn't replicate in lab conditions, have such a resistance against the, concievably, most infectious disease known to man? Some things like this need to be fixed, otherwise many of us are going to be more frustrated and unsatisfied with the game and disenchanted as I've slowly become.3. There could be more interactivity. More charts and representations of your disease. It would be cool to see the side effects in real time on a 3D model. There are 3d models, but they are boring and uninteresting and are only there for cosmetics.4. Symptoms like sneezing and insomnia should not spread world wide panic like it does in-game.In reality we do nothing to route out the common cold. It is very infectious, causes many symptoms, is everywhere at any given time, but we don't obsessively look for a way to rid of it entirely. Only in the game of Plague Inc. does an infection like the common cold cause mass panic and a world wide search for a cure as if it were cancer...The way humans are in reality: If it isn't killing us at this minute, don't worry about it...(truth). There are some ""philosophical"" stand points that should perhaps be adressed...There are plenty of strategies and plenty of ways to play the game and I've unlocked all of the diseases, but it is so frustrating to continue playing the game after all of the abilities and diseases are unlocked. There is nothing to push for and I don't want to even open the program anymore in fear that I'll just♥♥♥♥♥♥myself off and I'll have to play a different game. But it does offer a glimpse into the terrifying world of infectious disease and pestilence.It isn't worth $14.00...it's more worth like $9.99 or less and I feel a bit foolish for getting drawn into it. But it is a decent game. I do expect a better quality game so I'm hoping enough of these sort of reviews can get to the devs and push them a little harder to do something about it without also making the game perhaps too easy and maybe I'm giving too harsh of a critique, but I have spoken to many Plague Inc. gamers and my biochemist friend who plays the game and we agree more than disagree about all four of these issues. I'm not saying ""make it easier"", I'm saying ""Fix these little things and the game will be PERFECT"" so we can ALL enjoy the game. This is not a difficult game, but there are some ""bull crap""-y parts of the system of the game that should be further refined."

My virus had no symptoms but had developed all the defenses against research. So I suddenly developed all the systems and they researched a solution in just a few minutes. The interaction is totally unrealistic. I won several games and lost several but never did it feel like I was in anyway controlling a real virus. As an example when your virus evolves it somehow does so accross the world simulatneously as though all the little viruses are communicating over a wireless network. Also you can have an 80% death rate of humanity yet they are still doing top research on viruses. Yeah right. You kill 50% of humanity and we are living in Mad Max. I am a fan of Pandemic and was hoping this would have some of the same feel from the other perspective but just poor game mechanics.

Can be super easy for the lazy/dumb or very hard for the l33t haxx0rzYou get to kill the worldThe bad:Honestly, at its base it's a click/twitch scenario (if you run it max speed, which you almost have to after the first couple games) with a unique ""design"" strategy beneath it. The ""click for DNA"" mechanic seems beneath a game with this polish, and I'm sure the devs could have come up with a more suitable and more fun way to manage that resource. It's a HUGE missed opportunity that turns what could be a great game into a decent one.I'm not a player who really notices a games soundtrack. I don't even enable it in most games... but this game breaks down to ""Do stuff... then wait and see if that stuff pans out."" It NEEDS a solid and varied soundtrack to back that up. For me, the soundtrack it has was basically just background noise. Nothing stood out. Nothing even let me know that I was listening to something other than a few seconds of music on loop. Maybe others appreciate it more, but for me it was lacking.Definitely a fun game, but it could have been so much more with more thought given to resource generation and the soundtrack."

They choked out their own souls with the flames of nuclear weaponry. I put the world through endless darkness, as vampires rose from Transylvania and hunted down every creature bleeding light.

Getting the message ""Land XY starting on global cure effort"" before the desease has symptoms or has any points in severity, thats just cheap.The problem of the core mechanics making it too easy to make an invisible desease, makes it inevitable to make the AI cheat on the highest difficulty. A difficulty rating, that changes so many core mechanics, you built so many tactics on (point costs, AI mechanics, and my favourite = suddendly it COSTS points to remove abilitys) is just to confuse the player and no fun.From all the difficulty shortcuts (lazy = giving enemys more HP, creative = giving enemys new abilitys, lame = enemy gets vision-hack) you used the most annoying = cheating AIThe game is fun for one or two days, but nothing for 10€.

Plesant graphics (never expected someone to say that about a strategy game, eh?), nice sound design and interesting game mechanics. Unique and sometimes downright hilarious update feeds ""Miners in Sweden find top notch mine"". It's just those little things that keep ya going.The Neurax Worm and the Necroa Virus were especially fun to play and offered a diverse gaming experience and broke up the monotony of common pathogen after common pathogen. I always find myself coming back to the worm. Am I being controled? The situations you can make with the Neurax Worm if you enslave humanity can range from awkward to hilarious ""Invader Zim enslaves humanity"". Like I said before, it's just those little things.The Necroa Virus, eh, I liked it. Nothing too spectacular, but still enjoyable. Difficult, yes. But it has this sort of satifaction when you beat it that most other plagues don't have. Except the worm, of course. It does, however, seem rather tedious trying to upgrade your zombie horde. Overall, it's my least favorite plague, but hey, in a game where all the Plagues are enjoyable, that isn't saying much. I especially like the Necroa music.The scenarios? I honestly have not played those yet.Ah, yes. the Simian Virus, I haven't seen the movie yet, but we're here to talk about the Simian Virus, no? The gameplay for the Simian Virus is challenging but not tedious.In the end, I give it 8 Bio-Weapons and a Virus out of 10 bio weapons (8.5 out of 10) The only things I can see improving upon are as follows : Updating the map (Crimea is no longer part of the Ukraine, petty, I know) and Making the upgrading of zombies less tedious. Other than that, it's a pretty good game in its present state. I'll update the review as the updates come rolling in"

I had been hearing about the original Plague Inc game for years when I got this and for the price I was genuinely afraid that it was going to become repetitive and not worth it. Well ladies and gentlemen, I am here to say that I was gladly wrong(ish). Was the game worth it's price in early access, well that is up to the person who was reviewing it. It WAS repetitive and it DID get boring after a while back then (even though I still loved it) but I have no doubt in my mind that if you enjoy games like this you should absolutly buy this. Let's go through the list.Notice: DID and WAS (the game has since been updated and these comments are no longer relevant)Gameplay: When I first began playing I joked about how this was like flash games where you just click whatever you can to advance your goals but I was wrong. This is a strategy game based on how you direct your pathogen, when you reveal yourself and how you keep yourself from being revealed. You could also argue resource management (I've seen friends without DNA points just after being found) but this personally isn't a problem I've had. With the many different pathogens which all change up gameplay entirely, your job is to simply destroy the world...easy right? There are only two real stages to the game right? Infect everybody without being found out/ Panic and be found immediatly (or hate the world on nanobots and panic on necroa virus) and then kill everybody. It can easily be summed down in words but as I've said, you can't just click everything to win. You have to move your virus in just the right way (I prefer boats, easier to get at Madagascar and Greenland but mostly because I like boats) and make sure that it can spread in the countries it moves to. You can easily be found out in your first country (if you're a first timer) and dead before you even know it. This gameplay allows players to have a basic strategy game without the extreme amount of time and thought process required for games such as Civilization or Europa. It also allows for fast games so you can easily sit down and play a game of Plague Inc while you're waiting for something (just remember, any computer is a laptop if you're brave enough). Of course, saying this I need to say that it can be difficult for people to pick up at first. I don't mean it's difficult to understand the controls I just mean newcomers should start on easy and work their way up. I could easily continue but I do need space for the rest of the review, sorry. (9/10)Sound: The music is pretty good, kind of ominous but you kind of need that for a game about killing everyone. I think they got the music design right for a game like this, but this is a strategy game, while music is nice to listen to it isn't really that important. It is the kind of music that keeps your head in the game and that's all that really matters. The sound design is excellent, there's no lag on the sound design, the bubble popping noise makes me want to pop more bubbles, I almost feel sad when I play with cheats on and I don't pop any bubbles. (9.5/10)Graphics: The graphics are good, I don't really see what they could do better. The world feels alive, that's all I can say. You really do begin to feel like you're killing the world and as you slowly watch as the world stops moving it really does feel empty (the world you've just destroyed you monster, not the graphics quality). There are real pictures for some of the countries (I wanted to say most but in truth I'm not sure) thanks to help the devs asked for from the community and the work had payed off tremendously. While some of the map of the world could be looked at to be made more realistic, for a 15/16 dollar game (sorry, don't know the U.S price) they hit the mark. (8/10)Workshop: This is important, I seriously felt the need to add this. The Steam workshop adds a whole new dynamic to this game. There's no longer just a set number of deceases, there's new ones being made all the time and while many games are starting to embrace the workshop, this one's been doing it for a while now and I must say, the community is just excellent.Multiplayer: (WILL REVIEW AT A LATE DATE MAYBE. #foreveralone)Overall: This game is just absolutly excellent and while I don't play it as much as I used to it has earned a place in my Steam Library and is definitely worth its base price. Mind you of course that you are paying extra in this version for better graphics, better sound and workshop support but it is so worth it that I would even recommend getting this if you have Plague Inc on your phone.Pros:-Fun for strategists-Great and well crafted music-Great Community-Lots of content-Good graphics-Easy to pick up, easy to put downCons:-Might get repetitive for some-Music repeats so if all you care about is the music (and you don't like what is being played) you won't enjoy the game-CDC deemed this game ""realistic"" (♥♥♥♥ EDUCATION)-Creates hate against Greenland (in the event of a deadly plague, go to Greenland)-Requires trial-and-error for newcomers-Makes me think of random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things to balence out the con section (ugh, work)"

There's enough here to play and I'd be happy even if this was the complete build (I've seen a lot worse that went gold...).Why it works:  You need to experiment with the mechanics, and while general strategies will work for most pathogens, there are some interesting variations to keep you coming back. There's also some additional fun starting in different parts of the world - it does subtley change your approach. Oh, and the zombie plague is great fun, and quite unique.Main thing here is: If you want a simulation with a difference, a game with a learning curve but not a sim that is overly difficult to grasp, and top that off with a game that is quick to make a play through, then this game is a great place to start.Fun, and different."

The biggest downside to the game as of 5-26-2015, is the all or nothing nature of it. You get cured or destroy the world. The reward is the same way, you have to beat it on normal ( which is actually fairly challenging so far to me ) to get another strain to use, or on the casual setting one lower to earn enhancements to virus you are currently using.This game would be better served IMO by using an experience system so you always progress towards that next virus,bacteria etc and dont feel that 35+ min game was completely futile in advancement. It would also be a lot more fun if instead of getting completely eradicated insanely fast once a cure is researched and losing, you occasionally could linger on in poorer countries or a desert or ice cap and make a slow but patient comeback.The Bubonic plague / Black death is said to still be lurking in little pockets around the globe. In the same article it said this and made me think an ability to go dormant with your virus could be really cool.The plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis, had lain dormant in China's Gobi Desert for centuries. But in the 1300s, it emerged with a vengeance, fanning out via trade routes from Asia to Europe and killing millions of people along the way. The plague was transmitted by fleas harbored by rats, which flourished in the overcrowded, filthy cities of the Middle Ages. By the end of the 1500s, between a third and half of Europe's population had died from the Black Death"

I gave this one a shot, and it really just felt like an exercise in trial and error more than formulating a real strategy.  The tutorial teases you to watch news headlines, and read up on the geography of each region, hinting at a complicated and strategic gameplay with extreme attention to detail.  But in reality, the regions boil down to just ""arid or humid, hot or cold, densely populated or not.""  Throw in a wild card if they have an airport/seaport (dismissing that all countries do in real life...) and that's your variety.I had this one on the wishlist for a long time, and was swayed by all the positive reviews.  I just gave the reviews another glimpse to see if I was missing anything, and it feels like a majority of the positive reviews have less than 10 hours played.  Sorry, but if you actually enjoyed the game, you would find a reason to play it for more than 10 hours.

The game is largly simplistic with the same goal, and even though the disease can be different, that is just not enough to make it riviting game play. Multiplayer is okay, but it has the same problem as the single player mode in that you spend a lot of time waiting around for your disease to gain points and infect everyone.

I like the game and I have it on mobile as well however there is one big issue. Necroa plague - this one is even on normal harder than the brutals of the others (I haven't started mega-brutal yet but I beleive that fungus, prion and neurax are easier than this necroa).Why:0. THE GAME IS CONSTANTLY UPDATING!!! THERE IS NO FUC***ING DAY WHEN THE GAME DOES NOT DOWNLOAD SOME UPDATE!!! REALLY DEVELOPERS!!! WHERE IS YOUR QA!!!!!1. After 55-70% of world infected there is really high chance (close to 100%) that some symptoms mutate and it doesn't matter if you lower the chance of mutation by appropriate genes, it still does.2. Almost after the first or second mutation the remaining countries will close their borders, stop the ships and planes from coming (with the other plagues you can easily mutate even lethal symptoms).3. In every game I played no matter what happened Greenland was infected as the last one (or better I needed to use horde to infect it) - water 1/2, cold 1/2, genes that make life easier for water/on water and still Greenland the last one standing.Overall this game is fun but compared to the mobile version I am afraid that I cannot approve it to my friends or anyone else.

There is not a lot of depth going on here, and there is not much of a game. The unlocks take too long to open up the game. You can see the free to pay mobile mechanics behind it.There is a lot going on here that is just puzzling. The special event system doesn't make any sense as both Canada and Spain decide to set off nukes for some reason (Neither Canada nor Spain has nukes in real life.) Also can we get a from this century? Why is Newfoundland missing from the Atlantic ocean? Why is Africa so small?The mechanics of the game are also too simple. This is the world of PC/Mac and we expect some more depth than just hitting bubbles that pop up. The variations in the stains are not varied enough to withstand several game plays.The other game mechanic problem with this is the victory conditions - which really is kill everyone human in the world. While not a virologist I believe this is not a possibly, and is sort of ridicules goal. Perhaps a better mechanism would to be too outperform other famous diseases of the past?My advice is too skip this game in its current state, unless they can evolve it into a more worthy desktop entity."

You could do things right, you can follow a build guid on how to win with a particular plague. But still lose because Greenland closed their port before you got on there, or your virus mutates into a ""scary"" disease and work on the cure goes nuts before you've infected even a quarter of the population. All RNG.It wouldn't be bad if the game wasn't so time invested, but you spend a lot of time on your plague, just to not be able to infect some island state, even with upgraded plague birds, or airborne particles.This breaks the gameplay, sure you can just start again, but after playing for 30 min just to watch as your plague dies out by killing 99% of humanity, but Japan is still alive on their own island of protection.Sure it's realistic enough that if they close their islands borders they'd be more likely to survive. But from a gameplay perspective, the game should just say ""Game Over an island closed their borders before you infected it."" That's what is actually happening, but it neglects to tell you.Sure there's strategies to defeat RNG, and for the most part they work but some situations are rendered extremely hard, or impossible, simply because RNG is always there.I can't really reccommend people buy this game, there's a tablet version if you wanna try it. But until they work out the RNG issues within the game, which they probably never will thinking that it's ok that the hardest difficulty not only requires you to go online and follow instructions, and those instructions will still only give you a 10% pure luck based chance of actually winning.There's little strategy here, it's a build order, so playing the same plague more than once is kind of repetitive. You can't really react to what people do. The UI is just not designed to allow you to have full control over your plague. Especially when it comes to they plagues like ""Simian"" and ""Necroa"" It adds some semblence of strategy, but darn if they'll work on making the UI show all the information that you need.All in all, the UI needs a serious update, the game play needs an overhaul to move away from the Tablet based ""pop bubbles"" gameplay and RNGeezus. Until the developers actually make a game worth playing on your PC, avoid at all costs, not worth your time, not worth your money, and not worth washing your hands."

Right now the game has additional content which makes the replay value a little bit bigger.This is not an action game though and most of the gameplay is a waiting game (see a cure being made or the world die basically, based on your actions). Do I recommend it? Well; yes and no. For a low price (on a sale for example) it can be fun to play occasionally. Other than that... not really. I also do not get the ballon clicking. I do not see what it adds to the game other than being a button monkey... (or a Stanley Parable if you get what I mean).Since I play it every once in a while when I don't feel like playing an action game and I don't want to think a lot. For those times it gets a thumbs up, except the price which gets a thumbs down (13,99 eur atm.).Because of the current price I'm giving it a thumbs down...(in other words pick it up when it's on sale)I'll leave it up to you what you would like to pay for it, but right now it is pretty steep for what you get."

Although the additional content added some extra layers of functionality, I found they added nothing to the overall experience for me. I was bored within 25 minutes.The background music I found especially annoying. Very repetitive. I'm not even sure if it was a multi-theme soundtrack. It seemed like the same monotonous drone over and over. Maybe it's one theme per play, or the tracks are just long. I don't know.Visually I expected more. Even though the gameplay didn't appeal to me (which I'm sure its strategic element will do to others), I would have loved to have appreciated at least the graphics. Other than the added extras, I genuinely could see no graphical advancement from the ipad app I once played all those years ago.If you haven't played the app version, you may fancy checking it out, but I'd certainly recommend waiting for a Steam sale.2 out of 5"

I played a rip off iOS version of this game that was better.I infected the whole world on normal difficulty, everyone had my disease. I add one symptom to start killing off the population and they discover the cure almost immediately. I am not sure if they are trying to make it seem like ""good guys always win!"" or ""hahaha look we made hard game :^)""The fact that you can't unlock any new diseases except by beating the game with the first one unless you play on casual difficulty is stupid. I honestly feel insulted by the fact they have five difficulties and ""normal"" brings defeat so quick.Also, if you are trying to be sneaky and infect most of the population in your first playthrough, the disease randomly will mutate and get symptoms that will make Earth notice and discover a cure for your disease faster. Not only do they research this cure faster, but the tutorial disease that you start out with actively makes your pathogen more noticable.I'd rate it 5/10 because it was relatively fun despite the unfair mechanics of the game."

,Not Recommended,246620,24566297,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,Splat Me,"First review, I thought this game deserves it.While its a great game, the price-tag and the content do not match. You can get the mobile game for free and get base content. The price seems a bit high for, how I like to put it ""An HD mobile port with in-app purchaces removed"".Once you complete the game, theres not much to do, and while you have senario made from other players, there is no reward for completing them at all. It can get repetitive. And i don't really see a ""soundtrack"" minus some ambience background sounds, so the extra price for that is whack.The Senario creator is great, but I would like to see more added to it, like changing the default intro pop ups, the colors, winning conditions, or even soundtrack and way the game will play out. There is promise.Also I found myself being a little annoyed with some of the Official senarios and diseases, like the Ape flu, Zombie disease, Black plague, and a few others.

Unfortunately, due to the way it’s currently implemented, it feels much more like gambling than strategy. Often it seems like the player's decision have very little or even no predictable influence, while random events on the other hand have a huge impact. I really hope the developers tweak the right parameters in the right way before finally releasing the game, otherwise I can’t recommend to buy it."

Also, Paying ~15€ for a game that's available for free on mobile phones(Except there's a workshop on the steam version, but quite honestly most of the add-ons are really bland and don't add much stuff to the game)just isn't worth it. Oh, and the game has a lot of geographical flaws. The borders of the countries are really lazy and some of them are just ridiculous. And there are still A LOT of countries missing.Multiplayer: So fast-paced it isn't even enjoyable.TL;DR: Not worth 15€. Repetitive gameplay. Gets boring really fast. Grab it when it's on sale."

You mutate whatever pathogen you manage to unlock, you start with only 1 option, None of the game follows actual contagion vector logic, It appears as though the entire point accumulation systems is nothing but a random numbers generator and has very little to do with how you direct the pathogen nor how many poeple become infected or die. You can start two games exactly the same way in exactly the same place. one game you could have over 100 points in the first few months of game time while the second game you could have 9 points after a full year.In one instance I had the entire world infected with the exception of greenland and let the game run for more than 15 game years before green land became infected, The odds of that happening couldn't be calculated with the help of every mathmatician in the world.You can ""beat"" the game and kill the world with each pathogen if you desperately want to figure out the authors complete lack of knowledge and sort out what he decided is the ""right"" options for a lethal pathogen.

The world is divided into areas, not just countries, each with their own specific traits which will either hinder or help spread your plague, so choosing which area to start infecting is quite important. After killing the world, you unlock a gene, which you can use for one of three gene slots to get a slight advantage the next time you infect the world.The main scenarios and main plagues, if aiming to get mega brutal and all genes, will take around 3-6 hours, but custom scenarios and multiplayer should boost the game length.Multiplayer for me is rather empty at the moment, though with future sales I'm fairly certain this issue will get resolved.Get this during a Steam Sale if you feel the above content isnt enough for the store price, but intrigues you nonetheless."

Kind of makes you think the game devs don't know what the word ""random"" actually means. It could be weighted anyway you want, but an event with a 100% chance of happening isn't random.There's some other obvious hackiness in the game design to try to pass off planned scenarios as free-form sandbox play when the player is really being railroaded. In my opinion it's kind of a crappy choice from a game design perspective and does nothing to make this more fun.That said, it can be a lot of fun, as well.

I'd always assumed this game would be good: Destroying the world via biological threats, it just always seemed fun. To an extent, it is. Like when you enslave the world using the Neurax worm or when your virus mutates ""sneezing"" just as mankind is about to die out (cos when your species is dead and your body is shutting down, having a cold is just salt in the wound). However, it's NOT fun. Which defeats the whole point of this game. It can't even be called a simulator either, because it's wildly unrealistic.Pray tell, how does mankind cure a disease which has changed its genome three times in a month, is resistant to all known drugs, is generally impossible to research and forces anyone infected to fall into a coma and die of total organ failure? And how exactly are you suppose to destroy the world with zombies, vampires or smart apes when, surprise surprise, mankind somehow has an army to the tune of 6 billion people? Because humans aren't THAT powerful, even with guns.I still can't beat the zombie virus, even on casual, even with GUIDES, because mankind (even the 10,000 I'd reduced them to) is still insanely overpowered to the point where I couldn't beat them even with ten times the amount of zombies and about 2/3s of their combat upgrades bought! Vampires? Useless. Apes? Put down so fast that Planet of The Apes doesn't exist according to my play through.Just don't buy this game. I got it on sale for like £5-£6 and I regret it because I couldn't bought one or two other games which would been more fun. So don't make my mistake, don't get suckered in by the idea of wiping out mankind, because this game takes all the fun out of every extinction scenario you can think of because it's completely unbalanced. The odds are always against the player and that doesn't make for a good time. So just go play the mobile version, it's free and gives you all the better parts of the game.

I was hoping that this fixed the biggest issue I had with the flash game, but it appears not to have. My issue is simple: The game wants you to win the way the developers want you to win. That doesn't sound so bad, but experimentation is almost DISCOURAGED unless it's to find the way the developer wants you to win. That would be passable if the iteration time wasn't so LONG. Even on maximum speed, this is a SLOW game. It's ridiculous. Such a good concept, so bad in practice. If you get spotted, you're pretty much screwed too, unless you kill EVERYONE, because developing a cure is easy and screws you so hard that an industrial power drill made to drill through hardened steel couldn't do it faster.On top of that, to get ANYTHING done you need to beat the game several times. You unlock genes randomly, you unlock new pathogens in a linear fashion, proceeding from one to the next to the next... Winning is more about beating the system, rather than working with the system for a solution you like. The guides I've seen and my own experience is that the only way to win is to infect EVERYBODY undetected, then stockpile points until you've got a completely harmless pathogen turning into a disease more deadly than nuclear bombs fast enough to make Sonic blush.On top of that, they frontload you with NO information and don't even HAVE a tutorial beyond popups explaining SOME of the UI, just a ""How to Play"" hidden under the Escape menu with extremely unhelpful information.TL;DR: Iteration time too long, solutions MIGHT number more than 1 for any given pathogen (discounting minor differences), pathogen solutions nearly identical in approach, tutorial effectively non-existant, being cured is INSANELY easy and, to top it off, the majority of symptoms are only useful as paving stones to others. 2/5, at least it's not broken, but that's about all I like about the game itself."

Though I have played it obsessively (as I did the mobile version), the drawbacks to this on PC are extreme. For one, the gameplay is very much touchscreen-oriented. For another, the game is far too one-dimensional. It's also incredibly slow-going for such a relatively-simple simulation (I'd say it's worse than KSP in time consumption but without any creative aspect on the player's part).I love what they did with the graphics, but this could have also been done on mobile since nothing requires a more than a basic video card. The video made me think that it'd have more PC-oriented gameplay, a more immersive experience, and more to do than just add capabilities then wait for time to pass like on mobile.The only ""evolution"" is to a bigger screen from smaller ones. If it was marketed as ""PC-sized version of the mobile game"", I probably wouldn't have bought it. Though it's a great casual game, it's not a great desktop game, especially with a mouse interface."

To do so, you must morph and migrate the disease to fit within the different climates on Earth. If your disease becomes popular enough, the local governments try to cure it. When you have infected the world population, you can morph the disease to be lethal enough to kill.While the premise the promising, the fact is the huge difficulty complete eliminates all chance of repeatability. You could go lethal too soon, not infecting enough population and lose. You can become too lethal too soon, the governments will find out about your disease and will cure your disease before you had a chance to either infect or eradicate the world's population. Either way, you are facing the clock. Even on normal difficulty, it feels like your disease is found out too soon, and there are more chances to lose this game than win it.Overall, I would suggest you do not even spend your money on this simulator. In it's beta stages, it needs some fine ironing to do, and requires significant balancing before it goes out of beta. Right now, I cannot recommend this game."

You start by infecting a patient zero on a country of your choosing, then get DNA points by several ways to upgrade your illness- tranmission by water, resistance against cold, symptoms like sneezing in order to increaser infectivity, etc.It is certainly fun to watch humanity being more and more infected with your plague, until (in most cases) you decide to evolve it in a deadly strain.However, there are several problems ruining the fun. If winning grants you new plagues and genes to enhance them (like increasing infectivity in arid areas), half of the plagues are too similar and thus are played accordingly : you wait until everyone is infecte, then you fuse the ""bomb"" to kill'em all.Virus is funnier because it mutates like crazy and humanity will be likely to develop a cure before everyone's infected. The worm, able of thought control (like going to another country of your choice, wich is a tad bit broken) is quite fun too, the nano-virus and the bioweapon both play with humanity rushing to develop a cure.As is stands now, there are not enough variety, strategies are often the same, plus a lack of interactivity. You wait more than anything in this game, the random events do not make this much more lively. Sure, it's only alpha, and it's to be hoped that the multiplayer will be solid, and the scenarios interesting enough.Because, quite frankly and currently, no, 14€ is not worth it. At all. Especially not when you know that Pandemic II had the same global idea (and was a free web-browser game) and the original game costed 0,99€.I don't particularly feel entitled as to say what price is right. But one day, I'd love to see a detailed and honest document, summing up the costs a of a mobile to PC port. Plague Inc was hugely acclaimed and sold millions upons millions of copies on mobiles- if the developer wants to extend his market on PC, why being so greedy ?Even with all the updates promised, I'm not sure that such a price will be justified. I have my doubts about the ""hyper-realistic"" aspect of the simulation and watching graphs is neither my idea of fun or depth.Not to say that the game is horrible, but overpriced. If you are interested, I'd advise the following things : buy it on a mobile or Ios if you possess one, or wait for the final version and a sale to acquire it on Steam."

They always drop off  at the moment where your only hope is to evolve and then you wont get any points and they cure you and your doomed. As a strategy game it falls short because its very clear that they want you to focus on transmission, then leathality, with some random obstacles for you to buy out of your way under the ""abilities tab"" which only had something interesting for a few pathogens like the nuerax wormAlso if any island country dares seal its SINGLE entry point you lose, wich they will often do in the first half of the game and totally invalidate the entire session. They dont even bother to tell you youve lost so its possible to sink another half hour before you realize whats going onStrategizing is minimal because if there is a solution to the problem there is only one solution despite the plethora of options available.It has all the same garbage problems the old flash version did just with some pretty graphics and a few interesting ideas sprinkled on it.

The game has one active screen where everything happens, you watch little red dots appear and once in a while a little red boat or airplane fly.  Then there are several screens where you select mutations for your pathogen.  There is only one way to win, 100% world wide mortality.  The game is actually fun enough for a tablet or phone but for a PC game it's sad.  There is little or no stratagy other than try and infect the entire world and then give symptoms to people.

And on the PC version it's even worse cause the dialogs pops up right above the bubbles and while they pause the game they don't pause the bubbles which quickly disappears while you try to close the god damned window.

Players start the game with their only choices being bacteria or ""simian flu"", with none of the modifiers being available. I can't win on normal mode, and I like to have enough pride to avoid ""easy modes"". There is one way to win: kill every last human being on planet earth. Anything short of that, you lose, and gain nothing.""YOU GET NOTHING! YOU LOSE! GOOD DAY SIR!""While several tantalizing options such as mind-controlling ""Neurax worms"" and purpose-built biological weapons are available, I cannot access them because Madagascar, or New Zealand, or Greenland/Iceland close their only ports and ending 99% of human life is still as much of a loss as being eradicated within the first year. Modifiers can improve your plague out of the gate, but because one only unlocks them via winning, this becomes redundant.Before one of you decides that I'm just a loser, I'll compare this to another game based on difficulty, Dark Souls. Hypothetically, playing Plauge Incorporated would be like playing Dark Souls, but only if you didn't get to choose your class, you HAD to kill every boss, and when you died, you had to start from the beginning. I enjoy roguelikes, but those are USUALLY tests of skill and or getting ♥♥♥♥ed by the RNG. Plague Incorporated is actively attempting to prevent your success like nothing else I know of.The ideal strategy would be to infect everyone before they noticed and shut down everything, but random events including the ""mutations"" which give you a random boost to something serve to throw a wrench into your plans every time. ""Are you trying to be subtle? How's about your plague now makes people spontaneously combust!"" seems to be the norm.TL:DR  this game isn't enough fun to be worth smashing your head against the wall to unlock the fun."

Despite this I found it more enjoyable than the originals because it fixed playablity issues plus added in new factors that make it enjoyable. The interactivty is higher and so are your options for evolving your plague. Also the graphics look a lot better plus having a bigger map ends up letting you see the map better so that over time I could see people actaully knowing where countries are or at least generally are on a map.

I like the replayability as you unlock more types of plagues, genes, etc. I have realized the delicate balance of making the plague infectious and deadly enough. Too deadly, and you might not kill everyone because the plague cannot spread fast enough. I had a few rounds with GreenLand surviving my infection because I made it too lethal. It quickly killed off the rest of the world but Greenland, in my games anyway, is like nearly the last country to get infected and is not as quickly to spread there as other countries. Overall, I'm having a great time with this game and cannot wait to see what more the devs come up with. Money well spent."

Satisfying.I will admit though, strategy is involved and the cure researchers have beat my butt quite a few times.

Certainly one of a kind. However keep in mind it is early access still, but to a point it is definately functional. However there are still some things i would like to see.-Popping bubbles to get dna points is a distraction and should be replaced with something that actually relates to gameplay.-Transmission seems to be limmited between countries to only move via airplane and boat, which occassionally seems strange that a country with open borders doesnt get overtaken-Map doesnt provide much information. I like the way it shows ships and planes bringing plague around but otherwise its just a map showing ports and harbors on every country which honestly isnt much information. Perhaps more visuals could be added to show traits of the countries more clearly?-Occasionally seems strange that the focus of the survivors never changes, as if every single person alive is able to come up with the cure. Perhaps somehow elements of immune survivors could come into play when the population gets to a certain point?Otherwise this game is excellent, anyone interested in strategy games who is bored of the same old stuff should definately take a look!"

76561197980804400,Recommended,246620,9297980,"Posted: 28 February, 2014",all,Tantalus,"Initial Disclaimer:  I own both the mobile version (Plague Inc) and this version.  Most elements of this review apply to both versions.Summary:  Plague Inc: Evolved and its mobile counterpart are both great games - when they want to cooperate.  Plague Inc: Evolved has a cleaner, easier to use interface and a few extra features on Plague Inc, but they're essentially the same game.  If you have one, you're not missing out on anything groundbreaking by not having the other.  The biggest problems with the game are its randomness and lack of strategy.Details:  The game features a unique premise (wipe out all of humanity), functional graphics, and various addictive modes of play that keep me coming back time and time again.  Each plague you can use plays a little differently, though the basic strategy for success with all of them is basically the same.  My biggest complaint with the game is that later on, you get fewer and fewer bubbles to pop (other than cure bubbles), so if you didn't set yourself up properly from the very beginning, you are doomed to fail and all you can do is watch as you are eradicated.The game's random element makes choosing a difficulty setting almost moot.  This can make the game incredibly frustrating when you play on Casual and just want a quick, easy game.  Infecting everyone on the planet works pretty smoothly, but once you've done that, the influx of DNA points usually slows to a crawl - you no longer get red bubbles because everyone is already infected (which makes sense), but curiously, you also rarely get orange bubbles, and when you do, they're frequently worth much less than they used to be (usually only 1 pt).  At the same time, costs for all changes skyrocket, making those hyper-infrequent 1 pt orange bubbles essentially worthless when you still need 22 pts to buy the next symptom or ability.  This can very quickly leaves you in a situation where you can see that you're losing (humanity is creating a cure faster than you can kill them), but can't do a single thing about it.  On the other hand, you might be given a huge influx of points during play that means that you can easily afford all the symptoms you need later on in the game, which makes the game easy.  It kind of sucks feeling that your fate is completely beholden to some random number generator within the game's code.The game has multiple plague types, as I mentioned before, and they play a bit differently.  The virus, for example, mutates (develops symptoms) wildly.  On the other hand, the fungus doesn't spread across countries as quickly.  Despite the differences, there's really only one way to win - build up a couple abilities and transmissions while de-evolving any symptoms you get until you've infected everyone (making sure to stay undetected at the same time), then buy a whole bunch of lethal symptoms all at once.  If you're given enough DNA points through the course of the game to buy all the necessary lethal symptoms, you will win.  If you aren't, you will lose.  It's as simple as that."

76561198039757882,Recommended,246620,9357358,"Posted: 5 March, 2014",all,Psyth,"Plague Inc. is not a highly complex game. It's a basic point and click with minimal UI options or perks. However, in sitting down to play it, I found it highly addictive. If you enjoy strategy and a good bit of reading, it's an excellent game. It takes a basic understanding of pathogens and a good bit of planning. Like chess, but with people and pathogens. As you complete scenarios you unlock different pathogens and genes to combine with them before starting your scenario. Once in game, the evolution process is fairly limited as far as evolution or upgrades. The game does have a few random events that accelerate or decelerate the spread or lethality of your creation which makes it interesting. The game AS IS, is really lacking, but still fun to play. Given how the Dev takes further development of the game, it has the potential to become extremely in depth. I definitely interested to see where things go. In the meantime, I'll be playing and trying to unlock all available mutations and genes. At $15 it's a little steep as far as what it is, but if you're a science buff / nerd / geek, in any sense of the word, it's still a must have. That being said, I see the true user base being limited, but for those that find the game appealing have great potential to become long term supports. I highly recommend watch an in-game video before purchasing."

By a long shot my favorite plague was the newly add Neurax Worm. One thing that I might think would be good as a new plague would me an Alien Microorganism. Like make its strength that it has a boosted ability to infect people, but make it more affected by the environment. Also one good idea to think about is give the other plagues different symptoms, like the nano virus for example. Make it add implants that infect other people easier, or make the fungus grow mushrooms on people (like in The Last of Us). One big reason I liked the Neurax worm was because it had a completely different arrange of symptoms. I also like how the news also provide little fun things like the Half Life 3 reference or Alaska being owned by Canada. Overall pretty good game, but would like to see different symptoms."

This is an early access game and most of it is not complete. So don't expect a review, but my first impressions. Secondly Plague Inc is a tablet game on Apple and Android, I have only played the PC game.On the technical side, you don't need a powerful machine to run this game and don't worry about the tablet port side of things, the options menu is better than many full price games. Some things still need to be added like rebindable keys and accessibility options, but these things should be in the final release according to the Ndemic Creations website.So what is Plague Inc? It is a disease simulator, it lets you play anything from a humble bacteria to a full blown Zombie plague. You infect people, thwart human research efforts, spread across borders and kill people, lots and lots of people. Now this is fun in a dark kind of way, and the game does have lots of multiplayer and social media potential for competitive play. There is great replayability since the game is easy to pickup and yet there are many different strategies to employ. Still I can't give it an unequivocal recommendation for one reason, it does not make sense.Now I don't mean that zombies or brain worms don't exist, I don't have a problem of with that. It is the breaking of the laws of nature and common sense. How can everyone in the world be infected and never get better till a cure is found? Why do all the mutations in the game make the disease stronger?If you've ever studied biology you could go on and on about how odd the game model is, but from a gaming perspective it represents a lost opportunity for a really interesting simulation game. What you have instead is a fun, dark, casual, indie game.My verdict wait for the full game or a steam sale."

In addition, it's VERY frustrating that this game is branded as being compatible with OSX and (I assume) Linux (if only internally to Steam), but the installer for these platforms only places a 0-byte placeholder on the system. I understand that this game IS in very early stages of development, based on a game for mobile devices, but these issues with alternate platforms should be prominately called out somewhere in the description, and the content that has not been released yet should either not be shown in the UI or the button should just be disabled entirely until that feature is ready.That being said, the pieces that HAVE been released are incredibly fun, and I'm excited to play as this game develops. Once these issues are addressed, I feel that it will be very worth the $15 pricetag. For now though, I would say the most pressing issue from my perspective would be the lack of OSX support."

Other than that, this title made me completely nostalgic to the old mobile game ""Pan**mic"" (asterisks put in as to avoid infringement) and I played about 7 rounds the first go. It's highly addicting, has great graphics, doesn't take up much disk space, has a great replay factor (which I'm sure will increase as soon as they add upload an update) and overall, just a great title!

Another thing is that if you like games that aren't turn based but can take some time, I recommend this game. Last but not not least, is game functionality. The game in a way can seem repeptitive if you make it so. A reason why I say this is because I used to have a single strategy that always worked and I after a while i got bored.

This is by far one of the coolest, yet horrifyingly possible, games I have ever played. With your first Bacterial Illness to be spreaded across the world, the addiction begins. The game has much potential, and I would like to see the following improvements in the following areas:More types of plagues: Zombies. I think I am not alone when I say I would love to start a worldwide apocolypse with zombies in this game! Making all forms of them, and since there is a plain upgrades, I cannot see why instead of plain symptom upgrades for a zombie outbreak, have them be upgrades to the zombies' abilities! They can charge and contact infects, they could explode, they could spit/vomit, they could do all sorts of things: biting, sneezing (thats a bit redundant, but still!), you can fill in the blanks! Overall, make a dedicated zombie outbreak as one of the plague types, and this would be one step ahead of the game!More Interactivity: Close up views of people and footage. I have seen people display a request to see more on ground view in the game, and I have to agree. Showing pictures of the same city in several different countries is a bit boring, from time to time. I only suggest you add people moving, as a start to build a completely new interative map. Also, perhaps you can add filters to the map, like thermal signitures, night time with all city lights on, toggle on/off clouds, etc. Overall though, the game has a great interface and zoom feature, so that part suffices! :)Finally, Multiplayer: CO-OP and VS. I know this is already being worked on, and I know you know. But I think if you're going to do this, you may want some input, so here: I can already assume you will have two players choose to be on a team, the humans, or the plague. If this is gonna be a 2 plague, you may want to expand your reaches. If two people are teamed up as the plague against the CPU humans, the world would fall WAY more easily. However, I propose you add background events, like a shuttle has landed on mars with people, and in the next two-five years, you add people colonizing to mars. I dont know, I just think if you have two people taking over the world with two seperate plagues, or even just one is plainly unfair. Of curse though, if there is only a 1 person limit to each team, then this is all rubbish. I can only wait and see what curveballs your development team will throw at us when a friend and I play and he has the whole human race behind him, and will be able to decide how to wipe me out!In conclusion, this game is unique, scary, but tons of fun! I cannot wait to hear and see more improvements and updates!4.5/5! : )"

Now i know what that sentence usually entails but this game has actuall effort and work put it, much more effort put into it than say something like flappy bird or ""not bejeweld"". this, is an actuall game and has won several awards on the iphone.The main gist of the gameplay is that you're a maniac in a lab trying to evolve a supervirus that will eventually whipe out everyone you've ever met (obviusly the evolver has been bullied way to much and needs some serious huggging if they went to this extreme) so with that you start off by looking at your satilite map of the countries and plop down your very own baby virus. Now with that, you infect people and spread the disease with genetic engineering straight from michael chriten. Then i hear your ask, ""But mr.reviewer, how do we evolve our tiny coughs into super blood vomiting, organ dissolving, dead reanimating superdoom virus?"" that's easy, you pop bubbles. I know it doesn't sound by much, but what you spend it on is really intersting, especially late game when you get total organ failure and brain seizers. there's intersting ways you can transmit your supervirus. there's also senarios that are based in real history like the spanish flu and black plauge.With that said however, if your looking for a story, or uber graphics that's not what you get here. like civilzation it's all about the stories you make as a genocidal megolomaniac with some serious daddy issues. i love this game, and i'm going to play more after this review.In conclusion i reccomend this to anyone who loves zombie movies and apocalyptic movies."

Needless to say, I was delighted to see the game on Steam.First, if you, like me, have played this elsewhere you will notice this is a worth upgrade. Although gameplay remains mostly unchanged, it feels fluid and fitting. Graphics are better and I'm quite fond of the new soundtrack. Oh, and better yet: no in-app purchases this time.Although it is still in early access, I haven't found any bugs so far. As the developer himself stated, he is still adding features to the game (which is great), but it is a solid, bug-free release.As far as the game itself goes, you are supposed to ""destroy the world"", but not with guns or explosives. You are a pathogen who needs to evolve an illness to kill. It's an interesting and original concept. You have to use your brain and create a strategy. It can be challenging and as you progress the game you can unlock more content, so there's plenty to keep you busy for a while."

This, however takes it up a notch or two, adding new pathogen types, new genetic mutations that you can unlock, Pre-made scenarios and eventually multiplayer and custom scenarios.  I have enjoyed it very much already, I definitely recommend it."

But when you factor in all the different disease types (including a Zombie virus, a brain-hijacking worm, swine flu, the black plague, and promises of more to come) there are so many ways to play. You can infect along different vectors like air or insects or blood, and each plague type has its own set of special abilities. I played the original on the web back in the day, and don't regret a penny spent on the full, souped-up version of this game. I am currently having tons of fun trying to unlock all the achievements."

The transition they've made from mobile phones to PC is absoluetly awesome. Its not even officially finished and its already way better than I expected.The only con is that I wish I had the option to purchase things like I could on the mobile app. That was one thing I really liked about the mobile game - I had that option but wasn't forced into it. Everything was unlockable through gameplay.11/10 for me, either way."

If you're having a hard time start in China and evolve sneezing and you win every time. Weird is that you can pass a parasitic worm through sneezing but who am I to play Doctor House all I do is eradicate mankind."
