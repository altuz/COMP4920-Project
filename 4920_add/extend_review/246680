I also haven´t read previews so far, so I was relativley unbiased.This first hour was a real joy!The controls are very intuitive and after a few minutes you get what the game is about without much explaination.But very soon I came in contact with the first few highlights in form of the curious animal life.I don´t want to spoil too much but there was this particular situation where I, a bird, cleared the entrance of a cave in a wood while being chased by some wildcat and after being rewarded with an artifact that sat on top of a deers antlers, I had to chase the deer while still being harrassed by the cat. It resulted in tricking the cat away for a moment so I could grab onto the deers♥♥♥♥♥ pulling it to a dead end so I could wrestle away the artifact.Shortly after this I experienced one of the best situations in a 2D game I experienced so far, when I had to get away with another artifact but the trees just wouldn´t let me ( I don´t want to spoil it for anybody, but it is awesome)Long story short, I can already fully recommend the game, because only one hour into it, it was somehow already worth its money. I am very much looking forward to continue tomorrow and have a look at that editor some day.Go for it, it will make you feel good :DAnd yes, there is a stat for how many seconds you already played (besides the stats how many other animals I ACCIDENTALLY! killed)"

There is also something to be said about the emotions this game sparked in me, which range from laughing obnoxiously loud to feeling super depressed because I accidentally killed a little critter. I think it has somthing to do with the animals and the minimalistic approach to the graphics (which are absolutely beautiful). It really is a thinking mans game. It task you with collecting silver pieces for the ""machines"". It's simple yet enthralling. Simply getting past an opposing animal can be done in various ways. If you want to fight grab a spiked branch and hit him with it. Want to set up a secenario in which another poor creature gets caught up in a battle to the death so you can continue untouched? So many options and functions are in play. The games physics are so very real and fun.There is so much mystery about the story and the Runes and what is actually going on in the Alps. I am very ready to find out what that is. For an Alpha that I bought For 7 or so bucks I'd have to say I am in love with this game. I cannot wait to see what the Steam community has to bring to this game as well. The game also comes with all the developers tools to make this game. So if you feel the need to rework things or submit your own idea's you can. What an awesome and refreshing approach from an indiDev.Keep your eye on this game closely. Throw down the 10$ (or less if it's on sell) and thank me later.-Casey"
,Not Recommended,246680,19726034,"Posted: 16 December, 2015",all,kittycatgirl2k,"This game ranks as one of the biggest disappoints of my life and disturbed four people that represent three generations of gamers. Good job Broken Rules!  We all need therapy now!As you can see from the screenshots, Raetikon is visually stunning, with gorgeous graphical design and an engrossing world.  It plays like a simple Metroidvania type game that relies on puzzle elements.  Areas are gated off behind a ""collect the bits"" mechanic, but everything is so pretty, you don't even mind.  The creature designs are origami given life.  You play as a weird bird with shoes, that controls very much like the arcade game Joust, which works very well and seems fluid.  The game dumps you right into the action, leaving you to figure things out, which is refreshing with all the hand holding these days.  The story is pieced together by collecting runes to decipher ancient tablets, a gimmick that my kids and mother both enjoyed as they worked together to crack the code.  It's not a necessary thing to accomplish to beat the game, but a nice side diversion.  The music is also suitably haunting.Sounds good so far, and it is.  We enjoyed the laid back pacing that I would liken to the exploration of Proteus or Journey.  Some have complained of the difficulty, but I had no issues, and only died once, in the bramble maze while being reckless.  And there's two major issues with this short little game.BUG.  I have seen on forums where the developer promised to fix this over a year ago and guess what?  They didn't.  It's still there.  If you open the areas in an order that the developers did not intend, the game becomes impossible to complete the traditional way.  You get to a point where you are short three gold slivers to progress, and they simply do NOT exist if you mistakenly tackled the areas in the wrong order.  This happened to me and the only way past it is through ANOTHER BUG that allows you to access the end areas by an obscure method.  We wandered around for almost two hours backtracking, thinking that we were just missing a few slivers.  It was triple checked, so I hit the internet and found mention of this bug on a forum.  None of this was repaired as promised, so do NOT leave the area above the evil tree for last or you will have problems.FINALLY... it's the ending.  It IS memorable, you can't take that away from it, but does it ever kill a bit of your soul and leave a bad taste in your mouth.  You go from heroic hope to stupid and evil.SPOILERS!!!...........it seems through the whole adventure of Secrets of Raetikon that you are trying to save animals in cages.  Yet at the end, you find out that you kill them and use their blood/essence to power a primitive game of Pong.  After the credits, it dumps you into free roaming mode.  The real horror is here, for not only did you murder the caged animals, but EVERY SINGLE animal on the planet.  Everything is dead.  Everything.  So your stupid bird could play Pong.  It's depressing and senseless.We had talked about how fun it would be to just go back and replay it but that's not happening now.  Your journey seems pointless, tainted and corrupted.  Raetikon leaves a black splotch on your heart and a dead feeling in your soul.  My kids were disturbed, and my mother was so messed up she watched several Let's Plays on youtube just to see other rections and if there's another ending.... the answer is NO.  No other endings.  You can't change it.Therefore, I have a hard time recommending it, even though it's this lovely, wonderful game up until the end.If you don't mind absurdly bad endings and would like a game that combines Castlevania:SOTN, Journey, Proteus and Joust together, then give this a shot.  Personally, I doubt we will ever play it again.  We discovered the Secrets of Raetikon afterall...The secret was... the ending sucks."

,Recommended,246680,9873172,"Posted: 19 April, 2014",all,DYSIOD☰,"In 2013 Anti-chamber burst on the scene in Janurary taking my GOTY immediately (and it stuck!). It took a little longer, and there've been some other competators (Creeper World III, being the front runner, though I think it's a '13 game as well), but I can safely say Raetikon is my GOTY for 2014.It's an absolute joy to play. It's visually stunning, and generally manages to stay managable and not overwhelming. The envrionment speaks in beautiful ways as you move through it. The viewpoint is just the right closeness, it leaves you feeling lost as you explore, but once you learn the paths it doesn't feel clausterphobic. Secrets everywhere, but they're not unfairly hidden (ala The Swapper). And the movement, oh the movement. Soaring, diving, frantically attempting to escape other birds (who are bullies, btw). Finally, the combat. Yes it's there, it's amazing. It's brutal. It's viceral. It's wild. And you'll be elated when you figure it out yourself.All these elements combine into one of the best games I've ever play. It's under priced, and worth every money grubbing penny.As an aside, I haven't decided if I prefer Mouse or Controller play, but so far I'm sticking to the controller as it's slightly tighter."

76561198061690924,Not Recommended,246680,10430820,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,Batir,"To be honest, i'm pretty much neutral about this game. I like it, great astetics and concept, but I feel like the one thing that really makes it a rotten egg is the protagonist. They're too underpowered, and you haft to do some things over and over again if you even want to do it.  All you can lift into the air is the animals, and they never like you. On top of that, the special-looking blue triangles are pretty much useless. It's only a rez @ the spot you died, when you can just fly back to where you were. Pretty animation, though. As I said earlier, none of the animals like you, pretty much everyone wants to bar your way except for the little red and yellow birds. You can't even fight back most of the time, unless you throw them into thorns. Being able to hatch birds dosen't help at all; the buzzards still attack you and the magpies still take your stuff.In conclusion, I feel that for most people, this game will eventually send them into a rampage and they'd quit, saying it's too hard. Add some allies or strengthen the protagonist and it might make a decent game, but until then, it's not worth the 10 bucks, unless you like looking at the pretty stuff."
,Not Recommended,246680,25917019,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,FlamingoTanya,"Secrets of Raetikon looks like it had an amazing potential to be a very very good game. However, if, just like me, you got charmed by the trailer and the graphics, then you might be deceived as well.The enemies in this game are the most frustrating ones i've seen in a long time. They chase you non-stop and always make sure to get in your way at every single level. When you catch the triangle thing from them, the second after, they can steal it back, not giving you any chances of running away and having to go back and forth until you flee faster than them.Speaking of back and forth ; the amount of times you have to go back to the first stage and get back to the level you were to bring a weird triangle is incredibly frustrating. there is no warp or anything so you always have to do the stages all over in order to proceed to the next one.There is also an alphabet in the game, in which you have to find all the letters to undestand the runes. I personnally didn't enjoy it, as it just complicates the game more and doesn't give me the motivation to go through every single rune to try to discover what they are saying. Some of them doesn't even say anything important, which adds even more frustration. On top of that, all the birds wants you dead for no particular reason.Despise the amazing graphics and soundtracks, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game."

As others have already noted, the main problems here are tedium and frustration. It's a shame because this game could have been much more than it is. It looks great and the general movement mechanics are a lot of fun, but the actual game itself (what you are trying to accomplish) is equal parts boring and infuriating to actually do.The tedium/boredom in traveling back and forth depositing items into a thing I could forgive because when you do make progress in this game, it really feels exciting and intriguing. My biggest issue were the magpies/squirrels/anything that can steal from you types of enemies. I literally could not get across a single screen without having my stupid triangle thing stolen 50+ times by enemies that absolutely never give up the chase. Sometimes they'd steal it within one second of me getting it back! It became an absurd, unfun challenge just to move a triangle thing a little ways.SoR could have been much better with less aggressive enemies that know when to give up the chase or possibly even no enemies at all. As it stands, I just don't want to play it anymore, and I didn't even get an hour in."

,Not Recommended,246680,22893461,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,I'm Not Sue,"Secrets of Rætikon is a somewhat visually interesting game without much lore or depth of gameplay to it.  Or rather, it might be better to say that the lore is hard to keep in mind when it is there (and is confusing anyway) and the gameplay is just a tad bit wonky enough to be offputting.The gameplay loop is more or less: As a bird, explore > find shards > use shards to get crystal > carry crystal back to the start of the game.  This can be a little frustrating due to a lack of map, and the game often has aircurrents and 'invisible' ceilings (just max elevation for your bird to fly) so you cant always expect to be able to take straightforward paths.  Exploration can reward you with an anagram cypher so you can read various runes around the game world on obelisks, but its not really easy to do so because its not automatically translated for you, hence why I said the lore is hard to keep in mind.  Its a lot of mental effort to try to guess out letters without the whole codex.Finding shards is more or less easy, but the crystal carrying can be a different matter.  The other animals in the world will attack you or steal the crystal from you as you try to carry it back and make you have to chase them down to get it back.  This just feels frustrating and like your time is being wasted, it isn't fun.  The controls are passable, but I never felt like they were amazing and executing the needed moves to chase down elusive enemies or avoid attacks can be a pain.  Gameplay just never felt good.  I only kept playing because I had started playing and presumably was progressing towards finishing.Lore wise?  Was hard to keep in mind when I played the game, but I really can't say I remembered any of it.  I got all but one or two of the needed crystals to roll the credits then just gave up on the game.  I looked up the ending on youtube and it feels like a bit of a rediculous jab by the way of the developer.  Sure it can be interesting to have a joke on the expense of the player but if the other party can't figure out the joke and you dont explain it to them then its not funny or 'deep.'  I just sort of shrug my shoulders at this part, there wasn't enough of a story to be meaningful.I wouldn't recommend it."
76561198343482820,Recommended,246680,34861705,Posted: 10 September,all,Snowstorm Bengal,"Secrets of RaetikonReleased in 2014, Secrets of Raetikon is a 2D adventure puzzle game created by Austrian developer Broken Rules. Set in an uncharted area of the Alpine mountain range, players assume the role of a native bird who uncovers the remains of an ancient civilisation.Secrets of Raetikon uses an open world environment with a heavy emphasis on exploration, item collection and puzzle solving. The primary objective is to retrieve seven mysterious shard fragments and return them to a central location. Each piece is protected by a combination of hostile wildlife, hazardous surroundings and environmental based puzzles.In theory the game world is open plan, allowing the player to free roam and collect shard fragments in any order they like. However in practice, the routes you take often require you to complete a puzzle before you can proceed further, which ultimately results in a much more linear gameplay experience. There is no in-game map so players must keep track of their route themselves.Secrets of Raetikon uses a simple control scheme and your bird protagonist handles responsively enough. It does a particularly good job at conveying a sense of flying by utilising wide open aerial spaces and wind currents to help propel you faster through the sky. There are hostile animals which present some light combat elements, but there is more of a focus on evasion and retaliation through indirect means.There is a decent amount of interactivity built into the game world. The puzzles revolve around physics based gameplay, usually requiring you to manipulate a mechanism or assemble a statue in a jigsaw piece fashion. These concepts initially feel quite novel and satisfying to solve, however they really are quite simplistic and do become a bit repetitive by the end.Graphically is where Secrets of Raetikon truly shines. It uses a 2D polygonal art style which has a paper craft / origami look to it. It combines bold shapes with strikingly vivid colours to create a genuinely unique and appealing aesthetic. The game also conveys a good sense of scale by occasionally panning the camera angle back to reveal large background canvases set against your tiny protagonist. The soundtrack also deserves an honourable mention as it provides some nice instrumental tracks which help provide a theme to each territory.With regards to storyline, there is no real overarching plot. The only slight hints at lore are presented in the form of rune stones which are written in a coded language. Runic letters are hidden throughout the game which will enable you to transcribe the cyphers. However, these rune stones reveal so little in the way of story that it becomes a large investment for such a small return. The ending scene is also an enormous disappointment, the tone of which feels counter intuitive to everything else portrayed in the game.Overall, Secrets of Raetikon is an entertaining enough game with highlights in its art style and soundtrack. It is a short diversion which should only take a few hours to complete. It does have some definite flaws and weaknesses which are hard to overlook but I personally feel that there is still enough enjoyable content here to warrant a positive recommendation."

Some things will definitely be different in the future.*Firstly, this is unlike any early access game I've played. It's actually playable!The basic premise behind this game is the following: you're a bird. You're looking for singing rocks that, when you do find one, everything (read: EVERYTHING) wants to mess you up.That is, as far as I can tell, the point of the game. But the funny thing is, this unexplained goal is something Iwantto achieve when playing. Everything about this game makes me want to play, even when I don't know why.The very well done flying mechanics feel intuitive and, even on the keyboard, I found myself soaring around relatively quickly.The entire atmosphere and art style feel like a children's book mixed with cave paintings mixed with origami. If that doesn't sound awesome, then stop reading right now.The music (note: I am a composer, so my music opinion is much more in depth) is a happier sounding minimalism. Basically expect lots of repetition, constant looping ostinatos and continuous percussion that tend to stick out of the mix. Initially, I was put off by the music to be honest. Minimalism isn't really my thing and hearing the same 4 second melody over and over and over? Well, I was beginning to consider switching off the sound after a while...But it gradually grew on me, especially when I got further into the world. It starts to really come into its own when you meet the more interesting animals. So, I'm passing the music, but would much prefer something more than what's currently available.Speaking of audio, I did notice repetitive sound effects, so I'm hoping the creators decide to invest in more than the handful of rock cracking sounds they have! I also dislike the wind sound that accompanies a dash. That would work a lot better as a speed activation, rather than a button activated sound effect.So, thetl:drversion:PROS:Beautiful artstyleWonderful atmosphereVery polished controls and engineWorld is intriguingCONS:Music can get repetitive and dull over time. Did grow on me though.Sound effects are obviously few and far between/need to be changed in placesNow, the big question is:is it worth it?I would definitely say yes. There's a decent amount to go with already, and it's still early access. If the creators keep it updated and improve upon it, then the answer will be:OH GOD YES!Looking forward to the future of Rætikon."

Fighting or avoiding enemies is challenging and inventive, where the only way to hurt the enemies is to run them into a hazard, or bring one to them, there are lots of secret areas, and runes to find and decode, which is an added fun little bonus for those of you who like to do that, and it doesn't appear to be required, all in all this game tickles the mind and is innovative and inventive, a very quirky casual game, easily one of my favorites, 4/5"

On your free flight around this wonderful world, you happen across various animals. And you can choose to help or not, or even try to find a way past them. The crow seems to like attacking you when you're near a machine, just HOW are you going to get rid of him?? Well, there was that rock, I could try and squish him..Do you try and fight, try and use world objects, use another animal to your advantage?? It's your call.I'm still trying to figure out the rune table, but again, this will prove fun more than frustration, and it's all part of the learning curve of playing this game.The physics are well rounded (grabbing a heavy rock slows you down etc etc) and the ability to just mess about  is wonderfully delightful. Even though I've played less than an hour, this is going to be one of those games I can quite happily come back to again and again.I'll have to have a bash at the editor, which is a really nice touch from Broken Rules. Not many game companies give you this option to mess about with their game.End opinion?Worth £6.00? oh hell yeah.Game play? Very smooth, graphically beautiful open worldRecommend this? Absolutely"

The assembly of such gfx/music (one is a slow down version of a ""the fith element"" melody) and gameplay makes this game unique-ish.Unfortunately, I did discover some game mechanics when I finished the game while I decided to have a look at the steam achievements. The breeding, predator/prey law,  well... I missed them totally. Some of them are insane: finish the game without being hurt is crazy, coze the movement/flapping of the bird will make it extremely hard, namely, you will need luck, a lot.I managed to block an underwater rune with rocks... (unable to remove them to read it).The ending is controversial: killing animals for their blood in order to power what seems a machine, is a bit too much for me. And I'm not a vegetarian person. And why pong??The game is big enough to discourage to start again to unlock more achievements and to discover what the hell are the 2 unused triangles. I was not able to find a place where they would fit. I really did spend a lot of time looking for forgotten places in the entire world. Well... did not look hard enough... hint of the location not ""strong"" enough?One bad point though: the game require the linux closed source radeon driver for full rendering. Games can be closed source, but platform (here GNU/Linux)  and middleware should be open (GNU lesser GPL license protection for middleware code)."
,Recommended,246680,12616452,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,SqueakAttack,"An amazingly beautiful and frustrating game. Once you get the hang of it, it is not so bad, but at first you feel like calling it defenseless bird simulator. You are given little to no instruction as to how to actually play the game and are left to figure many of the goals and interworkings yourself. This quality is one I found to be both irritating and rewarding.The difficulties in the game are both technical (controling the character) and tactical as you are actually required to think from time to time to play it. The good news is that when you find yourself yelling at the screen, you have some stunning artwork to calm you down.I enjoyed playing this game quite a lot, despite my frustrations. It was, however, a little short. I finished two play throughs and all of the reasonable achievements in about 12 hours. I understand it is an indie game, so I cannot reasonably judge it on length. An expansion or addendum would be nice though.A few bugs (I think). I never found bees or bats in the game, but they are listed in the stats as things you can kill. Also, there are other stats in that same listing that never seem to change no matter what I do. I could have missed something entirely, or there are bugs. Looking at some of the videos of this game posted by others on the internet, I am given to thinking there have been updates that changed the game enough that certain things may no longer apply to it.Lastly, I may have had more technical difficulties than your average given that I did not play with a controller, just my keyboard."

Far from perfect, but would still recommend. The controls are very simple, but very ropey and imprecise. The narrative is non-existant. Quite why you're doing anything, or what exactly it is you've got to do at times is unclear. The game is action-focused, in that you're constantly doing everything you can to avoid action. Three hours long but ends very abruptly. A map is sorely needed.In short, everything is kind of okay, but can lead to intense frustration. I would not recommend it as a method to relax. Only buy if you're already a relaxed person, because the controls and enemies will likely annoy you.7/10, would recommend, but probably won't play again"

Art style is interesting, the setting feels awesome, its cool to explore and interact with the world or watch it carry out its own habits like a natural predator and prey feeling.Cons: Certain tasks and the typical issues with physic heavy games may turn off some folks as being a bit tedious, a full game over can erase a lot of well earned progress, and some transparent spots look no different than walls.Overall its a fantastic and inspiring indie title that isn't quite complete yet but surprisingly well polished and full of content for an early access. I'd say it could do better for user interface or friendlyness, but the gameplay itself is a lot of fun and something special. The slow pacing rewards you for taking your time and really making the most out of the world, and in this sort of way it reminds me of games like Spyro, Okami, or a flash game I played called William and Sly. If you're a fan of any of those, or like a certain range of slow paced adventure or platformers, or just enjoy this concept of flying and physics then I can safely recomend this game to you and I don't think you'll regret getting it."

Flying about and exploring was engaging, and getting some of the shards back to the central hub had me swearing at birds and trees alike - in a good way, mind you. There were definetely things to like here, enough to justify the five dollars I spent on it during a sale.That said, I found myself wishing there were more to explore; more proper secrets to uncover. That, and the game doesn't really do much with it's world; I think the biggest example is the fox tribe. Sure, you can find your way into the obscure location of the den and meet a tribe of foxes, but nothing really comes of the encounter. They just kind of...leave. They're a setpiece, and not much else.There's backstory here to find, but no real story to explain the gameplay, which perhaps helps to explain why the ending is so unsatisfying. I'm not even sure what it was properly trying to say. I suspended my disbelief and honestly invested into the world for a few hours, and didn't really feel like I got anything back for the experience. If nothing else, this game has shown me a bad ending can really sour the experience.Still, the game got me to swear at birds, so it certainly did something right."

The game leaves you without any key of comprehension.* The flight is special at least.You play a bird. You can flap your wings with the action button.What I was expecting: You keep your current speed before the action, and get a boost after the action.What the game does: You stopped in air before the action, and restart flying at after, slightly faster than before.Every. single. time.And to keep the optimum speed, you press that buttons at least 3 times in a second. Result: you move forward, you stop, you move, you stop, you move, you stop. That's stupid and really annoying. When you have to fly a long distance, the camera is like shaking because of those to two actions.* The enemy in this game are freeking ninjas.They can reach you from far and but you can't.Lynx often hide themselves, as you just fly by the area, you are taken down by them, even if they were outside of the screen.* So crucial feedbacks are missing.You can dive in the water in the game. My reaction: ok, that's cool.You can almost dive/swim in it for quite a long time. My reaction: ok, that's something I wasn't expecting, but cool.Suddenly, as you are swimming/diving, you get hurt, but your health bar doesn't shrink/reduce.Possibilities:- You are attacked by something you don't know and don't see.- You are sinking.The fact is you are indeed sinking somehow, but there's no air/breath bar, neither another user feedback.At this point, you should think that I'm stupid, that's obvious.I tell you: no.

Thankfully, the game is not confusing and having to remember where to go next won't/shouldn't be an issue.It's unfortunately backed with some backtracking and some animals that will attempt to ruin your work or outright kill you. You can kill them using the environment, but it will take some effort.The environment can trap you if you're not careful. This is in combination with auto-save, so restarts might be a possibility.The sound and level designs are fantastic. You will feel an urge to explore them, run through the trees as you desire, looking for secrets and such, it's well deserving of exploration. There were no noticeable glitches.There are a few, side-track things you can do to occupy your time such as hatching animals for your own benefit or killing the rowdier animals.

Therefor I strongly recommend using a controller and not going for the keyboard, as I did lol.I think the vision was better than the actual result which was rather messy boxed up in beautiful graphics. So, if you understand their vision, I'm pretty sure you'll like it!"

The game is all about collecting runes and working your way through each section with a main hub at the center. It is a simple game that you can enjoy without thinking too much."
76561197998531188,Not Recommended,246680,19394454,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,Roidh,"Secrets of Rætikon is almost a good game.  The art style is absolutely gorgeous.  It really gives a good sense of some hidden fallen world that has been overrun by nature.  Additionally the core feeling of flight was nailed down perfectly.  Just being able to fly around and pick things up is actually quite a joy.  Being able to fly around the areas and explore the little nooks and crannies that have little secrets hidden in them is really fun.Then there is the rest of the game.  The core gameplay loop is that you go around and collect little gems.  You then find a machine that you put the gems in.  When you’ve put enough gems in the machine it then gives you a bigger gem that you need to drag back to the central hub and put it into a great machine.  While doing this, every single animal tries to steal the item away from you and prevent you from putting it into the machine.  This would probably be somewhat tolerable, except that there is really only one path connecting all of these machines so instead of the big machine acting as say a hub that then links you to different areas, you end up going through the same areas over and over in excessive backtracking that wears on you and becomes monotonous after a while.There is a backstory written on little rune stones that are located throughout the world, but the runes are somewhat obnoxious to read.  They are just written in a strange font and so you have to go around and collect items that tell you which character is which English character.  When you read the rune stones though all it does is put up the font conversions on the side of the screen so you still have to manually go through and look up the letters to figure out what was written.  It becomes very annoying after a while especially because most of the rune stones don’t have anything very interesting to say.Lastly there is the ending.  Without spoiling it, I will say that the game ends on a pretty forced message that makes you question why the developers even decided to make this game in the first place if that was their point, because obviously they don’t respect you playing it.  Though even then that might just be what I think that they are trying to say because the execution is pretty poor.Which I guess is the best way to describe Secrets of Rætikon.  Some good ideas.  A few executed very well, but the majority executed quite poorly into a wholly unsatisfying experience."

After upgrading and moving all my games over, it played fine.The first thing is the art. Secrets of Raetikon is a gorgeously different game, with elements that bring you back to the ""good days"" of gaming. I personally had no trouble with the game mechanics. I rarely found it difficult or frustrating to move around in the game. Others have complained that the birds stealing cores from you made the game unplayable; I disagree. I thought it was a fun challenge that was not overly difficult. And yes; the ending is messed up.I enjoyed this game. I found it entertaining and a good way to spend a day."
