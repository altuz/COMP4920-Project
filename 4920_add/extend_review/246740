,Recommended,246740,7751549,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,13th |UKCS|,"Huntsman: The Orphanage is one of those very rare games that has an interesting idea for a game, and it works pretty well. It is one of those games that whilst you can watch people play it, the only way to really get the full experience of the game is to play it yourself.I also like how they take the sound of a ticking clock and make it something that you will learn to fear. I have lost count the amount of times I thought I heard it in game and breathed a sigh of relief when I realised it was the clock on my wall that I heard, Which to me shows how atmospheric the game is if they can make me get scared by my own clock. The stories that each of the characters have to tell also add to the games atmosphere. I honestly believe that these stories wouldn't look out of place in a movie as it is just so well told by each of the people that they got to play the characters in the game.And they have gotten a Ripley's Believe It or Not master to create the maze that the Huntsman calls home. And you will get lost in it, I have many times, I usually end up visiting the same grave 3 or 4 times as I look for the Orphan I am trying to free. Not to mention nearly jumping out of my skin as I turned a corner and there was the Huntsman making his way towards me in the maze.The Huntsman himself is a creature I have learned to love and fear. He is based on a Huntsman spider: Only he is a lot bigger and his prey is you.This is a rare gem of a game, with so many games out there going for the jump scare tactic. It is a nice refreshing change to play something that goes for atmospheric horror and really gives me the creeps whenever I play it. And for that, I thank ShadowShifters for giving me this game to play and look forward to whatever they decide to do next."

You need to map out a huge hedge maze that you have to find your way through 12 times to find 12 different graves, so be prepared!   You have to carry items to graves in the maze and can only carry ""one"" item at a time!  Then you have to go back to the house and get another item, go through the maze again, find a different grave, rinse and repeat!  It's so lame!!!Keep in mind, each item goes on a different grave and you have to find the right grave for each item.  It wouldn't be so bad if you could carry all the items at the same time, but having to go back to get each item, then transverse the maze again is torture!!!  Even if you brought all the items to the entrance of the maze, it's going to be a long haul!!!There was one cool part in the game that was freaking creepy!  I had an encounter with the Huntsman, but I won't spoil it for you because it was so creepy and really cool IMO.  I never finished the game due to sheer boredom and frustration.  I warn you, if you buy this game, get the graph paper out before entering that maze! lolI do not recommend this game, even at the sale price of $2.50 USD!  It can be very frustrating and so boring!!!"
,Not Recommended,246740,7694309,"Posted: 18 November, 2013",all,0dds_0f_Even,"It's rare to find a horror game that has no blood & violence but the prob with this game is that I don't like it. (I'm going to post my thoughts on why I don't like it).Cons:1. It does a terrible job at making you nervous since the game's antagonist moves way too slow & does a lame life sapping technique if you look at him (Doesn't that sound familiar?)2. Your main character moves slow and your always tapping Shift all the time just trying to run (The running in that game feels like fast walking)3. The lack of names on the graves makes it annoying & time wasting4. The lack of exploration sucks too because the orphanage is too small in my opinion which has a short basement, 2 short floors & that annoying hedge maze which takes forever to figure out5. Finding Treasure and setting them on a certain grave kinda reminds me of a matching game except a more boring version of itPros:1. Really good voice acting on each of the characters2. The story is decentOverall I personally think this game is terrible but some people might like a creepypasta based game with no blood or violence but don't bother wasting $15 on this game (I'm sorry about the negative review but I just didn't feel it)."
76561197983197880,Recommended,246740,8000939,"Posted: 10 December, 2013",all,Blast Hardcheese,"I'll just say this out front: This isn't a perfect game. I do feel that there are some things that were done right and some things that could use some improvement, but I'm also confident that any perceived negatives will be addresed by Shadowshifters.The game does a good job of setting up a creepy environment with a creepy backstory. If exploring an old, abandoned orphanage marred by an unexplained, supernatural tragedy doesn't give you a few chills, then you might want to check your pulse and make sure it's still there. The Huntsman himself is a creepy character too, although maybe based a tad too much on common creepypasta tropes in his appearance, but I'm largely quibbling on that one and have probably read too many creepypastas myself. The cellphone flashlight and screen are a nifty addition that makes you wonder why it hasn't been incorporated before in games like this. The flashlight mechanic is obvious, but the use of the screen is a very nice idea that can really enhance the genre. You may also wonder if the character is lugging a car battery in a backpack that's wired up to the thing, too, heheh. It's used to decent effect with some creepiness, although granted, I feel there's more potential in the idea than we currently see.That being said, I feel like this game could do more with what it has. More mystery would be very welcome. Handing much of the story over in narration isn't so bad, but I feel like feeding the story in smaller chunks via exploration and other means could have been a better hook. One item in particular was pretty difficult to find. The mechanics can sometimes be a bit too simplistic.However, I'm giving this game a solid recommendation based not only on atmosphere and some inspired mechanics, but also on Shadowshifters (the folks who made the game in case you didn't notice). They have been very active on the Steam forum for the game and have been very receptive and open to the community. I've reported a few bugs that were fixed within days. You are going to be very hard pressed to find that kind of open ear or dedication in any game company, big or small. Don't forget that this game only came out of early release status about a month and a half prior to writing this, so rough edges are still being smoothed and they're still expanding on the game and fleshing out further details. Some people have complained of low-quality textures and some rough sound effects. I thought so too when I first got this game, but before I even got through it I would fire it up and notice that I must've grabbed a patch, because they were steadily getting fixed. Better textures, better sound, bugfixes, adjustments to mechanics, and more have been pouring in for some time now and it doens't look like they'll stop while there are things left to do. The surprising rate at which they've been fixing bits and pieces (and hinted at some further expansion of the game overall) along with enthusiastic community interaction gives me great hope for Shadowshifters and the games they can make in the future. As such, I solidly recommend The Huntsman. It's good for some crawling skin and there's a great deal of further promise in the game and in the company who made it.Snag this game, turn out the lights, and have some fun. You might find yourself stopping any noisy, ticking clocks nearby when you're through for the night."

If you get it for free, good for you, if not, don't bother paying for it.I like the story idea of the orphanage and hunting down the parts for the kids but that's about where it ends.The game play is glitchy, you have to figure out how the keyboard is configured (fairly easy) and no options.Given time in delevopment, this game could have been a really good horror game.  I'm sorry to give this game a thumbs down."

Zip - zero - nada blood & guts style ""horror"".  There is no violence in it but there is tense suspense as the huntsman wanders around, you can hear him.It is the story of an abandoned orphanage that became so due to the disappearance of many children over a hundred years ago.  You are a paranormal type investigator checking out the stories in the place as wander through the abandoned building and the grounds - which include a maze where the empty graves of the missing orphans are set.Going through it, I found more than 2 hours of voice acting and the stories of the 17 characters (12 children and the 5 staff who worked in the place)  and all the stories are interesting in their own way.Lots of listening in this to learn the details of the stores as you hunt around for the pieces to free the trapped orphan souls."
,Not Recommended,246740,18777970,"Posted: 30 October, 2015",all,Brezlon,"With the creator of this game spamming my activity feed right before Halloween, it just reminded me that I hadn't yet done a review on this game. Why? Because at the time I didn't want to say anything bad. Now I feel bad for my fellow gamers because I DIDN'T say anything. I'm sorry, guys. :(----I will note, my post may be recent but my review of the game is older. I haven't touched that game in over a year and I'll tell you exactly why...This game falls flat. Flatter than a pancake lost in time. Now originally I was hyped before it was Greenlit as I thought there'd be more to it. I even pre-purchased the original Halloween edition to show my support, esp for more content. I was very disappointed. And still am.It's just plain boring. The in-game audio-dialogue goes on for what feels like forever and it's designed to punish you for wanting to listen to it. When you hear that ticking getting louder, it means the monster is approaching and you have to flee. Because you abandoned the audio, you have to come back to listen to the whole thing all over again.I had to ask myself why: why would the creator do that? Why would they make us loathe the voice actors/characters because they took too long explaining their sob-story. The reason is, because it wastes time, and more ""X time in game"" statistics makes it a better sell on Steam.As for the 'monster', it is in my opinion the worst part of the game. And that's saying something...If you haven't seen it in the Store's preview yet, it's basically a 3' tall spider-chicken. It's not a scary thing towering over you in a sinister-like manner - nothing that brings chills up your spine or causes you to scream in terror when you see it. When it does find you, it meekly expresses itself in pantomime by swishing its pedipalps (claws) at you like a silent game of tag. That swish means you're dead, btw. Otherwise, the rest of the time you never see it but you hear it quietly ticking around the house as if it's lost its way. It shouldn't have been called the Huntsman, but rather the ""Meander-man"".Speaking of spider-chickens...As a farmer, I've had to deal with far scarier roosters in my lifetime. Ones that wouldn't hesitate to fly up to your face to peck out your eyes or tear into your jugular with their 3 inch long spurs. They could bring on real terror, and they were 2 feet tall at best! Of course, they were also easily dispatched with an axe. So why can't I use an axe on Mr. Spider-chicken? It would actually make the game somewhat enjoyable.Barely.Probably not.When I first saw the Huntsman in game, I laughed my butt off. It droped down from the mannequins in a ""Ta da!"" stance. It looked silly, and stupid. It glanced up at me from the ground as if to say ""I'm powerful because I have .kill command!"" Ugh. Laughter really shouldn't be the first reaction a player has over a horror game monster.To finish off I'll say this game is in my hidden list, along with the other junk I regret purchasing. Save yourself money and time, don't get this game.No wait, don't even accept it as a gift. And if a friend sends it to you, theyprobablyhate your gutts."

I loved it for the first couple hours because the story is fantastic but it also lose it charm was you get into that stupid maze and you run into that chessy Huntsman, everytime I do i just want to push a button to hit the guy because he couldn't even scare a four year old, not that you'd want too, but still it was more scary when he was a nosie that always seem to be right behind you instead of this crap/doc dude from assassins creed, that just walks around the stupid maze ticking away and grunting, then when you finally run into him theres not much you can do so its game over. The most painful part is trying to figure out were the toys or objects belong. But I guess the real question is would I recommend this game to a friend it really would depend on the friend, if the friend was going after a game to scare the crap out of him through out the game heck no, but if it was a friend that like a interesting story and a challenge then yea I defeatly would.

76561198034870988,Recommended,246740,11210588,"Posted: 12 July, 2014",all,Turretcube,"My playtime with the game has been short but this is one of the better horror games avalible, its ambience is great, the story is intresting and it doesnt rely on jumpscares. What most people fail to see is that this game offers you the chance to get the whole story before playing which is nice since the main gameplay involves running back and forth from a maze hunting tombstones. The maze itself is probably the best idea i've seen for a horror game as maze's are ment to be confusing to navigate and this such maze will confuse you to the point of getting lost with the huntsman after you. The walking and running speed could be better then again it my by involantary stealth to avoid the huntsman. Plus his constant ticking makes you doubt that upcoming corner or him popping out of a path in the wall you can't see till you get further down said path. The maze itself is not just a cube splased with normal maps and textures like most 3d gamemazes, it actually looks like a hedge a iv scared myself from the bits of the hedge that stick out.The Huntsman design is excellent i completley didnt expect it and i killed myself by accident just trying look at it on all sides. The huntsman's in-game reach is abit off though as he can get you about 5 steps away which needs to be fixed along with the 3-5 minute death scene. Basically if you die you have to watch a floating phone for a bit before credits rock up. Not bad the first time but each time is annoying and is a pain as i havnt found an actual skip button.The objectives arn't ground breaking since they are find and place quests but are much more fun and difficult thanks to the maze and the huntsman.Overall this is one of the better horror games, it has some problems that are minor and are doesn't force the player to go through a gauntlet of jumpscares but more originality than anything.All Horror games lose that ""horror""element after 2 or 3 plays and have to resort to jumpscares to fix it. It happens here but they don't add jumpscares to keep it up. It shows they trust there game enough to not cheap it out like several triple A games such as ""Outlast""or""Slender The Arrival"". Truly one of the most original horror games on steam."

I don't know how much further you want me to qualfy that for an indie game that wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't also for how poorly animated everything is. The sound was recorded poorly, and is balanced horribly speach that pops up is at whispered levels while a slight wind buffetting a house sounds like a hurricane.The game goes long stretches of nothing only to show you a monster who stands stock still and talks (whispers) at you for a minute or two before vanishing.It is a terrible game.
