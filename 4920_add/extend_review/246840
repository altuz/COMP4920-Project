This is the game which Torchlight is based off of and I was wondering why it didn't get any love from Steam. The Dungeon in this game is endless and it's procedurally generated. (if I remember correctly, it's been a long time.) It is defently worth the money. It does support 1920x1080 resolution. I suggest not tab alting while starting the game, it seems to not like it."

You have the task to create a character, choose your pet and go deeper and deeper into the dungeon.++ It is an old RPG, but better than some today!++ addictive++ can be played for hours and hours (explore different levels or just go fishing)++ you can go fishing!+ lots of little tasks, but everytime the same (kill that, find that, bring me that, etc.)+ loads of weapons, armor and spells!+ the monsters get bigger and stronger with every level/dungeon+ typical skilltree (strength, vitality, dexterity, magic)+ money is not really necessary+ easy achievements (except ""Fate Ensured"" - beat the endboss)Also FATE is not that perfect!- it's often the same...so I rushed the last 10 levels- play it on hard, the remaining is too easy- I don't like the sounds of the pets (they're too annoying)- the controls were a little bit tricky (in my opinion)- If you are fast, you are done with in 10 hours - but you can play further- Ok ok ok.

,Recommended,246840,17974790,"Posted: 10 September, 2015",all,Whiteswart,"Isometric action-RPG dungeon crawler. A bridge between Diablo and Torchlight. Everything we have in the Torchlight we have because of this smooth project... And Fate itself is based mostly on the Diablo Hellfire best patterns.If you're familiar with the Torchlight (and I guess you are), then you'll know everything the Fate got from the first sight.Cartoon-styled graphics. Mild music, yet reminiscent to Matt Uelmen tracks. Very basic RPG elements but rich grinding system, making you constantly looking for more power-ups and new guns, which will be bigger and brighter... And many-many randomly generated levels (over 2 millions, and that's not a joke). Basically, you can keep playing in the Fate year by year and still be far from its depth (that's what Diablo 3 is only dreaming to be).Comparing FATE to all other ""Diablo killers"" and especially Diablo 3 itself may not be the best idea, though. While generally all those games, would that be the Diablo itself, Titan quest, Sacred (etc.) - have some story on the plate, you can't say same thing about FATE. It is so random in every point, that even the main quest is not stable, and will be procedurally generated and different for any player. You'll not get any background there but only the very basic: you have a town with some folks, half of them will be traders or item randomizers, while other half will be sending you on some irrelevant quests. And all the quests in the game will be like ""reach the level X and kill the monster Z"" or ""Bring me an item Y from level X"".Now, the main question: should you buy it? Yes.Point one: it is good for any dungeon crawler fan. Hardly FATE can take your heart now, with all new titles like Van Helsing or Bastion (or dozens of others), but still it provides a very solid gameplay. A lot of challenge awaits!Point two: even if you are not so deep in dungeon crawlers, but making numbers on Steam (would that be score of games in possession or achievement statistics, or both) - it is a good buy (especially with discount, of course). To make a gold on achievements, you'll probably need less than 5-6 hours.Finally, this game has very high valued cards, so you have a good chance to buy the game and even make some money back on top of it!Overall, it's not a hit or something you can't live without, but it's a very good pick. My mark 7.5/10"

Although it is very very basic, it has a certain charm that gets you hooked straight away.You can only have three active quests at a time, which means you have to keep heading back to the main town to hand them in and collect new ones. This is a really good idea as it kind of forces some replayability on you by having to reclear some of the dungeon you have done before, but also enables you to clear your bags of loot you have collected.You can wrack up your gold very quickly which lets you pimp yourself out in some pretty epic gear by the end.

,Recommended,246840,34712951,Posted: 3 September,all,Quantum_Tag,"When I started playing this game, I was about 9 years old. This game litteraly was my childhood, but I could only play the trial version and only while I was at my grandparents house. Now that I am 20, and have my own computer, I have decided to pick up the game for nostalgic reasons. After playing it, I was once again hooked. This is the type of game to get if you are looking for a challenge while also just walking around and cutting someone down or fireballing them to death. Now that I am older and know how to play strategically, I have made myself a Mage that regens more mana than I use.The game definitely is geared to make you constantly have trouble clearing a floor, but the harder the enemy, the more xp you get, so it balances itself out. Besides, who would want to play a game that is easy to beat? The game also incorporates a special On-Death question. It gives you the choice to revive on the spot at the cost of XP and Fame (my least favorite option), Revives you at a ""Nearby Level"" for a Cost (It can send you lower in the dungeons), then finally you can choose to drop ALL of your money and be sent 3 levels up in the dungeon (Provides you with a speed run challenge to get your money back), oh and if you aren't fast enough, your money will disappear. Isn't that awesome?As for graphics, you shouldn't expect very much. The game was released in 2005 and hasn't had any graphic updates that really CHANGED THINGS. But as for me, I do not care if the graphics aren't that of the newer games coming out these days. You can see what is going on and you dont have any trouble understanding what is what.Story? There isn't really a story to go by other that: ""After many days of travel, you've reached the forest town of Grove. On the outskirts of town, and once inside the fiery dungeon gates, you'll find fame, adventure and fortune."" Then the big quest that you have to complete by going very deep into the dungeon to defeat a big boss monster. My game gave me a boss on level 51 of the dungeon.Overall, I think everyone should play this game, its as fun as the new games but has been around much longer. Its a game that if you haven't played it, then you dont have a childhood. So what are you waiting for? Choose your FATE and get to playing!"

Slowly wiping away a small tear, I chose my pet and my head type.  It took a while to decide which difficulty level to start at.  Eventually, I chose the second hardest, Hero.

I finally descended into the dungeon and I was greeted by a familiar voice. After clearing the first floor with my axe, I decided it was time to go shopping.  I had already found a spear and some armor, so the only thing I did was stock up on potions and spell books.

FYI - this is an older game.  If you're looking for the latest, look at Torchlight.  I've played both, but being the cheapskate that I am, I figured the gameplay is identical between the two and I wasn't willing pay more than I had to for about the same experience.

This game, although stable can have bugs every once in a while. One of which i had where my normal cursor stayed on the screen when i started the game. Not allowing me to click any options and FATE took over my computer. Forcing me to cold reboot. But once you are in the actual game, I doubt you will find any glitches. Like i said eariler the monsters level up the deeper into the dungeon you go. So playing on the harder difficulty like I do you can sometimes rush into A level you just can't handle. The spells in this game are extremely varied, sometime even pretty unique. From making monster your friends to attack other enemies, to poisonous clouds that drain the life from your (Not undead) Enemies. There is also a stamina system in the game. Because even heros get tired. This really is only to slow you down. Making it so you can't run forever so thats pretty bad. And one of the best parts... FISHING. Yes, the developers decided fishing would make a great part of their game. Fish can be used to turn your pet into magical ceatures. And fishing can also get some of the rarer items in the game. The quest system is your standard. ""Go kill this for me/get this for me and ill give you gold EXP and sometimes an item"" its not much to talk about but its worth a mention. And mage is the only extremly remarkable class, albiet the hardest one to really lift off on.So all in all, fate is a pretty good game. If you like dungeon crawlers then you will love this game without a doubt, if your not a fan of dungeon crawlers i still recommend it. You might just find an exception to your distaste.8/10"

I spent all my free play tokens on it. A looooong time later, it's still fun.PROS: simple, casual gameplay""easy to pick up hard to master"" sorta thing, but in the sense of building your character and synergising different abilitiesFinds a way to make anything and everything useful to some degree, and you'll find yourself digging into several stats at once to make a build that holds its ownSuper intelligent UI and menu management, something essentially nonexistant in the modern eraNEUTRAL: IsometricCONS: definetly a dated game, not in the way Half-Life was the revolutionary FPS game but more of the ""old gem that's outshadowed by other games, yet retaining really cool features that modern games have lost""Less-that-helpful tutorial system, it teaches you the very basics but unless you're willing to look at all the niches of all the stats and find out information for yourself in the dungeon, you'll miss out. Seriously, it took me until floor 8 to realize that I could run away from a strike and have it miss my hitbox.OVERALL: 82/100, has charm and is endless fun but is relatively simple. Some shortcomings here and there, but most are overshadowed by good excecution by the developers.do note that this does hold a nostalgic place in my heart, but not enough to keep me playing if I didn't enjoy it. Even non-fans on RPGs will like it, and 2 hours (steam's max refund playtime) is more than enough to grasp a general feel of the game."

The variety of enemies, spells, items and companions possible is extremely impressive for such a small game and although the gameplay is mostly similair it doesn't feel tedious at all because of ho fast paced and rewarding it's upgrade systems are, it has an excellent feeling of progression as you go along.

The graphic are great for 2005 and can hold their own in a modern gaming market given recent events. (I am looking at you, AC Unity.)A very basic gist of the story is this: big bad monster in big bad dungeon. Adventurous hero of unknown origin and unremarkable (non-existant?) achievement must go and slay this baddie as s/he is clearly our last and greatest hope. So off you go with little more than a pointy stick and your trusty pet compainion to try and stomp a monster's teeth in.Every floor of the dungeon is random, in the sense that is a series of rooms with sporadic and often unyeildy connecting paths. As a whole, the entire dungeon has a nice and bumpy difficulty curve that, if you are strategic and don't mind some grinding, you can completely kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of.I think one of the drawbacks of this game is one key game mechanic in particular. I won't be disclosing which mechanic this is, as once you figure out why it is useful, you are going to abuse this machanic like you just found out the button combination to get free soda in the soda machine at the office. Once that happens, the game loses quite a bit of difficulty. One of many things that really makes up for this is another mechanic, Enchanting, which is really more of a gamble than the actual ""gambling"" mechanic.Another thing I really like about this game are the items obtainable and the playstyles available, FATE wholeheartedly supports the idea of having your cake and eating it too, though various stat selections on leveling up, you can do just about anything, or do everything if you really want to. This is great for me, because I am the type of person that if I get a massive '♥♥♥♥ you' sword, I want a second '♥♥♥♥ you' sword or a superpowered sheild of 'I don't give a ♥♥♥♥'. And the game lets you do that! And I love that about it.All in all, it is a great game if you are looking for something to introduce you to Dungeon Crawling, or if you are looking for something to eat up free time cheaply."

You wouldnt think that was a game-making mechanic but I'm finding myself keeping my favorite fish on hand, spending a lot of time thinking about what eventual permanent change I'd like for him to undergo.The randomly generated dungeons keep from being repetitive by a very small view area and a lot of challenges - you think you're awesome mchero-sauce until you step too far into a big room and pull so many mobs that you run screaming into the darkness like a little pansy.The quests are a little annoying in that you have to pay attention to what level they're sending you to. You can only ""carry"" three quests in a go, so dont clutter up your journal with the one that will make you wait for three whole levels.It's a great little time killer. No story, no maps, no mess."

I'm not seeing it going on sale at anytime but even so, for 5 dollars i think it is an investment you will not regret.

We got it with a whole lot of demos on a computer we bought a long time ago. The demo only lets you go to the 3rd floor of the Dungeon. Time for some personal backstory:It was some time around 2008. I was in Elementary School still. (4th grade I think). I didn't drink enough water on a daily basis, so my bladder got infected. I started to pee blood, so I motioned for my teacher to come out in the hallway while I tell her the embarrasing news. My Mom came and picked me up. We went to my doctor's office (It was sort of like a clinic. It's hard to explain).The doctor took me in, and told me I was going to have to get blood drawn which sent me into a panic. I had never had my blood drawn before, and I HATED needles (What kid doesn't?). So, the Doctor came in with this huge needle and stuck it into my arm. It hurt like crap. Afterwards I was really shaken up, and we ususally got toys or video games after we go to the doctors/dentists (I was into Legos at the time, so I got Lego sets for the dentist). That day, we drove to Walmart, and went to the PC games section.It felt good to pick up that game, and put it into the cart. My mom even let me get some candy on the way out. (Some sour candy. I LOVE sour candy). Of course, I couldn't play it right as I got home. Mom had to do the checking account. So, my brother and I went outside and we sat down on a matress that was sitting outside. (It was out in my Grandma's backyard. My grandma lives right next to us. I live on a farm, btw.)I rushed home soon, and heard that sweet sound the bank software makes when you log out; A really crunchy CHA-CHING!!! So, I sat down and put the disk into the computer. Like I said earleir, it was a long time ago and computers were super slow back in the day. So, I had to wait until the game finished installing.Finally! It finished! Oh, that sweet song that plays at the beginning. Captain O'Kane. That song captures the epicness of this game.The game is called Fate, you know that. You're a young adventurer with your Animal Companion (Dog or cat. You can change it later...). You arrive in the town of Grove, where the entrence to a large dungeon stand, beckoning the daring adventurers in.You start off basic. You don't have any armor, but you do have a hachet. (Axe). I'm going to do a walkthrough on my YouTube channel, so you can get the jist of the starting.You  can fish, too! So I recommend that you buy a fishing rod and fish to your heart's content. You can sell those fish or feed them to your pet. Each fish has different effects. Let's say you feed your pet a fish, and it turns them into a spider!! All the fish you get can turn your animal companion into a Dungeon Creature, but it will stay loyal to you and fight for you.You can chose what kind of skill you want to use. Personally I use the sword and shield the most, but I've used magic and bows too.It's good because you can use Magic and be a swordsman, or use magic and be an archer.  Magic, magic, magic.You can get quests from certain people around town. I strongly suggest you take the quests, because they pay off well.The main goal of the game is to find the boss of the Dungeon (It tells you at the beginning. It's always randomized too), and get rich!I haven't actually gotten that far, but I've been to floor 100 and beyond. Which is almost as good I guess.I STRONGLY recommend this game. It's a steal for $7.99 . I hope you liked this review of it, and be sure to find my channel on YouTube so you can watch gameplay of it, if you're not sure about it. Thanks for reading."

This game was really addicting, and one of my favorites, so when i find out it's on steam, i go crazy, i buy it, and play it for a bit, then stop, and forget about it, but then i pick it back up, play it a ton, then drop it again, for some reason, it wasn't as addicting as it was before, but probably because i have more than just 5 games like i did back then. I would recommend this to anybody that likes RPG's that have replayibiblity to it. Randomized dungeon every new game, many different item types so you can techniclly pick a class, and tons of quests that can played. I love this game, and always will."

Was really frustrating too, because it is actually a fun, addictive little game. So when I noticed a couple days ago that Steam had it, and that it was on sale because it is that time of the year, I jumped on it.I was playing Tl2 for the first time today, and noticed that it is VERY similar to that, there are some differences:-the character is a little chibi child looking thing, and you can only choose between a cat or a dog for a pet (BUT if you get lucky, you find a fish that can permanently change them, or just fish/buy fish that temporarily change them)-this is straight up dungeon crawling, no two games/levels are the same-no actual class picking BUT you can decide to specialize in a certain kind of weapon/magic-single player onlyJust like in Tl2, you can load your pet with things and send them to down to sell the stuff for you. Basic in game hot-buttons and controls are the same. This is basically a very simple, dungeon-crawling Tl2, if you will....but then, at the end of the day, MOST fantasy RPG are basically the same.This is a fun, simple, kinda cute little game, easy to pick up and play (and get lost in and loose track of the time >_< LOL) Great for anyone.

I got sucked in initially by it's subtle charm and my affinity for the genre, but frankly stayed with it to beat the game on a grudge. The loot system is flawed in that the majority of gear is unusable without certain stat requirements -- for example, to wear plate mail you'd literally have to win the game more than once, perhaps several times. That frankly is ludicrous, considering my character was literally defined as a hero of great reknown who was DRIPPING in strength-giving gear and focused on developing strength... what, is plate mail made of depleted uranium in this world? This is just one example... the vast majority of equipment you find or see in stores is reserved for people who (somehow) have the time and facination to remain on the hamster wheel. I hate-played this game just to see what was waiting for me when I finally beat the creature designated to be the target of my adventure... and it was the ""opportunity"" to start all over from the beginning. Bottom line - if you want to play a game like this play Diablo, or Titan Quest, or Path of Exile (which happens to be FREE!) -- those are ALL better games and finer examples of the genre. Barf. Oh, one last thing -- the difficulty scale on this game is literally offensive... it just multiplies (or divides, it would seem) monster hitpoints, and in the case of ""Hero"" difficulty (which I chose expecting a challenge, not a boring punishment) just makes monsters rapidly scale out of reach of being able to keep up with them. It won't make the monsters more challenging, but it WILL turn the entire game into button mashing the potion key while holding the attack button down. Also, most anti-climactic final battle ever -- it basically filled the screen with summons to the point the player cannot remain engaged to one target for more than an instant, making it literally impossible to swing more than three times at the same creature before dying. Luckily there is a (stupid) mechanic in the game that allows you to respawn exactly where you died at the loss of some xp and (mostly pointless) fame, so to beat the boss, (or anything for that matter) you merely need to swing twice before you die where you stand and keep coming back UNTIL you kill enough of the annoying summoners to face off with the boss, and if needed die numerous times to get him as well. Awful. Awful. Awful. If you played the game as a youngster and feel the need to retread this path somehow, be my guest. Those without the benefit of nostalgia have been warned."

At first it is a piece of cake but then as you start getting down lower in the dungeons you will start to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you on a regular basis due to the game sending armies of these creatures at you at the same time, and each time you get killed, you get three choices as to how you want to respawn. The first causes you to lose experience and they will drop you right back where you died. Unfortunately the enemies are still waiting for you and will proceed to gang up on you and beat you to dust where you will become angry and choose choice number two which takes some exp but spawns you on a nearby level. This nearby level could be either levels up, or down, from where you died. The problem with this is that as you make your way back to where you were, the levels are now loaded with powerful enemies, even if you already cleared them,  who will stomp you into mud in no time flat. You will get VERY ANGRY indeed at this game and I predict, unless you are the unusually stubborn type, that you will just leave and never come back again, OR, you will cheat and ruin the experience.

Get a skill point to apply to warrior skill, mage skill or ranged weapon skill - check.   Have a pet - check.  Can transform pet - check.  Use fish to transform pet - check.Use portal scroll to navigate to most recent level and go down a level - check.   Gamble - check.The game itself is good enough, but save yourself the money, go buy Torchlight II.  The latter Torchlight adds a dimension to the gameplay rather than simply grinding thru dungeon levels to satisfy arbitrary hack & slash quests."

The solution that worked for me was to start the game in window-mode and make sure that the window-width and -height (including the border) were small enough to fit inside the screen’s set resolution.To start the game in window-mode go to ""C:\ProgramData\WildTangent\FateSteam\Persistent"" on your computer, open the ""config.dat"" file with Notepad, and change “FULLSCREEN:1” to:FULLSCREEN:0Also, ensure that “WINDOWWIDTH” and “WINDOWHEIGHT” in the config file are set to something that will allow the application window, including the border, to fit within your screen resolution. For example my brother’s screen resolution is 1366x768, so we put our values at:WINDOWWIDTH:1366WINDOWHEIGHT:725For some reason, if the window is set to a size where even the border is to the outside of the screen, it creates a graphical issue where the gameplay is located in a small box to the left corner within the application window.I hope this helps someone else.

I played this game long ago when it first came out, it was nice to revisit the game now as an adult.Overall, the game is decent. Granted its not anything amazing when compared to its predecessors... but back in the day it was quite something. The fun in this game comes from the complete randomness and endless play killing waves of monsters while progressing deeper and trying to get the best set of gear you can.It does have its flaws. Item skill point requirements are not well balanced and can make gearing up early in the game quite difficult. Fishing is almost required to get well geared, and the fishing mechanic is a bit buggy causing you to fail the catch even if you clicked in time to catch it. Perhaps the worst feature however is the chance to completely loose all enchantment on your gear when enchanting, I would not advise enchanting anything that you wouldn't want to lose... because you very well might.I would recommend the game to anyone, it is good for at least 2 playthroughs. I'm not sure its worth the $8 price tag, i picked it up on a sale for much cheaper."

,Recommended,246840,8777771,"Posted: 19 January, 2014",all,Cindare,"FATE is the spiritual predecessor of Torchlight, and it shows.  Mechanics like ""pets carrying loot to town"" were developed right here.  The graphical style is similar, the play style is familiar, and the entire game revolves around procedurally generated quests and dungeons.  If these are the elements of an Action RPG that you enjoy, then do pick up this game and play a little slice of history.  If, however,  you want a thoroughly modern and highly polished experience, then stick with Torchlight 2 or Path of Exile instead.That all said, it has been my experience that most fans of ARPGs have a little bit of retro-gamer in them.  If this describes you, then stop reading this right now and start playing FATE.  It will give that pin-prick of retro style in a package that is just as fun as other ARPGs.The only detractors for me are the lack of any sort of skill tree system, or anything else that truly differentiates one play style from another.  While it is true that FATE's character progression is intendedly more organic than a class-based game like Diablo 2 (and succeeds, as far as it goes), it comes off as retrograde as compared to character progression in a more modern game like Torchlight 2 or even Diablo 3.Bottom line: If you enjoy Action RPGs, then pick this up on sale.

Don't be fool by my game time i played it like for more than 12 hours and finished it. Fate is a simple and old game, it's a really fun dungeon crawler game.The NPCs gives 1-3 level high quest depending on what dungeon level you are on, which is really convenient if you are heading to the main quest dungeon. The bad part about it is that once you've reach a dungeon level you can't get the quest in the dungeon you are in or any dungeon below your current dungeon you've explored, some quest have normal rewards but others have item rewards, but in this case you can manage the quest that you wanted to do even though it is limited.The monsters in every level is different and they have different types of attacks, if you're making a summoner build you are going to die... a lot... so its best to cover up your character weaknesses.One of the best part in this game is that you are able to turn your pet into a monster( not like slime, goblin or anything that has 2 hands and 2 legs) by feeding him fish, the fish you fed to your pet have a duration of how long your pet can be turned into a monster, you can turn your pet into a monster permanently if you want. And yes you can go fishing in the game in town or in the dungeon if you're lucky you can get rare items just by fishing.Finally the skills in the game, there is no skill perk trees just old fashion Str, Dex, Vit and Int. But instead of a skill tree you can spend points on Weapon skills, Critical strike, Spell cast time, Attack spell level, Defence spell level and Charm spell level. You can use magic too, you can choose to buy them from a NPCs or explore the dungeon for it.9/10 my childhood is complete"

At 20 years old, I still enjoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the games I loved when I was 10. FATE is one of those games.The graphics may leave some to be desired, but are not horrible for its age. The gameplay is spot on. Feeding your pet, having the pet go to town and sell stuff for you is a really cool feature. Combat is wonderful, no matter what style. I play using spellcasting/dual wielding tactics. I summon minions to take on the extra trash and tank for me, buff my pet and myself, and melee the mobs. It's quite a blast :) The story is actually pretty damn cool. I highly reccomend this game for anyone. It's challenging on higher difficulty, and easy enough for little kids on the easier ones. It's just downright, good ol' semi-cute dungeon-crawly fun. For 8 bucks, you can't pass this up. It's definitely worth it to get the bundle, too. Hell, get all the sequels, they're all killer :)"

Made a few years earlier, it incorporates a number of things that Torchlight did, particularly the use of the pet as both a beast of burdon and as an ally which is transformable by fish.  It has randomly generated dungeons, which is always nice, and has been produced well.That said, I am finding it a bit boring.  As a fighter specialising in swords, I've found most of the drops to be magic-geared, or aimed at axe-wielders.  I'd say about 95% of the drops are of no interest to me at all, and this tends to make hacking your way through the levels a bit monotonous.I'm also finding it annoying that it is all too easy to die in the game, especially if you're focusing on what's happening on-screen.  The warning that health is low seems to come too late, so you end up having to divide your attention between the fighting and supervising the health bar.  The pet also seems to spend about 50% of its time fleeing.My last moan is that the resolution doesn't seem adjustable, and I'm finding that I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more and with more detail - many of the characters seem rather large and chunky, as though this game was aimed at kids.All said though, the game is cheap enough, and I bought my copy during a sale.  If you like RPGs, give it a go."

The gameplay can be of an extremely repetitive nature, so if you expect a brand new and unique challege each time you turn the game on, you're never going to get it, the game deals it's hand very early on."

If you want to play through without back-tracking that's possible too.You also have a ""pet""; and this pet fills the role of protecter and Mule very well. You can, apparently, upgrade your pet by feeding it but I've yet to get that far.Very fun game so far. I will update review as I make progress. I bought this game for $8, and it's cash well spent!Rivscore 88/ 100"

But it is an aquired taste.The graphics on this game are bad, but I don't care because that what I remember most about this game. What it looked like. The music is soothing in the town, but as soon as you step into the dungeon, the music makes your skin crawl.The gameplay is simple. Go to a certain level of the dungeon, kill the boss, done. Easy, simple, and to the point. The coolest thing by far about this game though comes after you complete the game.You have 2 options: Retirement (which means you dont play the hero anymore, but you do get to make a descendent character that you can give one of your items from you old character to.) and Deep Delving (where you explore A 2 FOKING BILLION LEVEL DUNGEON!!!!!) This game is replayable as all hell, and it's not only nostalgic to me when I played it at the age of 5, but it is really good, and doesn't steal your wallet away(gaben).This game was also the base design for Torchlights 1 and 2.

I've always enjoyed playing this game from time to time, but I'd always have to restart, so with this finally on Steam and my account, I no longer have to worry about such things!If you're going to get FATE, I'd suggest getting all four games as you'll be able to transfer your character from the previous game into the new game, which is a bit like Mass Effect. On top of that, get it off here (Steam), and play relax a bit as you play it on and off. Eventually, you will evovle into a very powerful hero and will be able to look back at all of the things you've gone through."

Get deeper in the dungeon and find more items and treasure.It's a bit annoying that you loose levels, when you die and then you have to find the point, where you died to retrieve your things again.

,Recommended,246840,10441688,"Posted: 12 June, 2014",all,A Choice of Chicken,"Pros:+ Classic, fun dungeon-crawling gameplay.+ Countless hours of gameplay.+ A hefty amount of replay value.Mehs (possible cons and possible pros):== It's pretty much a relic of a game. The graphics, animations, etc. fit with its original release date.== The dungeon crawler experience in general can get a bit repetitive after so many hours. It doesn't vary a whole lot.== It lacks any sort of co-op gameplay. I personally believe that would've been a fun addition to the Steam version of the game.== They removed cheat codes from the game. You can still edit data files to cheat, however. Look it up if you're interested.== You need a lot of spare time on your hands to actually beat the game. When I say a lot, I mean a sh*t load.Cons:- Distasteful use of a semi-permadeath mechanic. Dying can really break you in differentiating ways, such as losing all of your gold, your experience, your place in the dungeon, or your fame. Considering how frequently you can die on even normal mode, you may end up just dropping the game."

Actually, the demo of this game was my first RPG, and let me tell you I sunk hundreds of hours into the demo alone. You could probably find better games of this nature out today (some of the developers of this game went on to make Torchlight and Torchlight II), but if you don't mind an older dungeon crawler with an infinite amount of procedurally generated content (for dungeon levels, item names and stats; you won't find wonky No Man's Sky creations wandering the levels of the dungeon) to sink some time in to, I highly recommend this game. If you want to play a simple addicting game that doesnt require you learn all the ins and outs of ""damage per second"" and secondary ""elemental"" damage systems then this is what you're looking for. On the off chance that you're a parent looking for a game for their kid to play, maybe to start them on RPGs, this would be a good start, with lovable characters, cute pets, and nothing too frightening for young eyes this game is fantastic."
