For the second time.Update - October 31, 2015:Another six months passed and this game is still in an unknown state. I just found out that a gaming website called AbsoluteGaming made aninterviewwith the new developers. According to that interview the PC release is planned for 'early 2016'. They also said that DLCs are planned, and that online matches will be limited to four players, which is pretty disappointing.Something I really don't like is how these new developers also don't seem to give a f*** about the people here on Steam. No communication with us at all, zero, nada. Recruits is still flagged as an Early Access game, but isn't the point of Early Access to let people play the game in an early state and get feedback? Seems like they just code away and don't care if their potential changes to the game are actually welcome by the people who already bought it.Update - May 5, 2015:A user namedmcabralsaid on theforumthat development is being continued 'from now' and that they (QUByte Interactive, a Brazilian game studio) will announce their 'partnership with Commotion Games'.According to theirwebsitethey are also working on ports for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U.Original review - April 8, 2015:Looked very promising, but the developers decided to abandon it at pretty much the first possible opportunity.Also, as usual, Valve doesn't give a frak and is still selling this abandonware."

,Recommended,246880,11498721,"Posted: 31 July, 2014",all,[|||] Magnum Force,"Gotto say,This game had me there for a second.. The controls are swift and the enemies are fast; so are their bullets.Basically, ""Recruits"" is a lot like ""Cannon Fodder"", but a lot more unforgiving. You have to learn to aim fast and steady while outrunning enemy bullets.Besides some basic gameplay elements which I think are kind of missing, the foundation is solid and deadly.I think it could be best described as a mix between ""Cannon Fodder"" and a breeze of ""Soldiers - Heroes of World War 2"" and a lot like ""Running with Rifles"" with nice graphics; because it's fast, easy to learn and hard to master.Although the game can be prety entertaining it can also be very frustrating. For instance when you're playing a jungle map you can't rotate the camera to look around. It seems to be fixed at a certain angle. (Facing North). Maybe I overlooked something, but if they don't fix this, well, that could be a major killer, because that small feature made sure that I died many times.Also, some things seem to be just scripted. Like: approach enemy, shoot, he throws grenade, even if he's dead already. Seems a bit off to me and kills the stealth factor.But, due to the fact that this is an early access game, I have high hopes for it.So far what I've seen is good and solid."

,Recommended,246880,11504507,"Posted: 1 August, 2014",all,Terhazul,"Do you remember cannon fodder ? Of course you do. If you liked that game you might like this one to.Its a topdown squad shooter game. It has nice graphics and good controls. Overall its a really good game with lots of potential.But.. yeah there are plenty of buts in this game. The AI is in this game leaves plenty to the imagination. Your own squad AI consist of shooting you in the back or the other AI in the squad. And the enemy AI move like squads and throws grenades and shoots at you instead of their own and they are pretty accurate with their guns.You can give your AI soldiers commands but they hardly ever work like they should and the AI get stuck quite often in trees or pallets.In this version we get to try jungle warfare, flying a chopper and driving a tank and even stealth elements.So it got very much potential in form of maps/gameplay but then again the AI strikes. When flying a chopper or driving a tank the AI doesnt do much since you just wreck the place yourself pretty much godmode. The stealth mission the AI get stuck in the fence, rocks, trees yeah well i think the rolled themselves in glue before the mission. And in the first jungle mission you can rush like rambo until your AI shoots you in the back.But if you dont mind the broken AI and perhaps play with your friends instead, when this options will work i'm sure the game will be freaking awesome just like cannon fodder was back in the day.So to finsih it upPros:+Its cannon fodder HD+Solid Gameplay+Nice maps+Tanks/ChoppersCons:-AI-AI-AI-AI"
,Not Recommended,246880,14023129,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Bartender,I've sat down and played this well over 20 times and can't seem to do it for more than 10 minutes at a time.This game looks extremely promising at first glance. It can be an O.K. experience if you take 1 or 2 squad members ALONE on a single mission and try to ninja them through by using the physics engine against the enemy. You cannot really play this game to an extent that seems rewarding or fun..yet.. Granted it is in Alpha...The real reason I cannot recommend this game is because along with all of the problems it has and lack of content- Overall the developers do not release updates often and their own status within the community is taking the hit.I have lost trust in these developers until steady updates start again. They were doing well about 6 months ago. Too bad.7.4/10 for the first 5minutes- quickly turns into a -5/10 thereafterEDIT:: Another 5 months has gone by and still no updates. Officially considered dead now... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY

Slowly walked up the camp perimeter and opened up with a burst from my M16. Two bad guys were immediately downed. Little did I know that the little wooden shed next to me was home to apparently 20 million more bad guys. Two of my squad were immediately cut down from the staggering return fire and I directed my squad to hide behind a rock as I did my best to dodge the bursts of fire the enemy were directing at me. Seeing I had no options left and that the enemy was keeping the remnants of my squad surpressed while another was working our flank, I elected to fall back to extraction and live to fight another day.10/10 Amazing game.The only major technical gripe I have with this game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of resources that get allocated to it."

,Not Recommended,246880,11499628,"Posted: 31 July, 2014",all,The Symposium,"Honestly this game has a lot of potential and the graphics are surprisingly good but that's about where it stops in the positive aspects of the game.  The A.I. is potpourri of randomness, your recruits can behave intelligently or act as dumb as a sack of rocks while the enemy is the latter, period, your teammates will also shoot you in the back of the neck because of how you treated them in boot camp and general it feels as if I have no control over them, not to mention that privates will die in literally one hit.  Also the inconsistency of the game is an issue for me, a grenade 10 feet away can blow up a shack but the exploding barrels inches away can't blow up the same target, in keeping on topic with the barrels all of the enemies seem to be wearing their flak jackets and ballistic face masks because many will stand right next to a barrel and get hit by the explosion and walk away like nothing ever happened.  The melee function is non-existent but the animation is.  On one run-through of a mission, one of my soldiers started piggy-backing me and when I switched to that soldier, the game crashed, no time for fun and games while on a mission it seems.In short, a load of potential but very buggy currently.  I cannot recommend it at this stage but if the various bugs and current state of the game does not bother you, I say go for it and support these developers.EDIT: Contrary to what many are saying, you can literally run in guns blazing with one man and win the mission, I've done it on Jungle, Stealth, Village, and Survival."

Would no longer recommend.Old: It seems like everyone and their mother has to remind people about this, despite it being pretty damned obvious, but this game is Early Access, which means:#Discussions_QuoteBlock_Author“At the moment, the game features the core mechanics that will be present in the game. Both Single Player and Multiplayer are available in basic form so that the community can give us further feedback on what areas to focus on.”Now thats over with, whats the game like?Enjoyable, even at this early stage. It feels like a less refined, barebones (except it has vehicles) Cannon Fodder and, in honesty, is essentially a homage to it in almost every way, right down to the unsuccessful mission music, the 'honor' list for lost soldiers, the gore, generally the way the game is played (Grenading houses to destroy them and stop them spawning soldiers!)The Ai IS rubbish, but if you are relying on your squad Ai when you can control the squad independently, you're doing it wrong. I found my first few play throughs ended in disaster and frustration until I figured out that I could switch between soldiers (keys 1-4) and move them around independently (the trick is to give them a 'Move to' command so they move somewhere and wait until you switch to them or request a 'Regroup').The issues right now are, as stated, the Ai is rubbish, there are some little bugs with triggers (I don't seem to be able to completed Mission 3 right now), the occasional lag when something intensive happens (crashing a Hue in to an AA gun), and some missing refinement/features which is to be expected at this stage of the game. Saying something like this at such an early stage is a bit redundant I feel, but replayability is a bit thin, limited to a handful of play throughs for each mission - You can approach each play slightly differently, I just hope they add some kind of progression or choice so that you can complete each mission in varied and interesting ways.Whats fun about the game? The game lets you play what is essentially a modern Cannon Fodder but allowing you to be loads more tactical, the addition of vehicles is nice and gives it a 'Toy Soldiers' or 'Soviet Strike' feel and the graphics are pretty enough, the gore is nicely overdone as are the explosions.You might be worried that this is riding on nostalgia, and that is justified especially with what I've said about the game, but for  £7 you'd have to have serious doubts not to grab a copy.I've played 89 minutes so far and that is enough for me to recommend this game, at this time, at this price point."
