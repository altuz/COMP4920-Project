Just wait until you see how disappointed they are when you waste your life playing a video game that simulates being a janitor, while sitting in a messy room in real life. Soul crushing disappointment...100% complete update:I enjoyed this game when it was in EA, but I really fell in love with it when I came back to play the release version. The core mechanics are basically the same, but the details were greatly improved. Each map is unique and interesting and it can be approached as a bunch of individual missions or as part of a larger narrative thread. I really can't recommend this game if you are looking for a chill out game or if you are very meticulous. It's not a game for everyone because there isn't any action or enemies, but it's a delightfully unique puzzle-esque game.This is one of the few games that I wasn't ready to shelve once I 100%'d the achievements and am keeping it installed to hop in occasionally."

Did you ever wonder who the heck's gonna clean up after these heroes?The answer has finally been provided by the developers of VCD, and the answer --- is you.There is no story.  There is you.  There is a mop.  There is a bucket of water.  You have no idea who is responsible for the carnage; you only know it's your task to clean up after it.For such a strange idea for a game, the developers have really outdone themselves in my opinion.  They have taken an idea that likely only tugs at the corner of the minds of .01% of the total FPS-gaming population and made a game out of it.  They've made a game that seems incredibly boring actually fun.As a Janitor for the Viscera Cleanup Detail company, each facility you visit must be painstakingly mopped; all the trash must be picked up; and all the body parts must be incinerated.  How you complete this task is up to you, but that facility had better be spotless when your supervisors arrive, or you risk losing your job (and that's actually an Achievement).After completing a facility, you return to your ""office,"" and can read reports on your progress.  These reports vary from employee commendations to tongue-in-cheek company newsletters, and really add to the experience.  You are also able to take ""trophies"" with you should you so choose by placing them in the blue trunk that you take with you to each job.People who don't enjoy ironic humor, or never played an FPS, should stay well away.  But if you love watching the gibs fly on any contemporary FPS game; or even enjoyed the pixelated trips down Memory Lane of DOOM or Duke Nukem 3D;  or even the bump-mapped polygons of Unreal and Half-Life, this is a must-have in your collection.  You already blew the place to smithereens; didn't you mom teach you pick up after yourself?"

So I'm just going to wing it.It's long, it's boring, it's dull; and that's explicitly why I love it.This is not a game about shooting, bleeding, goring, slashing, looting, any of that; this is a game about cleaning after all the aforementioned has been said and done..You're not a space marine, you're a space janitor.There are multiple tools, water buckets (which will dirty as you clean off your mop in it, don't spill it either or it'll make a bigger mess), brooms (only efficient for sweeping tiny things), sniffers (to find missed messes though these can be turned off), stationary incinerators (how you get rid of garbage), wastebaskets (to put the garbage in to carry it) and maybe one or two other things I'm forgetting at the moment.There's something cathartic, something calming about this game and others like it that completely break the status-quo because they try to simulate what is ultimately mundane and boring, but in a game format.You're not getting shot at, you're not getting killed, there's no real threat (as far as I'm aware) on any of the levels; just you, your mop, and whatever level of determination you have to actually get the job done.The maps will tell you an estimated time they take to complete, and boy can they actually take HOURS to get done, which is why it's nifty there's a co-op feature so you can call in your friends to expediate the process.Graphics wise, it looks very nice and is very well optimized.So, if you want a good looking, boring game about cleaning up bloody messes, then this is definitely the game for you!Post Edit:Please don't add me and expect me toA) Buy the game for you.B) Play with you.You would think this would be common sense but it apparently isn't."

You've heard of first person shooter games?  Well, folks, this is a first person cleaner game; the shooting has happened, the world is saved, and you are the janitorial staff tasked with cleanup.   I have never hated saviors of mankind as much as I have while picking up their discarded ammo casings and fixing bullet holes in the walls.Reasons why it's great for co-op:1.  The satisfaction you and your friends get when seeing actual progress in transforming the unique environment of the game you're playing.  Seriously, this sounds weird, but we feel great seeing what we had to work with and what we made it into.  I never expected to enjoy playing the game as much as I did and I was shocked at how much fun the friends I gave my four pack to liked it.2.  Hearing them argue about the best methods to dispose of a body (record for blackmail later!).3.  Seeing them walk into a room, look up, and exclaim, ""Oh god...HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!""Early Access Tips:Remember, if you play the game now, it's not going to be at its best.  Early access means it's rough and there's definitely some code optimization and collision detection going on that can be frustrating (and sometimes funny as hell) to work with.When hosting a game, it's a direct connect type.  So make sure the person hosting has a pretty decent computer and a solid internet connection.  If you can't connect to their sever, they may need to setup port forwarding.  The ports used by this game are 7777 and 27015If you get a ""too many actors"" error message on your server, it means there's too many unique items.  This can happen from tracking too many player bloody footprints around.  Happened a lot when we were doing a 4-man cleanup team.  To solve this, have someone get rid of all the ammo casings on the ground (pick up and drop in the incinerator) and the rest of the group should focus on getting a specific area of floor clean.  Of all blood and gore.   To prevent this from happening (until it gets fixed) try making little clear footpaths to all the necessary machines (incinerator & bucket maker)."

Or you try and slam dunk buckets into an incinerator and one gets stuck in the rafters, so you have to start stacking crates to get up there. My mate Charlie even got so into it that he started doing sick tricks like putting buckets on the heads of corpses and doing live puppet shows for us with them.

To quickly summarize, it's basically a game where you clean up the aftermath of your average old-school FPS level/sci-fi movie mishap. Mopping up blood, burning the remains of gored aliens etc. It's a game almost certainly born from a joke, but it's execution certainly isn't one. You're given a variety of cleaning implements to perform your job, from things as low-tech as a simple, if slightly stylized mop to as futuristic as a laser gun that can mend bullet holes, and actually doing a thorough job takes an understanding of all the gadgets on your toolbelt.It's bizarrely relaxing, and perfect for doing things like listening to podcasts or audiobooks over. Much like the games it lampoons there's also plenty of fun secrets to find, including a bunch of momentos you can take back to your office at Aerospace Sanitation and put on display. Speaking of your office, even it has secrets to discover! There's even a sort of larger narrative one can slowly piece together across the game's many levels if they take the time to really search every nook and cranny. It's a lot of fun. This all comes from someone who played the game entirely single player, so I can't speak to the funcitionality or fun factor of the multiplayer personally, but having seen the YouTuber Criken's video on it, I get the impression it's a blast, whether your friends are actually interested in cleaning or not.Overall, I'd very much recommend Viscera Clean-Up detail."

With that out of the way, RuneStorm's drudgery simulator is bloody good fun.  Taking on the role of the poor fool who has to clean up the mess the hero left behind him, your basic kit is a mop, though you can also get a broom if you see one, plus a bucket and a bin.  As a sandbox game it also does a good job of simulating worker boredom in a way that's far from boring for the player.  If anyone's ever done a really dull, manual job with no redeeming features, you'll sympathize with the Space Janitor as he scatters boxes, abuses the spot welder by melting random stuff, makes amusing piles of body parts, writes on the floor with the blood on his boots... all that good stuff.  When you're not incinerating things that don't belong to you and treading blood into the carpet, you can also steal stuff via your special Janitor's Trunk.  For every Rambo and Ripley out there, you'll find an army of long-suffering Space Janitors armed with nothing more deadly than a mop, rolling their eyes and tutting as they get down to the real work.  Go on, give them a hand.  They need all the help they can get."

Based solely on the fact that you cannot meander about doing a bit of one thing, and a bit of another; You have to have a strategy on the order in which you do things. You can, and will spend an hour or two on one level- if you let yourself go that far.""This sounds like a commitment."" I hear you say, and yes! It is- and it has to be one that you find enjoyable in order to truly appreciate the subtle fun that this game has to offer.*This game is fun, because it offers a challenge that current games lack: Self management, and to an extent- self control.You will not have some computerized message on-screen to tell you: ""Pick up the body parts first"" or ""Mop a path to the incinerator and bucket dispenser in order to minimize bloody footprints"" you learn these things as you go, and you have to be willing to experiment, and keep an open mind in order to succeed.So, on a closing note- if you like experimenting with processes, as well as organizing yourself in a productive manner- then congratulations! You'll likely enjoy this game a lot!If you're more the sort who likes to make a mess of things, and loves playing with body parts, and spilling buckets of blood everywhere, then you'll still like the game, but you'll likely get bored of it quicker, and lose friends over playing hockey with an intestine."

Those of you who've played the gory games like Dead Space, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, will maybe have once joked that you don't envy whoever has to clean the mess up that you, in those games, makes.Turns out that is EXACTLY the case in VCD. YOU are the shmuck who got sent to the blood-drenched space station AFTER the Bald McAngry Spacemarine protagonist of another adventure had passed through. YOU are the poor sod who has to pick up all the limbs, the guts, the organs, all of it. YOU are the janitorial staff hired to clean up after the incidents.That is what makes it so oddly satisfying and brilliant all at once. There is no big bad enemy bosses, there is no universe to save, there is no multi-level demon destroying slaughter. There is only you, and the aftermath of the previous examples. Something had happened here, judging by the abundance of guts and trash and casings...but that isn't what you're paid to think about, really. You're cleaning up after the story has happened.The levels are quite diverse, ranging from a trashy, smelly waste disposal area to an entire digsite or even a zero gravity chamber, all of them filled to the brim with things that need mopped up or incinerated or both. Some even have their own unique gimmick, such as the Sandtraps of Unearthly Excavation that can be fed items, though it may just regurgitate other items and cause further mess.The game is somewhat passive aggressive in it's design. Your automated waterbucket dispenser can jam and sometimes spew out bodyparts, which can make a mess. Or your Biohazard Bin dispenser can spew out some gibs...which needs cleaned up as well. The game does it's best to let you know that your job is grisly. You will need to take bloody buckets to be incinerated, you will need more buckets to mop up a spilled bucket. You'll need bins to carry all that viscera to the incinerators too...but that might just make more mess if you spill any.It becomes oddly satisfying to turn a gory scene entirely on it's head. Make everything nice again, put it together, organize boxes. Do well enough and you'll be promoted. Do even better and you'll get an Employee of the Month award! The 'feedback' given to you outside of Speedrun mode gives the game little snippets of flavor. If you do well, you'll receive a meaningless promotion with very minute and insignificant changes to your lifestyle, such as a 5% salary increase, or a slightly bigger locker. Of course, your colleagues begin to hate you for this, because then the company expects higher performance from them too. This has no real changes evident in gameplay, but you CAN collect multiple Employee of the Month awards to decorate your office with...All in all, VCD is still Early Access but hell, if it can make a strangely tedious job like janitorial work satisfying in a weird way, money well spent.Also if you see Bob, notify security immediately."

Blood gets into carpets.There is something very satisfying about this game.  It appeals to the sense of accomplishment.  We all feel down now and then, and this game hits on that nerve.  We're offered the afrtermath of a slaughter and need to clean it up.  And when we do clean it up, we get this great sense of accomplishment, eventhough only virtually.

Starting some of the maps feel like you've been dropped into the middle of a pacific oil spill with a pack of tissues and a bucket of good intentions, but that just makes it all the more pleasing to see the level be transformed as you work away at it like the gameplay equivalent of trying to get a gobstopper to fit in your mouth comfortably by licking away at it until your tongue bleeds.The graphics are surprisingly great, and there's more to it than just mopping up messes and carting out bodies. You get bonuses for repairing level specific objects and stacking things in the right loading areas, or by using a welding gun to melt an eldritch tentacle into a single cauterized blob for easy transport. (That is a real tactic)You can really be very tactical/logical about the whole thing, and for some people - myself included - many hours of slow methodical not-quite-work is a wonderful way of spending the time.The levels are all interesting and distinct; from the enemies to the colours used in the lighting. There's a bunch of references and homages to horror and scifi throughout the game, and plenty of easter eggs, some you can even take with you to your office to start a trophy room. You're absolutely as much a traveller as a Janitor, it pays to be observant!Music is...interesting. Apparently Polka really takes off in the future.Workshop support is icing on the corpse. They even give you a copy of UDK to do your own things, no messing around with loading packages, it all works right from the menu.Only problem I can see with it is multiplayer isn't especially user-friendly - I've never been on a multiplayer server since the browser doesn't work too good.

You will knock over buckets of blood, your waste bins will glitch out with dismembered, break dancing feet and throw all that trash you picked up everywhere.

This game is not full of inventory menus, you don't go up to an incinerator, click it and select which items go on like in Minecraft. This game operates on physics yo, and since that's case, you have to pick things up, orient them, carry and place them carefully wherever you need them.It takes strategy, skill and patience to beat this.

Went, ""Ehhh,"" and gave it a shot. Played through it twice in a row, eight hours over the course of two days. Holy crap, it was good. SO good that I HAD to buy the full game.Why is it so good, you ask? It's the most unique game I've ever played. Almost hypnotic when it comes to starting the game, grabbing a bin and bucket, and just turning off your brain for a while.

Earn an Employee of the Month award plaque? It's oddly amazing for something as tedious and downright repetitive as cleaning. But it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.And I didn't even get into its morbid sense humor. The way you find body parts everywhere, little notes from people who used to work in these facilities you're cleaning, and countless other tiny (and not so tiny) details lends itself to some of the most memorable humor I've seen in quite some time.

Perhaps you can even get paid a bonus for good cleaning so you can purchase improved cleaning products, or a discarded weapon the hero dropped like a flamethrower to help remove those pesky bodies.

I'm so funny)Viscera Cleanup Detail is a simulator-esque game in which you are put in the position of a ""hygien technician"" (or Janitor for you simple folk). You are given the task of cleaning up several rooms of a sci-fi scene where there has been a tragic and gory disaster. You must wipe the floors, walls and even ceilings which are coated in blood and dirt with body parts scattered amongst the mess.My expierence of this game is minor but impacted. Although I might not have had this game for long, I seem to have grown quite fond to it. Although, while I was mopping up giblets, I thought ""Why is a game about being a janitor of all things so intriguing?"" and you may be asking that yourself, reader. I find that this game is great and fun to play because it something different aswell as being relaxing. (apart from the odd moments when you spill a dirty bucket or break a light, then♥♥♥♥♥♥gets frustrating)We as gamers are used to running around gunning aliens and opponents to death, leaving a trail of destruction and gore in our path but with Viscera Cleanup Detail, we see how the person who has to clean up after us feels. We are put on the other side of the fence with VCD. Also, as I've stated, it's very relaxing compared to the fast-paced, time-limited shooters most of us play on a regular basis. Not to mention that VCD is very self-rewarding when you get to your office and see that you've left the previous area perfectly spick and span.In summary: I thoroughly recommend this game because of it's calming vibe, difference and it's ability to transform something so mundane into something appealing and fun to play."

Why would I want to be a space janitor?"" And first of all, that's Space Sanitation Professional to you. Second, this game is a ton of fun. More fun than it has any right to be. Especially if you play with friends.In this Space Custodian simulator you play as part of the lowly sanitation crew for an evil corporation in the far future, and you're tasked with cleaning up the messes left behind by horrible plant experiments, alien attacks, mutations gone wrong, etc. You know, normal custodial things. You are the guy who cleans up the mess after the hero of a sci-fi FPS has killed all the bad guys and left. Many of the levels are homages to sci-fi movies (like The Thing or Event Horizon), books (like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea), and games (like Half-Life). The game is very tongue and cheek, and that's not just because body parts keep coming out of the bucket dispenser. Easter eggs (some literal) and macabre humor abound.How does the gameplay work? You are tasked with paying proper respect to the deceased (throwing their bodies in the incinerator), picking up garbage, bullet shells, organs, etc, mopping up blood, getting rid of bullet holes, and more. You have several machines that dispense tools, like water buckets and boxes for trash, all of which eventually end up in the incinterator, and a laser gun for getting rid of bullet holes and burning up uncooperative flora and fauna. There are no enemies in the game, but that doesn't mean your teamates won't find ways to get you killed. Everything from explosives to pushing your teammates into environmental traps, to setting up the turret that doesn't like people when no one was looking... Even walking into someone with too much garbage in your crate can get someone killed - the physics engine, like in most simulator games, is pretty wonky, but it isn't a bug, it's definitely a feature.This game is a ton of fun to play with friends, and it is both simple enough to pick up quickly, and involved enough to keep you coming back. I find that game both relaxing to play when you get into a cleaning groove, and hilarious when you and your friends are finding new ways to sabatoge each others efforts. Even in the best of situations you end up creating an even bigger mess than when you started, but it is very satisfying to gradually whittle away at it until you are finished. There is also a ton of content. I'm twenty hours in, and even though I've replayed a few levels I'm still not all the way through the main game, and there seems to be a ton of fan created content. A great co-op game, I would totally clean up the horrible experiment gone wrong and hide all the evidence before the space police arrive for my evil corporate overlords again."

I expected it to catch my attention for a couple hours at most before it got old, but I found that it's less about the novelty and more about the experience.Have you ever needed to occupy yourself with something that could help you wind down and relax? This game is perfect for just that, even when you end up spilling blood and guts all over the cargo bay. There's a certain charm in putting in the time to accomplish such menial tasks while also feeling like you're working toward something - nothing compares to the feeling when you look back on a corridor and it's sparkling clean when an hour ago it was covered in blood.I normally don't find the idea of cleaning entertaining, but I do find it relaxing, and Viscera Cleanup Detail manages to bring both entertainment and relaxation together in a way that really helps me forget about things for a while."

A clever and amusing reversal of roles, you find yourself cleaning up the mess left behind after terrible experiments gone wrong, alien attacks, etc. Put down the gun, and pick up the mop. The controls lend themselves to making silly mistakes and more of a mess, and while intentional it can get a little frustrating sometimes as you're trying to clean the place.

,Recommended,246900,22315015,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,Misery,"First, to get it out of the way, I'm a bit more familiar with the game than my small-ish number of hours with it might have you believe.  I first played this elsewhere.  I hate having to point that out in reviews, but you know how it is...Anyway, Viscera Cleanup Detail... you know, this kinda reminds me of back when Harvest Moon came out on the SNES, a million years ago.  I saw that game, wondered ""This is a game about farming... how could this be any fun?"", but tried it myself anyway, and, well... suffice it to say, THAT series has been around for a long, long time now.  It's kinda like that; a game that seems like a fantastically stupid idea on paper, but it just works anyway.Or is it a stupid idea?  Games like this have been popular lately; things like Euro Truck Simulator, or Farming Simulator, or various other things of that nature, those games pop up and end up being pretty popular.  This game is a bit along those lines, except that it's taking a realistic job (janitor) and putting it in a not-so-realistic location (bloody sci-fi environments filled with exploded space nerds).The basic idea is simple:  You know all those violent 3D FPS games where you're exploding a bazillion monsters, robots, or evil jerks, with blood and bullets going all over the place?  Well, in this game, THAT stuff already happened.  It's over.  And YOU are the one called in to then clean up the mess.And boy, what a mess it is!  There is a TON of blood and gore and other mysterious fluids.  It's all over the place.  Not to mention all of the spent bullet casings, random broken things, smashed up equipment, randomly strewn junk, garbage... the amount of things that need to be dealt with in each level will seem extremely daunting when you first enter a given level.  You really have your work cut out for you!In order to avoid getting fired, you have to be very meticulous.  You want to try to clean PERFECTLY, if you can... not missing a single spot with your Space Mop (TM) or variety of other tools (including a laser welder gun, which has various entertaining uses).  You have to use the tools you always have with you, combined with objects that need to be carried around, such as buckets, bins, lights, and other things, and also special machines stationed around the map.  Machines such as bucket/bin dispensers (sometimes also known as ""severed limb 3D printers that occaisionally malfunction and give you a bucket or bin instead""), special vending machines, a big metal lift thing, and of course the all-important incinerator, the final destination for... basically everything.  And a big purple boom-box with a ton of selectable music which vibrates out of control if set to full volume and can set off nearby explosives and such(....what?).  You'll see what I mean if you mess with that thing too much, it appears in every level.  Just dont say I didnt warn you.But that's not all!  For bonus points, there's other things you can do too.  Feel like playing a bit of a CSI role?  Well you can!  Try to piece together what happened in each area, and more importantly, exactly how each person died.  Is a particular corpse leaning against a bloody wall, with a bunch of bullet holes nearby?  Well then, he was probably shot to death.  That's a very simple example, some others are... a bit more confusing. There's some where you'll look at some guy (or what's left of him) and go ""...what in the funky hell happened to this guy?"". But it's fun to try to figure them out, and each dead guy has a name associated with them, and you can stick their USB things (each corpse has one) into the machine to fill out an optional report detailing just what happened to the poor guy.  Get it right (or mostly right, you're expected to give your ""best estimate"" and ARENT required to be absolutely 100% perfect when writing up your report, but you want to try to be as accurate as you can) and you'll get a bit of a bonus.   There are a variety of ways to get such bonuses, which can be used to make up for small messes that you might miss.That all of course is if you're playing the game properly... you also, of course, have the option of just flinging stuff around and making a bigger mess, or doing things like that.  Detailed physics and all.  And that's part of what makes the game what it is, is some of the wacky things that might happen at any given moment.  Even when you're really playing properly and trying to do your best, well... sometimes, that's when some of the funniest things might happen (it's always most hilarious if it's spontaneous and unexpected, after all).  Maybe you're transporting a huge bunch of biohazard bins filed with gory bits down an elevator, and the elevator gives a bit of a nasty jolt when it reaches the bottom, and suddenly... it's raining gibs!  Or you might knock over a light and suddenly things are on fire, or stuff just goes flying all over the place, or... well, you'll have to see for yourself some of the things that can happen.One thing about the game though, to me, is that it's relaxing.  I think this might be one of the most attractive things about the ""simulator"" type games; it's nice to have something that's very different from the usual violent action games for once, something that's actually calm (yet still often hilarious).  And this game does that very well (and if something frustrating DOES happen, you are definitely able to grab and fling random things around in great frustration, as seen in one of the game's trailers).  And actually managing to 100% every level takes quite alot of work and is actually pretty hard.  And there's an overall story that's out there to find concerning a certain janitor that came before you, and.... well, I dont want to spoil that too much.  A hint though, start out by exploring your office a bit first before jumping into the main levels.  Some of the things you can find in there are.... interesting.  If you can figure out how to get through the doors, that is.Lastly, the levels themselves are VERY well made, with incredible detail and a bazillion things to interact with.  LOTS to do in each, and hidden stuff to find.  Oh, and the graphics are utterly fantastic.  I dont normally bother talking about graphics... as I'm the sort that'll happily sit there with an ancient Atari 2600 for hours... but sometimes they are worth talking about, and in this game, the spectacular visuals are a great added bonus.  The game is gorgeous. But you'll want a pretty beefy machine if you're going to max it out.Oh, and it comes with a level editor, and Steam Workshop compatibility.Overall, sure, the game isnt going to be for everyone.  This sort of game never is. If you've always thought that the ""simulator"" sorts of games were nothing but stupid jokes, this isnt the game for you.  But for those that like this sort of thing... this is easily one of the best (and again, alot of potential hilarity here).   You'll get your money's worth out of this one.  Just be prepared for that.... that irritating moment when you THINK you've gotten 100% or better in a level, only to find out... you got 99%... stuff just might get flung around the office at that point.Oh, and before I forget:  This game does indeed have co-op.  My experience with the game is all solo... I'm not a big fan of co-op gaming... but from what I hear, the hilarity increases tenfold when you're playing it with friends."

SHE DID MAP GUIDES AND SHE DIDN'T REVIEW THE GAME?"".What do you want me to tell, mopping these maps are just so fun that I've been saying it on Playblink, Steamgifts and any friend that is wondering if the game is worthy.You're a janitor in a space station - sometimes sent to some planets - always cleaning the mess around, caused by genetically modified creatures, aliens, special military division sent to dispose of these and the scientists, which means mopping blood, incinerating body parts or body bags or entire bodies, trash (cans, noodle boxes), bullet cases, toxic goo, repairing holes caused by the guns, etc. etc.And while you're at it, since a newer version, you can bring back unique items to your office like a Face Hugger, Gordon Freeman's assests, Duke Nukem's, Isaac Clarke's helmet, and any other easter eggs (litteraly). Besides, with the datalogs and pages let by workers, you'll learn more about what happened, the causes and the orders given to the soldiers. And why not, keep traces of codes to enter some areas, needing your cleaning but closed.To do so, you'll find an incinerator to burn what you need to burn (or an airlock in one case), a water bucket dispenser, a disposal bin dispenser, a vending device when you need medikits back to their places or light, a laser welder that can repair and burn (but with stains in that case) holes, brooms, J-Harm, sort of mini-lift and maybe other items that I'm bound to forget.Each level can be small to huge, on several floors, with dispensers not always near of each other. Unearthly Excavation can take hours to complete alone for example.You can guess that the main ambiance of the game isn't a scary one but more a comedy one. Finding Bob is fun as he's a psychopath (or not) and you're one step behind him, even if you'll never rattle him out. And getting an Employee of the Month award is also a great filling.Anyway, you've understood, I play alone. But you can also bring friends with you, kill them to get them replaced, annoy them by messing around or simply play the game normally.And don't worry for the music! You have a radio on each level that play great tracks.Viscera Cleanup Detail is maybe in Early Access since some time. But the developers are working hard. They added more and more features making me forced to complete my maps and cursing them for that pain (but what a pleasure in the end). And they're nearing the 1.0, the final release.Thanks to the devs listening and answering the community and thanks to the community, Viscera Cleanup Detail will be one of these games that you will never regret supporting in Early Access.For 10 bucks, you're not ripped off. BUY IT! Because while my cleaning skills are still a mess IRL and in the game, it is really relaxing to do so. And because you want to find Bob."

What may not occur to you, is this is actually a real job what you're doing. Its really hard, and most that do it do not survive for very long.I've been with this game from the very beginning and it goes without saying that I've been utterly pleased with it. Even its offshoots are great.Its not a fad game. It never 'took off'. It never had its moment and hopefully never will; this is a game that deserves to be discovered with wild eyes and a wet mop. This game deserves to be found as the calming zen-like, ocd-destroyer of a game that it is.There is no danger so as long as you're smart. No ammo to keep track of, and nothing is actually trying to kill you. You're just Joe, trying to clean stuff up.Its got problems though; and nearly all of them have to do with its physics engine. While its certainly a good one, its really hard to actually get rid of bullet casings. And intestines. And hands will still sometimes clip through the floor. This action makes it basically impossible to get a hold of, and its detectable. So you're screwed.  They added a broom to make casings and trash easier to pick up but personally; I'd prefer a vaccum.They threw in references to various games here and there in the form of workers logs usually. They do indeed feel thrown in. But it gets a knowing smile from me if not much else. This game is not exciting. Its not action packed. It is not for everyone, and its not that detailed.Red blob #3 (its a joke kinda) still looks like a red blob to me, so I always assume its a heart.There. Is. No. Tutorial.I repeat.There. Is. No. Tutorial.So when you see a gun that fires lasers and you have no idea what its for, nobody else did either. They learned the hard way unless you check out the wiki.This game will throw you in all kinds of different areas.From med labs where all kinds of things went wrong, to an oil refinery, to a greenhouse; where you'll also have to remove weeds and tumors, and even in space itself, where you're free to turn gravity on and off.Is it fun? I say it is.Theres a reason why its foil badge has been my featured badge for as long as it has been.Runestorm did a great job with this game in Early Access as it was, and is one of the woefully few success stories from it.Give it a shot if you think you like what I've described.8/10.--edit--Nominated this game with the ""I liked it before it won an award""Cuz its true and it deserves it."

That's all.You clean muck, blood and a black substance than can be created by burning things with the laser or... Be there.That's it... All the time... And you can't keep the gun. You have to drop it to get anything else.Also, movement is strange and dificult. It´s like if you had a massive body but you couldn't see it. So you'll spill buckets a lot or get stuck in places that don't appear to be tight.I like that there seems to be something like a weight system.

,Recommended,246900,16799104,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,Omega,"I bought this game and in two days I had over 12 hours of gameplay. This is not a common thing for me anymore.I don't know what it is, if it's the thrill of looking at a room and being disgusted and lazy of how much you'll have to work, or walking around the same room when it's all squeaky clean and feeling accomplished. Something about this game appeals to me.Of course that this is not a game for everybody, as sometimes I also need some time to recharge my will of play, but it really is fun, and I bet that with friends it should be a lot better, too. Good luck trying to convince them, though.For the few complaints I have so far:- Buckets: Sometimes, when cleaning the mop, you hit the water perfectly but it still doesn't count, so you have to try again. And they flip WAY too easily as well (might be a game mechanic or simply bad coding, either way, it sucks in my opinion).- Dispensers: The fact that sometimes it will drop body parts instead of buckets or disposal bins is NOT fun at all, to me. Yes, I understand, it's a game mechanic, so it will probably stay the way it is, but I just don't like it. It makes me more annoyed than surprised.- Laser gun/Welder: It should be in your inventory after you pick it up for the first time. Having to drop it when you want to change your tools and backtracking for it every time is annoying.- Physics: Iffy. When you put stuff in the disposal bins, they sometimes ""drop"" through its bottom. Also, the ragdoll physics are not very good. What happens to date is that when you pick an object, the center of the object is where you will grab it, and right clicking flips the object to be ""straight"" up. The pivot point of the grabbed object should be where the cursor was, and then after right clicking, rotate the object and center the point to the center of the object (as is right now).That's about everything that I can remember for now.A small suggestion or idea I had that could be added:- Magnet: Used to pick up shotgun shells and bullets, maybe other small metallic objects. Because of now, the only way is to picking them up individually, which is somewhat tiresome. But then again, it IS a janitor simulator after all, so I think it's fair not having such thing.Overall, I recommend this game, but not for everybody. Look at the screenshots, watch gameplay of it, try to get some friends to play with you if you feel like you don't want to play alone.EDIT:After having played online with a friend, I decided to add some more body to this review. Nothing above the EDIT line has been changed.I will (briefly) describe a few changes I myself and my friend would like to see done in this game.As they follow: for one, the multiplayer. It's bad. Like,SERIOUSLYbad. It needs a LOT of improvement. Even though our ping remains under 50, we have to take turns hosting a game, because it is horrible for client(s) to play (hosts are always fine). Some problems the clients face are that sometimes you cannot see other players or you are completely unsynced with one-another; disposal bins don't work properly, as in ""everything inside of it will collide with each other and will burst leaving nasty stuff everywhere"". Seriously annoying.Another thing, the object rotation must be reworked, in other words, it must actually exist. As of now, you can't rotate objects at will, you can only flip them up, and that's it. You should be able to rotate them like you do in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, for example, where you hold the left button and move the mouse in the direction you want to rotate the object.Third and final factor, perhaps the sniffer should also be reworked. I honestly can't suggest much, I just think it's pretty... useless. While it does tell you there's something dirty in the vicinity, sometimes it will still beep when there's nothing there. Maybe changing the sniffer's organic mode to an UV light, in which you point it at a surface and if there's blood or other fluids it will glow, and the non-organic mode perhaps could be changed to a portable metal detector. I don't know for sure, I just think it should be reworked as well.I will try to suggest these things on the game's forum as well.Thank you for your time."

Not worth the full price.You'd think after 9 iterations they'd have the collision right, but it's seriously broken, in many cases you will find yourself being propelled by other physics enabled objecs, resulting in knocking down things that you might want not to.There is no tutorial, figure it out yourself, or more importantly use the wiki. Things that don't appear to be trash turn out to be trash. Like toxic waste barrels being undeterminate, at least I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to burn them or not.You may also find yourself spending a good deal of time and thinking that it's all clean, only to see that you've got only 92%  completion of the room. For example I spent 2 hours in the sewers making the place spotless, while letting the envornment to play pinball with me. Punching out got me demoted, and apparently 92% is the bare minimum. There is no way to go back, you gotta do it all over again if you want to get those last nooks and crannies.Either way, the novelty of the idea wears off quickly, as you have too few tools at your disposal. A lack of convenience is just strange really, what, they don't have hoses in the future? Water is pretty hard to get for a game based on cleaning. You have to run around to get a bucket, bring it to your designated cleaning spot, only to find out  that 5 swipes is all it takes for the bucket to be useless. Now go and burn it (yeah cuz it's so intuitive to dispose of dirty water in the fkin incinerator), get a new one, and rinse and repeat. Stacking more than a few of these also doesn't seem to be very productive, since everything launches you left and right, it's highly likely that you will spill your dirty water and just have to clean everything again.The lack of tools becomes very obvious when you start looking for bullet casings. Prepare to have to pick them up one by one. Don't expect a vacuum cleaner or anything, a janitor may have a garbage scanner (that simply beeps, what it is that you have to throw out is anyones guess, since I've had it beep in an empty corridor), but a vacuum cleaner would be asking for too much. In fact, I'd rather clean my own room, since you can use the comforts of life.Music is good and the sounds are nice and visceral. The gore is satisfying, though I mostly found myself desiring to play as the guy who did all the carnage.Other than that, I can't say more. I see an effort, there is mod supports and custom maps, but as far as I'm concerned this is an average game. It looks good, but it plays average. My recommendation is to get it on sale."

There's not much to the actual gameplay and you'll get the hang of the mechanics quickly, but the game looks very striking for an indie production and the story told through various notes and diary entries you can find through the numerous maps lends life to a game that's otherwise full of extremely dead things. The end-of-level scoring system is also remarkably novel - instead of a bunch of arbitrary numbers, you find yourself in your modest janitorial office at the end of each shift, with inspection reports and newspaper articles detailing your specific failures (or lack thereof) with plenty of humour.The physics engine is still fairly rough, as might be expected with games made in the Unreal engine, but even that provides a masochistic kind of fun as you find yourself sliding into and knocking over a bucket full of human juice... again.

The goal of the game is to mop up blood, clean up and burn body parts, shell casing, and other bits of evidence, and leave the place spotless and shiny like there never was the horrible slaughter of a dozen space marines by unknown extraterrestrial monstrosities.Let's start with the bad of this game, and of that there are two major problems: the physics system and the content (or lack there of).The physics system is your standard, sterotypical buggy and awful physics system. Often times objects will bounce unrealistically, get stuck in walls, phase through walls of the bucket, and send you jumping in the air like it was spring loaded. It is also impossible to right a box if it gets knocked over, you have to get a new one. Given how much of the game revolves around the physics system (mainly by placing little bits of bodies in boxes to bring back to the furnace) this is a major problem. The physics system has caused me a lot of frustration and hinders its enjoyability.The second and more serious problem is the lack of content in this game. Yes, there are a couple dozen maps with different things to clean up (usually varying in the alien bodies). But after 30 minutes of playing the game you've done all that the game has to offer, the rest is just more of that. This might not have been too bad if the game didn't feel like such a chore. Granted, I assume feeling like a chore was intended, you are a janitor after all, but that doesn't make it any less tedious. The physics system is also a large part of this chore, and when half of your gameplay that is very repetitive is poorly done you have a major problem with enjoyability.The good in this game is that the mopping up part of the game does work rather well. Mopping up blood and washing your mop in buckets is well implemented (if a bit repetitive as stated prior). The fact that splashing body parts against the wall makes blood stains and that walking in blood will leave bloody footprints is a nice attention to detail. It is also very satisfying to complete a level and look back over all the work you've done, similar to the satisfaction of writing a long essay or doing the dishes.The problem is that the game is very shallow and what it does offer isn't that enjoyable.The only saving grace for this game is that it is a great podcast game. That is, it's perfect for something to do idly in the background while listening to a podcast or a TV show or the like. However on its own the game falls flat.My final verdict would be this:The game is very shallow and repetitive and simple, so I would recommend not buying it.However, this game can be useful as something to do idly while listening to a podcast, but even then I would recommend other podcast games with a bit more to offer, such as Elite Dangerous, over this."

Lame"", and that my friend, is where people like that, miss out on something more.At the heart of it, the game is about working together with others as a team (or alone if you want to blow off an hour or so per each map) in doing a common goal, all while making sure to not make mistakes like dropping stuff on the ground, thus making creating a mess again, or knocking over a dirty bucket of water.   People with OCD, will either really enjoy this game because of that feeling of accomplishment when they clean up the entire area, or it will be a nearly endless nightmare with everything being messed up, out of order, dirty, etc.Now to the bare brass.Gameplay:  It is a first-person game in which you use your default tools, mop, sniffer (used to sniff for organic and non-organic spots/items), and your hands (to pick up stuff).   In certain maps, there are other tools to use such as a shovel to fill in pits, a laser gun to fix bullet holes or to incinerate large items.   Some maps, even have interactive objects to do various things, such as gaining access to other rooms, or gas chambers to gas anything inside of it.    Aside from that, are there buckets of water to use in conjunction with your mop to clean the floors and ceiling, and a waste basket to toss in junk that will then be tossed into the furnace.   In the most recent update, a new mechanic of Planting, was added.   Also, map trials are in the game, so if you want to see who is the fastest cleaner in the business, then do a trial run and find out.  IMO, duo games, or games with three or four, would be interesting to see, and to see what time it takes for a team to complete a site.Sounds:  Unique sounds for various items in the game.  Background ambience was amazingly good.   Aside from that, nothing too special.Visuals:  Ok, so we all know how visuals can be a big deal for people.  Well, the graphics here, are actually pretty nice, wether theyare maxxed out, or set to low.  The maps used to be trippy with lag spikes, but a few optimizations later, and the maps run very smooth.  Their newest map with the man-eating plants, are a bit laggy, but overall, they do a nice job at keeping the game smooth in performance.Early Game:   Yes, this is one of those EA games where they are not done, and some people grab their pitchfork and start shouting with others about burning the witch, errr I mean Banning the EAs, but the devs have been able to keep up with fairly steady updates that usually have a brand new, not just a reskin, map that is unique and enjoyable.   Heck, their last 4 maps were simply amazing and unique in location/settings.   The devs have gotten to a stage where they are going to focus on another project of theirs, and then come back and add a few more things, and eventually have a full release which will hopefully include the ability for players to create their own maps.Overall:   Some people will like this, others, won't, for  those who don't, I say to them, give it a chance.  It just might grow on to you.  Besides, when it comes to modern games, a lot of them are about shoot this, shoot that, where as this, is about coordinating what to do, how to do it, and seeing if you can do it even faster (especially if playing with friends)UPDATE:   I will post some updates here.  Recent update added another map (good size, nice simple design) and a lot more unique sound effects for various items in the game.   Few more bugs were fixed, performance improved, easier to connect o other players too.   Another map was added as well with even more unique features.  One feature that is neat is name cards.  Find them all and punch them into the machine to do a role call on all people in the map."

You may ask yourself,how could a game with no dialog have humor?Well, good imaginary people asking that question,it's because the game makes you change how you think, although it is usually not like a certain game that rhymes with schminfinifactory (wish I had the money to get it), which makes you change your way of thinking to solve problems. Imagine if you will, a space station whose purpose is researching alien lifeforms. One day, one of the specimens escapes and kills all the reseachers. The government sends soldiers to kill the lifeform. The soldiers manage to kill the lifeform, but with heavy casualties. You don't play as a soldier fighting the alien,you're the one cleaning up the mess the soldiers made.The way it makes you change the way you think is that instead of feeling bad for the dead soldiers, you start to think along the lines of ""uggh! Couldn't they have died less messily?!"". It is hilarious without saying a word. There are also times when the game does provide humor through text. An example of this is when you miss something when cleaning.There are a few issues, but these are mostly due to my playing on a mac:No online multiplayer through steamNo steam acheivementsNo steam overlay, at least there wouldn't be one if there was a steam glitch on mac that has disabled itNo way to take screenshots, at least that I know ofUnable to move the cursor off the windowFullscreen is hard to activate(I am unsure if these last two are due to me playing on a mac or not, but the rest I knew about before I purchased the game.

,Recommended,246900,34978287,Posted: 15 September,all,supernaut,"The stand alone Shadow Warrior expansion of Viscera Cleanup Detail was a fantastic idea in and of itself, raising the question what happens in the game world after you're done playing. So for example, if you leave a trail of bodies behind in an FPS game, who will then clean up the mess? Enter the Janitor. You are here to clean up the remains of a repulsed alien invasion. Get to work! Viscera Cleanup Detail includes 18 levels of various sizes that are full of trash, spent bullets, blood and body parts of humans and aliens, crates, barrels, tools, debris, secret items, collectibles and so on. It also includes three expansions, one of which is Shadow Warrior and an office where you collect your trophies, items and it's also a level you can clean, so all in all 22 levels of ultimate cleaning pleasure.I'm not sure if I should say this, but this game is probably a better fit for introverts and/or for people who take at least some satisfaction in cleaning or putting things back where they belong. But that's my impression, I'm sure it has fans of every kind of variety, cos it's a great game to relax to and everybody needs to relax. If you're not making much progress in your professional or personal life, then cleaning a level in VCD will give you a sense of accomplishment, even if it is only an illusion or escapism. Your messy life will always be waiting for you once you exit the game.A big part of VCD, for better or worse, are machines that create human body parts. The idea has puzzled me since playing the Shadow Warrior level, cos I got the main game a few years later. How or why does a bucket and a bin dispenser dispense body parts? Sure, it's more mess for you to clean up and I might've missed a bit of story that potentially explains this, but it's the one part of the cleaning process I find completely pointless and often annoying, cos at the end of the job you have to collect those body parts with multiple bins and get multiple buckets to clean up the rest. It's as if the game is not confident enough for you to simply clean up the remains of terrible incidents. Is it funny? Machines spewing out body parts? Maybe the first time around, but that's about it.The music. How good is it? Hmmm. Let's just say VCD's soundtrack is different. It has heaps of character, which is more than you can say about soundtracks in much bigger and more expensive games, but I think you'll love it and hate it at the same time. You'll be turning off the Big Banger eventually, just to take a break from the songs, but you'll also turn it back on in the next level, cos you really like that heavier tune, but that's me.I should say that Shadow Warrior is the only game-themed level in VCD. You won't be picking up headcrabs in City 17, as amazing as that would be, but you won't be disappointed by the selection, cos the locales are varied and it's not all about picking up body parts and mopping up the blood. Some of these levels are huge and you'll have your work cut out for you. Co-op is something I haven't tried, but Revolutionary Robotics, for example, is really a job for two people when I think back on it, but I enjoy the solitude and there's no need to complete a level in one sitting.If you're an achievement person, I suggest researching levels before you tackle them, cos you're likely to miss items or tasks on the first try. At the beginning I was very confused about what I was supposed to burn and since there's a lot of stuff you can pick up and move around, you start overthinking it eventually. Supposedly there's no difference between stacking barrels and crates in the appropriate areas or simply burning them. While there's a certain set of rules that apply for all levels, the look of items will vary such as what constitutes a crate, but a barrel is always a barrel. I'm not complaining though, the levels are different, cos they tell different stories, so the items have to look different. You're not going to find ""space crates"" in Santa's workshop.I have eight more levels to complete, the office needs a bit more work and the House of Horror awaits, but I think I've done a pretty good job so far. I'm not sure what I've accomplished in the 47 hours I've put into this, but I've left some clean rooms behind, so there's that. It's not often you play a game from a South African indie studio, VCD is both funny and engaging in its mundane tasks. It's a parody on the violence of video games and how meaningless it often is when a game has no real story to tell. I'd say this is not for everybody, but Santa's Rampage is a cheaper entry point and if you own Shadow Warrior then you already have the VCD expansion of the same name. Both of those left me wanting for more, so hence the review."

Finally this game has been released fully! No longer do people have to ""Wait until it leaves Early Access"" to consider this game! Now, I apologize for not updating my review that much during the Early Access period, and sorry for waiting so long to give a full release update.  Anyway there isn't really any difference in this review, considering that the core game is the same, but I did edit a couple things, enjoy.What can I say about this game?  It was probably one of the greatest Early Access games I have come across.  It seems the Early Access model is abused and is filled with games that make little progress.  This game on the other hand has made plenty of progress, adding in new mechanics and maps constantly.  Even after leaving Early Access, they seem to still update the game, revisiting the awfully updated Santa's Rampage expansion and having it be a part of free DLC instead of Standalone, a benefit of this being that you can now play it in the modern version of the engine, instead of the buggy mess that is the older engine.GameplayThis game is about cleaning, which is very odd, I mean how can they make a game about cleaning fun?  Well, it is simple, they make sure that it is interesting.  You take on the roll of a space janitor, cleaning for various companies.  What do you clean up exactly?  Viscera!  You clean up various dead bodies, organs, blood spots, radioactive materials, aliens, and even the normal trash that would consist of soda cans and potato chip bags.  When you are cleaning you are using various tools to get the job done, such as your mop, the newly added broom (Which sadly seems to not be very useful...), the welder, and many more.  In order to have a job well done, you must weld all the bullet holes, mop up any messes you see, and incinerate any trash or even bodies you find.  The concept sounds simple and dumb, but trust me when I say that you will be spending hours enjoying yourself while you clean, especially if you have a friend to bring with you.StoryEach map has it's own story.  It is told by the various notes scattered around the map and the various hints as to what really happened before you were tasked of cleaning.  I find it really interesting how they try to tell the story of each facility through the eyes of the janitor, the person who is tasked of cleaning the aftermath of the action.  There is even some story found inside your own office, which I will not spoil, but let's just say there is a small surprise found behind every door.ContentLet's just say there is a ton of content in this game.  There are plenty of official maps that are already added, especially as of now.  Each map can take you a good amount of time, and thanks to the new save feature, you can pick up and return to each map if you wish.  With each map there is also easter eggs and other things to look out for in each map too, so there is even some side content.  Also included with the purchase of the base game is the Shadow Warrior and Christmas standalone maps, which are sadly a bit outdated when it comes to the engine.  Speaking of crossovers though I REALLY wish this game had more crossover maps, in the form of either standalone or just maps in general, it would be cool to clean up Black Mesa from Half-Life or possibly Aperture Science from Portal.Performance/OptimizationSo far optimization in this game is really good.  The game doesn't lag too much from what I played.  I have a decent PC, not the best but good enough for gaming.  There is one problem however, and that is multiplayer.  Playing multiplayer is possible and is actually 100% playable with some precautions.  If you tread too much and make more of a mess than what you started with, you will start to lag, and if you are hosting then the other person playing will start to see some interesting glitches.  Even if you play and have the place near clean you still see glitches as someone who is not hosting, such as the mysterious kamikaze blue bin.OverallThis game is great, it is a blast with friends, and despite it being a cleaning simulator, it is still a boatload of fun!  Plenty of content for the money, even if it is 3$ more than it was during Early Access."

,Recommended,246900,23930437,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,PCGNeurotic,"In a nutshell, Viscera Cleanup Detail poses the question, ‘What happens after you finish an FPS?’, then answers it with ‘Someone has to come along and clean up all the blood, gore, bullet casings and destroyed stuff, and get the place ready for work again the next day.’ That “someone” is, of course, you.Its central shtick – that you’re working in environments familiar from the shooters we all know and love, as well as various icons of genre cinema – is ideally served by its Unreal Engine 3 housing. The colour palette tends to err on the side of ‘fun’, and fits well with the game’s overall sense of humour. The levels are solid and chunky, beautifully textured and full of hidden detail. In fact, the amount of thought and care that has gone into each level is very clear. They look and feel like they’ve been meticulously planned and carefully crafted by people who are as happy and comfortable working in their game engine as I am sitting in my pyjamas writing about it. Plus, you get a choice of 32- or 64-bit executables to launch, which is always a delicious cherry on any gaming cake.It’s an interesting concept, and an excellent setting in which to explore it. But what’s it like to play? Well, entering a level for the first time and looking around is a bit like waking up in the morning with a heavy head and seeing the epic mess left after last night’s fun times. Except with added ludicrous, Sam Raimi-like amounts of blood on the floors, walls and ceilings. There’s also general rubbish and litter, assorted body parts (including quite small, fiddly bits of entrails), and furniture, items and decorations that have been smashed or knocked askew. Sometimes there are broken or empty sentry gun turrets that need replicating, replacing and re-arming (making them come online again — a dangerous part of the puzzle), as well as every gamer’s godsend – first aid kits, which also need re-filling. Then, there are the barrels and crates. Each of the five levels I’ve played so far has had special zones painted on the floor, one for barrels and one for crates. Your success in each level is measured by various statistics that represent your thoroughness in cleaning and tidying, and ideally you’ll replace all these scattered containers in their proper zones to help get the best rating.So, there’s stuff to clean, stuff to repair, stuff to refill or replace, stuff to pile up in its proper place, and stuff to just shovel up and throw away. Dead stuff is part of that latter category, and its bloody messy (janitor humour again). Deceased people, plants, monsters, robots and Weird Things all leak some kind of nasty fluids, and every time you move something, trip over or drop it, more of these delightful fluids plop out. On top of that, walking through puddles of it creates footprints. And despite your best efforts, there will always be (more) blood.The very first time I fired up Viscera Cleanup Detail I lasted about five minutes before giving up and leaving it again. I’d been hankering after the game for a while, and had finally got it at a really good price from Bundlestars, so it preyed on my mind somewhat that I should go back and give it a fair shake. Finally, as I mooched about at 2 am in my kitchen dealing with the aftermath of the inaugural Summer 2016 barbecue at my place, I wondered whether clearing up broken sentry guns, blood stains and eviscerated monsters was as easy as dealing with dirty paper plates, millions of beer cans and acres of greasy, burned tin foil. Well, I can tell you that it’s not. But it sure is a lot more fun!"

Well, they worked acceptably. The carry mechanics in Unreal (Which make up the most of the game) aren't great, but I can see those getting better in a future beta. It's a beta, and it feels like it, but there are the underpinnings of a really polished game.However, it's not a game I think I could ever ENJOY, not beyond maybe a level and a half. It is almost exactly like cleaning in real life. Mopping up blood is pretty rewarding, although the bucket mechanic is infuriating. Picking up trash and bodies never felt fun to me in the same way, and after a while the mopping part got pretty old as well.Besides mopping and trash collection, there's a couple distractions. The logs scattered around each level are pretty interesting, in a Bioshock-y or Dead Space-y way (There's an overt reference to Dead Space in one of them; I'm sure there are many more references to find... If you keep playing after 1 level). There's also a little minigame where you organize crates or barrels, and a sort-of-hidden gun that fixes bullet holes (unless you use it recklessly, when it just stains everything and makes more holes). None of these are bad, but they aren't really enough to break the monotony of trash/mop/rinse/repeat.The best quality of the game, honestly, is the deadpan sarcasm coating its entire existence. It's fun to tell people about it (It's a cleaning simulator! No, yeah, just that! I swear it's fun!), and its funny to play, at least for a bit. I like the stark contrast between the boring day-to-day janitorial tone and the bloodstained sci fi scenery that you clean insestines off of.But: I can't get past the fact that the actual game, where you actually spend hours just picking up giblets and scrubbing blood, is just as fun as cleaning is.

There is no way it can be fun.  If I wanted to clean I would get off my lazy butt and go clean my real house and get crap done.""I was, thankfully mistaken.  VCD is fun if you have OCD, more or less.  It isn't the fact you are cleaning, it is /what/ you are cleaning.Imagine back to days of old, where you are the awesome Doom Marine, ploughing through legions of space zombie demon things, all the satisfying shotgun cracks and blood and body parts flying thruogh the air.  Good times.  Now imagine the poor sod that comes in after to make the place functional again.  The one who drags each and every severed limb and dismembered body into an industrial grade furnace, mops up the blood, picks up every shell casing and makes it look good again.  Thats what VCD is, you are cleaning up after someone elses game.In all honesty I was whole heartedly ready to write off VCD before even playing it.  However another game that I had bought and quite adored (Shadow Warrior) came with a free, stand alone, DLC for paying customers, VCD: Shadow Warrior.  I had heard of VCD by this time, and had disregaurded it entirely, but with a free copy I decided to give it a shot, I could always stop playing, and it was free.  This bit of marketing was totally ingenius of the developers, because I adored it.  A game I blew off, believed I would hate, I found I loved.  I further bought the other Stand alone Santa's Rampage game upon release.Now that the real version is here, I got to say I am really not disapointed.  It is as fun as ever, and I got to admit I have honestly found such few things than fully cleaning  a level and getting 'employee of the month' in game.  It is affordable and in all honesty if you are on the fence about buying it, I recomend Santa's Rampage, or if you have Shadow Warrior give the DLC a try.  If you bought Santa's Rampage or have the Shadow Warrior one you get a perma discount on VCD, if not this game comes with both of them upon buying, so, three games in one.  It is totally worth your time and money!There are a few things that could be fixed:- A tutorial would be nice to tell people what to do and how to play (I had to look up a guide to find out how to Buff out bullet decals.)- The Punchout machine should let you know if the place is spotless or not before you clock out, much like in Santa's Rampage.- Arc Weilder should be a perminate carry like the mop."

If you have time though it is possible, though it could take a few hours in most cases though6/10 Could do with some more fairy liquid"

,Recommended,246900,18656709,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,Werd,"---The world's first OCD simulator--- 10/10 for triggering my OCD when it comes to cleaning. It's a unique and innovative concept which has never been done before in gaming. It creates a new paradigm in cleaning simulators that can only be countered by cleaning in real life.This is possibly the world's first OCD simulator. I have never found myself wanting to go back constantly and clean EVERYTHING. Think of this game (I don't know if I can call it a game but more of a ""trigger"") as taking part after say DOOM or whatever Space Marine simulator you prefer.Now, imagine it's about a few days after the incident and the company wants to use the base again. Well, someone has to clean up the mess and that's you. You are assigned the fun task of picking up the pieces of people, cleaning up the blood splatter, the shell casings, dumping the toxic waste barrels into the furnace, picking up the pieces of trash (like the empty takeout food boxes), and having to both mop up and sweep up. It's as fun as it sounds, trust me.Now, you are alone, in the base in silence. All you have is your map, broom, your hands (wearing cleaning gloves of course, have to be safe), and some random ghost busters looking thing which I have no idea what it actually does since the game doesn't tell you. So, off you go on your task to start the cleanup. Fun OCD adventues will soon ensue.You start out next to a dispenser and if you push the button (most of the time) a bucket of clean water will be dispensed. You pick this up and take it over to the first area you want to clean. So, you use your trusty mop, dunk it in the bucket (which is a project in itself since you can easily splash the bucket - that becomes a problem as the water gets dirty) or what usually happens is you spill it. This leaves the floor wet. No problem you think, I'll just get another bucket. So you walk over, get another bucket and think ok, no problem. You pick up the task where you left off. Then you happen to look down to refresh your mop - well shi!!!!! the water you spilled caused you to leave footprints as you walked back to the bucket station.Now, not only do you have to clean up the inital mess but you have to clean up your footprints. More fun ensues, as your bucket water gets pretty nasty fast (I mean you are cleaning up blood, toxic waste, dead children and the sorts). So, you go bust out your trusty mop and start trying to clean that up. Well, once again, the water gets dirty. So, soon you start collecting buckets. The game doesn't tell you what to do with any of the trash, including the buckets, so maybe you figure out that the big metal thing behind you is a furnace. So, you go pick up the bucket full of dirty water, but because you moved too fast, it spills. The bucket makes it into the furnace but now as you walk back to get another bucket you leave footprints all over the place since the water was dirty.This time, because Zeus loves you, you click the button for a new bucket, and behold, a bloody body part is dispensed, you pick it up and accidentially touch the machine - blood everywhere. So, you go and burn the body part. Another body part will be dispensed and this time you don't touch the machine, but you still have to dispose of it. You carry it over and do your thing. Go back and BAM! you get a bucket of clean water. However, since you dirtied the machine, you have to clean the machine now. By the time you get back to the original mess your bucket water is already half dirty and pretty much only good for a dunk or two.So, you burn up the bucket. If you are lucky you didn't spill it this time. You go back and repeat the cycle, but then you walk in the area which is still wet. Well it's your lucky day because now you have to mop up the area where you just tracked up with footprints.Oh and don't forget your trusty broom which as you push objects around starts smearing blood and poop across the floor. So, you have to clean that up too. There is also some laser/fire thing but I don't think that was very helpful as all it did was blow the bodies into chunks.This game is the greatest OCD simulator ever developed for the PC. I cannot recommend it enough if you have issues with cleanliness and want to experience the joy of cleaning up a virtual world with the problems of real world cleaning. I don't know if you can ever really ""win"" as after about 15 minutes of cleaning up the same spot and then dirtying it up again, I realized that it would never meet my godly standards for cleanliness.I give this game a 10/10 for being the first OCD simulator. I have never ""played"" anything like it and it triggered the OCD in me. If you have OCD, and want to virtually clean in circles, this is the game for you. If I were on a hardcore strteet drug like evil crystal I might have spent hours playing this game. However, since I am not into evil crystal nor do I want to have my OCD triggered by a ""Game"" this isn't for me.However, if you are speeding along on evil crystal, this is quite possibly the greatest outlet ever for that infinite energy that you supposedly get. You can channel it in the virtual world instead of cleaning on single spot in your house for 5 hours, you can do it in a post-space marine warzone. It would be an excellent place to channel all that energy.Otherwise, if you are like me, you will want to punch a hole in the wall after seeing that you left footprints because you walked in your dirty water, or spilled the bucket, or tried to sweep up the trash only to smear blood and green goo everywhere. You'll truly live the experience of cleaning in this game. It wil complete your life in ways only cleaning in real  life would! As for me, I am going to go pick up the trash in my room now.Thanks Viscera all your inspiration!"

This sounds boring but it is really fun and satisfing to clean a level for hours and hours, the levels in this game range from being 45 minutes long to 3-6 hours long.When you finish a level you will be given % clean grade if you get that grade high enough you get a promotion and after a promotion the game is going to expect more from you like, Stacking explosive barrels in the right spot, doing an incedent report for each and every one of the dead bodies and doing level-specific objectives like repairing auto turrets.This game can give you over 20 hours of fun easily if you have a friend or two to play this game with, if you do all of the levels and try and go for the achievements then you can get up to 40 hours of fun and cleaning.I would rate Viscera Cleanup a 8/10I wouldnt give it anymore than that since first of all, after you do some a level you dont want to do that level again because it gets boring repeating levels.Second of all, theres no story or store or curency that makes you want to return to the game the only thing that the game rewards you with is the little grading for each level that you keep for ever other than that theres not much else in the game."

That should tell you how much I love this game.I first heard about this game from a podcast-like series called ""Lets Drown Out"" so you might be able to guess what was happening. This is an amazing game, similar to Papers, Please (minus the story) in that it shows how a mind-numbing task can be fun. However, I highly recommend finding a good podcast or audiobook to listen to while playing as otherwise it can be mind-numbing.That out of the way, I must congratulate the developers on their physics engine. The game runs the Unreal Engine, I don't know how good the physics are in the engine but the games physics are superb. This is a game in its simplest form, about mopping and putting stuff in bins, so physics play a big role and it is done very well.The Graphics: They are great.Oh also they can run even on a pretty crummy machine. My friends refer to my poorly partioned MacBook Pro as the ""F***-it Bucket"", so that should give you an idea of my  machines graphical capability.Multiplayer: This game has a multiplayer, but I havent convinced anyone to pay for this godsend of a game to try it, and that may be an area where the game screws up.Gameplay: Ok this is a big one. There is no tutorial. At all. While this isn't an issue for some, it follows the Minecraft tradition there being no shame in looking up a FAQ. All in all, I dont have any problem with that. Moving on, the game has a little sense of humor in it. In the first level (which being one of the smaller of them, it took me 3 hours to fully clean) I opened up a door to see the classic ""SAVE US"" inscribed in blood on the wall, my only reaction was to contemplatively sigh, thinking ""honestly, did they need to do that? Seriously? No one else was there. Now I have to clean it up"" and got a little giggle. There are also the necessary tablets and such saying things like Oh, by the way this virus I developed is highly toxic and revives the dead. I guess i'll store it with the dead space aliens."" As for the gameplay itself, the controls are simple and very easy to understand.Conclusion: This godsend from the gaming industry is one of the best timesinks I can think of. However it might require a certain type of person, who enjoys this sort of thing. I highly recommend this, but make sure you really want it. I.E. if you dont like things like Euro Truck Simulator, or even Minecraft to a degree, I do not recommend it. However, like being assigned a challenge, and are willing to accept that it will take a while, then buy this game. Oh and the free expansions are great fun as well. You can really only play the same level once, unlike L4D where thats where a lot of fun comes, so the expansions are quite nice.Now excuse me, as I need to go remove the intestines of a space marine from my bucket dispenser.9/10(only because of minor bugs)"

For me, its good, I rather like it! But there's no minigames, no easter eggs or hidden fun times. You are a janitor, and you clean. The co-op is something I like even more, having a second person makes it not only faster, but fun and more social. It's still pretty buggy even as far as early access goes, but its not game-breaking, midly annoying at most. As far as gameplay.. pretty polished actually. Movement is fluid (if youre not holding a crate, which can often bump around due to hitboxes of its contents.), and some tactics are actually needed if you dont want to mess areas you've already cleaned. Mechanics are pretty cool and getting progressively more in-depth, for instance if you walk through some blood you'll get it on your boots and track it for a certain period of time.

After all, in essence it is a janitorial simulation, where you get to clean up the messes made by other people. But what made this game so enjoyable was the contrast between this mundane job and the exotic locations to which that job brought me.The game was surprisingly good looking for a throw-away title like this, and the game felt as much a love-letter to FPS games as it was an attempt to make money for the developers. The gameplay was surprisingly enjoyable too, albeit only for short periods. The wonky physics made my clean-up attempts all that more amusing (whoops, just bumped the bucket and spilled dirty water all over... again!) and finding that last bit of gore or shell-casing in an attempt to get the vaunted ""employee of the month"" poster was surprisingly challenging. I have to admit I was more than a little bit impressed by how well the physics engine handled placing items in and carrying around containers, too.Still, this is definitely a game you don't want to spend much money on; I became tired of it before an hour was done and never did bother to explore all the levels. After all, even with the exciting locals and fun physics in the end it still is cleaning up, and I can't imagine anyone really finds that fun. Mildly amusing, strangely charming and different sure, but not worth a major investment in funds or time. Recommended if you can get it at a steep discount because it is just quirky enough to be fun, but if you pay full price you definitely will not be getting value for your dollar; there just isn't enough of a game there."

Blood and body parts (also called viscera) litter every part of the station, be it human or alien. Your main objective in this game is, of course, to clean the designated area of blood, gore, and casings. In your arsenal, you have a uber-absorbant mop, your hands, and a sniffer tool which helps find any mess you missed. You are also given a bucket dispenser and bin dispenser, which both can spew out mess at random times, causing you to rage. Also at your disposal is an incinerator where all your bins and dirty buckets are disposed of. Not only do you have to clean up the violence, you must tidy up, which includes not leaving trash, buckets, or bins, not leaving overturned barrels (people apparently die quite easily from these), and filling any wall-mounted medkits with new supplies. There are also bullet holes on the walls apart from everything else. To get rid of these, and prevent someone freaking out from them and breaking their neck, you need a plasma gun, which is located somewhere on the map. Watch out though, as overheating it causes it to create more mess. There is also very simple yet effective multiplayer, where you team up to take down the mess that plagues the station. I will admit this game has more than a few bugs, but this game is in early access, and updates bring many new additions and many needed bug fixes. This game, if u got the money, is definitely worth it, and besides, who wouldn't want to clean blood and gore in the middle of space?infinite X infinite/10"
,Recommended,246900,19539076,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Waccoon,"This is one of those curious, experimental indie titles that should have come out a long time ago.  You'll either love it or hate it, but since may people seem to like it, it's quite pleasing to say that Runescape's gamble has paid off.  It's exactly what it says on the tin, with no gimmicks or annoying, forced puzzles.  After fleet glasses the planet, janitors mop up!7/10 - I've played a ton of it so far and I love it, but it's not for everyone.I recommend buying the stand-alone Santa's Rampage game first, as it's still one of the best and funniest levels in the series, and it's got lots of explosives to keep things interesting.Pros:- Terrific craftsmanship and worth every penny.- This is a NICE looking and sounding game with tons of polish.- The gore is... especially so.  The plant pods are actually the scariest.- The physics are actually pretty decent once you learn the quirks.- Multiplayer is hilarious and the best way to play.- There is a sub-plot and lots of hidden secrets and Easter eggs.- Speed runs are where it's at (though you can't collect trophies in this mode).- Use of the Unreal console isn't gimped.  Cause some chaos!Cons:- Some levels are rusty corridor after rusty corridor, making it hard to tell between clean and dirty.- Green alien blood on green floors with green lighting.  'Nuff said.- Suffers from many technical issues, including studdering.- Documentation and backstory is lacking.- Some levels are way too dark, even though lanterns are available.- Needs more dangers, explosives, and amusing physics.  In solo mode, you are completely alone.- Could use more bizarre, exotic locations, a la Santa's Rampage.  Industrial locations suck.- Needs more tools besides the mop and sniffer.  The brush and PDA are useless.- The laser welder was a bad addition.  Finding bullet holes to weld is VERY frustrating.- The office is a map with its own save file.  If you get fired, you cannot fix it by loading a save game.Tips:- If you're an achievement collector, for heaven's sake, get the ""You're Fired"" achievement first!  If you get fired later in the game, you'll lose all the trophies in the office, which is a massive design flaw and a huge slap in the face.  No, you can't reload your game save and fix it.- You only need to clean a level 70% to return trophies to the office.  This can save a lot of time on replays.- You only get fired if you clock out.  If you can't clean the level properly, just choose the ""Leave"" option and you'll be fine.- Return every note from ""Bob"" to the office.  It sucks to burn them early in the game, only to find out LATER you were supposed to keep them, and you have to replay all the early levels again.- Run the game via Steam and choose 64-bit.  If run as 32-bit, the game is more likely to have problems.- Mop up blood first, then collect body parts.  Blood multiplies, not spreads, as you walk over it.- The office is much bigger than you think, so put in the effort to hack all the door locks."

,Recommended,246900,11541549,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,Chef Excellence,"This game isn't fun, exactly—it's an occasionally creepy, unique NPC simulator whose sandbox-ish mashup of meta-storytelling, stark horror imagery, and mundane drudgery somehow manages to be both darkly funny and perversely satisfying. I like it a lot, for the obvious reason—conceptually, it's a particularly funny♥♥♥♥♥♥take on the tropes of horror FPSs. After the big lantern-jawed super soldier stomps through and paints the walls with alien squick, you're called upon to pick up the expended shell casings and severed limbs, mop up the blood, and replenish all the health kits. Somebody's got to, right?VCD is in early access, and it feels like it. They've clearly done a hell of a job with the physics in this game to get it this far, but even still after the first few times a bin full of severed body parts encounters a physics glitch and spews everything upward with the force of a shotgun, covering the walls and ceiling with more blood to mop up, you'll find yourself eyeing inanimate objects with deep suspicion.Okay, so it's out of early access now and the physics are significantly improved while still just janky enough to make you feel like the gameworld's got it in for you. Objects still occasionally interact wonkily with each other, but after the first instance or two this kind of thing becomes predictable. You'll still have the occasional bit of gore clip through the bottom of a trash box and leave a long smear of blood, but you have to really pack stuff in there to get it to happen.Which, somehow, is part of the charm. It all reminds me a bit of Papers, Please in that Kafkaesque desensitization sort of way. As a wage-slave trapped in a thankless job working for an amoral employer, it somehow seems right that the physics engine sometimes punishes you for no reason whatsoever, or that the supplies dispensers occasionally dispense bloody mangled meat instead of buckets of water. You quickly stop seeing the bloody gobbets of former co-workers as anything other than one more damn mess to clean up. Or, depending on your particular bent, toys to play with or souvenirs to tuck away. What to make of it all is, of course, up to you.But I also really enjoy VCD because it is one of the few games that has altered how I think about *other* games. What The Stanley Parable had to say about the arbitrary nature of narrative and objectives in gaming, VCD says something very similar about contrivance—for most any modern game to be playable, the gameworld must necessarily be designed around if not specifically for the player's avatar. And the rules of how that avatar interacts with that world, even down to basic physics, are by necessity completely different from the ones NPCs follow. You, by becoming the NPC in someone else's story, get to experience a gameworld built for someone who is not you. And that someone is kind of an a-hole. I'll never look at Half Life in quite the same way again.That's the beauty of VCD—nerds like me can wax philosophical about it, but if that doesn't suit your taste you also have the option to pop into multiplayer and throw intestines at your friends all night. Well worth the money and quite playable in either case."

Somehow though, it's fun and entertaining without getting boring. It brilliantly tackles the idea that there's someone out there in these fictional horror movies who eventually has to clean everything up. While it gives an uneasy horror vibe through its sounds and cold, gory sights, the contradiction of the mundane cleaning task at hand keeps the absurdity in the forefront. Although you won't have to worry about dying to monsters yourself (maybe) that doesn't mean you won't have to endure your own personal horror story. The first time you spill a dirty bucket of water in an area you've thoroughly cleaned, you'll experience a similar feeling of dread that the horror genre is known for. It'll make you keep saying ""What the hell am I even doing?"" weather it's your first day on the job or your 665th."

It makes it more unpredictable and fun since it creates another mess that you and your friends need to clean up.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv2nQBHo7UYThere's nothing like collecting bodyparts and incinerating buckets of blood with your friends.

I absolutely love it, but I don't have a lot of playtime in it because I can't go for long stretches playing. I've got 2.6 hours total on record for the main game, but I do own the other two as well (though Shadow Warrior came with that version of Viscera) and have 3.9 hours combined in Santa's Rampage and Shadow Warrior.The game is definitely a novelty game, it's fun, but I really like seeing things go from something messy to something clean (kind of like when I cut the grass, I enjoy seeing the grass go from somewhat tall to perfectly cut, where you can see the lines, which also leads to when I clean, I like seeing things go from one form to the other). So if you enjoy that then yeah it's probably worth it.Couple things that are annoying that they've yet to include (though I haven't played in 2 weeks), is there's no broom and dustpan. Each bullet you have to pick up individually, whereas if they had a broom and dustpan, you could sweep those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s up. Really, if they implemented the dustpan, I'd probably play a lot more because I'll get a lot of it cleaned and then get annoyed and quit because it's too tedious. Also the fact that you can knock over your water bucket just by cleaning your mop is annoying too, especially if it's full of blood or alien goo. Pro-tip when it comes to the water bucket: jump on top of the bucket and look straight down, then clean your mop. Never spill again....for the most part."

You probally think that that is disgusting, but it's actually quite interessting. I personally discovered this game by a video of Nerd³. Since then I played this game for 28 hours already and I love it. It has funny bits and pieces and also some story in every map. For people who are new to this game should definitly ask someone to get them started (like me). The game does not have a tutorial and that's one of the things that makes this game a bit less likeable, but as always someone made a tutorial level on the steam workshop to get you started.The maps on this game go from 45 mnutes of playtime to 3 HOURS of playtime and the sizes go from small to huge. Most maps have around 1-2 hours of playtime wich is long you may think but once you play the game you won't even notice (I've done 5 hours straight without noticing.).A far as mechanics go there is not too much special. Only some tools and machines that appear in every level. Some tools are level specific. There are also secondary objectives that won't influence your score. The controls are quite easy, just WASD and mouse buttons (or xbox 360 controls).As far as multiplayer goes there are  few options:splitscreen co-op for wich you need to be on the pc and need two xbox 360 controllers. Then you have multiplayer server for up to 28 people (not recommended though). The servers are not paid or don't require any difficult set-up things to do but are a bit slow sometimes. For the multiplayer servers you can make them public or friends only wich comes in handy when you're trying to do a speedrun or so.For VCD I would give a 9/10. I hope you found this helpful and thanks for reading. Regards, Spider."

It has helped me calm down many times after having a very stressful day at my real job. The levels have predefined amounts of time for them because there is a goal (clean up the place), so you can pick how much time you want to destress. So when I'm in an awful mood, I will sometimes pick up a mop and clean up after the aliens or robots or genetic mutations have made a mess of this science station or that star ship.And my wife usually comes along so we can let off some steam bickering about the nasty messes we find... or even how badly the other is cleaning... or complaining when the other one knocks over our bloody bucket and makes a giant mess... or walks around the corner at the wrong time so we knock that chunk of alien out of their hands on accident, leaving a trail of blood as it bounces down the corridor that we will be responsible for cleaning up as well.Thankfully, the developers have made quite a number of places to clean up.

It's simple, you clean up after horrific sci-fi related events/accidents which involves everything from mopping up blood with your sausage fingers looking mop ends, picking up and then incinerating various human and alien viscera and parts, disposing of various trash like soda cans or potato chip bags, disposing of shell casings leftover from gunfire, repair bullet holes in the walls, restock medical supply kits at appropriate wall stations, dispose of medical waste containers, and even replace toilet seats if there happens to be a restroom in the level you're playing. The amount of work when you first realize all of it can feel pretty overwhelming but luckily there is multiplayer which I will mention later. This is definitely a game for the patient gamer if you plan to actually get the task at hand done but you could always just see how damn dirty you could get the place. Sometimes the body parts are a little difficult to get into the biohazard bins and going up stairs with said bins isn't the easiest task either, I fixed that problem slightly by disabling bob under the settings which basically smooths out the walking animation. This is purely a personal thing but the fact that the alien blood is greenish in appearance (I only say aliens because of some of the body parts I've seen) opens up the possibility to imagine maybe it was a zombie outbreak in some facility and I suppose even the alien body parts could be Resident Evilesque Umbrella experiments. The multiplayer adds another level of fun and excitement you can experience with your friends although it is sometimes buggy as hell at the moment; invisible friends, buckets/bins not dispensing, filthy rooms looking completely clean, etc... They do mention the multiplayer is in the works though so I can't wait for it to be more stable. Overall I've thoroughly enjoyed my initial experience with Viscera Cleanup Detail from knocking over buckets full of bloody water, toppling over bins full of body parts, and obsessively checking for anything I may have missed I would definitely give it an 8.5/10."

And what I mean by that is they don’t understand repetition. And what I mean by that is… well, you get the joke already. For those of you, dear egocentric viewers, who include yourself in this bewildered ratio the best place to learn is at your computer looking up the definition online. Or you could play Viscera Cleanup Detail which bases itself around the mundane and repetitive. And yet is somewhat intriguing in its attempt  to be the most boring game ever. You are a cleaner and your job is to clean until the level is clean and you can say that your cleaning has left the space you are asked to clean is clean, if you know what I clean. Bad puns aside, cleaning is the literal object of the game. It’s in the title if you were smart enough to put 2 and clean together. Alright, I’ll stop saying clean.The enjoyment in this piece of technological culture is to relax, put on a podcast and zone out while your brain cells rot and your inner neat freak is unleashed, which describes exactly what I did. To say this is a completionist game is an understatement when you consider that you’re given a tool that detects even the slightest smudge of blood and your life is threatened should you not do a good enough job. A prospect I know Groundskeeper Willie would be dying to attain. At the time of this review the game is still in alpha, but it already presents to you the realization of what effect your sci-fi shoot-em-up adventures really have on the lower class.

Make them play for 5+ hours and tell them that this is their LIFE if they don't hit the books DAMN RIGHT NOW!But in all seriousness, yes, that's what you play here. A janitor. Have you ever wondered what happens after you blasted through a level in your favorite shooter and you're not in Germany, i.e. the corpses, gore, blood, guts  and other bodyparts don't simply vanish before they hit the floor? Well, this is it. The game for after the game. The alien invasion is over, our hero won and now it's time to clean up the mess.This is where you come in.Your job is to clean up the mess. To collect all those body parts and mop up the blood and gore. And as odd as it sounds, yes, that's actually fun. OCD of course helps, but even if you're not obsessed with total cleanliness, there is something ultimately satisfying to start out with a bloody mess and end up with a sparkling clean place.It is a very Zen game, though. There is nothing that would put pressure on you except your goal of cleaning it faster this time around (which usually only leads to you spilling that bloody bucket or strewing the body parts all over the place because you wanted to run with a heavy bucket), and you will spend quite a bit of time hunting down that last body part hiding behind a panel or that last speck of alien blood that you mistook for the pattern of the wall paint. Picking up bullet casings also is very ... Zen.It's also not a good idea to play this game alone in a dark room. It's quite haunting. Even though there are no living creatures but you (and your potential partners in a cleanup crew), but you are, after all, cleaning up an area where you collect bodies.

It was rather daunting upon my initial solo-working as a lowly space janitor to discover the huge messes of gore and blood left for me to clean, the basic equipment given to fix it all, and the...collectables? This mechanic alone was the intriguing portion that kept me cleaning bit after bit of Gary's, Bobby's, Sam's and Mike's from the floor that the corpses were smeared into. Finding various items such as movie references, secret letters, gizmoes that were just more references, alien heads, and so on. It was oddly fitting for a janitor to keep what no one really wanted for himself, so the basic notion that I was being encouraged to grab them helped immerse me even more into the persona of this yellow hat gentleman (And woman, as I later found out in multiplayer).-Story(?!): To be quite honest, the side stories within the various levels that tend to reference movies that the incidents that created your job of the day poke at caught my eye as I kept playing the massive zones of pure blood and guts, without the glory. The main 'plot' of you being sent to these horrific scenarios finally ended to mop up the mess like nothing special even happened was a nice point that still impresses me with its basic delivery, via PDA or the initial Mission Briefing once you start on a level. Not that it was something grand and spetacular, but I feel the makers gave the idea of space janitoring a nice twist to the average game that would suddenly turn heel and throw you into a winding plot of schemes and surprises, and instead keeping it very mellow and calm with the steady work you have to commit to achieve a good score with your employers. They even threw in a mystery or two with what exactly happens on the levels, and even outside of them! (I do refer to the Bob story, which I won't get into here, since it's meant for you to figure out yourself!)-Glitches: Now this is mostly refering to my main play-time with my friend, who rather enjoys this game with even more infatuation than I. As we Co-Op'd our way throughout the levels, I notice occasional items suddenly falling into the void of below the floor, or into a wall, which dettered our ability to achieve perfect ratings after doing a good job with those side missions to boot (I'll touch on that next). Sometimes my game will get even worse, as moving simple boxes becomes a nightmare if the trash-box is filled up, the gore glitching itself to freedom, only to still be within the containment. Othertimes, the box will just feel like bouncing madly around for me, while my friend questions my sanity as I just hold a box in my hands. Even still, the glitches I listed and a few more minor bugs never dettered me from enjoying my experience, but should be listed non the less for sake of possible fixes. Especially the glitches where collecting NEEDED secret items to complete a side story (Bob in particular) kept dissapearing from the main office and trunk whenever we switched zones together, making it near impossible for us to actually reach our goal.-Complaints: The complaints here are more personal that technical, so do not look at the developers warily, or to me for honesty, because this is mostly opinion. I did not enjoy the fact that side missions within the level are mostly obscure, in the sense that it is never listed out for you in the OBJECTIVES tab of your PDA. Later on, my friend notified me that some levels we completed had little markings about the zones to inform you of some of the missions, but not all were so nicely informative as the jungle level, with the yellow zone pointing out where to put your barrels and boxes.-Weird Suggestion: As strange as this sounds, I actually suggest maybe putting in more story to the zones. Despite the more jump-in-and-work gameplay that is the main focus of this janitorial simulation, what little pages and notes they dropped in there kept me wanting to find more and more, even the ID tags telling me what unlucky soul I shoved into a bucket was today, and inspired me to collect each one in their memory, until my friend and I just gave up and tossed them into a hole. I believe AllShamNoWow puts it best in his video, about wanting to have a story basically be a re-telling of the events on the level, as the janitor simply cleans up the aftermath.Conclusion!: In the end, after the daunting introduction of the game mechanics, the exploration of the various levels with my friend, finding the secrets and genuinely enjoying janitor work, before raging at the 50th bucket tipped over because I thought it was in the air flying madly, to the intrigueing stories on the side that I cannot complete with my friend, due to odd dissapearances of items after completely levels. All of this in conjunction leads me to finally say: This game is dope. Get it, learn it, love it, then clean it. SPACE JANI'S FOR LIFE!"

,Recommended,246900,20684304,"Posted: 22 January, 2016",all,Foxysen,"Viscera Cleanup Detail is a first person ""simulator"" game about being space janitor. In space. Sure think it's a joke simulator, but gameplay itself is not broken on purpose unlike other such games. It was developed by RuneStorm and finally released out of Steam's Early Access in 2015 after entering it in 2014. And yep, coop multiplayer is primary focus. But can solo.It actually had two stand-alone spinoff before release, which included only a single level: Shadow Warrior tie-in and Santa's Rampage. And they are going to include them both into base VCD game for free. Actually, they already did it with Santa's Rampage, Shadow Warrior one is coming soon. Which also means that this review will become outdated soon, uh oh.It also still gets a support post-launch. It's probably not going to stay forever, not every game is Minecraft. But hey, new map!Technically, it does have a bunch of physics bugs. Most often you are going to be frustrated that ""crisp"" chips packets clipped at the bottom of the bin once again. Physics items also sometimes get stuck in geometry. The best way to handle it is to grab them, then hold the grab button (it will let you to rotate it) and swing your mouse around like crazy until it glitches out. Game may also not always be fair, hiding barely visible stain behind no-collision geometry, for example.Multiplayer community is kinda dead but not really. It's just that people usually prefer playing with people they know, since in this game you can mess up progress a lot. Can ask or find coop request in the forums. But if you just want to play with strangers and public, then the only thing you can expect to see in server browser is a bunch of empty password locked servers. Oh well.Your job in this game is to clean up the level from all the trash, guts and blood which happens to be there after some disaster of alien origin. It often references famous horror movies so it's fun if you get the reference. You spawn in the level and it's your job to burn all gibs and wash up all blood and burn up bullet holes and just make it look clean for your own amusement. The core gameplay can get repetetive, but it has this relaxive feel to it, especially if you don't turn on radio. It's also fun for those who love to do stuff fully and watch the progress of level getting cleaner. That, and things can sometimes go wrong, especially if you are playing with good friends. Somebody may knock the bucket of bloody water, for example. In multiplayer the fun comes from party aspect. Maybe more fun than doing it all solo.Oh, and you also have to spend time to use radar device to find out what you missed, which may also happen to be nastily hidden if you aim for 100%. Actually, the maximum completionists also can do paperworks, in which you have to report on what you think happened. Then bring USB sticks of dead people and choose what you think happened to them. And fill in boring stuff like number of shells found. It's pretty great idea, to combine being detective and janitor, but sadly it's more mundane and I just don't want to count all the shells.But it could use more variation between levels. Well, there is some, but it's not enough. This game just doesn't fit to play fully in solo.Which is why I like how the game is structured. It pretty much says you that you aren't supposed to beat it fully or play it all in solo. There is no linear campaign at all and there is no real requirements or real progress. You just pick mode, pick the map. Well, you do get achievement for beating them. But eh. You can even clock out from the level anytime, there is no real concequence to doing awful job. Well, I still would have liked story mode, but only if gameplay was less repetetive. At least this way it doesn't push me ""beat whole game to be the men"".And to be honest, I didn't. I only have done half of levels in solo, only big levels are left. And I want to tackle them only with friends now.It also has the office into which the game sends you after clocking out. It's a very small level, your little basement-like space. The point is that only at this point do you get a feedback on your job. You have screen which shows completion state, it puts paper around the room of hiralious accidents if you forgot to clean up something. It also is just your little home filled with useless stuff and you can bring up anything you want from the levels.And there isn't much else to it. It's a nice jokeish simulator. It's a relaxish experience to play solo and it has a great party effect when playing with friends."

This game is magical.A bit hard to get used to first, there are so many precautions that are to be taken in order to clean the map with good efficiency. There are so many official maps to choose from, including the two extra games (Santa's Rampage and Shadow Warrior) that comes with this game.You can easily spend many hours playing this game. It will probably take a couple of hours for you to complete the first map you play, if you dive in without any knowledge of how to actually play, like I did. There's just so much content. I really want to see what else awaits me.The number of small things they've added to spice up the gameplay is awesome! Each map has some unique objects to it with their own properties. There are even small notes to read about the certain map you are cleaning. They've even added this little funky music player into each of the maps that you can have fun with. The rest is up to you to discover!~ Gameplay is a bit boring after a while, but what these developers have done is set everything so precisely in each map, so that when you feel that bit of boring, you're able to discover something that'll make you want to play even more. Don't even get me started on the feeling you get when you finish cleaning an area. Amazing.The graphics and performance are amazing. My computer honestly sucks. When I first opened this game, I was a bit disappointed because I was getting very low framerate. However, with a few tweaks to the options, as well as the notepad configuration settings (turning off dynamic shadows, etc.), I was able to enjoy the game with smooth gameplay. I never thought that I would see such an aesthetically pleasing game run on this screen!Get this game quick, before it leaves Early Access where the price may significantly increase.

This may be the game for you.Viscera Cleanup Detail, the name says it all. Zombie apocalypse, alien invasion, crazed mass murderer, epic fantasy battles, even casual puzzle games all focus on destruction, how to make a mess of things. You ever stop to think who had to clean up the aftermath? This game puts you on the cleaning crew for such events. The tools are simple and easy to use, while the messes may not be. It is very easy to make a mess again, especially over clean areas. There is a timer for all you record holders out there, I personally take my time. It's really about being aware of your location and equipment, to plan ahead and be efficient... just like a job in real life.It's oddly satisfying when you finally clean a whole room then look back at your work. Makes you wonder why cleaning in real life isn't as fun or satisfying, but I digress.It's a fun little time waster. Buy it, play it, clean it.P.S.

But with a friend the game become's easier and more fun. There is a total of 19 levels not including the santas rampage and shadow warrior and house of horror maps. Anyway each level has a time scale wich means that how long it can take on avarage to complete this level there is also a speedrun mode. The purpose of the mode is quite obvious wich is to complete the level in the quickest time possible . Moving on to the pros and cons of this gameProsbetter with friendslots of levels to completeif you like these type of games then it is quite challenging by challenging I mean there is a lot of thing to clean and lot's of tools to use to complete your taskintresting aspects such as replacing turrets and ammo for the turrets and replacing medickitsConsIt is pricey for the type of game that it is when its not on sale its cost 13 euro in europeIt can get boring/ tedious when stuck on the same level for more the 1 hournot so good without friendsconclusionI really enjoy this game and i would recomend it to you but if your not a fan of these type of games then obviously i wouldn't recommend it to you in my oppinion this game deserves a 7.5/10.

To top it off, the UI is not very good, the interaction with objects in the world varies from comically bad to downright glitchy/broken, your mop bucket carries next to no water (granted, the messes ARE pretty bad), and the ""story""/""narrative"" is so poorly written and explained that I wish they had just left it out entirely and left us to our ridiculous work.Overall?

The entire premise is simply cleaning up messes. There is no other gameplay. Nothing attacks you or attempts jump scares because you've arrived on the scene after all the action has happened. Unless you play with someone else, you basically don't encounter another living creature in-game. It is possible in very specific circumstances to die, but there are no repurcussions for death, you just respawn.The mechanics are all designed to be repetitive, semi-tedious busywork with mediocre tools. That being said, I find it deeply meditative to turn on some music or a podcast, enter a level and just set everything to rights. Going through an area covered in trash and gore and making it spotless... there's genuine satisfaction to be found here. I prefer to ignore the in-game evaluation system, which seems inconsistent and irritating, and just clean things to my own standards.What a typical session consists of:1) Picking up countless bits of trash and gore and running them to the incinerator. This is by far the most time consuming element. You thankfully have access to trash bins that allow you to carry more than one item at once.2) A lot of mopping. Mop buckets need to be replaced after a short while or you just redeposit filth. The dirty buckets must to be incinerated.3) Little odd jobs like welding bullet holes shut or restocking emergency kits.4) Recleaning stuff because you accidentally made it messy again with bloody boot prints, fire damage, a severed limb getting blood on something, etc.To be clear, this is not an exciting game and arguably not a fun game, but as previously stated, it can be rewarding. There are also a lot of nods to familiar gaming and sci-fi tropes or moments. The game has a dark sense of humor, evident in some of the massacre sites you encounter, and although there's no narrative to the game as a whole, every level has a vague backstory that can be explored through found objects and data logs.A couple negatives... the game has sometimes triggered motion sickness for me, some of which can be mitigated via the options, but not all. The netcode feels wonky, with more distant friends having significant lag. Obviously this doesn't make a huge difference because there's nothing happening action-wise in the game that necessitates rock solid sync-up, but the lag can do weird things to the game's physics.I would suggest watching some gameplay vids before buying this game, but I do enthusiastically recommend it for people who want to try something different."

Once you start, you can't stop.The developers actually managed to make being a janitor fun and challenging.  (Yes, I wrote that with a straight face)  What makes this game so much fun?  Trying to figure out the best way to clean up after these horrific events.  Do you start with the body parts?  The entrails?  Do you clean from the top down?  Do you start from the incinerator and work your way out or the other way around?  What about the shell casings?  Choose the wrong strategy and you end up leaving bloody footprints all over your newly cleaned floor.Your cleaning tools are a mop, unlimited supply of buckets of water, and a biohazard detector.  That's it.Another part of the challenge is the size of each level.  Just cleaning up one of these rooms would take a good 30mins.  There are several rooms and hallways on the first level alone.You have to be careful handling buckets and containers.  They can and do tip over easily.  Imagine a bucket filled with bloody water tipping over your newly cleaned floor.  FRUSTRATING.  Mopping around shell casings will send the casings rolling away.  Accidently run your mop over an entrail you didn't see?  Instant blood spatter.I'm only one level into this game but found it so much fun I had to write a review.  Hope this helps."

You start off with a mop, in a bloody mess of a room and go to work. Right away, your mop becomes so dirty it just splatters more blood on the wall, so you have to find a bucket. As you traverse the intestine and bullet casing filled area to get to the mop bucket, you begin tracking blood all over. You get your bucket, take it back to where you started, and manage to clean a good three-foot section, before your water is too dirty to clean the mop. This is also around the first time you usually kick your blood-bucket over and just spill blood all over the floor.The amount of detail is RIDICULOUS. You have to remove every shell casing, body, body part, medical waste box, every ounce of blood and alien viscera and even rpair every bullet hole in the walls. Then you have to replace toilet seats and and restock medkit supplies. When you first realise how much of a task lies ahead of you, it's actually a little daunting at first.VCD is a blast, and despite a number of bugs with lagginess, invisible co-operative players and items and so forth, it is a ton of fun to play.

Okay, well some of the garbage really is garbage, like beer cans and discarded potato chip bags, but also burning up corpses.To assist you with cleaning, you'll have a large incinerator you'll be doing laps to with trash, biological waste bins (chuck anything you like in there), mop and tons of buckets of water, a pushbroom, a ""sniffer"" that makes sounds to help you detect messes when you think you're done but may have missed some rogue blood, and a portable elevator for levels with high ceilings you need to reach. There's a fair number of levels for the money, each one can take 2+ hours to clean by yourself, and you can do time attacks if you're wanting to try to get it done quicker. Playing alone is pretty entertaining, but playing with one or more friends was quite fun for me, as you can get the cleaning done even faster and divide up your tasks with one another, helping each other out.I found this to be a really enjoyable game, but not everyone would like it. I'm pretty OCD and don't particularly like messes, so I get a euphoric sensation as I ""purify"" a level, bit by bit. If you like sci-fi settings and eliminating the scourge of messes from the galaxy, this game might just be for you!"

This game is the answer!Positive pointsGraphics- Pretty sweet and the graphic style fit perfectly to this game.- Sometimes the lights are a bit too extremeGameplay- Simple mechanics but pretty much fun. I dont really know why I enjoy cleaning a virtual room while I hate cleaning in real life o_o- The ""Cleaning machines can spit out limbs and♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; mechanic is something I really hate... just no!Maps- I like the variation of the maps. Different themes with many easter eggs and around 20 maps on count is not bad.Neutral pointsMultiplayer- Well multiplayer seems to be pretty dead. Playing with random people is a rare phenomenon. If I imagine how MP would be played by the players I can just think about a LOT of trolls ♥♥♥♥ing things up all the time so..- This game can be pretty much fun on LAN parties or if you play with friends especially if you are drunk =DNegative pointsBugs- Over the time there were many bug fixes but still there is a problem with objects glitching around. Objects can glitch under the map so you can complete the map, objects glitches through your boxes or the incinerator. Can be very frustrating cause all your work was useless in this case.- Cleaning machine sometimes just stop working so you can restart the map.Miscellaneous- On some maps there is dirt/blood on the blanket of the map so you have to build a tower with your boxes which is a very, VERY frustrating task.- My progress and my settings was reseted so many times..ConclusionFunny game which you can play from time to time. Fun factor increasing when you play it with friends. One of the few games which started as Early Access game on steam and made it to a complete game. The game is time intensive and can frustrated you sometimes but overall it is much more fun than cleaning your home in real life!"

I kept expecting to clear a level, and upgrade my character, equipment or something.  Anything.  But no, the gameplay in the first level is the total gameplay.   You never level up, or get any new or better equpment.    I say ""never"".  After only 14 hours of gameplay I can't really say ""never"".  But that's all I could handle.  If this was an Early Access game with a dedicated and involved team of developers and a vibrant community, it would be different.Then there's the bugs and glitches and lag.  You will quicly learn that many actions in the game cause your previous work to be destroyed.  When learning the game, and the proper order to do things, you will then discover the bugs that crash the game.   Do not depend on the autosaves.   Save your game each and every time you make some progress in an area.Specifically, the mechanism that allows you to carry a container with stuff in in it- that is an incredibly complex mechanic for the game engine to achieve.   I totally understand that there could be errors and glitches there.  But again, this is a ""completed"" title.I have over 4000 hours  supporting an EA game, so I definately understand the development process.  I do not see any dedication here to improving the gameplay in this supposedly completed title.   In the Steam forums, there are many unanswered bug reports.  My report went unanswered as well.$12.99 USD is way overpriced.  I think $4.99 USD would be a more appropriate price for this demo.Edit:  Remember, the Steam refund policy is for games played less than 2 hours!"

Like a lot of others have commented, you would not thing cleaning up blood, trash, body parts, shell casings and much more would be so enjoyable...but it is! There is something very enjoyable about encountering each level as a puzzle. It can take you as long as you want it to but there are methods to tackling each mess quickly. The graphics are very pleasant. Blood, corpses and body parts are laid out in such a way as to tell a story. Each level is littered with notepads describing what happened which really adds to the atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are spot on. Squishy sounds under your boots indicate you are tracking fluids as you walk. Dismembered bodies make a satisfying thump or splat when dropped. There is even a boom box in each level to add some music to work with. The amount of levels currently in the game will leave you with hours upon hours of cleaning goodness. I do have a request though. There needs to be some system of progression. Being able to upgrade your mop to clean more without using a bucket so much would be great. Perhaps some sort of deployable furnace to reduce long treks back and forth to incinerate trash. Just some incentive to actually make you want check every nook and cranny to make sure everything is perfect. The satisfaction of a job well done only goes so far. All in all, the game has been great and I look forward to way more time with it. Anyone on the fence about purchasing the game needs to remember, if it doesnt look like something you would enjoy, don't buy it.

I'll admit this is a hate it or get sucked into it title. Like in my case for example I found myself taking a quick look at the mess and just getting the kneejerk reflex of starting to clean up right away. If you get into it enough you'll find yourself having fun especially with the ridiculous nature of what you're cleaning and how you go about it. Soon enough I personally found myself watching out not to trail bloody foosteps behind me, obsessively washing every corner one at a time, strategizing with the buckets, etc. It is what it is... and it's a game; if it sucks you in, you'll be having fun!Not counted here is the time spent in the Santa's Rampage version which is where I really started actually trying to get the damn place clean. Prior to this I did some time in the space stations and before that, a quick first impressions video in which I quickly leaned all the difficult aspects of this game:http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=HFPPPydWs0I(Link to a YouTube Flash player, required for watching my video format)My only complaint? If this is to go for a story type flow, it should begin with much smaller areas to clean up. Levels around the order of 1-2hrs, then bring up the bar. Having the messes progressively revealed to us would be even more shocikng and having shorter areas to start with would give more feeling of progress.Suggestons I'd like to make are this: A bag or dust pan item that could allow us to pick up multiple small objects in one swoop instead of going one by one. Next a highlight on the item that will be picked up if the player clicks. Last but not least this game could actually benefit of a basic investigative aspect. You can't help but wonder what the hell happened in these stations and start speculating. A backstory with elements to progressively reveal it... as simple as possible... would be cool."

Perhaps change it so interacting with the door would give you this option?-""Zero-G Therapy"" level imcomplete with a door that opens and closes with no immediate effect-The sniffer device is useful for detecting messes and objects that need disposing/cleaning but a separate switch should be implemented for sniffing out dirty buckets and disposable bins to avoid frustration and confusion as i had to get rid of those buckets and bins nearby when I wanted to find a particular mess/object when those aforementioned tools could still be used.-Most of the levels require the use of the welder gun so I found it unintuitive that it had to be thrown aside everytime you wanted to switch to your hands or mop rather than being on person at all times like the aforementioned tools.-In it's current build, there can be some texture tears in some levels such as above door ways in ""Evil Science"" but these are the exceptions rather than the norm.-When the bin is overloaded with objects, the physics can cause the objects to smash and bounce around each other impractically which can result in some objects actually popping outside the bin.---------------------------------------Further Possible Improvements-Use of both hands when picking up small items, I can't tell you how tedious it gets when you're picking up the 15th bullet case in a level, one at a time, when you KNOW you have another hand free that can pick up another but instead it's just dangling in front of your face uselessly.The vendors that give you your buckets and bins has an in game script that drops giblets semi-randomly when you use them.Funny for the first few times. Not so after that, especially when you're trying to do your job quickly. If the script would just end after the first few times or have the option to turn off/on, would help eliminate this point of frustration.*Edit*Although frustrating and non-sensical, this is a feature to add more difficulty to the game apparently so probably won't be changed in future.-The sniffer works just fine as it is at the moment but if another icon could be added to show you the current position of the object its detecting in regards to your altitude that would really help out especially in hard to reach places so you don't end up spending significant time looking in the wrong place which can add to player frustration.I've come close to quitting a level because the sniffer was picking up a object/mess that i just could not find despite spending 10-20 minutes looking in the approximate area.Alternatively, have the sniffer react to where the camera cursor is pointing at so it bleeps faster as the player's cursor is getting closer to the object it's detecting.- Implementing another mode to the sniffer so dirty buckets and bins are seperate things to be detected-I like how they added the function of having to replace supplies in certain levels, this could be extended even further by maybe having to replace light sources as well?-Make the toilets flushable in ""Evil Science"" level!-Achievements-Add interactivity to the office door so it offers option to choose another level or exit to main menu.-----------------------------------------------------Reviewing this game was difficult since some of the points I raised, someone else may argue is what adds to the gameplay however as these are points that were reached only after extensive play throughs, I do feel they warrant some consideration.Overall though, I really like this game, there's a certain therapeutic feeling to cleaning all the muck and gunk that a level comes loaded with and you get a certain satisfaction when you feel you cleaned up a area nicely.Truly one of a kind game. Plays very well in its current build and with a few additions would make for a great game.Would currently highly recommend for those looking for something different.06.03.14 (MM/DD/YY)*Edit*07.03.141. Changed point about the sniffer modes as the pinned thread explains the first two functions which i reprimanded2. After reading the pinned thread, seems the vendor special feature is an intentional feature not to be changed, previous point about vendor's changed to reflect that."

In Viscera Cleanup Detail, it is the janitors job (and therefore your job) to clean up after a horrific sci-fi massacre. The game has several mechanics that can be hard to grasp for beginners, beause there is no real tutorial level. (There is however, a downloadable tutorial level on the worksohp) When you are playing alone, it can be a bit dreary, but not exactly hard. The real fun in this game is working with others, with accidents to be had, and new strategies to cleanup levels with increasing size/ decreasing gravity.   (it is a space game afteral).

I have a few recommendations for it though as it seems they have still a few problems. They should add a crouch button, and make it so buckets stack better. Because it seems like they keep adding updates which is nice but! There is still quite a few small bugs that make the game unable to get the full experience for. So I think they should fix the bugs before they add new and improved levels. Also this game definitely needs a workshop or a place to download mods. Other than some of the problems I'd say this game is pretty nice and gives people a calm feeling. I give it 8/10 - Extremely nice simple game, very good."

I've had this game since the near beginning, and it has come to be one of my favorites. I had at first purchased it as a joke, not expecting much. The concept of being a janitor in space sounded silly to me and I figured I'd give it a whirl. I was surprised to find out how much fun being a janitor actually was. There's something oddly relaxing about cleaning up all the blood and body parts in singleplayer, not to mention it's a good way to kill time.  If you're not into singleplayer, the multiplayer will be a major selling point for you. Grabbing some friends and cleaning up horrendous massacres together will lead to many great laughs.One of the best aspects of this game are the developers themselves. The guys at RuneStorm have put in a lot of hard work and dedication to make this game so great. They constantly update the game and keep the community informed as much as they can, something which I greatly appreciate. Thank you RuneStorm for everything you have done.I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you have buddies to play it with. 11/10"

With this game, it's you. Move over, space marines, and let the space janitor through.It's a strange game, for sure. The gameplay and atmosphere remind me a bit of Portal, and vaguely of Surgeon Simulator. The game is exactly what it says on the tin- you run around with a mop and bucket, cleaning up after various sci-fi disasters. The goal is to take the warzone and make it good as new by mopping up and incinerating all evidence, and tidying up what's left. It can be somewhat repetitive and sometimes frustrating, but it's more about the big picture than instant gratification, and various levels do come with their own unique challenges. Overall, it's great zen game for obsessive compulsives like me who get a huge sense of satisfaction from setting things right. I'm very much enjoying myself.Unfortunately, it does make me motion sick, so if you're prone to motion sickness like I am, maybe just be aware of that. It does give you the option of changing the FOV, though, which goes a long way to improving the experience!"

HOWEVER: I cannot imagine playing this game otherwise for more than a few hours.There are some small flaws with the game too. The physics engine is prone to glitching, which never leads to anything good. Trying to find a tiny mess is infuriating if you can't see it easily. And a tutorial would have been nice; you might think it's just ""mop blood and use buckets"" but there's actually some stuff that isn't obvious. Use the wiki often. Considering the rest of the experience is fine, these issues aren't too big.Again, I'll sum up this game by saying: if you don't have friends or something to listen to, just don't buy it. But if you just want a game that you can play while listening to a podcast or music, buy it now."

For example, if you knock over a used mop bucket, it pours whatever you were cleaning up all over the floor.  However, overall the concept of Viscera Cleanup Detail is a very unique take on the physics sandbox genre.  One that I think I'll enjoy for some time.A review wouldn't be a review without at least one negative point, and from the time that I've played thus far (Admittedly that isn't long, though I do plan to sink some more time into this today and in days to come) I do have a few.The bloom lighting, while beautiful, looks a bit off at times, and can be excessively used in certain areas of some of the game.There's a real lack of ambient audio, and given that you're the only (living) person on the station, it'd be nice to have something to listen to while you're toiling away.Okay, so only two negative things that I can think of off the top of my head.  All in all, VCD is a greatly underrated game in my opinion, and at the time of writing this review, it is currently on sale for less than 5 dollars, every penny of which I feel it is worth.I hope you've found my review to be helpful. I don't often feel compelled enough to write one, but I think that this game gets a lot more negative comments than it deserves."

76561197996031175,Recommended,246900,18665760,"Posted: 24 October, 2015",all,Team Vladof,"Pros:+ Interesting ""anti"" game; feels like discovering an unlockable play mode in a more ""serious"" FPS game+ Good for OCD, Project-oriented, Process-optimization types of folks, or just folks that had more fun in ""serious"" games messing around then playing the ""real"" game+ Game starts like an actual min wage job. No tutorial; just dumped into the middle of things. So, you have to experiment to learn how to use your tools. First level may turn into an absolute mess/disaster as you do, but it'll be entertaining.+ As you conquer the learning curve, find efficiency methods, formulate plans to tackle certain levels, etc, you get a certain satisfaction of being a pro cleaner. It's more then just mindless grunt work. There's strategy involved, and art form, especially when your cleaning supply machines are located in different parts of the level. (Do you pick up itmes first, and make a mess of the floor while walking every where? Or, do you mop first, but stack up the buckets until you can finally get to the incinerator? How long can you keep using buckets as cut-rate disposal bins until a path is clear to the actual disposal bins? etc, etc)+ Game has lots of potential. Developers say they're planning a mod tool, and being a janitor by yourself at some place during off-hours screams ""potential"" in what you could eventually have the janotor do... find secret passages, solve puzzles, etc... all while cleaning. The cleaning scenarios can also expand greatly... have a level where you clean up a government assassination gone wrong, clean a crime scene and alter it to place the blame on someone else, clean up the results of mini-guns consantly holding off an assault on a base, etc ... this game and the concept has so much potential to tap via the Devs and the Fan Community.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cons:- I mentioned the potential as a ""pro"", but the current levels don't exercise it enough, and as such it's a ""con"" for them They don't take advantage of their settings to let you do more then just clean. EG:The Office has a few secret areas. But, other levels don't really have much. You get some back-story, but no exploring, secrets, mysteries to solve, fix major issues, experiment with issues that caused initial catastrophe, etc. Nothing. Just cleaning.- Unforgiving game mechanics are aggravating at times. EG: buckets tip over too easily making a mess sometimes (even when you're just trying to dunk your mop in them). The welder to seal bullet holes can make a royal mess if not pulsed carefully. Mopping can be tedious with all the buckets you have to haul, etc)- Malfunctioning tools are also very aggravating. The devs decided to be jackasses by making the bucket and bin dispensing machines spew out body parts every now and then, but they do it way too often to be funny; just aggravating. Also, the platform machine that lets you clean higher surfaces malfucntions every other time you use it, from minor jams to major errors that will send you and anything on it flying. This happened 3 times in a row while I was trying to use it, spilling the gear I had on the thing. All of this is ""haha"" funny the first time (""lol, this is just like a real-life min wage job with tools that hardly work."") But, it's just a huge PITA afterwards. They need to make an option to turn it off, so folks that just want to zone out with the game don't have to worry about faulty equipment ruining the experience.- Some levels are designed to purposefully be aggravating. Some have layouts where you need to carefully plan your cleaning, since the machines are in different rooms. But, some levels have the incinerator on one side of the level and the bin/bucket machine on the other. This just creates this massive annoyance of having to spend hours walking back-n-forth ad nauseum. It's not fun, especially when the bucket machine dumps a bucket due to poor ability to grab/operate things.- The welder in general deserves special note, because it's so tedious and time-consuming to use. You can't just blast a wall with it, otherwise it makes a huge mess of soot that you have to mop up. Plus, you have to blast each individual bullet hole or indention separately. Make it where it mends everything in a 4'x4' vacinity or something. IE: the welder should be akin to more of a ""magic wall eraser"" instead of an actual spot welder. Some levels have like 30 bullet holes in a tiny area, and you will waste a good 10 minutes just zapping your welder. It's boring, there's no strategy to it, and it makes me want to stop playing certain levels.- Game really needs some kind of progression. You go through levels, and you can get some awards that stack up in your Office. But, you don't get any money, so you can't upgrade your tools. You don't have a skill, so you can't get better at mopping (other then just learning how to do it better as a player). The Office needs to get fleshed out as a trophy room much more by letting you solve certain hidden goals or activities in levels (more then they have now), then The Office gives you a display case showing a progression. Likewise, make the game a campaign. Let the player start off with small messes, then work their way towards larger levels with more interesting dynamics, better gear, so forth. In this way the small levels can act as a tutorial. It just seems like the game needs some kind of progress to feel like you're working a career instead of isolated instances."

It's amazing both how competent or incompetent a bunch of random strangers can be at a job.Surprisingly, real janitors play it. As pilots play flight simulators, model railroad hobbyists play Train Simulator and farmers play Farming Simulator.I'm not a janitor, by far. I'm too smart for my own good to be a janitor - but not as smart as that mathematician janitor guy in that movie.Do I play this as a janitor or do I play this as a puzzle, a logistics problem (perhaps I am a little bit like that mathematician guy in that movie)?Whether to relax meditatively, joke online or find the most efficient and productive method to get the job done, no other game like this exists, nor any that combines all of this."

I am changing now the verdict (original review still below).Despite some small bugs, an horrible way to make a match (it is very difficult and many times you won't even understand why friends can't join you) and a bit of un-optimization in terms of graphics (too heavy for what it offers), I fell in love with the game.It is one of the best coop games out there, it can be REALLY funny....all the gags that happen while you clean or just your colleagues making jokes, and the feeling of teamwork....yes, you 'only' have to clean, but damn if there are good cleaners and bad cleaners....when the job is done right it's pure satisfaction. This is a try and love/hate game, you better give it a go if you can survive with some glitches. The game is very cheap anyway.One idea that I just got is that maybe the maps should be randomly changed: the corspes and blood stains are always in the same places, in would be cool to randomize that, that would give more replayability to the game, it is still fun to clean the same room multiple times though, with different partners.OLD REVIEW BELOW (it was a negative review). They didn't fix anything really of what I said, I just got around it or got used to it, and it was worth it anyway.-------------------------BEWARE!!!!I haven't tried this game while it was in early access. I bought it now that it has finally been released.To be honest the game is far from finished. The matchmaking is very complicated, even making a friend join your game is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There are no dedicated servers, that means someone around you has to have started a game as a host, and you 'should' be able to see him in the server list. Sometimes there are, many many times there isn't anyone hosting.I hosted a game a couple times and nobody ever joined.This is a network detail.....the game is super fun and with friends is a killer. It runs also quite well although it is not perfectly optimized (getting framerate drops for no reason) and there are still some glitches (limbs inserted in trash bins will clip inside each other and flying all over the room when they glitch out, walking stutters when playing online).That means: beware, I don't think the game is really finished yet, I tried to play it online and have fun with it for the past 3 days but nope, there was always some problem. Playing alone is absolutely no problem, but that destroys the purpose of this game.I will absolutely change this review as soon as they fix what is to be fixed and make the matchmaking a bit better....the game would be really fun if it were possible to just connect to someone and play without problems."

The idea of cleaning in a game to me sounded pretty boring, but since the game was on sale, I decided to buy it and in the first 30 minutes of play, I enjoyed the game very much, but in the final 30 minutes of play, the novelty wore off and everything I was doing just felt boring and I didn't feel any enjoyment from playing. Viscera Cleanup Detail is a nice idea, but the developers need to think of new ways to keep the player interested. If you want to buy Viscera Cleanup Detail, I would wait till the price decreases in a sale, that way you won't feel as much regret from buying it.4/10 - Overall, good concept, but the game needs a lot more work to keep the player interested in playing."
76561198055199904,Not Recommended,246900,33550731,Posted: 14 July,all,jamescb2010,"An interesting idea, but very poorly executed. From the wonky controls, both in game and in the menus, to the lack of clear direction and information about your task, to the tedious gameplay adding unnecessary frustration, the game feels unfinished, years after being deemed complete enough for a full release.You start out with an incredibly large map filled with thousands of things to clean up, from dead bodies/body parts, to bullet shells and general debris, and it is your task to clean  it all up, presumably in between the previous player and the next player.It seems daunting, but if you take it a small amount at a time, work your way through the map, and slowly clean up the area and bring it back to the way it looked before the implied carnage, you eventually start to feel rewarded for having completed such a large task, in a slow yet steady pace.That's how the game should be.But you slowly realize that the mop needs cleaned way too often, the disposal systems are way too far away and cannot be moved, some tools cannot be picked up permanently and therefore need to be picked up and moved every time you need to use them like the broom and cleanup gun, and how the previously mentioned cleanup gun is incredibly fickle, meaning it works against you more than for you. All these, plus the hours upon hours it can take to clean up one map due to its size, the directions that don't tell you what belongs in the map and what doesn't, and hub area that acts as little more than a place to show you how you screwed up.The controls are difficult and imprecise. You will constantly knock over buckets, leave trails of blood, footprints, and burn marks all over the place, and drop or hit viscera everywhere, redirtying the floors and walls you just cleaned. The physics of the containers means you can only fit about 5 objects in them, and constantly make grating noises and shake, making them a pain to use and a pain to move.The whole game feels like it's trying to make your already difficult task even more difficult, working against you far more often than for you. As a concept, it works, but in practice, it could use years more polish, and the developers have more or less forgotten about it for at least 6 months at time of writing.In conclusion, a good demo, but your money is better spent elsewhere."

While it may not sound fun, it is incredibly satisfying to see a dirty room become sparkling clean again. After a few hours of cleaning everything and fighting the physics, you're finally ready to clock out and see what kind of rating you got. The only problem? After spending two hours with a friend cleaning up a one hour map, checking and rechecking everything, what's the rating you get? 68 % cleaned. Oh yeah, and you're fired.This kind of slap in the face completely kills any satisfaction you might have received from the cleaning itself. It's not relaxing. It's not satisfying. You only get frustrated because no matter what you do, there will always be something that you missed, even though you can't even see it. It is impossible to get a perfect rating. If you don't care about being scolded for performing poorly after being very proud of doing a good job, don't hesitate to buy this game. But if you do care about that, then I would not recommend this game."

The multiplayer is where it all goes downhill, as even small levels for us quickly ran into the physics engine going berserk, randomly spilling buckets and biohazard containers.  Also, the engine gave warnings about the number of actors, which would cause scenes to render completly differenly and de-sync, even on two good gaming machines in the same network.  The multiplayer bugs ultimately were too frustrating to fight against and we ceased trying."

You know, you get to see what happened after they saved the world and play your own small part in humanity's salvation. Unfortunately, that's not what this game is. What this game is, is incredibly stressful. I admit, I didn't play it very long. I didn't give it a very fair chance. But that's because, in the first however many minutes I played, I had to replace my mop bucket ten times. Every third mop bucket I got from the mop bucket machine, three more new pieces of gore were pumped out, splashing blood all over the place I just cleaned and giving me more stuff to dump into the incinerator. ... Why? What is the point of that? Furthermore, the controls are non-intuitive and over-sensitive. Good luck getting that torso into the incinerator without splashing gore all over the place.This is less of a game and more of a chore.

The turn speed will be way too fast/slow, the sensitivity was way too high, the mouse speed will have to change, and there'll have to be a few changes to adjust the graphics to your liking. I literally spent 15 minutes changing the settings.Fortunately for the game's creators, the game does have some pros:-The game IS fun when you ignore the bugs. You can spend a couple hours on just one map--more if you like fooling around.-Each map has its own story to tell and many fun things to interact with.-You can play with body parts. ( That sounded less creepy in my head. )And that's all the pros i can really think of. If the pros outweighed the cons, I'd recommend this game.

The mechanics of the game fails in a couple of places:A) You've cleaned the level, but the punch-out console reveals the job is not done: you pull out your sniffer tool to complete the finishing touches to only find it is entirely unhelpful.  You're left with the dilema of wandering about, what appear to be pristine halls, with a tool that doesn't do the job - of letting you finish.  Fix it, or allow the sniffer to ""zap"" clean small areas with a long timer when a large percentage of the map is clear.B) The mopping mechanic is great, tediously picking up each shell casing and each tiny gib of viscera is not.  A dustbin and broom solves the problem and works with the best mechanic.  Or use a metal and and organic magnet tool that pulls small objects to it, by way of spraying gore and machine oil everywhere as the solid chunks get attached to it.C) Let the good times roll:  the bloody gibs should be, for purposes of mopping up more fun, dripping and oozing - encourage people to either deploy bins and store the gibs, with small drips - or be ""punished"" by having to mop up the gore trails to the incinerators."

At the same time though, I can see how that might go against the design philosophy. It really is a game built to revel in the mundanity, at which it absolutely succeeds. It's just kind of a sad reminder of the times that even ""space janitor"" is somehow a gripping escapism for some.There will still be occasional instances of gibs or spatters ending up out of bounds or stuck inside an impossible piece of geometry, but otherwise 8/10 would play to escape existential crises again.

It seemed like a nice take on the whole ""alien shooter"" genre and he said he wasn't playing anything else, so I bought it.I loaded an easy mission. Something about plants going wild and killing people. There was no tutorial, so I had to figure out everything. Turns out it's relatively simple. Use the bin dispenser to carry large amounts of body parts/trash to the incinerator. Use the mop bucket dispenser to get water to mop up the blood. Repeat until finished.So I went at it, happily picking up body parts and burning them without so much as a prayer to whatever god allowed this atrocity to happen. Sucks to be you, nameless employee! I spent several hours cleaning up messes, plagued by clunky controls where I accidentally bump something I'm carrying into something else only to watch both items fly across the room, or by dropping a tiny bit of flesh onto the ground and watching a gallon of blood appear out of nowhere, or by knocking over a mop bucket despite being nowhere close to it, then getting another mop bucket to clean that mess up only to spill that one too, by having to individually pick up hundred of bullet casings, or even by turning the mop bucket/ trash bin dispenser's on only to have gore fall out (as though that makes any sense).FINALLY, I finish the level. Every speck of blood is cleaned up. Every bit of gore is burned. Every inch of this place has been meticulously checked and rechecked by that nifty gore-detector thing. So I'm confident- absoutely confident- that I'm done. I go to clock out, run through a list of questions that make no sense or that ask for information that I don't have or that ask my opinion on how I did but don't give me any hint about whether or not me being confident or humble is better. I make my best guesses and submit.I get demoted.What the ♥♥♥♥.So I google why. Turns out you have to have every single bin upright. Every mop bucket has to be burned- even new, unused ones. The incinerator door has to be closed. Probably some other stuff.What the ♥♥♥♥. Okay, give me a slap on the wrist for the door being open or the buckets being left around. But holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ I spent several hours of my life cleaning up a fake mess and I get ♥♥♥♥ing demoted because the game failed to explain exactly what my duties were.I haven't played since.

,Recommended,246900,30408975,Posted: 9 March,all,Viking Mana,"This game is an oddity.To give you an idea of what it's about, you're basically the guy who deals with levels from action games, once the protagonist has come and gone. You're cleaning up the gory mess left behind. Why are you doing this? I honestly have no idea. How are you doing it? Throwing bodies and coffee mugs into a furnace, picking bullet casings off the ground, and mopping up pools of blood.I picked this game up because I was waiting for another game to come out, and I didn't feel like starting a serious playthrough of anything. The way I like to play it is to have something running on my second monitor while I do so. I have not played the co-op, and I don't plan on doing so at this point in time, but you can play it with a friend if you so desire. I don't know how entertaining that would be though. As stated, this is more of an activity to me than it is a game. It's something to keep me occupied.That's about all this game does well - It's a good distraction. A nice activity that requires minimal thinking.There are a few things I don't enjoy. Some levels have odd and obscure mechanics associated with them, and they aren't really explained to you directly. In fact, the game barely tells you anything! I could be obnoxious and say that it's the ""Dark Souls of Sanitization-Simulators"", but it's actually a real issue. I had to google a lot of information for this game, before I understood all of it's hidden mechanics and obscure objectives. That's definitely unfortunate.The puzzle-elements are the same over and over again, and so is the bulk of the gameplay. It's repetition for hours. Beating a dead horse with a mop, if you will. Except you're picking up the dead horse and throwing it in a furnace over and over again.The biggest issue that for how little it does, it doesn't even do it very well. Physics are a major issue. In a game where you're repeatedly asked to stack boxes, you need to be able to rely on gravity working as intended. This isn't always the case, and suddenly a stack of boxes might start to move on it's own. Items might get stuck in the floor, or refuse to fit into your bins for transport. Said bins might randomly fling half their contents across the room. Strafing a bucket might cause it to spill it's contents all over the floor for no discernible reason. Items like the portable lift are designed to barely function, with it occasionally jamming or launching you at the ceiling. The only issue here is that it happens more often than the thing functions, and while it's all fun and wonky the first few times, it began to rub me the wrong way after having to use the damn thing more than a dozen times in the first map I played. Now I despise the thing. Whenever it's an option, I'd rater try and stack boxes to reach my goal, than use that thing.But even though this game might sound overwhelmingly negative, I do actually recommend the game. It's fun, and you'll probably get your money's worth of entertainment from it. Of course if you haven't gotten this game in a bundle or on offer already, then you've probably already made up your mind to never play it anyway."

Strangely addicting to clean up these bloody, gorey messes.  Everyone that has just glanced at this game says the same thing: ""Why would anyone find this fun?!?""  But then they try it and they're like ""I have no idea why, but I love this game o.o "".At the time of this review, it's still in early access, but one thing I consider to be a 'con' has stayed consistent throughout ALL versions of this game, including the completed ""Shadow warrior"" installment:  Unbelievably glitchy physics.  Stacking ammo shells into the waste bins and then dropping heavy body parts on top should not cause, for instance, the shells to be pushed out of the bottom of the waste bin when you move it.  Tho that is a somewhat rare occurence.  Other times it's body part flying when you don't mean it, buckets toppling over from just a casual brush against or your character getting pushed back easy or you accidentally tip over a full waste bin by accidentally hitting the side with a shell casing.All in all, the game is great fun.  The cons don't outweigh the pros.Some things that still need work and will most likely (or maybe?) get it:-better stability on larger levels in multiplayer (As of 4/17/14, The evil science lab and sewer levels are unplayable on multiplayer)-Better Physics tweaks-voice overs (It just feels missing after all the one liners present in shadow warrior version :P )-Better view point/carrying positions-A female janitor (please? :o )The only game breaker is the multiplayer stability at this point and since another update has come out 4/18/2014, maybe it's fixed?  Either way, I recommend this one."

It's an interesting twist to be the one cleaning up the Alien War, rather than being part of it. You never know what gorey mess is right around the corner for you to clean up. It's probably much more fun with friends.Pros- Realistic Janitor Simulator- Interesting concept- Very well designed levelsCons- Controls are kind of wonky, especially playing with a controller. My character kept jerking forward sporadically, causing many mop bucket spills. This only really seemed to happen with a controller.- Can get repetitive and boring fast.- Low replay value- No real instructions of what to do or how things work (like the Sniffer, or that the ""laser rifle"" is actually a welder to fix bullet holes).Another complaint that I have is that the Dispensers, after using them a fair amount, will occasionally drop gore and body pieces, thus stalling the completion of the work.  I don't really see the point in having this happen, as it's just an added annoyance in a game that can be plenty frustrating without it.I like the game, don't get me wrong.

And it's just stupid and silly, in a good way. It reminds me of Surgeon Simulator. Remember all those messes you made in games like Dead Space, Aliens, and others? Well, now it's time to clean it up. Your main objective is to clean everything. From all the severed body parts, to all the alien goop and blood, all the bullet shells, even potato chip bags and soda cans. Your main tools are your mop, your hands, your sniffer, and the shovel. You'll need more than that though. You need a bucket to wash off your mop, waste bins to pick up all the trash, and the incinerator, to burn the trash. The graphics are pretty nice themself. The blood textures are nicely done, and the shadows (Although you yourself do not have a shadow), and the lighting. It's all well done. I just wish you could see yourself, because it gives you an option to change the colors of your outfit, and there's no good way to see it yourself. And, another thing that should be mentioned, is that the game does a fantastic job of playing with your OCD. For example, sometimes when you go to grab a bucket of water or a waste bin, the machine will instead spit out body parts, leaving you to clean up the extra blood and trash. And, you MUST, watch your step. Because if you knock over your bucket that has all the blood and water you've cleaned up, you'll have enough anger and frustration to punch a small child. But aside from that, there's not much to complain about. I just wish there was a manual, or something to make me understand what the stuff on the Sniffer means. And sometimes the physics would ping objects out of the waste bin I was carrying, but that's expected. The levels themselves are quite nice, with loads of things to clean. At the pace I was going, which is normal, I would say, that each one will last you at least two hours. And I haven't checked, but I think there are eight or ten levels. Now, I haven't tried out multiplayer yet, but I'm looking forward to, because I would like to help someone clean. There are also collectibles in the game. There's a laser gun that I picked up, but I haven't found much use for it.

76561198040868056,Recommended,246900,16431948,"Posted: 15 June, 2015",all,ZuTheSkunk,"So I am walking around, cleaning stuff up and constantly questioning myself why do I put this much effort into it. Especially considering that the game doesn't even provide any clear guidelines for how well you're supposed to do your job, beyond the basic ""clean this up"".In general, the game works well and is strangely relaxing and engaging. The controls are fine and the given tools provide everything you need to do your job well. I found it amusing (and realistic) how the mop gets dirty when you use it repeatedly, and how the water in your bucket also gets grimy from overuse. Everything gets pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.That said, it's clear that the game still needs improvement in some areas. To list a few things that bugged me:- There's no tutorial. Yes, you can look things up on Google and stuff, but what good modern game out there has no tutorial? Not only can it result in someone getting scared away from the game, but there's a LOT of little details and such that affect your score, and which you aren't informed about and can't really learn about them in-game in a way other than via pure dumb luck (or, in some cases, via people's complaints in your office). Looking up a wiki dedicated to the game is absolutely essential if you want to know how the hell you're supposed to do your job correctly.- It can be ridiculously easy to break lamps sometimes. It's especially aggravating when you need some light in a tight corridor, and you have to go back and forth between the mess and the water bucket or a trash bin, with a lamp in your way. It's made all the worse by the fact that the collision in those tight corridors (I'm referring here especially to the ones from the Waste Disposal level) can cause your character to really bizarrely jump around, making it very easy to knock a lamp over.- The game can be really unfair at times with the stuff it gives you to clean up - like barely visible bullet holes you have to fix up, or blood stains that you can't really reach without resorting to the noclip cheat. On top of that, even if you use the sniffer tool to find what messes you left out, some of the less noticeable ones can't really be found without abusing the noclip cheat to get really, REALLY close to the source of the mess.- For some bizarre reason, I couldn't get on top of the stairs that should theoretically let me get out of a sewage pool in the Waste Disposal level. I had to use the noclip cheat every time I jumped in there and wanted to get out.- The game really needs to do something about the blood stains that end up on the ceiling. In the Waste Disposal level, there was simply no way to reach them without the noclip cheat, and while the Unrefinery level offered a portable elevator, it was so unreliable and so annoying to use that the noclip cheat was a better option anyway.- The bucket and trash bin dispensers randomly jamming up and throwing up body parts. What. That is just cruel and not fun.SUMMARY: As it is, the game is nicely thought out and works pretty well, offering a strangely satisfying and relaxing gameplay. However, it still needs improvement in order to provide a fairer level of challenge and to be less needlessly cryptic. Also, once you beat a level with a satisfactory score, there is little reason for you to replay it, so the game's replay value is rather limited, at least in solo mode. Still though, the game as a whole seems definitely worth recommending."

Oh, it is.Although I have a sneaking suspicion that this is in fact not a simulation but a clever trick by aliens to force us simple humans to clean up their messes, I love this game. Each scenario has a clear ""story"" so you can infer form the remains what took place, which is super cool to me. Additionally, once you get the hang of things, it's a great way to manage your raging OCD or feel like you're actually accomplishing something for once, even though it's just a game.Of course, there are some issues with the physics spazzing and bullets launching into all corners of the map, but these are being worked on. For a game still in its beginning stages, VCD is already incredibly well-done - even including some fun little easter eggs along the way. The only major complaint that I have is that several achievements are still not working, but hopefully these will be cleared up soon.

Even offers Co-op mode with functional server window and all, but you can check in the guides of this games community hub for helpful tools to make it easier to connect with your friends.You are put into the shoes of an employee (you can customize your appearance abit, just name and colors. You cannot choose to be female or male atm) of space clean up complany, probably called ""Viscera Cleanup Detail"". Your job is to simply clean up aftermath of the action hero who stood up against the alien invaders (and put innocent lives in danger as comedic value in the background story items you can collect):1. Take all burnable trash to the incinerator (human/alien remains, bullet casings and regular trash items like soda cans and empty chips bags)2. Thoroughly mop the place clean of any kind of dirt (human/alien internal fluids, ash from burn marks and chemical spills)3. Utilize welder to fix bullet holes in any possible surfaces and replace crucial items in specific locations like: Sentry turrets on their mounts and medical supplies into wallmounted first aid units.4. Do after clean up check with your sniffer to find what you missed, since muck can be stuck on floor, walls and even the ceiling.5. Loot every thing you want to take with you, but putting them into your storage box that comes with you to the workplace, and then move the items into your office. Your office also holds some secrets to be discovered.6. Or make a bigger mess with special items you find in the map, cover the walls in blood and gunk with your mop (Unfortunately there is decal limit in this game which will prevent further decals when hit) or overload your computers processors with huge amount of physics based spawnable items.You are given selection of tools which you have to use to clean up the mess. Mop, your hands and Sniffer with sloshbuckets, movable lights, flares (hard to use since you need a source to ignite it) and trashbins, there are some extra tools too, which depend on the map.This game can make cleaning up your own house in real life more amusing, but probably not that much, as you will be very unlikely to be forced into incinerating remains of humans and aliens without repercussions.Lastly: I suggest this game over that ""Sunset"" game. Reasons?Because you can do the actual work in Visceral Cleanup Detail, rather than stare at loading screens during everything you do in Sunset and it's portrayal of black female housekeepers as lazy thieves.Well, unless you love a game with more internal monologues, sitting and walking simulation, I can't stop you."

It is literally genre defining.This game is just entertaining. In the past, we've had many many career related games, games like Paperboy, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Flight Simulators, games where you drive a supply truck cross country, games where you're an investigator, games where you work in a factory, games where you're a hitman, games where you're a farmer, games where you run your own Space research and exploration administration, games where you're an astronaut, and games where you're a plumber (ba-dump tshh.)But, I have not come across a game where you play as a janitor (and actually do janitorial work, I'm looking at you Sierra!)Viscera Cleanup Detail is this game. You have to mop, pick up trash, burn trash, burn body parts, replace medkits, cover up giant sand monsters, cleanup bullet shells, and face your superiors ranking your performance.In all seriousness, that is the game. Ever heard of Doom, or Dead Space? In this game, you clean up areas that look like the areas you visit in those games after all the carnage is over. Sprinkled throughout some of the levels are various logs of the strike teams that went through it, or the scientists/personnel who were there in the first place.The game is still in heavy development, but is still really entertaining. Fans of Minecraft I think would like this, because although the goal is to clean everything, the game doesn't punish you in any way if you don't. You can pretty much do whatever you want with the tools, body parts, guns, and blood splatters given to you. It is largely a self motivated game. The latest update added an additional mechanic to the game, and I truly believe this game could become something amazing as development continues, plus it has Steam Workshop integration! Custom map creation abound!The humor of the game is fresh and funny, and it even has multiplayer support, The game is also very suitable to play while listening to a podcast or a let's play of a game you don't necessarily need to pay full attention to."

Overall I would say this game is pretty straight-forward and fairly solid with the exception of Biohazard bins occasionally freaking out when full of physics objects (which is understandable as physics objects have a tendency to misbehave in confined spaces and in tight groupings.) Personally I absolutely adore the fact that the game allows you your own personal trunk to transport items to and from your personal office, it makes it that much more satisfying to clean because when I find neat little objects that I want to keep for myself, I can!Bottom line: If you were even remotely interested in this game, just get it, you'll probably like it."

The game allows you to collect anything you can fit in your janitors chest to bring back to an office. this adds a nice little collection element as well.the problems with it lie in things like lighting and glitches due to the nature of the physics engine. sometimes blood is under the textures here and there and sometimes a box full of bodyparts will shimmay around and spill out making a huge mess but these are forgivable and the game is a work in progress so i am confident it will only get better.The novelty and love put into this game make it a must own for any steam user"

The basic mechanics are there, but for multiplayer, there are a lot of issues, ranging from latency to textures and objects flat out flipping out.  Most of the issues regarding latency and visual bugs drop as play progresses (And the server has much less to keep track of) but are very noticeable at first.  Probably the biggest issue is the problem of overlapping dirty footprints.  While I would normally think nothing of walking over a dirty floor repeatedly, as dirt is dirt, the game registers every single step and remembers it until it is clean, requiring many high-traffic areas to be cleaned both repeatedly, and constantly, to prevent objects, players, and textures from suddenly vanishing or behaving in bizarre ways.The speed run concept is interesting, and I would like to see this developed further, especailly for competitive play.Some of the concepts in the game are, as of yet, only half implemented.  Promotions, ranks, and being fired serve as little more than an in-game joke.  There is little need for a Janitor's Chest, as there is nothing of interest to bring to the office, which in itself is already overcluttered with random debris.Overall, I feel with some polish and maybe some other and explicitly stated objectives, the game could become something fun with a novel concept.  Something as simple as a tutorial or instruction level would make all the difference.But because it is early alpha, I'd recommend it in hopes that the creators are working on the flaws."

It is very repetitive and boring. All you do is disposal, cremation and mopping. Only replay value is in trying to achieve 100% performance rate for each map. It is just boring. So I highly recommend you play this game. Why? Cause sometimes games don't need to be fun. Think of the game Minecraft. People who don't know the rules might find it very boring and time-wasting. But when you know the rules, and sit down to play a game, you will still say it is boring, but you have been playing for 6 hours straight. Same idea here.I wanted to try out the game for a couple of hours. Told myself that i will only spend 1 hour. I ended up spending 5 hours cleaning the map spotless.

There is a multiplayer to this game, although I have not done it myself. There is a wide selection of official maps, ranging from small, quick maps (and by quick I mean hour, hour and a half) to large, very cluttered maps that will take a few saves worth of time. As much as you might need a good computer to play this, I can run VCD on a $300 laptop, although not very smoothly. The Workshop for VCD is very much alive, allowing players to use the Unreal Developer Kit to make maps and share them through the Workshop. The only things I didn't like about VCD is the physics in it.

Want a game where you can rage after making some mistakes? Like accidentally kicking a bucket full of blood? dropping some little pieces when overfilling a bin? or accidentally blowing yourself up in the process? Then this is the game where you could chat with your mates while working it out to pass the time.Besides what's missing right now is the Server system where you don't have to input an IP Address to join a friend like Terraria frustrating enough, The other is having a Steam Workshop. Where you can play various other maps made by other people to clean more forms of mess. Why? Shadow Warrior has their own cleanup! So does Santa! Some parts of Postal 2 could use a good cleanup and so does Dead Space!Verdict: 7.5 / 10 for the moment, Review will change at final version."

The premise is simple. You are a janitor and you are hired to clean up the mess left by [insert typical Sci-Fi shooter/horror scenario here]. each of these scenarios themeselves are references to various tropes with the damage being done by typical mishaps like a supervirus or messages scattered around detailing how one of the scientists turned into a world-saving badass despite the odds. You end up painstakinly clean up the place, mopping up the bloodsplatters, picking up the casings, restock the med-dispensers, weld the bullet holes shut and ofcourse incinerate all those body parts. When done you are sent to the office which acts a sort debriefing, detailing your performance through humorous news articles. Forgot a casing? report how someone tripped over it and died...This game is one of those perfect time-killers. you just toil away within it while waiting for other stuff or to just kill time.Unfortunatly wether you would enjoy it is a matter of taste. the devs really should make a demo version of a small level when the game nears release"

The frequent addition of new high-quality content is also quite satisfying, keeping the game new and exciting with more levels to explore and tools to use.My one qualm with the game is that many of the ""clean"" textures have knicks or stains that are permanent, which reduces the satisfaction of cleaning.

What's more, the former type can be a tedious, un-fun slog, if handled wrongly, while the latter type can be greatly entertaining, if it contains the right mixture of challenge, gross-out moments, and deeply dark humour.  VCD is proof of that.Dexterity and patienceVCD does not pit you against slavering hordes of aliens and/or monsters, testing your reflexes and your ability to crouch behind cover while your health regenerates - the monsters have already come and gone, and instead you are pitted against the physics simulation of the world, testing your dexterity in collecting, disposing of, or stacking objects of various sizes and bloodyness.  It tests your ability to think ahead and plan, so you avoid unnecessary walking back-and-forth and do not track fresh blood and guts through areas you just cleaned.  It tests your ability to remain careful and patient, so you don't knock over and spill that bucket of curdled blood, slime or other unidentified substances that you previously mopped up.Job satisfactionBoth the mission statements that send you into a level and the after-action report of the inspector make it clear that you are just a tiny, unimportant cog in a vast corporate machine that doesn't give a hoot whether you live or die in their horrifically unsafe work environments, but this makes your small victories all the sweeter.  You'll feel every bit as heroically accomplished as someone like ""Max Power, Hero of the Galaxy"" in a more typical game, when you clock out and find that instead of a reprimand and a host of newspaper clippings detailing the consequences of your sloppiness, you have instead received the coveted ""Employee of the Month"" award that nobody but you will ever see - plus the undying hatred of your fellow cogs who are vying for the same honour.You, too, can be declared an ""Award-winning Dumbass"" by the company newsletter, if you play this game, which I heartily recommend."

You also get a little bit of story related to each level, but as I said it's not really a story game. There is a normal gameplay mode where you take your time and try to clean up as best you can, and there is a time attack mode where you must get the area as clean as possible very quickly.

That isn't to say that the game is a life-changing piece of art that defies description; just that it's unique to the best of my knowledge. The title says it all; the objective of the game is to clean up the gory aftermath of various sci-fi/horror scenarios.While the premise may be simple, the game is far from easy. If you're going in expecting a quick, casual experience, you might be in store for a rude awakening. Viscera Cleanup Detail may not be the deepest or most involved game, but it does require a good deal of time, and a very methodical approach. Be prepared to spend a few hours to get just one map completely cleaned.Much like real janitorial work, attention to detail is paramount, and if you aren't taking your time, you might find yourself making the mess even bigger than it was when you found it. Walking through pools of bodily fluid will cause you to track footprints across the floor, carelessly swinging a severed arm around can spatter blood on the walls, and not cleaning your mop often enough will lead to it smearing the mess around rather than absorbing it.The game also demands some platforming and problem solving skills, as sometimes you'll be required to build a tower out of boxes to reach some blood-stains on the ceiling. The physics for these particular challenges are very good, sometimes to the point of being annoying; if your tower isn't braced against a wall, you might find that it will topple over if you stand too close to the edge of one of your boxes, or bump into one after undershooting a jump.Even though the game only ever shows you the aftermath of the carnage, each map has several items that allow you to piece together the story. When you begin a map, you get a work order that explains the basics, but you can also find notes, messeges written in blood, journal entries, and emails, all of which give you a little more prespective on the events that preceded your arrival.As of this review, there is no soundtrack. Now, there are a great deal of sounds, from footsetps to flamethrowers, but there is no music. While the sound effects are pretty good, after a while the silence gets a bit dull. I'd say play a map as-is just to hear all the various sounds, then add your own music.Obviously, this is not a game for children or the squeamish. Only those with strong stomachs and a dark sense of humor will truly enjoy Viscera Clenup Detail. If you do possess both of those qualities, I'd say this game is well-worth the price of admission. It isn't perfect, it isn't mind-blowing, and it isn't Game-of-the-Year material, but it is fun, it is addictive, and it is wonderfully twisted."

Playing again, they've deinfately updated/fixed the physics system and now works really well for the most part.Gameplay can be a bit repetitive but it is quite rewarding completely clearing a once bloody hallway and this is heavily suggested and rewarded which is clever as anything less would be turn this pointless quickly.Graphics look good, runs pretty well as well, 60fps 1080p on a fx6300 and R9270x 4Gb.There's also the level editor, probably the best part of the game because the variety there is incredible, workshop has a great selection of levels and some including story (in form of pickup notes/tags)It eats time, fastest I've cleaned the smallest scene was 47mins solo but with friends can be a lot faster, or longer if you want to troll them..."

Oh did I mention FUN? =PPros:-Oddly enough in single player, when not on speedrun, very relaxing like others have said.-Co-op blowing up my brother was fun for the Acheivement =D Also on the flip side getting blown up by him when going afk near the incinerator and he didnt know you had to put the TNT in water before burning or esle KA-BOOOOOOOOMMMM, rofl.-Getting eaten by the Pit monster in Unearthy was fun too, or throwing stuff in to see how much you can feed them or just to make a BIGGER mess for laughs. Also for kicks trying to light the TNT and timing it just right when throwing it in the pit monster and not getting blown up in the process. (Warning: gets messy attempting so save first)-Feeling pretty good after seeing what the places first looked like and then after you tackled them (assuming your goal was to clean and not make a bigger mess for laughs)-This is probably just a personal preference but I enjoyed reading all the notes and data pads that were dropped in places. Especially the one in ""Evil Science"" I think it was. On the second floor the Alien-ator Member (The hero that saved the day?) Her/His secondary objective was to ""Make a really big F***ing Mess"" of Which He/She deffinitely accomplished. Also the Flyers that come out of the Vendo-Machine are chuckle worthy too. (Yes Im trying to collect them all by tossing them into the Janitors Chest =P)-Having a bad day? Pick a stage and grab the Arc-Welder Gun and turn the place into an inferno to let off some steam. Then Punch out and laugh at all the flyers that show up in the office. Or try to clean it all up and feel like one of the New Forms Selections: A Cleaning God/ess if you do manage to get everything.-Others have said repetitive. Its probably just me but I dont. Then again I may be crazy, so... *shrugs*.Cons: (*probably just cause its early access and there will be glitches/oddities naturally)-FIXED ISSUE*****Edited to add:(YAY they fixed the Athenas wrath spot and the Unearthy Excavation spot that did the pop up that sends stuff everywhere from your buckets/bins that you happen to be carrying.)*****-Checking out the new form to fill out: They want estimates of #'s of BULLET casings found? BODY parts? Anything Incinerated? REALLY!? Whats next guesstimates on how many gallons of Blood? =D No offense but I dont count it. I just CLEAN the hell outta the place and burn♥♥♥♥♥♥ =) Or on a bad day go on a rampage of my own with the Arc-welder Gun and turn the place into an Inferno.*Scratches head* So I musta missed something when clocking out of Athenas Wrath because Heres the Con: there were flyers saying I was fired. In the office there was no ""Darkness in Light"" flyers, or ""Drug stash in Bullet Hole"" flyers, Or ""Employee mistakes blood spot for ketchup"" flyers, nada. Just ones saying Incompetence, calling for investigations and the ""Homie"" laughing about the firing. I did everything on the form to the best guesstimate but didnt realize the Tags needed to be taken to the punchout machine *Sigh* Maybe a flyer needs to be added in the office upon clocking out saying thats what got the firing? because at this point I dont know if it was cause of the Guess-timates or the not doing the tags in the machine or the other selections on the form or what since everything else was perfect.**On a side note I thought in the update description/news this wasnt supposed to be a negative thing only used for bonus points. But the kinks probably just need to be worked out since it is a new concept.***Edited: It turns out that it was the data flash drives cause I reloaded my save and filled in that info and this time it didnt have the flyers about being fired, so Yay!Anyway, LOVE this and the 2 other Viscera games that came w/ it.~Cyn"

It's simple enough to pick up what you're supposed to do—throw giblets and debris in the incinerator, clean up blood/slime from the walls, floors and, sometimes, ceiling, and put any little mementos you find in your trunk.It CAN get a bit frustrating at times, however; I've lost count of how many times the bucket physics spaz out and suddenly one of the surfaces I'd spent time cleaning, is drenched in blood again. Plus there are times when I can't find that one tiny sliver of blood on a wall that my Sniffer INSISTS is there, or there's a giblet on a vent WAY TOO HIGH for me to reach, so I have to get creative with stacking stuff to get to it.Finally, my biggest issue at present is there's a real lack of achievement at the end of it. I suppose there's a joke there, how janitors have a crap job with crap pay, but still, it'd be nice to be rewarded for leaving a level prestine, with something other than an employee of the month thing in my office. Dunno if a reward would really work in a game like this, but, hey.Still, if you're looking for a stress-relieving game, or maybe just someone with OCD who's fine with cleaning up the aftermath of every Sci-Fi Horror shooter ever, look no further."

You're given a mop, buckets and boxes. You get no guns (well, aside from one, but it's a tool) and there's no enemies (yet). All you do is clean, and after that, you clean some more. If you're lucky, maybe you'll get a employee of the month award, then you clean even more. However, cleaning up a mess, rather than causing it, is a surprisingly relaxing experience. It's even more fun with friends, however be warned that physics are wonky in Multiplayer. Chances are you and your friends will create more messes for each other, but the thought of finally finishing the job after you all get your rears in gear is a pleasant one. While there's still things to tweak here and there (it's beta after all), Viscera Cleanup Detail enforces an important rule of the gaming world; cleaning, as well as chores in general, are only fun in video games."

Do you mop up as you go, or trek blood everywhere to dispose of gibbets (and thereby prevent more bloody messes from forming)?  Do you focus on cleaning up one room at a time, or work across the entire map?  There are many approaches for each level, and the only downside to choosing a poor approach is the possibility of making a larger mess and taking longer to finish the cleanup job.Once you have a plan in mind, the FPS elements come in as you then execute that plan.  Maybe it's a great plan, but you have to be careful not to knock over dirty buckets or dropping trash bins and undoing what you've just cleaned up.Finally, learning to use the sniffer to determine where the last few remaining messes are located is almost a fine art, as you sometimes have to triangulate to determine just where the last few messes are located.All in all, it's a surprisingly fun and relaxing game, and I highly recommend giving it a try."

,Recommended,246900,27658128,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,PanzerSouffle,"Viscera Cleanup Detail is possibly the most weirdly relaxing game I've ever played. The basic premise is that you are a member of a janatorial crew cleaning up FPS-style levels after the super soldier hero has already gone through and murdered everyone in the messiest of ways. You have a number of tools to help accomplish this, such as a Sniffer tool to detect areas that require cleaning, a weird kind of lightning welder to repair bullet holes, and of course your trusty mop for cleaning up those messy bloodstains. There is also the all-important incinerator, and dispensers for incineration bins and water buckets (which only occasionally malfunction).There are a good and varied number of levels, all with the same base gameplay loop but a different story behind each one and with various amounts of time needed to complete them. Helpfully the average completion time can be viewed before level selection to better suit the amount of time you have available.There are only a couple of cons I have with the game, the first being that occasionally you will spend a long time at the end of a level (assuming you are a perfectionist with this game like me) wandering around hunting that one tiny speck of dirt you missed somewhere along the line that your Sniffer tool has picked up. The other is that the physics of piling body parts and objects into the incineration bins have always been a little shaky. Occasionally you will wedge a couple of things in there that for whatever reason do not agree, and cause the bin to tip and send its contents exploding all over the general area. Not a problem if you're at the start of a level, but very frustrating if it happens in an area you've just cleared.These are nothing more than minor inconveniences for me, however, and I have immensely enjoyed all my time with this game. The way that cleaning up these gruesome remains becomes mundane, and picking up shell casings oddly relaxing is a pleasant surprise for me. In my opinion it is a brilliant concept well executed, and definitely worth the asking price."
,Recommended,246900,26531963,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,Awesomov,"I suppose this is more worthy of a recommendation, but I'm actually on the fence a bit. What enjoyment one can obtain out of this game greatly depends on what one finds enjoyable in a game. Though I'm aware this is generally the case with all games, it's particularly so for this game. I say this because in this game where you are a janitor who cleans up messes, you can be so OCD that you can count all of the numbers of bullet casings and bullet holes and such as you clean, or you can just ""mess around"" and make the level look even less clean than it did before.You can also explore each level to search for the backstory behind each level you're cleaning, and to search for the elusive ""Bob"", a crazed janitor whose closet you can unlock after some finagling in the game. This secret closet with its ridiculously long password, even when opened, has yet another secret room behind it, which apparently takes going through a lot of ridiculous riffraff to unlock (and I haven't bothered to; it doesn't seem that important anyway so it doesn't actually affect gameplay that much overall).If you ever tire of the included levels, you can download more through the Workshop. I will say, though, some levels are just ludicrous in terms of how much cleanup they need and thus aren't that fun to play, and I speak of both the included levels and downloadable levels. But that's if you consider the game ""fun"" anyway, as you may either come to see the cleanup as actual work, or not see a point at all in being zany and messy, or you may not care at all about Bob, or you may not like any bit of it. It's one of those divisive kind of games in that sense, as even playing the way I like to play doesn't feel special. I suppose I will recommend it, however, considering it is quite a unique experience nonetheless and, as long as you know what you're getting into, it can end up being a decent enough way to kill time on occasion. I will add, having more than one person play with you also helps any enjoyment you can obtain from the game, and even if you maximize your enjoyment however you please, you will find moments of frustration.Lastly, I must add that this game does seem to need at least a decent PC but not necessarily something intensive, and even then is kind of buggy regardless of what you have, especially when you make just enough of a mess. Some of the bugs add a bit to the frustration. I don't always like saying something should be obtained if it's on sale, but this game, despite its already low-ish price, would be better bought on sale."

The idea of it appealed to me, but I wasn't sure that it would live up to my expectations. After finally taking the plunge, I realized it lived up to my expectations and more.Pros:It's much more fun than real life housework. If they could figure out how to make real life chores this fun, my house would always be spotless, fridge included.It's relaxing. When I'm stressed and need to unwind, all I need to do is grab my trusty mop and a bucket and set out cleaning up some gore.Despite the relaxing element, there's enough of a challenge to keep the fun going. Wrestling with physics is always entertaining. Properly clearing cracks and bullet holes is a good time. Trying not to spread more gore or alien guts through the hall as you carry a corpse to the furnace is an especially fun challenge.The very few glitches it has are of the humorous kind rather than the game killing kind. Imagine walking into a room filled with halved and dismembered corpses, only to see the top half of a corpse jiggling away. Or watching a severed arm jump up on its elbow and run out of the room. Good job, zombie arm.Cons:Until you master the buckets, you'll be saying bad words a lot. I renamed the game a profane phrase (what rhymes with bucket?) while I was adjusting to the physics and constantly bathing in both bloody and fresh bucket water._________Another reviewer commented that he or she was unable to get more than a 60% rating and was constantly fired. A note about that. This game requires more than cleaning up the blood and litter. Bullet holes and cracks must be filled, crates need to be stacked nicely (well, at least an attempt must be made), and paperwork needs to be filled out (there are chips by the bodies that need to be placed in the computer time clock so you can document various aspects of the person's death)."

Its a really relaxing game to play though it might not be for everybody. If the thought of a game where you clean doesnt appeal to you it probably wont. If you're intrigued though its worth a try.There are lots of games where you gun down loads of enemies but Viscera Cleanup Detail puts you in the boots of the poor guy who has to clean up afterwards. You're weapons are a mop, rubber gloves and dirt sniffer and you get dropped into blood stained,gore covered environments that you have to clean up. I initially thought this would be a novelty game but I got hooked. Cleaning the levels in this game is actually really therapeutic and relaxing and its a great game to play while listening to music or podcasts.The level designs are great and each one is fairly unique and its fun trying to put together the clues as to whats happened in each level via the various notes and visual clues. The games physics add more comedy. For example walking through blood leads to you spreading bloody footprints or dropping a body part causes blood splatters. Theres also co-op and online play if you fancy teaming up with other janitors to clean or cause more mess.Good points:- has great varied levels each with their own backstory and unique features- the cleaning mechanics are done really well with mop buckets, incinerators and bins available to the player- the games dark humour is great and theres lots of references to famous games and movies littered throughout the game.-playing this game is really relaxing and cleaning a level perfectly feels really rewardingBad points:- while the physics are an important part of this games charm they can be a bit glitchy at times with body parts glitching through the floor or the scenery."

You can Die~! But when you do, You don't; Infinite lives~ Woohoo~A map can take anywhere a minimum of 50 min to 3 hours depending on the map size (in a solo game)Side note: if you want to just goof around in a space janitor simulator, making a mess that is already present more messy or defy physics with biohazard bin flying from one end of the map to the other with viserals / limbs clipping INTO the floor, this game is definately for you !10/10 would just play polka 2180 and accidently brushing past fellow janitor(s) to see them on the floor.This is definately 100x more fun with friends, be it one or a full party of 4~**If you are thinking of getting this game for multiplayer, make sure ports 7777 and 27150 are opened on your router ! If you are hosting~**Sadly the multiplayer portforward issues encoutered has no fix( I tried or I'm doing something wrongly perhaps), aside from using Hamachi and Evolve (So I hear...)May the mop be with you."

Pretty solid humour here and there. Holiday maps are a blast.There are some technical issues though - areas with large amounts of items and physics going on can make your fps dip even on top notch computers. This is most noticable when playing online. In that online enviornment strange things with apparent desynchronization and lag can also occur but I really wouldn't let any of this throw you off and mostly it's possible to tolerate it if you plan your work a bit.Before I bought it I didn't think it's worth the price so it took me a while to pick it up but now that I have it I'd say it definitely is worth the price and has more replayability than you may think.

However I myself highly recommend this game to those who would like the concept of cleaning up the dead. Your role is a Space Station Sanitation Janitor and you have to clean up any grizzly mess given too you. There are several levels and 3 amazing DLCs for you to buy if you really want some cleaning options.VCD- Viscera Cleanup Detail is the base game and in the base game alone you have enough for hours of fun! Several levels of blood and guts, your duty here is to clean it ALL! Upon arrival on any level you decide to clean you are brought face to face with the death that happened there. Your mop, your hands, and the rest of your gear will be needed for every level you do! So don't think you can beat around the bush and slack in this game because Viscera Cleanup is very real in terms of a job. Get it done or your fired!VCD Santa's Rampage- Santa's Rampage, a time of year where elves are putting together presents for the children of the world is now...a blood bath. Santa had one too many Eggnogs and too many bills too pay and his solution was murder. As the janitor it is once again your duty to clean up the mess!! This DLC adds one level for you to clean and is added to your base game VCD .The level is santa's workshop, enjoy the blood!VCD Shadow Warrior- Shadow Warrior is another great addition to the VCD collection. It is your duty once again as janitory to clean up a  grizzly scene in a temple that was the scene of  a blood bath. Pick  up the bodies, mop the blood, clean the bullet caseings and other murder weapons. This level however there is lots of money laying around and its pretty fun to look for them. Steal them all, that I recommend!VCD House of Horror- House of Horror is the final addition to the VCD Collection and it is your duty as always to clean up the mess. This time your task is a regular house...OF DEATH!! This house is probably the most normal of the Details but the death is always showing you surprises as always! Clean Clean Clean!!For this review I went over all the VCD instead of doing it seperately for my own benifit of not wanting to type so much and too make it easier for you to understand the whole reason I like the game. I recommend you get all the parts of VCD for the best experense but you can still have loads of fun just buying the base game too."

You are gonna have a lot of fun when playing with a friend because of the silly moments you will have like someone randomly dies because you touch them with a bucket or when you are cleaning and the other pushes over the filthy water buckets. The maps are great and it is exciting to find new items and new map mechanics , like there is one map with a lift and one with a gravity controller , and with items I mean a gun that shoots a laserbeam which can repair bullet holes and burn items and a portable lift to get to higher places. Definently check this game out with a friend and if you still do not like it , just refund.Oh and by the way it is pretty cheap in sales.- 8.9/10"

Truman during the final stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.In the final year of the war, the Allies prepared for what was anticipated to be a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This was preceded by a U.S. conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945. The Japanese, facing the same fate, refused to accept the Allies' demands for unconditional surrender and the Pacific War continued. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese response to this ultimatum was to ignore it."

This game is surprisingly satisfying.  The feeling of attacking a tough task and then looking upon your completed clean objective is very rewarding.   It is also harder than it looks, especially when your goal is to achieve 100%.  I would recommend playing with a friend.  There is something about cleaning up blood and gore that brings people together.    There were a few incidents of glichyness, but nothing that hurts the game.

Well, more like a crime scene cleaner, covering up the insasne debouchery that went down at wherever you are sent by tiding up the remants. Shure, the public knows about the heros who came through and cleared it out, but you have to not only keep the place tidy, you have to erase what lead to the mess from existance.Don't forget to do your paperwork! This is a job you are doing, for a semi-legal cooperation.You can be FIRED, and this will erase whatever you've done in your office. Oh, yeah- you have a office! You can store things in it, and there may be more to it then meets the eye.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, let's get to the nitty gritty- You are dropped into some senario where everything has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of it harkening back to some sort of horror or action movie in a way. You clean it all up. Every. Last. Drop. If you want to, that is.You can just complete the bare minumum so you don't have your♥♥♥♥♥♥reset back in your office.You can say '♥♥♥♥ all of you' and spread blood everywhere, making it WORSE.With every job, you get feedback, letters from coworkers, information regarding what goes on outside. It's alot of filler and alot of laughs.This is a very comedic game,despite the piles of corpses, where half the fun is finding out from context clues and notes how ridiclously great every situation was and has become.It's like a very long campy horror story that both portarys those involved in the senarios as geniuenly terrified and plain silly.It's even better with friends, but isn't for everyone. The gameplay itself is still you cleaning stuff up in relative silence, and only certain types of people will really find intrest in it.Oh, and you should really look into your ingame settings when playing with friends. This becomes glorious when you enable TEXT TO SPEECH, complete with the voice pitching commands and dial tones.Still, as if you can't already tell from the recomend, I highly suggest you get this game on sale; and if you buy it, buy it in a pack. Just make sure the friends you want to give it to actually like it as much as you might."

Equipped with a bucket of water, a mop and furnace, you make sure that the site is in complete good order.  It’s your job after all.  You can fill out reports on how people died, neatly stack all of the company’s property in designated areas and even collect trash to display in your office.  There is a lot of great immersion here and frustrations too.  If you’re sloppy you can track footprints, spill contaminated water and even get fired.  Put in the time to clean the world one bucket at a time and you may even get employee of the month!

Maybe you don't have time to learn an entire universe, to remember how the controls work in the next big game. Maybe you've had a stressful/terrible day, and doing something repetitive is your therapy to unwind.I like this game for those purposes. I like to progress, without needing to absorb myself in pages of lore (although there are pages of lore for the ultra-dedicated), or to remember controls and combinations in some of the larger games. As I've gotten older, I've lost some patience in properly immersing into a game, because there are some games out there that are truly worth the immersion, because your actions matter; your choices matter.Viscera Cleanup Detail isn't larger than life; it's not going to save your marriage, and the only people you will be saving here are their disembodied heads.
