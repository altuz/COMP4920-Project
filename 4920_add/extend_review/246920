The game can be played either on keyboard or controller. According to controller it works perfectly with inputmapper and a PS4 controller for those who own one. I would reccommend a controller since it just fits right in. (Don't get me wrong)If you like a similiar idea of the oldschool bomberman, with modified grills jumping around, then this game is for you.Here is a demo:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I8_L3ROnaA"
,Recommended,246920,18035063,"Posted: 14 September, 2015",all,Hartmunt,"For me personally, Bombernauts is the pinnacle of quick casual multiplayer mayhem.It is amazingly well balanced and still random enough for absurd things to happen which make you either want to cry and punch your monitor to dust or praise the RNG dogs for an insane recover from a desperate situation.As of now (Sep. 2015) this game is in ""Early Access"", but with the original idea of ""Early Access"" in mind:This game is ALREADY A FULL GAME and not some PoC. Every major update, which happens to roll out each month afaik, can only make this REALLY GOOD GAME EVEN BETTER! Im not kidding; They could release it now and it would be great!Sure enough you will need to have a few specific gaming preferences to enjoy this:It is an entertaining, casual, quick round, absolute mayhem, multiplayer indie game.No ranks, no itemshops only fun for you and a few friends maybe some strangers...Oh btw: It has a level editor = endless user generated content if you want to YAY"

Easy to learn, difficult to master, this is probably one of the most fun multiplayer party games on Steam. The drop-in/drop-out lobby system makes it extremely easy to get a match going and the zillions of items, power-ups and maps makes every round feel fresh and exciting.At the moment, the only negative is that the game has a very small playerbase which makes it difficult to find lobbies outside of peak hours. That said, it's still very playable with only two or three players, so if you can find just one friend to play with you will still be able to have fun. Hopefully this will stop being an issue as more people find out about and start playing this great game.That said, I definitely recommend this game. Tell your friends about it, too!"

You have a lot more bomb powerups, space to move, and even a camera to angle at your will.1 Main thing, though... For some reason, holding arrow keys diagonally to move, removes the functionality of the spacebar. Is that just a computer thing? And can it be altered?"

If you're looking for a multiplayer game that you can just jump into and start playing with simple mechanics, look no further. Not only is this a relatively un-complicated game the aesthetic is something I haven't seen in a while. I think I heard Gassy Mexican or someone on his stream say it looked like a SEGA game, but it definitely has an N64 feel to it. It scratches that nostalgic itch without being too same-y. IT'S SO COLORFUL.Didn't experience a laggy game, I was matched into a game really quickly (about a couple seconds after clicked ""Quick Match""), mechanics are easy to understand while still allowing players to pull off some interesting combos that could be found through playing and observing.TL;DR = Colorful, easy-to-learn, action-packed nostalgia trip. Would play again."

Definitely reminiscient of Bomberman back in the day, but the variety fo maps and the voxel-based terrain gives it tons more depth - both figuratively and literally."
,Recommended,246920,19497896,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,[PriPara] Blushing Boo-pri,"This plays like one of those stellar local multiplayer games, like super mario wars and such. Except this one fully online.Heck, 4pack is the only viable option for this game, its just 2x as expensive as one copy and you can enjoy some really fun matches with 4 people. In fact, even with just two.Dont be fooled by early access though. When I launched the game i couldn't believe at first that this is still an early alpha build. It plays smoothly and seems well worth its price. There are huge amounts of default maps to play with and there already is alot of technical depth to gameplay, like bomb jumping and such. Its in fact so well made i wouldn't be surprised if the game developed a competitive scene if there were more people playing it."

,Not Recommended,246920,18648290,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,BattleCat,"Bombernauts is a tough one to review, because the game isn't bad, it's actually quite fun. I just can't recommend it at this point in time because it's online-only multiplayer. My issues largely come down to where I live and it being a relatively unheard of game at the time of writing this, so this won't apply to everyone.If you're an American, I suspect there won't be any issues with finding a match, and you'll have a blast (Get it? Blast. Bombs blast!). But, as an Australian the game is sitting in my library gathering dust because:A) Small player base = no one to play with, particularly in my timezone.B) Busy periods aren't when (working) Australian's can play.C) When it does find people to play with, pings are too high (it's P2P).If bots and drop-in, drop-out behaviour (e.g. Lego and Left 4 Dead etc) were added, that would go a long way to making the game playable while the player base establishes. As it stands I search for an active game, get told there aren't any so it creates a new one and I sit in the level waiting for people to join. Normally I'll wait 10 minutes (during which no one joins) before quitting.If Bombernauts hadlocalmultiplayer I'd get some use out of it, although I recognise that brings a whole host of problems with the design of the game, so I'm not holding my breath on that.The camera can be very frustrating, especially with the verticality of some levels. Even on level maps you can't see the person you're throwing a bomb at so distance and position are guess work.It's not worth writing much else about Bombernauts while it's in Early Access. The game is fun enough and the dev is actively updating it and seems to be listening to feedback. I hope it catches on in places other than America so we can all enjoy it and I can change my review to a ""recommend""!"

Bits of humour sprinkled throughout give it a very nice party vibe.Possibly the best legal way to kill your friends currently available. Highly recommend.

But when it does get to the point where there is almost no ground to walk on. The game just becomes annoying and I do not have fun at all. On the plus side. There is a lot of people to play the game with. So if you are worried about player base. Worry not, there's tons of people playing online. Netcode is pretty good too. The game could still have hope, but as of right now. It is not the reincarnation that I wanted."

Isn't popular enough to warrant a purchase without planning to play with friends, but if you get a 4 pack, it is a great time."

If you like what you see in the trailers, you can expect to experience that yourself, and more.The only major caveat is that unless you search for a group online that plays this (whether it be Steam or some Discord chat server), you're not likely to run into anyone in the lobby by random. So, I'd advise getting it if you got friends who are up for playing something a bit different every now and then. You get 1 free copy to give to a friend anyway (at least at the time this review was written), so if you can somehow sweep up 4 equally interested friends, at least, you'll be able to get some decent play time with this.Sidenote: I gotta say, I really appreciate the level editor. It has symmetry tools that make it incredibly simple to whip up new maps & demo quick ideas efficiently (you'll probably notice it in one of the trailers). That said, the maps aren't meant to be pretty, so, if you're likely to build custom maps, build having a unique level design (and maybe a theme) in mind, not a pretty appearance (not to say, you can't have both, if possible)."
