The Devs responded with a ""yea...but"" claiming money and etc as a limitation. What they managed to put together is not a finished product and is by all means an early access build. No polish, no depth or immersion and absolutely no support post release. In recent posts, the Devs cited financial difficulties and made empty promises for upcoming updates. There are NO updates for more than a year now and their website is dead...In the meantime, the game is plagued with the same bugs and CTDs that it had in earlier builds. You want to open trade routes? Crush. You want to play a long game? Crush on random turn and crush again later on.Another Early Access scheme: promising the impossible and blaming bad finances for their complete and utter failure to deliver. An almost formulaic approach to risk-free-failure: promise A, receive payment for A, deliver B with promises of A but without the means of delivering A…Classic bait and switch tactics under the grey area of Early Access."

There is nothing to this game that I wouldnt expect from any other x4 game, and this is still on the light side of 4x games. It does not get very in depth with any game mechanic. Combat is mediocre, Diplomacy is mediocre, research is very limited with a relatively small research tree compared to other more recent 4x games. All in all, the game is just bland and sub par. Honestly, it feels like playing a unity based game in a web browser. I would expect to find similar mechanics and gameplay from a free game site.Its also not stable. When creating a game, picking certain map settings could cause a crash. First battle I lost, caused a crash. Within a period of 30 minutes just to check out the full release version, I had 3 crashes.I really love the sci-fi space based 4x genre, and I wanted this game to be good because there are so few games in this genre that can hold a candle to what MoO2 was for its time. This game does not get close. I would not recommend this game to anyone, not even casual players."

A Rogue-like 4x game.The Devs have all but left this game.  Even at 75% off, it's just not worth it.  Plenty of 4x games on steam and GOG has MoO 1& 2.Steam should be ashamed to have pulled this out of early release and the publisher should be strung up for asking $5 for this game, let alone $20+.1/10 for potential but worth $2 at most."

This game is the result.It's not often my lead-ins to my reviews are so short, and it's not often that I review a game prior to spending at least 24 hours in-game with it, but this game isn't one I can recommend, for various reasons.First things first - ""Lords of the Black Sun"" is a space-based 4X game, where you attempt to conquer the universe,Cid Meyer's Civilization-style.  You build installations on planets, create colony ships, build pre-defined military vessels, and can even create custom units.  Units stack, and space battles take place in a sort ofFinal Fantasy Tacticscut-out battle scene.All of this sounds like a strategy gamer's dream, so why do I sound so against it?First, the interface is horrible, and I'm not merely talking about the presentation, though that's pretty awful.  The UI isn't optimized for a player's experience; it's hard to see even a neophyte developer looking at the UI and thinking, 'the players are going tolove this.'  Most of the menuing takes more actions than is really necessary.Second, the game itself feels utterlysoulless.It feels like someone started by taking a look atCid Meyer's Alpha Centauri, then proceeded to put itfurther into space, but instead of hiring a writer, gave it to someone's nephew.  The result is an experience that doesn't capture the wonder of interstellar colonization, or galactic politics, but is rather an experience that it's hard to care about for even a single session.Mechanically, the game is sound - as stated above, it's the sort of thing strategy gamers claim tolove and want.  The execution is so terrible, especially given the$30 asking price, which is entirely too much for what you're getting.  Firaxis Games, these guys ain't.PROS:Mechanicallly sound gameGreat space visualsInteresting fleet-to-fleet combatGood custom unit creation system.CONS:Uninspired, forgettable writing and scenarioUgly UI that impedes the playerForgettable musicUnstable game - the end of my expeirence came after the game just crashed for no apparent reason.Waytoo expensive for what you're actually getting.Verdict: Avoid it.  The developers need to do some serious work on this game and lower the price for this game to be worth it.  If they will do this, I will take a second look and re-evaluate my review."

I watched a review of this game from several months ago, and it looked promising. More than promising actually, it looked like it could be an excellent game that combines many of the aspects that I love. Overall, it appears to be something like Sins of a Solar Empire crossed with Civilization crossed with Democracy. The issue was that it was not a finished game.Jump forward to now, and it is on the front page of Steam, announcing that it is a finished game. FAR FROM IT. I should have looked more at the fine text, but the developer says that even though it is moving out of early access, it stills needs patching. This is evident from the start. The intro splash took quite some time to load, even on a fairly powerful computer and locked my screen to the program until it finished. Typos and grammatical errors are common, even on the first few small text boxes of the tutorial. Additionally, the textures are rediculously poor on higher zoom levels, even on max graphical settings. What sealed the deal for me though was the frequent crashing brought about by this game.Again, though this game has promise, it is not yet ready. I feel as though I was tricked into buy an incomplete game. The saddest part of it is that if this game came out in a ready state, I might have loved it. But my initial play has only served to frusturate me."

There are plenty of other 4x space games out there that are a) actually finished, and b) a hundred times better than this game.It is a shame because during early access it did show some promise. But then one day the developer decided it was finished and it went from early access to released. ""Abandoned"" version would be a more accurate term for what we got. There have been no updates for months now, and it doesn't look like we'll get any - indeed at the time of writing this review the website for the company behind the game is no longer there.It would be less of a waste to just burn your money rather than buy this game."

The techs for ships don't provide any options - the missiles, beams and lasers are essentially the same. There are no fighters or bases.Tactical fights are available but not terribly exciting - nor does it provide any depth as all weapons are in essence identical.Many of the ""management tools"" are absent or in very basic form - you can't rearrange build queues, set up rally points, understand how much science, industry, or trade any particular action is going to generate. It's weird how you have to close an empire menu before opening the next one rather than switching between them.The tech tree is pretty minimal - maybe 50-60 items in total. It gets boring in the 2nd part where you get solid lines of 3-4 consecutive ""industry +1"" or ""research +1"". It rarely opens up new abilities, just improves your starting ones.Minor races have no interaction, except for pirates. You can send a trade ship there, tho with the game maxing out at 4 trade lines, it's not clear why you should bother.What is working in this game is relatively fine. It just seems like they ran out of time to fine-tune and tweak the content in fun and interesting ways. Perhaps updates wil improve this solid, but it is currently an extremely bland X4 experience.Verdict - unless you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel for x4 games, skip until a few updates."

This is about the only informations you get from the get-go once you boot the game for the first time. Once you start a new game, you will be asked to select from a group of 8 original races and customise the ""game board"".Once the game begins, you'll immediately take control of your chosen race and you can start using your scout ship to explore your surroundings. You also get a home planet, which will be  used as a main hub for initial development.The game leaves a pretty good first impression, with very nice and clean graphical information. The UI is functional and simple, but can become a bit overwhelming for starters, but all in all everything is pretty intuitive. But, being this an alpha build, i must stress the importance of the creation of a structured tutorial, so players can learn and try the base mechanics before being sent into the wild.Once the game starts building up pace, you will meet other civilizations, which you will need to either crush with military prowess or outsmart through diplomacy and espionage. Overall, the AI is pretty solid, even though other races can be tad temperamental towards your actionsThe game map, even though presented in a very simplistic fashion, works very well and offers a ton of graphical variety. Planets look pretty good, and so does spacial debris and other celestial bodies, such as moons and stars.The game still lacks a bit of clear indicative elements, such as an ""it is now your turn"" prompt, or some audio feedback on research completion but, as it is in alpha, hopefully these elements will be added at some point.Veredict: There is room for a lot of improvement, specially in the fine details, but as this is just an alpha build, i will be eagerly expecting the finished product, and i am glad to be supporting it!"
76561197963819207,Recommended,246940,8161736,"Posted: 21 December, 2013",all,FireSickle,"I have been playing this game for a while now, it has grown into such a great game. The developers really shine in their skill, communication, and direction. Right now it is like an uncut diamond. You can see the potential in the game, but it might not quite be there yet. If you are looking for a finished or mostly finished game, this is not yet for you. Since I bought the game, it has been drastically improved, both functionally and with new content.For your benefit, here is my take on a few features the game offersMultiplayerSorry charlie, not yet. If you play the game, you will see why its not ready, the engine is not finished and the balance is a bit off.AI, multiple opponentsThe AI saw some improvements after the game launched to Beta. Now, they attack each other and expand more often. Additionally, every race and pirate uses stronger ship designs and upgrades their fleets as they research new tech. The early game is much more brutal, simply building 10 of the default attack design won't cut it it anymore. You'll find the most challenge in this game playing against Very Hard AI, having Total War selected, and selecting a race with a low likeability.ResearchStandard researching. No real thoughts on this, its nothing to scream about, but its not bad either. To summarize.. Three tech trees, military, economy, science. Military has weapons, ship modules, and fleet and ground attack buffs. Economy has money and diplomacy buffs and a few economic buildings. Science allows you to colonize worse conditioned planets, terraform, buff science production, and has a few buildings.Ship DesignIts a rudimentary system currently, but it has already seen some major improvements. Currently there are 4 hull sizes available from Scout up to Capital. Your different ship parts have weights and can only be placed in certain predetermined spots.Ships and space combatUse shipyard planets to build ships. Then conquer the galaxy. Space combat is psuedo turn based. Each player takes a turn with his whole army and attacker goes first. You can move a ship, then move another ship, then come back to your previous ship and attack with it. I like to move all my stuff then attack with it. There is automatic combat resolving, but like most 4X games you can do much better when you control combat manually.Random Events, Minor Races, Pirates, Espionage, DiplomacyThere is a decent amount of variety but like any game if you play enough you will see it repeat a lot. Someday they are going to add in Race specific story line events, the race backgrounds (detailed in the manual) are quite good, but that story is not yet integrated with the game. The game offers espionage and diplomacy. These features are being worked on and have seen some improvements over the last few months.Game graphics and performanceThe graphics are beautiful. The camera angles are not great yet, but you can see that your able to zoom into fine detail and it still looks good. The developers recently said on the forums that their intention is to make combat more cinematic so it feels more exciting, you can see already that they will be able to pull that offGame soundSome of the sound effects are much louder than others, so occasionally you will jump at some sounds (like a missile exploding or when you deliver any of the speeches). The music is deliciously good in this game, I never noticed it until the Beta launch reset my settings to default."
,Not Recommended,246940,19556527,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,Archy Senpai [RTOZ],"A very disappointing addition to the 4x Space Strategy game genre. I love the genre, and it seemed to look very nice, but the actual product was not as good as expected from the description, screenshots, and video. It seems to lack polish and actually seems somewhat unfinished, with plenty of bugs and lacklustre dev support.On to the one pro I've found so far for the game... the hex-based, turn-based space combat is actually a quite interesting addition to the 4x space genre, and one that I quite like. Admittedly, it can turn into a bit of a chore once the participants have large fleets, if you can get to that stage... but I do like the idea.However... the game is plagued with a multitude of crashes, which makes any sort of progress, especially in multiplayer, very frustrating. Even when you're lucky enough to not encounter a Crash to Desktop, the gameplay itself is not quite up to scratch. The tech tree and units are somewhat disappointing, and there are many better games out there if you want to customise your own space ships as part of your plans for galactic domination - which brings me to my next point - the galactic maps are pretty sub-par. It doesn't look nice, the travel is boring (there are no restrictions or wormholes or gravity wells or any other mechanic) between systems. There is an arbitrary limit on which systems you can travel though, in an expanding circle, but I have not been able to figure out how that works, but apart from that, you can travel to any system without any changes.And the economic and diplomatic options are both also disappointing. This combos with the 8 ""different races"" you can play as or against - they don't look or feel different, and the bonuses and ""unique generals"" aren't very noticeable. In combination with the lack of options, and a lack of descriptions of the various pre-game setup options... it just doesn't make for a compelling experience.Especially for the asking price, you can do so much better if you are after a 4x space strategy game."

I was disappointed by this one and after 30 mins put it on the back burner in the hopes that it might get better being early access.  Well a couple days ago a friend said he was looking at it and my instant reaction was to tell him it wasnt worth it.  After that i felt bad cuase i had not loaded it back up since last year so I reinstalled it to give it another go.  Even with the time thats past, I my opinion has not changed.  This is a very cut and paste 4X, I can see that have tried to introduce new aspects to the genre, but they all feel less micromanage ( which i dont mind ) and more gimmicky.  The interface and graphics are alot more dated then they should be.  Now take in mind that you have to judge for yourself and all this is just MHO.  I support indie and early access titles to a fault, and in 6 months or so I will give this title another try and will delete this review if need be, but as of right now I cant recommend this title with so many 4x out there that are older, better, and more deserving of your purchase ATM.

Not only does it crash all the time but the interface leaves a great deal to be desired. There is no tooltip so it makes it really hard to understand what is what. The lack of standard designs for ship building make it annoying to have to build your own vessels. Not to mention the fact that the ship builder is a joke really. The items cost way to much and doesn't give you much options on the ship. The lack of a proper informational database means that it is hard to decide what to do and when. Basically the game just needs to be developed further because this is the level I would expect to see in an alpha. Combat is also not very interesting. The AI always moves its ships in max distance so if you go first, you can hang back and wait and open up on them and if they go first, they move in to your operational range but out of firing range allowing you to just go in and shoot first either way. Your military strength also makes no difference in their choice to make war with you. I had more than double the enemies worlds, general and fleet and he goes to war with me. My ships outclass his easily and I just faceroll fleet after fleet. As for construction on a planet, I find it rather intersting. Not really complicated, not really easy but without tooltips and having not memorized the look of buildings means it takes ages to figure it out. Also you don't get to know what the benefit of each building is before construction making it a hard choice in the end.If the game actually finishes I think it would be rather fun but as it currently stands, I would prefer my money back over the game on my list."

There isn't much interaction with the universe as a whole outside it being a static generation from the start. Perhaps I was spoiled with Space Empire's abiolities to drastically reform the universe even while in the game, but here its marginal.-/- even with another strike against it is the ""neutral"" races or ""pirates"" which are just a bit more than just target practice and nuciances occupying a planet you want.-/- the diplomacy feels shallow. I am sorry, its just not as in depth as I have seen others - it can be altered to get there sure, but as it stands I don't see it shifting to that. Many of the diplomacy options require facility constructions that will limit your options on the planets you own, and some options won't happen unless you or the other race have room to invest, further limiting who is really benefitting.-/- the tactical turn based combat is restrictive as hell. You only get to do so much per turn, and each ship is further limited by its loadout. Multiple loadout designs with different weapon types or perks limits the ship's ability to function as you can only do one per turn, making the combat really limited in scope to the design and swarming of a few cheap ship creations of a doubled weapon or three.-/- this further falls under the ship construction as there are limited sizes and options for what can be loaded on which ship. It limits design and role choices heavily.+/- the genreals are a cool idea that develop as you use them, but the risk and reward are staggering comparisions. Due to the combat being so restrictive there isn't much for strategic desings possible and the random generation of the generals is flawed at times - they may have an attack power, but without a type given so it doesn't work. The development of them can be cool, and it directly affects their strengths, however the combat risk can easily leave them out on a limb and you'll loose all your progress.-/+ the unrest aspect is interesting, but difficult to cause and easy to avoid, making it a moot issue that rarely surfaces unless you let or make it.-/+ further deplomacy aspects sound cool as well, but the AI is fineky on its choices making its fulfuilment in many regards challenging, or just a question of finaces. A good economy can basically buy allies in most cases wtih a bit of espionage fixing.-/- the AI cheats. I'm sorry, it does. It doesn't do something its not confident it can win, making it more hesitant and dulling the gameplay. Set up safe enough even with cheap ships and you'll never be threatened as you grow until you amass that army to just wipe everything out.Sounds good, can be interesting - but I've seen other 4x games pull off similarities better, so its not really worth it for most."

I made one attack on a pirate faction and then every race hated me and started going to war with me. I was also experiencing some learning curve set-backs, so I quit out of that game and started a new one.Round 2 I went with just 2 alien AI opponents, in a small galaxy, and tried just making nice with them. We claimed our planets, established trade routes, built stuff.... 5 hours later nothing had happened. I was basically just making the same colony ships over and over, going to new planets, building the same buildings... My population was happy, my enemies were all happy, I had more money than I knew what to do with. The game kind of just devolved into a management of the empires finances and construction.This game is really lacking from random events that spice up your experience. They attempted by puting in 'disasters' which is basically just a simple: 'pay money and keep people happy' or 'Tell your people you wont help them and♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone off'. Its a pretty shallow wildcard system.The interface is clean, but is also very lacking. For example, when looking at what buildings are on a planet, only the 'build menu' has the names of the buildings and what they do. The buildings you already have in place do not have names, and you cannot click on them to see if they are being effective in any way. So you have to do a cross reference on what the buildings look like to even know what you have built...And on the subject of building, its super boring. I'm sure I would eventually get to more advanced structures down the tech tree, but in the 5-8 hours I played Puting the same combination of 5-10 buildings on 20 different planets was about as much fun as organizing a deck of cards. Also it seems when you do unlock better versions of buildings, you need to go BACK to all of those planets, destroy a building, and put in the upgrade. Its not automatic.So when you are 20 hours down the line in this game and you wonder why every race has a better economy than you, it might be because you forgot to upgrade 5 of your 40 planets to better factories... better go check them all... one... by... one....While I cant recomend this game I hope that the developers learn from this one and make a sequel with the holes filled in. It's a great idea, It just relies WAY too much on the player to micro manage all of their systems."

There are also issues with colony building, wherein buildings would take forever to build, due to the planet's low level of development, even given that these were basic structures designed to boost development and production rates, causing a reciporicating cycle of being unable to have more productive planets, but being tied up in the process of making them more productive, whilst trying to build other things, which interrupts development. This said, the game has a lot of depth, even in early access, and seems to have very good custimization options. Also, the research tree looks good, from what little gameplay I've experienced, though it could be expanded, as it is relatively short. All of these flaws are easily fixable in development, and seeing as this is early access, I'm confident the necessary improvements will be made.

The crash I had was when I tried to move some ships that I sent to attack a planet, after the reload I lost 90% of my solar systems (although save file were 7 minutes before crash), remaining solar systems were the starting spot and last conquered. And no army to fight, no explored regions anymore etc.Other than that, I had over 550 turns of decent fun, battled for my home planet several times - lost it once, but there is room for improvement on the combat side of things.

Spent my 5 hours on building trade routes and being mr. nice potato to everyone I met. Have to play it multiple times to see what strategy will push you to a resolution, I played 2 incomplete rounds in the 5.1 hours as of this review.First round, I didn't make any Colony ships so really only had the one planet.Second round, I expanded to 5 areas, made 5 friends, Allied with 1, declared war on another.. but then I was deep into the slog.I think Production only has to do with the planet it's on, whereas Research adds across your empire. The number of factories you can build depends on the 'Resources' of the planet, so often you can make 2 Factories, then all Research. Demolish later to add banking, police and whatever else you unlock, depending on the planet's purpose. What I should have built more of were shipyards as it took 11 turns to get anything from my Home to the front lines.Research Tree is pretty vast; it's split into 3 categories - Science, Economics, Military. Spent most of my research on Economics to get the gravy flowing, then some into Science to help later research. Military I only touched for the engines, really. But if you focus on Economics, then you should finish with them as progress will just slog while you get your weapons up to snuff.Menus are pretty self-explainatory. You have a handshake for diplomacy, eye for intelligence, ship-with-arrow for next ship.. stuff like that. You only have to click on them once or twice to see what they do. Only issue I had with that is the Tutorial's (descriptive boxes) font is really small.Navigational plane is 2-d, and I haven't touched on battles yet. Ships have a preset shape; the 'building' part is just placing different parts into their respective slots so kinda disappointed about that honestly.Conclusion: Currently it's marked as 32.99 CAD and for that price.. HELLLLLLLL No. I got it on a Steam sale for a really good price so in my opinion 10.00 is the most I'd pay... but when it comes to a Steam Sale, I can still be El Cheapo :P."

Not 'any' modern game. The advertising material and wall paper images selling the game are grossly misleading.

That game was produced in 2004 and if anything Star Lords is actually even worse, even when it did work.  It's super slow and has tons of glitches, plus game is very simple (granted original was pretty simple too).  I feel like I was robbed.  Game is really bad, not worth $20 for sure, probably not worth $5 in present condition, if some improvements were made and all glitches fixed it might be worth about $10.  Very annoying, to start a game and have it crash because Windows encounters a problem with it and that happened a lot with this game.  It loads random stuff even if you don't start a new game, just any game... not sure why it does that.  It glitches bad on your economy a lot.  In one game I had saved with an income around 500 BC/month and came back and had -650 BC/month on same game =(.  The premise of the game is kind of fun, albeit it simple, but I recommend not buying or looking for Starships Unlimited (if you can find).

Maybe it is just me but i dont see how i blow the specs away tenfold unless there is some secret way to get it to work nobody told me about.

Yet i dont expect one and will promptly be seeking a refund with steam so say goodbye to the money you would have made from me and if steam will not give me back the money i will just cancel my card for fraud.

The game is as everyone else say bland. The Graphics are unappealing the universe seems to be on this wierd grid like system the music is not enough to keep you into it but it is pretty nice The tech HAHAHA what an excuse it is like they spent no time in it. The game comes off too unappealing for me to even get past 15 turns without forcing myself and then it crashes for some reason. Oh the story they put in for the factions make no sense: The Terrain race was once of earth then becuase of certain events they left and went to a new universe where they buiilt a thriving civilization and then the game starts and your very advance human race that has been on the planet for years now doesn't even have a factory or police station or research lab OR a medical lab all you have is a shipyard WHAT!!! I didn't even bother with the other race backrounds. The ship system is just ew you get this top down look on 2D blueprints. I have to say this game has no direction and that is the problem everything in this game is just as normal as everything in every other space strat game but lacks a strong point like an impressive politcal system or ship system or combat system or some awesome AI but nope they didn't focus on a story or anything special it is a copy paste game in my opinion and I would like my money back. If you are looking for a good Space strat by Iceberg they have Endless space which is way more appealing than this
