,Recommended,246960,9234966,"Posted: 23 February, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is without a doubt one of the best things to come out of the great retro platformer deluge, which began somewhere around the release of Super Meat Boy. It was stunning to look at, a joy to play, and managed to feel fresh yet familiar at the same time. As with any good thing fans are bound to want more, and Black Forest Games has now delivered just that with Rise of the Owlverlord; a standalone expansion that in many ways is even better than the game which spawned it!If you've played Twisted Dreams (and you definitely should have before jumping into Owlverlord), you should know what you're getting into here; a tightly knit platformer with a neat world shifting mechanic, that controls like a charm and features an outstanding soundtrack. Owlverlord doesn't mess with this formula at all, but reworks it into a smaller more focused experience that fixes nearly all of my complaints of the original and then some.While I enjoyed Twisted Dreams a lot, variety was not its strong suit and I quickly found myself fatigued of it after only a few level, forcing me to space it out of many short sessions to keep it from completely wearing out its welcome. I never felt this with Owlverlord. While there are far fewer levels this time (7, if you include the boss fight at the end), the upside of this is that each is longer and more uniquely designed than those found in the original game, with some of, if notthebest level designs the series has seen to date! It took me weeks to finish the original game, but I tore through Owlverlord like a starving dog who just found a box of bacon, and was left eager for more (despite previously thinking I had had more than my fill of the series after the first game).If you enjoyed Twisted Dreams there is absolutely no reason you should hesitate to pick up Rise of the Owlverlord! It's a shorter game, but a better one in every regard (which is saying something as the original was fantastic as well) that heightens the challenge, fine tunes the gameplay, and somehow manages to deliver and even more ridiculously awesome soundtrack than last time (Machinae Supremacy has completely outdone themselves yet again)! If you have yet to play Twisted Dreams you are missing out on one the best modern platformers we have, a fact Owlverlord only further solidifies. Black Forest Games have continued to impress me more than I would have expected from such humble Kickstarter beginnings, and now have me wishfully hoping a true Giana Sisters 2 is on the horizon.Don't delay, there's an Owlverlord to topple!You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

,Recommended,246960,7810426,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Minoru Leonardo,"Personal rating: 8/10Giana Sisters - Twisted Dreams: Rise of the OwlverlordThis is the standalone expansion toGiana Sisters - Twisted Dreams.About the gameMuch like its core game, the Rise of the Owlverlord is fun, creative and difficult. The game forces the player to shift between ""cute"" and ""punk"" Giana constantly in order to make progress or survive traps even more than the original game. Traps are always there making the player balance out cleverness and reflexes, and enemies are strategically put most of times to aid reaching a secret area or merely to pose an extra challenge.Twisting Dreams againSwapping between cute and punk Giana is a must here and the game will never let you forget about this even once. Swapping can be done between a specific key assigned to it or by using the Fireball Roll (which automatically swaps to punk Giana) or twirling (which swaps to cute Giana). At first it may seem simple, but the game will have creative ways to spice up things as levels goes by.Running and jumping is very precise as you'd expect (and want) in a platformer, the controls feels great and runs smoothly at all times.Learning curve: STEEPUnlike the core game Rise of the Owlverlord holds no punches and throws everything it can as soon you decide to play. Mercifully there is a ""Normal"" mode which considerably ramps down the difficulty inserting safe places between death traps and removing certain gimmicks that would require split second reaction to bypass.However as soon you decide to pick ""Hard"" mode you're in for a rough ride as the game will not hold your hand even for the first second of the first level, but playing at hard difficulty will allow you to earn rank stars and will unlock the finished level for Time Attack and Score Attack mode.Not enough yet?For those seeking for more challenge the game still have the Hardcore difficulty (which removes every checkpoint) and the Über Hardcore (which gives you one, single life for the entire game).Final considerationsRise of the Owlverlord follows just as well the core game and is more than a ""more of the same"" expansion, it is a fine platformer with beautiful graphics, amazing controls and brutally difficult if you are not used to platformers."

There are 10 levels, but they're much longer than before. The music's new, so there's no rehashing there.There's really not much to say that I didn't already say in my review of the first title. It's a comptetent indie platformer that doesn't do what others do and go for the 'retro' 8-bit look which is getting aggrivating.

,Recommended,246960,8556521,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,Bovinoid,"Hi People,Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is not the typical horizontal scrolling platform game with one button to move the character and another to jump. If you have played the ancestors, The Grat Giana Sisters and Giana Sisters DS you know I'm trying to tell you.In this game you have the possibility to manipulate your dreams and transform the character when you want to be able to jump, glide, kill the enemies, etc. You can transform Giana in any moment and choose the prudent/demure Giana or the aggressive Giana depending the situation. It's important to emphasise that you can transform Giana ALWAYS you want over and over again. When you play with the ""cute/shy/prudent"" Giana you can only kill the enemies jumping over them like the typical platform. But, when you play with the ""aggressive"" Giana you can kill the enemies jumping over them or by means of the special attack consisting in transform Giana in a fire ball more or less like Sonic when rolls.Moreover, another important thing is the stage of the game. Why? Because the stage have a little changes depending on the tranformation of Giana you have in this moment. For example, If you have the ""Cute"" Giana you will have in front of you a solid wall impossible to cross, but if you tranform the character and you play with the ""aggressive"" Giana this solid wall disappear allowing you to cross because you are playing in two different dreams (I think it is like a big puzzle).To sum up:Pros:-Original platform game-Excellent Stages (1080p 60Hz)-Frenetic game in lots of situations with fast scenes.-Excellent controls with Microsoft 360 pad.Contras:-Boring game depends on the level and could be repetitive.-Easy. I want to enable the difficult level and I hope it will be better.-You don't have ""lifes"" and you can die as many times as you want to.In conclusion, YES i would recommend it to anyone!Bye!Bovinoid"

A very fair game, and worth picking both games up in the bundle for. I could easily introduce strangers to this series via this game, and let them become immersed in the rich atmosphere and music. Its brevity, while noted, could just as easily serve to better both games. Leading in with this game, gamers can expect a finer transition to the original. Both games do a fine job in educating new players about how to perform moves, and to return players, the ""tutorial hints"" are not oppressive or get in the way. This game serves to whet your appetite and provide you with knife and fork to dive headfirst into everything else Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is ready to offer you.Definitely would recommend to both casual and hardcore style gamers."

But I want to point out that this game is crippled by the checkpoints not being saved when you exit the game. I spent a significant amount of time getting the first 4 keys on stage 2 and then got stuck on my way to get the last one. I spend quite a bit of time on it, and then it started getting late and I just wanted to switch it off and try again from the checkpoint some other time, but I knew after making that mistake previously that it doesn't save the checkpoints...so I kept on playing.Anyway, I ended up turning it off, and it's going to be hard to bring myself to go to all the trouble I already went through knowing that there's a bit I struggle with coming up. I'm sure I'll have another crack at it some time...It's not the 90's anymore. I mean, it's cool to have the uber hardcore mode for people who want the bragging rights, but if you're gonna put checkpoints in the game, make it so they save when you turn the game off.Even if I never play it again, it was worth the 94c just to enjoy the gameplay for a couple of hours, hence why I recommend it. If the checkpoints saved, I'd say it was probably well and truly worth the full $5 (assuming the rest of the game is as good as the first couple of levels).EDIT: (I had another crack at level 2 after a good night's sleep and managed to get through it pretty quickly. It's a really outstanding game, but I still find the fact that it doesn't save the checkpoints both frustrating and a baffling design choice.)EDIT2: After a few playthroughs it becomes easy to finish every level. Getting stars is more difficult, but once you've familiarised yourself with each level, it's easy to estimate how long it will take to play the level and decide if you have time to play. The play times are reasonably short, so even with a busy lifestyle it's no problem to set aside a few minutes to have a crack at getting more stars on a level. My only advice is to make sure you set aside plenty of time to finish the levels the first time you play them. The game is awesomely addictive, controls are smooth and responsive, and despite the somewhat complex mechanics for a platformer, it's very intuitive. The visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack is nice.tl;dr: great game but the fact that checkpoints are lost when the game is closed is frustrating when you're first learning the levels."

This mechanic reminds me SoulReaver because changing characters will open doors and remove obstacles .Most of the difficulty will come from dodging yellow and red colored projectiles because each sister can only avoid one . Also some platforms will go back and forward depending on which sister you playing .Overall the game controls are very fluid and you should have no problem mastering character switching . Although I imagine that playing on keyboard is alot harder than with xbox controler .The game looks very good and kinda feels like a Sonic game because of how fast paced it is . Two realms on top of eachother is always a welcome aesthetic feature .There are some really cool effects like beeing able to raise water level with a click of a button .My only subjective criticizm is that I do not like when core game is designed for post game highscores. I play platforming games to beat the game but there is no death penalty and checkpoints are too close .So the diffeculty really comes from highscore goals that you set for yourself and 1 deathmode in post game .8/10 if you like highscore games . For me personally it would be lower because I look for content and more challenge on a first playthough , not extra modes ."

The boss is also way way better than anything in the original and actually fun and all that, so props on that. I can't say it's that bad level-design wise though there's still some stupid things like no spare hits in stage 2 and lots of moments where you're expected to predict the future (especially in regards to what path to go). The difficulty is pretty even throughout, about the same as the third world of the original game.

Прошел на нормале, что и всем советую. Игра не церемониться с непосвященными, поэтому сложность выше нормала зашкаливает. Никогда не понимал зачем в подобном антураже такие виражи - дефицит чекпоинтов, пройти уровень ни разу не умерев, пройти всю игру ни разу не умерев... тьфу на вас."
,Recommended,246960,9365256,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,dboywheeler,"Granted, I was frustrated with the lag and the controls at first (just barely below AVGN mad) but then, first off, I was playing it on my laptop (really stupid of me, I know) and second, I was new to it at the time.  I should've done the tutorial first.  Still, when you get past the lag and the quirky controls, it kinda grows on you quite well.For those not ""in the know"", Giana Sisters was once a Mario spoof on the Commodore 64 and the Amiga (it was called ""The Great Giana Sisters"").  But who knew there was enough of a following that there'd be a new game with a new flavor all its own?  Again, when you get past the weird controls and (if you foolishly loaded it on a laptop, like I have) the lag, you might actually find it really fun.  And hey, you can't beat the price!"

,Recommended,246960,11379569,"Posted: 23 July, 2014",all,Anometa,There are only 10 level but longer than previous title. The problem is when you quit the level in the middle of the game it will start from checkpoint instead the place where you left. It's harder to play with keyborard than a controller. But overall is great.
,Recommended,246960,13939734,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Siriya,"I like this!This game reminds me of my childhood, a time when I was sitting at the computer for hours and pass the levels :)And about Giana Sisters :)In this game really nice graphics and interesting story feature with two sisters Maria and Giana. Dragon stole Maria, and Giana decided to save her sister. Simple and clear)In the game you play as a one sister - Giana, but with two personalities, and it`s cool, I think ;)As well really liked game world, especially the fact that it changes. Very surprised that at any time, you can switch between the two personas (cute Giana and punk Giana) to make use of their abilities, which in turn will also switch the dream layout accordingly. When you play as a cute Giana you play in the world of nightmares, but when you play as punk Giana you see dream world, and it makes the game really unusual and interesting!In conclusion, I can say that you need to play in Giana Sisters if you want something unusual, beautiful and just have a good time!))"

Mix in it the preemptive pastiche of the magical ambiance of Rayman forests, even some of the high speed thrills of Sonic the Hedgehog. What more could one ask?Well, the truth is that platformers to me need to have a quintessential feature: Tight control  scheme. It's a make or break thing. And unfortunately, Giana Sisters is the latter. I tried both gamepad and keyboard defaults and the movement always feels very unprecise. In fact, I've never been so frustrated with a side-scroller controls and I've been a keen fan of them since the 1990s (I played the lot, Super Mario Bros., Alex Kidd, Sonic, Rayman, Kirby, Donkey Kong Country, Crash Bandicoot... you name it.) None feels as broken as this. So it's a no go, if you want my opinion."

,Recommended,246960,17428104,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,baja gaijin,"A polished little standalone ""expansion"" to the original game. The levels are, in general, a bit shorter, for those who felt the original's dragged on, and the game gets more creative with its obstacles per stage. Each one is basically its own gauntlet and the last few levels will make you mix things up to win. All in all, a damn fine way to cap off this take on the game until whatever that Giana II project turns out to be."
,Recommended,246960,33635221,Posted: 18 July,all,Cuddly Kitty,"I recommend playing the original before playing this.  While the tutorial does a good job, it's missing a couple concepts like how to deal with ghosts.  In addition, the learning curve is steeper in this pack of levels by comparison.  Rise of the Owlverlord in more of the same high quality tough-but-fair platforming that the original Twisted Dreams delivers, but is much shorter and feels like a DLC add-on.  However, the 6 regular stages, 1 boss stage, and three bonus stages are still fun to play.My only gripe with this game is a lack or a stage reset button/menu option."
