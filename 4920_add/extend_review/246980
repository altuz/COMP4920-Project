InFlux offers a serene ambience with melodic music that produces a peaceful environment that is calming.Campaign:Influx is the story of a small ball and its adventure to complete mazes, explore an island, and collect orbs. You must collect orbs in each area in order to unlock the maze that allows you to progress to the next section. The island continually grows as you progress through this amazing campaign and the emptiness keeps you wondering at every turn. I completed the game in about 3-hours, which means it’s not a very long game. You could spend more time exploring the landscape although because of the poor mechanics of the protagonist exploration can seem rather annoying at times.Ambience:The rhythmic music and simplicity of Influx creates at times a very peaceful experience. The game offers a very vivid environment without any traces of even the simplest story. Without a story to follow Influx produces something most games lack, answers. I found myself continually wondering why there were empty houses on the Island, how the modern maze structures formed, why I was even solving the puzzles, and the list goes on and on.Gameplay:The protagonist, a small ball, is able to roll and boost in order to accomplish tasks. There is no point where this character can jump, but by using boosts correctly you can launch yourself into various places. An interesting feature behind controlling the character is that you can boost while in mid air allowing you to change direction. Boosting also slows down time which allows you to gain a view of your environment while deciding how to act in a fast paced situation. Although there are time where controlling the character can be tricky the overall experience is relatively easy.Results:If you like puzzles, modern graphics, beautiful scenery, and melodious music then this would be the game for you. Despite there being more cons than pros I would recommend this game, but only if you can find it on sale for at least 75% off. InFlux is a short, but very riveting puzzle game. If you are a fan of puzzle games then this is the game for you.Pros:+Interesting puzzles and mazes+Beautiful serene scenery+Smooth loading transitions+Peaceful and elegant musicCons:-Poor controls (can be annoying to control the protagonist)-Lack of explanation-Listed control to boost, but doesn't unlock till half way through the game-Attract ability can be infuriating as it forms an orbit rather than just pulling an object to you.-Too short of a campaign"

Aided by a cool soundtrack, chill atmosphere, and beautiful landscape even at lower settings.For some reason I had trouble installing it, but once I got it working it was totally worth it.It's largely free roaming exploration and it's quite easy to understand what to do due to it's simplicity.Due to how enraptured I was into the game, it was actually a little shorter than I anticipated. It could really benefit from an additional level or two under a different kind of landscape, like perhaps a snowy tundra, a space level, or a man made system of some kind.Still if you need to relax, but you also want to have fun while doing it, then I highly recommend this game."

The puzzle engages just enough grey matter to be enjoyable, but are spread out enough that just exploring the world and finding neat landscapes in between breaks up the experience into a joyful take-at-your-own-pace eerie wonder.  It's so rare to find a game which favours and rewards self-exploration for those of us who just like to meander through every nook and corner for idle amusement."
,Recommended,246980,8127022,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,.0day,"So, this game really is loads of awesomeness. It has an incredibly calm atmosphere, lush graphics, ridiculously smooth gameplay, and aims to bring a new light to problem-solving and virtual puzzles. Its originality in terms of both puzzles and overall gameplay really gives off a great vibe, and in my opinion, it feels like the developers really knew what they wanted from this game. They executed this indie game extremely well and it really shows.I have not had the chance to play this game with a controller, but for a mouse and keyboard(which feels more natural to me than a controller), the controls are perfect. The developers really struck a beautiful balance in terms of how you control the gameplay, and subsequently, how the gameplay controls you. They left the complexity and problem-solving to the puzzles of the game and made the controls simplistic. Perfection.On the topic of the puzzles, they also match this game perfectly. As you can see from the teaser video clips, the puzzles take on this abstract form of obstacles within multi-dimensional cubes of glass and steel. Without spoiling anything(or too much anyways), at first glance you would figure this combination to clash with the original atmosphere of the game, but it's quite the opposite; the transfers are done so seamlessly that the player remains undisturbed, and continues to flow through the calm, dream-like gameplay that is InFlux. Most of the puzzles are simple, a couple of them frustrating, but not so frustrating that you want to turn the game off or bang your head against a wall. They always keep you coming back.At the end of the day, this is a fantastic game with an amazing atmosphere that keeps you coming back for more; and honestly, that is the kind of result you want from a problem-solving game of this caliber. If you are on the edge about whether to buy this game or not, just go ahead and buy it and thank me later. For its miniscule price, you get an experience easily worth ten times the amount(was on-sale for $2.99 when I wrote this review)."

No obvious tutorials, it's a fascinating and weird landscape where mechanics are gently added to your repertoire. Absorbing and fascinating.It's not going to be for everyone, sure.

It's broken apart into six different hub worlds, each containing 3 puzzle areas. These hub worlds are wide open natural vistas, whereas the puzzle rooms look a lot like those Marble Blast Ultra. Most of the puzzles deal with world rotation, and getting other marbles to designated areas.The movement feels pretty different than Marble Blast Ultra, mostly in that you carry much more momentum, and you don't have a button to jump. They introduce a charge boost though, that accomplishes similar goals. It has a small story being told organically through the world, and it's just a really satisfying time. I'd highly recommend it to dudes that dug Marble Blast Ultra/Switchball/Spectraball."

,Not Recommended,246980,7830220,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Ignoritus,"What baffles me is how developers who clearly had the time and resources to make such beautiful visuals and ambience managed to screw EVERYTHING ELSE up this horribly.Multiple times I had to replay portions because the game is, as much as I hate to say it, too open world. It's way too easy to get stuck somewhere you shouldn't be and have to restart. And surprise, the game saves itself very rarely and there's no way to manually save it. It's utterly ridiculous. Several of the settings options also seemed to flat out not work.The game has a lot of those little flaws where they're not big enough to cite for a review, but they pile up. A few examples: Before each puzzle you need to collect an unknown number of arbitrary glowing blue dots lying around the area....Why?What's the point of this? It's not like getting them is a challenge or something. They're just lying there. Another example, they give you the ability to gain up speed and ""boost"" forward, yet the collision is so accurate that the bumps in the ground will usually send you hurtling in some odd direction if you ever dare boost across the ground. Yet another ""hyper-specific"" example: There's a point in the game where you activate a thermal vent that serves as a natural cannon. It's right next to you, you get in it, go flying, aaaaaaand- slam into a stalactite. Upon further examination, when you activate the first vent it also activates a second vent slightly back from where you activate them. You have to enter that one. What? Why is the giant vent that EXPLODES right next to me not the correct path? Why do I have to go backwards? It's a pointless waste of time. And I could go on and on about little nitpicks like these.The puzzles themselves aren't awful but they tend to be very straight forward and bland. What's awful with them are the underlying mechanics. Citing Portal as the obvious comparison, in that game you pick up, easily move, and place cubes. Since they're square, they stay where you want them. But that would be too simple for this game. You have to use your magnetism powers to attract or repel spheres that just roll around everywhere. I can't for the life of me conceive a good reason for this awkward and frustrating control scheme.In the end, Influx is visually and thematically beautiful, but not enough so to excuse the incredibly poor gameplay and massive amount of bugs."

If you are a bang bang shooter up type you won't like it.  If you are of the MYST genre and like atmospheric environments, you will love it.That being said, there is a lot of inconsistency in the game saves and it's down right frustrating.  I don't understand why the developers made this feature so user unfriendly since the ability to save your progress is probably the most important feature of any game.Be warned that unless you just leave the game running on your computer, you won't be able to save any progress that you have made on your own.  Rather, it seems mostly random.  For a while it seemed like it was saving at each glass building once you entered.  But I found that NOT to always be true.  Occasionally after you have finished in the glass building and are dumped into the next environment, thinking that your progress has been saved, you exit, you find upon reentering you are back at the beginning of a glass house puzzle, and not necessarily the one you were last in.Also, if  when bouncing around and playing in an environment, you land ""inside"" a rock or piece of graphic, you often can't get out, even with the power surge.  And if you bounce into a section of the game you've already completed (because they sometime run side by side) you more than likely can't get out.  Murphy's law dictates that these are the times when the game chooses to save for you.So I would rate the in game exerience an A+ but the whole saving thing a big fat ""F"".Oh, there is a feature called go to last checkpoint.  But that again is up to the game to choose and not you."

Unfortunatly, the execution is flawed. The open world is full of bugs (I played 10 minutes, I got stuck about 5 times) -you cannot explore the world per say, you have to follow a path from one puzzle house to the other, any sort of deviation and you will either stay stuck bugged out and reset, or you will drown and reset; in other words the open-world feature is useless, very demanding and moslty left unseen- and the camera/controls feel unatural (I played with a PS3 controller).Now that I purchased it, I wonder what's the point.

,Not Recommended,246980,12439903,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,arcanum.zero,"The main problem with InFlux is that it doesn't matter that you're a ball.  Rolling physics games, like Marble Madness, rely heavily on conservation of momentum as a game mechanic.  InFlux does not.  You have very good control over your movements and can arrest your forward momentum at any time.Moving slowly often makes the uneven ground difficult to traverse, but that's more an annoyance than a gameplay mechanic.  There's no incentive to dash madly through levels, not in the least because you spend the navigation levels searching for hard to spot motes of light that you need to unlock the next puzzle.The game has some ramps, but you don't so much roll up them as you hit them at speed and bounce into the air.  Once the game introduces the boost mechanic all semblance of ball relevance goes right out the window, as you can use it to easily turn on a dime at tight angles and even essentially freeze time in mid air to target perfect landings.  Overshot your mark?  No problem, just boost again and turn yourself around.There are some puzzles that involve rolling a ball into a receptacle but that ball is not you.  It's a different ball.  And you don't manipulate it by hitting it like a cue ball or a bowling ball -- you have telekinetic powers.  These puzzles would have been much better if you were the ""scoring"" ball and the game actually forced you to behave like a ball.But instead, InFlux is just a mediocre first-person puzzle game with some reasonably pretty landscaping that is in no way relevant to navigation by a ball.  You might as well be a tiny person with a gun that fires attracting and repulsing waves -- in fact, I have definitely played games where I was a person and my momentum was more difficult to control than it is in InFlux.  At the end of the day you are a character with a motor skills deficiency trying to solve spatial puzzles.  The net result comes across as unfortunately frustrating.It's obvious that the developers put a lot of work and care into this, but it suffers badly from some poor design choices.  I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone but the most diehard of spatial puzzle fanatics.  I definitely don't recommend it to anyone looking for a ball physics game."

Makes good use of the Unreal engine, the environments are well built and with the settings turned up it's a good looking game. The natural hub environments contrast nicely with the more artifical puzzle aspects.  Gameplay wise, this doesn't provide any real additions or major change-ups to the puzzle-platformer genre, but executes it nicely in a comfortable and relaxing style.  Usually the goal is to move color-coded spheres into the matching recepticles using a fairly diverse set of standard puzzling mechanics, including push/pull, lifts, buttons, and level rotators. Gamepad support worked flawlessly for all aspects (I used an Xbox controller, you'll want something with two joysticks), and I didn't encounter any bugs.  It was a bit annoying that sections of the hub environments would load during roaming, and this did create some lag, but the load times were fast so they didn't last long, and didn't occur too often.  Overall a good game for the price."

Between the hybrid of natural and abstract environments, you will find an immersive world full of puzzles waiting to be solved.Controls for the most part were very responsive. (I used an Xbox360 controller which the game immediately recognizes and alters the menu screen accordingly.) Controlling this sphere reminded me of the Morph Ball from the Metroid series assuming Samus was stripped down to just pulsing magnetic fields and using speed boosts to get around.The game's puzzles offer a decent challenge on what you are supposed to do. I think only two puzzles glitched on me, but in both cases, the puzzles did eventually work leaving me wondering what I did differently.In terms of game time, this game is on the short side. I spent about 3 hours give or take on my blind run of the game. To be fair, I can think of one other abstract game that's probably even shorter and still gets lots of praise anyway: Portal.My one real complaint is the apparent compatiblity issue with Windows 7 32-bit OS in which the game apparently runs out of memory and crashes. Thankfully, the forums offer a workaround which certainly made the game palyable for me."

The environment is lush and welcoming, and control of the sphere feels natural.  However, I felt that the game seemed short.  There is a fine line between having too few puzzles and too many, and the size of each of the levels could have crossed that line with another set of 3-5 cubes, so I understand why the developers made this decision.  As with numerous other exploration/puzzlers, plot can be a secondary concern, but the motivations and background of the events in this game were murky at best.  A sphere falls from the sky and powers up the machines for the next part of its journey.  Why were the machines here?  Who built them?  Sadly, one is left with more questions than answers, but it may be left to the player to ponder and draw one's own conclusions.I will say too that I initially had some issues with it stuttering fairly heavily when loading new areas of larger maps, even after turning my settings all the way down.  I was ulitmately able to solve that by counterintuitively turning the settings up or on, but is more likely an issue with the Unreal Engine.All in all, though, this game is definitely worth a few hours of your time if you enjoy puzzle-type games."
76561198027238792,Recommended,246980,8388225,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,1=2,"Take this yes with a _massive_ grain of salt. I can't simply bring myself to say ""No, do not buy this game"", because to be honest I enjoyed it. However, there are a lot of things holding the game back.First off, let's talk about what I enjoyed about the game. The premise of the game is to complete a bunch of puzzles by activating a certain box, which is by far and away the most inadequate explanation for a game, but it's the most I can say without spoiling the game. This is a very interesting concept, and I did have fun solving the puzzles. It's very important for a puzzle game to leave you thinking ""Boy, I solved that puzzle! I'm pretty smart!"" On another topic, this is a very ""artsy"" game, and the atmosphere has to be (and is definitely) executed beautifully. The ""story"" had me wondering what on Earth, or where on Earth, I was. The minimalism put me in the position of having to wonder exactly what I was doing, and it definitely had me guessing, in a sort of existentialist way. This all comes together to make a nice game, and I believe that lots can be done with this premise!Now let's talk about all the glaring downsides of the game. This game is absolutely gorgeous. I think. I wouldn't know, I played on low graphics settings and at times I found myself rolling up a hill whose texture looked like I was rolling up / through a set of stairs. Then again, I'm playing on a Dell i5 laptop, so I wasn't expecting much from the graphics department. The low settings may also explain why whenever I plunged into water that kills me, I see myself falling below the game world for half a second. Or is that the physics engine? One of those two departments has to fix that.Speaking of game physics, this is to me personally the most infuriating flaw of the game. More than once I have found myself stuck _inside_ the ground. Other times, when I break the sound barrier, I fly _into_ rock formations. No, they don't shatter, I just seem to become one with the rock. That's easily escapable though since rocks are actually made of air in the middle. There's also this one part where there is a current that drags your ball to the edge... of a pool... for some reason... and if you don't act quickly you're going to be stuck there for the next few minutes trying to boost your way out. Finally, there are parts where you will encounter the infamous Invisible Wall. Even though the game is trying to take you in one particular direction, it does it in such a way that, if you didn't have the Invisible Wall blocking your way, you can hop onto the top of the edge of the area that you're currently in. I was incredibly let down when I saw this. If I was able to roll on the edge of the arena, that would have given me the feeling that I'm ""beating the system"", and mastering how to control the game.On a personal note, I was disappointed with the lack of difficulty of the game outside of the puzzles. To access each puzzle, you had to wander around a world collecting X-thingies to activate Y-thingies, and open the puzzle. It turns out that you only need to collect three X's to unlock each Y. This killed my ambition to go hunting for X's, or spending effort to catch the X's that are hard to reach, essentially eliminating a possibly very interesting game mechanic.This last oversight is so big to me that I have to count it as a flaw. No level editor? Really??? The level designs were really impressive in the game, and here they are not taking advantage of the potential creativity of their audience. A level editor would practically have the players make the game themselves, minus the artsy portions.So why do I say ""yes"" when the list of downsides is more than thrice as long as the list of upsides? I feel that there is so much potential with this game, and I am willing to bet that Impromptu Games is not done with it yet. It may not be the longest game (though I feel that for the given premise the story length is perfect), and it may look incomplete, but I firmly believe that the Devs have more planned for InFlux. Perhaps a game patch, a level editor, or multiple story arcs with each journey eliciting different emotions. Whatever it is, I'm excited for the future of this game.As for the price, I'm very confident that the Devs can make this game easily worth $10 and then some. But for now... it'd be best to wait for the Steam sale."

It may be the fact that the ball had no way to communicate and no one to communicate with, and must therefore keep the experience of its journey internalized throughout the game, that you feelforit more: the silent protagonist. But this feeling may depend on the sensitivity of the player.Another point of praise goes to the soundtrack, which was beautiful, relaxing and fitting to the game.Technically, the game was sound, with some areas left for improvement. The camera reaction to world collisions can be jarring, and coupled with the strong motion blur used by the game, may cause a few people eye strain or motion sickness. Loading models sometimes caused momentary pauses in the middle of gameplay; and jumps in model level-of-detail are sometimes incongruent.Overall, I recommend you in buying this game. :)"

The pysics are a little shaky but not laughingly funny either. The first time I played, I didn't see a save button so I assumed it would auto-save as soon as I completed a level. haha. hahaha. nope. I quit and had to replay the first three levels again. I came up to the fourth level and I somehow managed to convince the game I already finished it, without even entering it. That would seem nice, but I couldn't get past it in any way, so I was basically stuck. right. reboot the game. start all over again. oh no wait, I didn't. I stopped.Oh and the tutorial at the beginning does not explain how to enter a level, and it leaves you to figure that out too. (Hint: It's the little floating thingies, you'll need three of those)I do seriously not recommend the game. sorry."

I had some fun. but I'd have rather played a lot of other things..."

Unfortunately it becomes dull very quickly.The controls for the ball are clunky and unweildy, and a very slow start up time to get rolling makes it very frustrating when you hit a wall or the ball stops (which is all the time).  The puzzles themselves are tedious, and monotonous. Only challenging because of the clunky controls and not for their actual puzzle merit (although perhaps later game they get better - I don't know, I burnt out very quickly).I generally found the exploration much more enjoyable than the puzzles, but found myself very frustrated that I even had to complete a puzzle to explore more areas - for a game who's focus is the puzzles this gets old very quickly.Not really worth it, felt like a waste of time."

The environments are beautiful and big but just seem hollow as all they really do is provide a little break in between the puzzles. Its better as a relaxing game rather than something to challenge you.
,Not Recommended,246980,7907130,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,dldavidgames,"I came expecting that this game would be similar to ""Marble Blast Ultra"", which is where I thought these developers got thier inspiration from. The reason this game isn't fun is because the controls are way too lose. While the ball is in motion and you wish to turn it to another direction but the ball takes a few seconds to get out of its momentum. Sure in real life the ball might do this but this is game, too much of reality can hinder a game. Also another annoying thing is that the ball doesn't roll smoothly since the ground is bumpy but again reality. This game might of been fun if the controls where more tight."

The gameplay outside the 'greenhouses' is pretty linear and only serves to be pretty. The gameplay inside the lighthouses suffer from the controls and camera problems.Example: The greenhouse can rotate and crush your camera to just a few ""inches"" away from your sphere thing, and then it'll take you like 10 seconds just to recover the camera. All the while, I felt really sick to my stomach as I was forced to zoom in on the sphere that closely.Additionally, you also can't Alt-Tab without graphical errors that require you to Quit Back to the Desktop.Don't be fooled by the Pax Australia badge, that apparently isn't a sign of quality.

,Not Recommended,246980,519328,"Posted: 21 September, 2013",all,Bunni,"*STOP*. Save your money.Terrible puzzle game, terrible anything.The game tries to focus itself around visuals and fails. It’s using the Unreal 3 engine so the visual engine power is there but the game does not use it (considering its focus this is rather silly).Level layouts are ugg, invisible walls, bad layouts (dead ends),  getting stuck in crannies (rocks, between puzzle button ramps and walls). For a game that you'd expect to be movement to be fluid it’s just the opposite, lots of  slow breaking to stop, turning around,  hitting ramps at the wrong angles and thus drop to a complete standstill.... Far, far from fluid...The game flow, I expect, ’s supposed to be a pattern of explore -> puzzle -> explore -> puzzle-> ... etc. Iit’s just executed so poorly, the explore sections are clearly supposed to be *ooo look at the visuals* but it’s more like *oo look at the visuals that look like they are from a game 4 years ago and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (yes I've gone into the settings and jacked everything up). If you stop to look at anything you immediately see beyond the superficial polish into cheap, lazy visual effects.Furthermore a lot of the ‘exploring’ (feels more like walking around Disney world without a map, looking for a particular ride) is to dead end map sections (you’re on an island with all the outlying water being cordoned off with rocks or bundled timber? Looks really silly), where your entire purpose for going down was either to discover keys (blue floating balls) or the absence of keys, either way you have to stop and turn around. All the exploring is through like… hiking trails very bumpy and therefore very little room for any fluidity and gets repetitive as well (“oh look another trail with… tiki huts… ooo so different”).The controls are loopy (e.g. forward+ left should result in the ball rolling left, but instead is like an invisible force is pushing the ball diagonally (like a kid playing with a hot wheels car)), the game is buggy (especially with the boost feature, found myself going THROUGH walls and other solid objects and dropping outside the world or in a place I could not get out of (like inside the model of a tree). Or once I touched some water and then for the next ten minutes I heard the obnoxious water splashing sound looping over and over.My overall impression is that this was some team’s grad school project and they had a great team of modelers, content artists but the game designer and programmers were not so great...The skills you learn are extremely repetitive, e.g. use 'mouse buttons to repel and attract rocks, here now have twenty rock walls incase using this skill didn’t sink in the other twenty times!’ Or the flipper things, have to use them thirty times in a row; it’s all highly repetitive…The puzzles are lack luster, very little thinking, just obnoxious trial and error: “oh you got all the way to the end of the puzzle lugging around 2 heavy balls using the attract? Well oops looks like you stepped on the wrong button which requires you use the balls to activate (no way you could have foreseen this). Now watch the balls fall off the platform and roll back to the beginning of the puzzle, DO IT OVER NOW!” Highly repetitive, very little to no satisfaction for solving puzzles as most are extremely monotonous.Its crap; all in all the game does nothing new (kind of mandatory for a puzzle game) (ok there is ONE new thing, the puzzle maps do flip but really has little effect on your skill repertoire), nor does anything particularly well and it all feels like some poorly executed grad project with no direction other than five people shouting out ill contrived ideas at a meeting table in a student library. It even sounds lame when you describe the games concept out loud “you are this ball thing rolling around the environment up and down ramps placed on hiking trails and occasionally solve puzzles”.Overall *HIGHLY* repetitive and very mundane."
