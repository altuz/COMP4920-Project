76561198005768777,Recommended,247000,18817203,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Archon,"TL;DR:  Ignore the meta-critic score; ignorant reviewers shouldn't be allowed to review games.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Talisman: Digital Edition is an amazing adaptation of the original boardgame. I could write several pages about why this game is enjoyable to play, but there are a million reviews that can give you that.  Instead, let me explain why all of the negative reveiwers are wrong:1 - Most of the negative reviewers can't read.  I don't know how to put this politely, but it seems that 9/10 of the negative reviews I see about this game come down to the fact that the reviewer didn't understand how a certain card or area worked.  For example, they'll say things like, ""I couldn't use my Psionic Blast card in the middle of combat????"""" ... when the card clearly states when you can use it.  I'm sorry, but if you can't even read, you shouldn't be reviewing games.2 - Many of the negative reviewers are 'hung up' on the game's randomness; in their minds, this means that the game does not ""require any skill"".  Several reviews talk about the random nature of the dice rolls and card draws--you even have YouTube personalities getting uptight over the randomness--and they all try to make the same, idiotic argument:  that the game isnt' as ""good"" as, say, Dota 2, or League of Legends (where skill is required).  Of course, what they are trying to say is that, in their estimation,  the game lacks strategic depth.  This is, of course, entirely false.  While the game may be easy to play (not requiring much skill), Talisman has layers upon layers of strategic depth, in that the entire game is built around choice-based risk management and knowledge of the game.You see, these YouTubers who have NO FAMILIARITY WHATSOEVER with the game--and thus no strategic understanding of what they should be doing--and are just throwing dice and drawing cards, at random, and then simply pronouncing the game ""dumb"", ""dull"", or ""without merit""--they're all just talking out of their asses.  They're like chimpanzees poking at a keyboard, as they make one bad decision after another.  And because the game isn't, say, League of Legends, they simply pass it off as crap.  Meanwhile, they raise up games like Hearthstone, etc.,  even though they are equally abstract and are driven by a similar kind of randomness.3 - Talisman is difficult for many reviewers to even classify, much less actually review well, and for a very specific reason.  On the surface, the game is ""abstract"", much in the same way that other boardgames, like Monopoly, are abstract.  The game board is an abstract ""construct"" that you move around by random dice rolls.  At the same time, you are playing a discreet character, in an almost RPG fashion, with spells, abilities, statistics, inventory, followers, etc.  These two aspects of the game, when combined, seem to confuse many reviewers who are simply incapable of appreciating the game as a whole.  They tend to focus on one of the game's aspects, while ignoring the other (or getting confused by it), and then lay all kinds of criticisms without looking at the whole game.  These are reviewers who simply cannot ""pair"" the RPG aspect with the abstract, boardgame aspect, so they simply trash the game without a second thought.  I'm sorry, but if you're too stupid to understand a game's overall design, you shouldn't be allowed to review it.Don't even get me started on the negative reviewers/monkeys who can't figure out the UI.  I mean ... really?  The game can be played on an iPad, but you can't figure out how to use the UI?  If nothing else, that tells you what kind of reviewer you're dealing with.4 - The base game has its flaws, but with DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a really great game.  Some reviewers complain about the game's standard ending--and, I would have to admit, the standard ending, in its own way, is rather lacking, and it can certainly take a while for the game to conclude.  There are options to make the game end faster, but of course the negative reviewers again fail to mention (or even see) this.More than anything, though, it's worth noting that, the game's ample amount of DLC provides a metric ton of content, from 20+ new characters to play, additional game boards/regions, NPC's, hundreds of new cards, items, etc.--as well as dozens of new endings, both revealed and unrevealed.  And more are coming, as Nomad works to ""finish"" and/or round out the rest of the game, so that it matches the full boardgame (with all expansions) developed by Fantasy Flight Games.To judge Talisman WITHOUT the DLC--which EVERYONE knew was coming--is just a huge disservice to the game.  I understand that reviewers are tasked with reviewing the base game on its own merit, but really anyone who is familiar with the board game will tell you that to review the base game alone is just a waste of a review.  With DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a great, very enjoyable, game, and any reviwer who ""trashed"" the base game--knowing that it was basically ""unfinished"", in a sense--is just ignorant, in my opinion.  They could at least mention the fact that DLC changes the base game completely.  Of course, none of these negative reviewers ever come back to re-review the game, with all of the DLC.  Like every good tabloid ""writer"", they're simply happy to skewer an easy target, and just move on.  It's shameful, really.Anyway ....If you are a boardgame fan and are thinking about getting Talisman, and are ""on the fence"" because of all of the negative reviews:  Don't worrry.  Don't listen to them.  Just get the game.  And get the DLC as well.  It's well worth it.  The negative reviews are largely written by people who can't read, who only played the base game, and are so used to playing FPS games, MOBA's, etc., that they don't even know what to make of Talisman.  Their reviews are crap."

I'd heard about the digital edition quite a while ago, when it first entered the Steam greenlight process (originally as Prologue, the single player edition). I've followed the progress up to the point where it was released though Steam Early Access and then jumped at the chance to get it.I've had a real blast playing both the Digital Edition (just against AI opponents at the moment) and playing the Prologue (single player variant game). My wife also expressed interest in playing it again (either Board version or Digital edition) so we gave local multiplayer a try using Steam Big Picture on her laptop, hooked up to our TV, and passing a mouse between us. It was a lot of funIf you've ever played the boardgame, then I highly recommend the digital version. The game is faithful to the original in virtually every respect, with the addition of the Prologue single player edition which makes for a very enjoyable single player experience. There's no online multiplayer in the early access version yet, but it is coming in time for the full release of the game.If you've never played the boardgame, but are interested in fantasy themed adventure boardgames, then track down the Demo of Talisman Prologue(http://www.talisman-game.com/prologuedemo/)and give it a try."

I have played extensively on This Digital Deluxe version of Talisman now and can render the following Analysis:Keeping in mind that it IS still in Pre-release stage overall it is an enjoyable gaming experience one can play with the whole family (Up to 4 players).Pros:1.) Simple to learn and play2.) Ease of use - the game is entirely mouse driven. One can play with the keyboard sitting on the desk, feet kicked up ... using only the mouse as you relax in your favorite chair.3.) In-game voice chat which can be muted by individual player4.) Fantasy based ... always a plus :)5.) Family Friendly - as long as you are not overly religious (Devils, demons, angels, undead etc are contained within)6.) A Mandatory Random setting!!! The host can set the game to Classic mode where no perks (Runes) can be used and all class choices are random, this is an option missing from other games (DoTP needs this badly)Cons:1.) Glitches up terribly in Multi-player if someone leaves the game normally locking it up. (SP w/Bots works fine)2.) Game glitches if you alt/tab out to do something else3.) Re-playability isn't that good. It takes a couple of games to see all the spells and Adventure cards but once you have run through them once or twice, things tend to get repetative. They definitely need a wider range of spells and adventure cards.4.) Class balance isn't that good. Some classes are very noticeably more powerful than other classes and have abilities that give much greater advantages over other players (Prophetess and assassin come to mind)5.) Using AI's in Multi-player runs the risk of hanging the game up. Bots usually get hung up in the City at the alchemist and they go into an infinite loop and the game cannot progress from there but as of 1-7-2014 using all humans in MP games hasn't botched up unless someone rages quits .... which is common if the game is not going their way.Overall I would recommend this game as I expect all these problems to be worked out before its final release version."

So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman.  Well duh.  That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant.  You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews.  The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.So, are you new to Talisman?  New to board games in general?  No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it.  Youtube.  Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version.  If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you.  If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere.  Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers.  People who like the board game but hate the digital version.  But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.I think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game.  And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix.  Happy gaming!"

You'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. To everyone else, I must say...Talisman is a hard game to recommend. My partner and I enjoy playing and we laugh hard at the antics which play out over the board, but there are still way too many things not working as intended, too many bugs, too many instances where the user interface doesn't do what you may want it to do.They're charging a lot of money for content that isn't even created yet, and the stuff that is already there often does not work as advertised. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but as yet it still acts way too much like a beta version for Nomad to be charging full price.I can recommend this game only to hardcore fans of the genre like myself. For everyone else, I'd have to say... wait for them to finish the game and maybe get it on sale at a deep discount."

While my preference - out of comfortable familiarity - is the original, the modern streamlined version is just as good and certainly removes the hours of rules conflicts that inevitably arise.The computer version does this one better by enforcing a standardized ruleset, making games last (usually) less than an hour and a half. The computer's turns can be sped up, too, improving game speed even more.Purists will enjoy the classic rules while people who find the basic rules too hard can improve their characters through progressive upgrades. Numerous achievements also offer arbitrary if fun goals along the way."

You can play against AI, local humans or online covering all bases. Items need to be found and kept hold of to get past certain points adding strategy. Battle is based on a strength or craft stat with a roll of the dice, winning battles can earn you stat increases. Character abilities are varied enough to tip situations to your advantage meaning you will want try different classes out. It is fun to go up against the AI and they offer a reasonable challenge without being perfect players! I have played two full games losing the first against three random(?) thieves but winning the second against a more varied group as the warrior (as always a recommended starter class!). You will gain runestones to give you a small advantage in later games (you can buy these but I would suggest earning them instead). I have now invested in the first expansion as the prices and playability seem fair even without a sale. Basically if you like Board Games with a Fantasy setting then get it!"

We played for hours, sometimes into the wee small hours of the day. It was addictive, and fun.As the years went on, still playing the game, and as the various expansion packs rolled out from Games Work Shop...we discovered BEER. We continued to play into the small hours, but now a little tipsy. We would stop the game, and gingerly put the game boards into a safe corner, until the hangovers wore off, and we could continue the same game later.The point is, that if you give this game some time and patience, then it grips you with some phantom force calling you back for more.This digital version perfectly emulates the original board series from my youth, and would recommed this game if you have the time."

,Recommended,247000,34285021,Posted: 16 August,all,Balaam's ass,"tldrGood game - a mix of challenge and frustration, where victory doesn't always leave you feeling like a winner.  NOT a fast achievement kind of game, but one that can offer at least several dozen hours replay value even in the solo player - but it's much more fun with friends, while you're all voiced and light-hearted.The DIRTI had a complex short novel ready to go in regards to the many things that can happen in this game, but it was too much, even for having nigh on 100 hours in the game; someone unfamiliar with Talisman wouldn't understand most of it, anyway... and that is exactly the summary of complexity that is relevant to a review: if you're unwilling to spend some time learning the game, you will probably not enjoy the experience.  My 96 hours make me rather competent to play, but not nearly aware of the many dozens (or hundreds?) of strategies that can lead to different styles of play.This is the kind of game that can make new friends and lose old friends, all in the space of the first 5 turns.  The learning curve is simple for basic game rules, but sharp, SHARP,SHARPfor particulars in regards to how the turn is executed and in what order things resolve.For example, as a turn based game with a turn-speed throttle, if you have the game speed turned up (a necessity, lest every turn last a short eternity) it can be very easy to miss an opportunity to use a spell, card, or ability that would save your bacon (or fry someone else's) simply due to the speed of the turn, and a lost opportunity due to the game timer expiring.  Especially when you're new in the game and don't know what a card with a lot of text does, it's difficult to know whether you want to respond or just let it happen.  Not knowing the game well only exacerbates this tendency, thus giving new players a potentially very frustrating first brush.Because of the many, many items of interest here, I'll try to narrow down a few things so that this review might serve as a complement to others, or an encouragement to look further for those up to the challenge.First, as stated, this is NOT an achievement hunter's easy game.  Of the (current count) 189 achievements, there is one for every character, one for almost each ending, and at least 19 hidden, unintuitive achievements.  Most of the revealed ones are not difficult and would be easily revealed in the course of a normal game (things like, as the Elf, go to a different forest than the one you start in; or, as the Troll, roll a 6 on the die and choose to heal instead of move).  However, the many, many DLCs for this game are linked to many of the achis because not all characters are included in the base game.Second, if this game does not frustrate you at some point with a terrible run of ""every move I have is crap and every roll I make is a 1,"" then you haven't really played long enough to know what people rant about - because when it happens, it's really, really bad.  On the bright side, you can check the forums for a dev explanation... but on the dark side, it's bad enough that enough people asked the devs why the AI cheats! xDThird, the ~2 dozen endings to the game provide rich variety in play and a pretty good reason to play different characters, use different modules (DLC), and play with friends.  While the bots will be somewhere between capricious and random, you can count on your friends to be downright malicious and self-serving when it comes to who gets that awesome follower, or pet, or the stat buff from a good magic ring.  Any given game can be played with 2 to 6 characters (persons or bots), but a 6-player game with all players can easily run 16 or 20 hours, depending on how cutthroat or cooperative you all play.  Hard game is HARD when it comes to a big game.Fourth, there are periodic crashes in multiplayer games that prevent the game saving - which means not all players can return, since their disconnect resulted in a failed save.  This appears in my experience to be most likely when all players do not have the DLC that the host has enabled, but is not limited to this circumstance.  Further, the .dmp file is on the order of 600mb (no typo - six hundred megs for a dump file), which makes it... cumbersome to send to the devs.  The forum is expressive on this point with player frustration, but I have found that playing solo does not result in crashes.There's so much more to say... but if you've made it this far, you're probably going to check other reviews, so I'll cut it short and give my thumbs UP for the following reasons.Why buy and play?Acceptable sounds, musicGood translation from board game to digital board gameComplex game mechanics give high replay valueFun with friendsCards and achievements - and boy, let me tell you: when you get achis in this game, you've earned them!CriticismsDLC will break your bankMinor/Sporadic game crash riskTIME... games can be really longGood job on this project Nomad Games - not a perfect 10, but I keep playing because you got the spirit of this game right."

Simply put. 10/10 for a recreation of the board game. With many expansions, characters to choose, rules that can be turned on/off, and  many, many different endings/conditions for winning, Talisman is a new game each time you play. Some of the reviews are "" just roll a die and decide to go left or right..durrrr""... I wouldn't expect that traveller to ever reach the crown. There is heavy strategy that you can implement to put you atop the crown, or in the best position to do so. You can also not care about strategy at all and just have fun playing the game and the RnG of it all. However, if you are playing with seasoned players, be sure to try to make good decisions, calculate carefully, and take your opponents tendencies into consideration as well in order to succeed.

,Recommended,247000,22490150,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Pessimistic Page,"If you like Talisman, this is a great adaption of the board game!  The appeal of this game as a digital copy of the board game is twofold:  The computer manages all the fidely cards and components (plus no clean up or set up), and this digital edition is WAY cheaper than than the physical game.  Playing games with AI can be great too if you have no friends.If you have no idea what Talisman is but are intrested in this game, let me lay it out for you:  Talisman is a RPG in a box.  You pick one of a million characters with unique abilites and attributes and race against other characters to reach the 'crown of command', a game space that slowly kills all the other players.  If you kill everyone else, you win.  The thing about the crown is that its locked away in an inhosptable wasteland that your weak character will not be able to reach right away.  As a result, you gotta level up, fighting monsters, encountering events, and PVPing other players.  Awesome stuff.This game is not without its faults though.  This game is extremely RNG based.  Everything is based on dice rolls.  There is strategy in the game, sure, but alot of the time so many random things you can't control are happpening that you kind of have to just roll with it.  This is essentially the heart and soul of the game, so if this is unappealing to you, this game might not be for you.  Now personally, normally I hate games that are overly based on luck, but Talisman is great because it never pigeon holes you into situations.  Every turn you have a choice on which direction to go, where on the board(s) to travel, who to interact with, etc and these choices give you an illusion of freedom and often a way to blame yourself for your bad luck.  Went into a cave and got ♥♥♥♥ed by a dragon at level one?  Should have gone to town, your opponent would have got the dragon instead.  Now, this game does have a 'fate' system that lets you reroll dice, giving you some control over your luck, but it can be hard sometimes to know when is best to reroll and sometimes you can just reroll bad rolls again(dice rolls are seeded at the begining of the game, so reloading doesnt work).This game does a great job of always giving you something to do and work towards, and the various expansions give lots of variety and alternative scenarios.  If you get this game I highly recommend some of the expansions (get the season pass on sale to get all future expansions cheap), specifically the reaper and the corner boards.Before rounding out this review I just want to provide a shout out to the company that made this digital adaption, nomad games.  Originally I thought this company was just porting this game from the ios and wouldn't care for the quality of the game post release.  How wrong I was.  Not only do they participate on the forums frequently and respond to posters, but they have even developed and distributed free content based on customer critisism.  This is very rare these days and exremely praiseworthy.Objectively Talisman isn't the greatest game ever made, but I seriously love this game regardless.  It may be luck heavy but the experience of travelling around the board, collecting loot and getting stronger before racing to the end against other players is great.  Laugh at your friends as the dice ♥♥♥♥ them, then cry out in amazement as they get the luckiest card draws, but most of all enjoy the ride and the emerging narrative that the game provides."

I would happily recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether one was a fan of the original tabletop Talisman.Talisman: Digital Edition has HUGE replay value, owing to the random nature and variety of card draws, and the large assortment of character classes available. Each class allows (and often requires) you to approach the game in a different way. You can also customize various game rules before starting up a new game, which adds to the variety and replayability.The DLC is also strongly recommended. Each expansion adds a massive number of new enemies, events, items, classes, and additional rules. The DLC in this game is very definitely worth every penny!"

I wouldnt be playing 24/7 but its a nice switchup for a bit of fun with some of my other friends that also enjoyed playing this game table top.Updated after purchasing all XPACs.Recently with the additions of all of the expansion packs, I have experienced NUMEROUS errors/glitches/and bugs playing the game. Considering that the game can run upwards of 4 to 5 hours for a group of 4 that are enjoying themselves, to have the game screw up (client/server crashes for one or all players, yes both have happened to me and my friends) and be unrecoverable is inexcusable seeing as you lose all your experience for the game. At times, spells do not function as stated, Objects do not work properly (as stated on the card), etc.  Sadly, I am changing my recommendation to NO until the developers address the issues.

The board game part still holds up, it's fun to play with your friends, taking stabs at each other while racing for the crown of command.Unfortunately that fun is hamstrung by poorly designed UI. Everything about it is clunky and irritating to the point where I can't be bothered to play this anymore. Here's a short rundown of the biggest offenders:* Looking around the map is awkward. You can't quickly zoom in on a location, see it's text or quickly browse the cards that are there. Of course you can do all of that, but it's not intuitive or snappy.* Timers are awkward on spells that have to be cast during certain phases. There's a mechanic where you mark a spell to fire when the trigger is available, but it can sometimes work differently than expected making you target the wrong player. Can be avoided by playing more carefully but it's easy to make a mistake.* Planning your turn while your oponnents are playing is nearly impossible. The camera will constantly snap back to the current player showing them move. You will also be presented with the reverses of cards every time they're making a decision effectively blocking your screen because why not. You can't basically do anything useful while it's not your turn. It plays like a online enabled hot seat game. This leads to a lot of downtime and makes the games drag on unnecessarily.* In-game handling of people dropping out of game for whatever reason is♥♥♥♥♥♥ The AI automatically takes over for anyone who loses connection so unless you react quickly enough and save they will lose their turn to AI doing some dumb stuff. Also there is no way for a player to rejoin without reloading the whole game. To top it all off the game handles reloading a saved multiplayer game automatically without you ever seing any menus (like say 'chose a saved game to load'). It usually works fine but can (and has) lead to losing your savegame.It makes me really sad to recommend meeting for the board game version or playing on tabletop simulator over this version."

,Recommended,247000,33909358,Posted: 30 July,all,Rawrzington,"Talisman is long board game.  Often described as a combination of D&D and Monopoly.  The starting board doesn't show much, but as the game continues more is added to the board and things can get very interesting.The main game is fun to play a few times, but where the game starts to get really good is with the expansions.  All add cards, and some expand the board game.  After playing with the expanions, I don't like playing the base game.Pros:-Solid adaptation of Talisman.  Though playing IRL is always better than digital, if you have the itch to play it, this is great.-You will never have the same game.  The combination of different cards, choices and luck will make each play experience different.  Also, play with different characters to get a real new adventure.-Great to play with Bro's who like this stuff.  Talisman is a party game.  It might be hard to get 5 other people down to play a game as long as this, but it's the best.-If the host of the game has expansions, then everybody can play with them,  Though those who do not have expansions will not be able to choose the new characters, they still can get cards, and experience the expansions.  If you're not sure about a new expansion, you can use this to test drive them.-Stuff goes on sale constantly.  Wait for prices to drop and pick it/expansions up.Cons:-Multiplayer is glitchy.  Earlier versions were plagued by a lot of disconnections.  It was horrible playing a game for three hours then having it clitch out and start over.-The UI is very tough to get down/can be glitchy.  For new players, this might be a deal breaker.-After each action, there is a few seconds wait time to let other people respond if they want too.  This adds to the over all play time.  I've played Talisman in real life and on steam, and the steam game adds an hour or two with just waiting.  It's the nature of the beast I guess, but it should be noted.-Not all the cards work the way they should or the way you think they would.  I actually had to read the IRL rule book to figure out if somethings were glitches.  The game won't tell you a thing.-The AI level isn't always the same.  Sometimes in the same game it's that doofus kid eating paste, other times it's a calculating monster.  In some games you can learn how to play and a lot about the meta by how the AI plays, you can't really do that with this game.  Never underestimate the AI.-----------------------------------------Overall, it's a very good game but not without faults.  The IRL board game costs between $40-$60.  If your'e interested in Talisman, but not sure if you'll like it, $8 on steam is a good price to see."

( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.id call  this the talisman tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismanThere are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.(at time of review it was not on sale ) .so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present.for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10(The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more.)DLC review.now i wouldnt advice you to dig deep and buy all the dlcs, unless  you know the game inside and out.but i would say to maybe look at (The Reaper or The Blood Moon first )these add a little extra fun to your game and  beginner must haves.will i end up getting all the dlc, 100% yes.The more you play Talisman ,the more you want to play, win, lose or draw its more fun that a sack full of kittens.(just a saying , animals should always be loved and looked after lol).At the time of this review i also purchased the ps4 version which came with all dlc apart from 1 or 2 that are on steam.(£23).this game is a amazing ride, and the Buy now button is your ticket.i give Talisman Digital Edition a sword swinging,strength building, giant  slaying 10/10."

My Elf soon discovers that he has a nack for lifting, so he begins to Lift all across the land. He soon becomes the strongest Elf, to the point that Dragons immediately burn up and die by simply being in his presence. The Elf soon becomes known as Bicelf, master the bicep and all things body building. The Elf then notices that a stream of protein powder has appeared in a forest, along with a stream of life in a another forest. Enraptured by its beauty he rushes to the first stream with great passion ,and proceeds to travel back and fourth between the streams, mixing them into the ultimate protein shake, till there was not a drop left.However, while Bicelf the great was busy mixing his poretin shake, a Dwarf born of a noble lineage, decends into a pit of dispair in the tavern as he drinks his life away. Soon contracting every dicease, virus or cancer, from STD's to the common cold, as he performs many questionable acts within the tavern.However, as time passed he came across a ball, the ball of which whispers to him of darkness. This strange combination of ball and disease soon beings to manifest as a being of pure death, with anything the Dwarf touches dying soon after. However, the Dwarfs toxic powers cannot be contained with his small body, and begisn to leak out, poisoning the entire land, slowly draining the life from anything it touches, with nothing able to stop this cloud of death, and when I say nothing I mean nothing no healer, no magican not even a angel could heal him.Bicelf hearing of this taint on the land travels to meet it, and hope to end it. But the STD riddled Dwarf is a slippery one, eluding him at every turn, constantly keeping just out of reach. Unable to catch the Dwarf, the Dwarf proceeds to devour all who live, with the elf in hot pursuit. The Dwraf of whom chases after a strange ninja who, having lost all his honor has decended into killing innocent animals in the forest. Even becoming so desperate at one point, that he tried to turn his sword into gold. However, it failed him, leaving himself a sword that was one part sword and one part of what remained, but no one was interested in buying.My Elf in pursuit of the Dwarf of death, continues to turn dragons to dust under his gaze, and vanquishing all evil he finds. But, is still unable to catch the Dwarf despite his efforts. Seeing how much of the land is now currupted, and no other option Bicelf turns to the crown of power, deciding the only option is to wipe the world clean, cleansing the world of the Dwarfs curruption, who has now widely called, The Destoryer of Worlds.Bicelf begins his journey entering the inner region, melting the sentinal with a simple flex of his sweet pecks. Now, with his vast quantitys of mule's, a unicorn, the ring of power, the legendary crown of soloman, a battle axe, a mecernary who has follows Bicelf in the hopes of avenging his family, a alchemist (The same one who turned the ninjas sword to gold), some provisions, armour and most importantly the fabled talisman.Ready to go, Bicelf begins his journey into the wasteland.Back in the outer region, the Dwarfs power grows, gaining strength from the lives he consumes. He finally catches the ninja, devouring his strength and stealing everything the ninja had left. Taking a fancy to the ninjas armor.After a short journey my Elf reaches the doors to the great desert and begins his journey, in its harsh and unforgiving wastland. Soon after entering the wasteland, he runs into the Reaper, former lord of death (Second to the Dwarf). Death who, despite becoming second to the Dwarf still thinks himself the strongest. Hearing this, Bicelf is overcome with a masculine rage, declaring that nothing is stronger than he, and begins to beat the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of death.The battle lasts for a few minutes, before Bicelf gains the upper hand, body slamming death into the ground, and crushing him between his sweet solid biceps. Having beaten Death to death, and having done a exceedingly good job at it, our hero continues his journey to the crown. However, he is soon met along the journey a pack of wolves, which with a simple flex of his masculine and perfect gluteus maximus, he turns into smears by the shear shockwave of raw power his gluts create. Now, with the crown in sight, and with a end to his journey in sight, he stands before the crown taking a moment to savor this achivement, thinking about the moment he'll purge the destroyer of worlds, and finally free the world. But, for a second he wonders if this is the right thing, since after all this will kill everyone not just the Dwarf. But, if he doesn't do it, the Dwarf destroy the world anyway. After a moment, and a quick workout (He does his best thinking while he bulks), he realises he has to do this, grasping the crow and placing it atop his head, so beginning the purge of the Dwarf era.The Dwarf however, whose power has grown beyond comprehension at this point, begins to feel the purge take hold, draining his life force. So, without a moments hestitation, he rushes to enter the inner region. However, as he comes upon the sentinal, he is struck down as the crowns affects have begun to weaken him.The ninja having been begging for money on a dirt path nearby, and seeing this opportunity, runs out and uses a magic spell he learnt back in his old dojo, destroying all the items the Dwarf had.As the items begin to fade into the infinite void, the ninja began to hear a faint whisper, telling him of the power of the dark ball the Dwarf possessed. But, despite the ninja's situation, his mind, though devoid of all honor still retains its strength, and he is able to resist the orb as it is finally over come by the void, and banished to its deapths. The Dwarf unable to reconsitute himself, thanks to the loss of his orb of power, and the purge draining his life force, begins to slip into the void with the orb, pulling his corruption with it. The Elf still wearing the crown, finishes the purge, cleansing the world of all life, including the ninja who was able to die with a shred of honor.Bicelf however, now being to the sole being in existance, begins to perform a righteous workout, bulking up to a godly level, and from his sweat life was born anew.Bicelf, no longer able to live among the world of mortals, writes down the events that have transpired, so that the future generations of this world could read of their creation. However, Bicelf could not stay for long as his muscles were so perfect and well toned, that he can no longer reside with the likes of mortals, since all who gaze on his perfect body would be overwelhemed by their shear power. Ascending to the relm of the gods instead, where he could become the god of lifting, inspiring a new generations of body builders.Good game 10/10, would purge the world of life to stop a insideous STD riddled Dwarf again.Play with friends if you want a good time."

The last two hours consisted of me rolling a die, hoping for a 50-50 chance result to come up a number of times. Every turn. Flip a coin. Next. It took me more than EIGHTY turns to finally grind everyone's HP down to zero. Max HP any one opponent held at any time? Seven. EIGHTY turns. I'd like a word with the playtester who signed off on that.This is a digital adaptation of a boardgame and as I understand it, it's quite a faithful one. I've never played the tabletop version, so I can't make any statements to that effect, but I'm happy to believe that it is. It certainly feels like a board game. Specifically, it feels like a board game from the eighties, and that's not much of an endorsement.Don't get me wrong, I want to like this game. I appreciate the idea of turning an RPG into a boardgame, but this is a very flawed attempt. The first part, where you're stocking up on resources (items, health, combat stats), the GOOD part, is still a tedious grind, due to the extreme randomness. Roll the die, move exactly that many squares, hope for a decent encounter, hope you'll pass that encounter, eventually advance a little bit, then hope the others don't gang up on you once you get ahead a little. Rinse, repeat.""But it's a dice game, of course there's randomness!"" Quite right. But that's not a get out of jail free card. Go have a look at Elder Sign to see dice randomness done right. The board is a significant component of the game experience, but in essence it's no more sophisticated than the board in Trivial Pursuit. The difference is that TP isn't about exploring the board, so it can get away with it. If you want to make the game about exploring the board, have a look at Legends of Andor and learn how to get a much more satifying experience in a lot less time.As someone who has played a lot of board (and card, and dice) games and a lot of role playing games, I can see the potential and the appeal of the concept, but I really can't recommend the actual product. I see reviews stating that it gets a lot better with this-or-that DLC, but my experiece with the base game doesn't make me want to spend more money on something that was thoroughly unenjoyable.Eighty bloody coin flips..."

It is enjoyable enough to play, but you cannot take it too seriously.  It will delight you as many times as it will break you.  Talisman:  Digital Edition emulates this experience precisely.  I know some people have an issue with the RNG of this game, but when it comes to simulating the physical board game, I can say that it is spot on.  You will rarely roll the number you need to survive and you will often draw the worst possible card at any given time - just like the real board game!My advice to anyone playing this game is to play without the expectation of winning.  Play it as if it's a rogue-like, choose-your-own-adventure fantasy story represented by a board, some cards, and miniatures.  I guarantee that once you lighten your expectations, your playing experience will be much more enjoyable.

But not without qualification.  While an ably faithful translation of the boardgame experience, the AI is simply not challenging enough for veteran players of the game.  It's not that the AI will never win against a seasoned player.  It can.  But things have to go extremely right for the AI, and extremely wrong for the player, for this to happen.   Even with the wonky AI, I still find myself enjying the game.  And I believe most folks familiar with the game will, as well.If you've never played Talisman, the AI is actually a benefit, as it keeps the game from being too punishing to neophyte players.  It's not that Talisman is an overly complex game.  But there is a lot of information to absorb.  The starter set alone boasts over a dozen playable characters, all of whom have multiple special abilities and differing alignments; there are five attributes for each character; there are nearly one hundred event cards, spells, etc.  So you get the idea.  There's a bit to learn and the AI allows games to extend the learning curve.If reviews were given on a scoring basis as opposed to a simple recommend/not recommend, I would score Talisman: Digital Edition a solid 8.  In spite of the AI, the overall gameplay experience is fun for those who like board games or fantasy settings and there is a lot of replayability to be had."

I purchased the season pass for this in order to get all of the expansions as they become available. While I certainly get a bit itchy to see the next one come up immediately, it is not because of undue slowness of release so much as my enthusiasm. That being said, do not expect to pick this thing up and have all content immediately, or even in the next couple of months. I feel that the quality of the experience definitely is worth the wait, but if you are an ""instant gratification only"" sort of gamer, then I would advise waiting a little bit. I say this because the value of the season pass is incredible. Since this is a bit of a financial leap, I downloaded the demo of the Prologue, liked what I saw, and went for it. A comparison of the cost between the tabletop version of the game + expansions will send you reeling, and to me was a great option as a way to eventually test the expansions out before investing in the physical boards, since I don't play often enough to justify buying all of them.Totally worth it, in my opinion!!!The Game:The game varies in small ways from the Prologue, as it has been updated and refined, and I consider these differences to be in the best interest of the game for playability and ease of use. Keep in mind that the prologue is designed as a single player experience, and the interface is adjusted accordingly.Unfortunately, I have not been online with the game and can therefore not comment on that.The House Rules and various play options are fantastic.The DLC: In between releases of expansions, features are updated and new characters are added to the mix. These have interesting abilities and seem balanced, though I am still playing through to try different play styles, since some characters are meant to flourish when played in a particular way.I was really pleased with the way that the Reaper expansion was handled. There are some great adventure cards and characters, but the Reaper himself is not my favorite game element. When the community spoke, the developers listened and added the ability to deactivate the Reaper while keeping the rest of the expansion in play.Frostmarch has just been released, so I look forward to checking that out as well.I expect that some members of the community may say that this content ""should"" be released faster, I really think that the quality is well worth the wait, and that the characters that are added in between expansions keep the worst of the suspense at bay."

If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!There's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!The goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.That last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.Did I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.In short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!You can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.I'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.Anyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest."

When it was first released under early access, I was very disapointed in the AI, but I decided to give it another try now that it is officialy released, and I was impressed enough to pick up the expansions (Reaper, Frostmarch, and a couple of the character packs), and those make it an even better game.  If you enjoy the board game version, it is worth getting, but do so knowing that it may be quite a while til all the expansions are out and that the digital version is limited to 4 players max.  A few of the specific character AI's such as a the elf sometimes still do strange stuff, but overall the AI is at least competant enough for a single player vs AI game to be satisfying to me.If you have not played the board game and are on the fence, but you do like board games that involve a bit of luck, then I still recomend giving it a try, but probably best to not pay full price if you are on the fence. (I paid full when it came out and still consider it worth it, but this is a game with a lot of childhood nostalgia for me, so I'm highly biased)If you do get it, getting at least one of the expansions (Reader or Frostmarch) is highly recomended, because they basically double the size of the adventure deck and give you a few more characters to play with which adds a lot to the replayability."

The main goal of the game is to build up your character by travelling around the board, gaining Strength and Craft by events, killing monsters, and sometimes, luck. There are three ""sections"" of the realm, and once you get to the inner most area with a Talisman, you attempt to kill the other players off by casting the ""command spell"", which has a 50% chance of all players losing one life. This is the only way to win the game, as killing the players before someone is at the center just results in that player gaining a new character.I recommend getting the Gold Pack, as the expansions make the game that much more fun to play, and the benefit of more character choices makes the strategy more varied."

Lots of fun, the additional playable characters and the expansions really add to the experience as well.  The UI is simple and intuitive, and I have yet to run into a card that is bugged.  The AI is a bit stupid, and will very rarely make a play for the crown.  There is no difficulty slider to make them better.However, if you buy this you should realize you are buying it baiscally for vs. AI play or hotseat play at home.  The online servers are absolutely rubbish.  95% of the time online games will crash at launch.  On the rare 5% occasion an online game actually starts, it will crash or lag out in the first couple turns (if not during character selection!) 95% of /those/ times.Should you actually manage to get off the ground with an online game, odds are good that something unfortunate will happen to someone and that person will ragequit, which invariably crashes the game as well.I say, without exaggerating, that I have actually managed to complete 3 online games out of about 200 attempted.  It baffles me that the game can be so very good and the online technical bits can be so unbearably useless.Conclusion - If you are a longtime talisman fan, and you have real-life friends to play with, hook this up to your tele and get a wireless mouse to pass for a fun evening.  Or, if you don't mind playing against AIs slightly less intelligent than your average cocker spaniel, pick this up.

I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.Other than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.One feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)"

Two games were all it took to decide this is best played as a local match.

Every action must have it's required 10 seconds of pause to allow other players the opportunity to counter or whatever. When everyone in a region must miss a turn, it won't just skip over everyone. It will say each player missed a turn, with its requisite timeout.Playing the game online is also pretty buggy. In about half of the games I've played, the game has either:- frozen and not let a player do anything- randomly booted me from the game and ""helpfully"" replacing the other players with AIs. Once booted, you cannot easily rejoin a game.It's worth noting the game does not pause. If you don't take your turn within the specified timeout, the AI will take over your character. It's really up to you to decide if this is good or not, but it is worth knowing.I'm not recommending this game because it offers little above being more convenient than the physical game, and because the online bugs are frustrating."

I had the boardgame version of Talisman and several of its expansions years ago, and played it a lot. The biggest problem I've encountered with this version is the usability. Spell casting, for example, is kind of dreadful. Several times I have tried to cast spells--even after learning the system of queueing spells--and had them not cast; I have accidentally cast spells when I simply wanted to read the text to see what they do, wasting them; and I have tried casting spells at the times that are indicated in the text, only to find out, nope, that was not the right time to cast it.Important information text from the game is ill placed at the top of the screen in a box that is not prominent and doesn't stand out.There are an awful lot of confirmation clicks as well--too many in some cases. Also, sometimes the confirmation text is not the best. For example, when you're learning the game and you view your followers, the ""Dismiss"" option can leave you wondering, Wait, will that dismiss my follower? Dismiss is a term in gaming that, in my experience, has always been used to get rid of followers. A better term for getting rid of message windows is simply ""Close.""I hope there are improvements to the game design. I find myself more often frustrated than having fun when I play it currently."

It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.The overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.The physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.The game is a ""traditional American"" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.There is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky. The overall UI in fact is a bit wonky, in that it takes 5 clicks to complete every action or view any piece of information.I think I picked this game up while on sale for 99 cents, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it. If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it."

I understand the devs wanted to make sure the game was fast paced when spell casting and that it would not cause people to start guessing when someone wished to cast a spell but the whole mechanic is awful. Here's why:The only way to cast spells as a reaction is to queue them at which point they will automatically go off regardless if the spell is needed or not. For instance if you have a spell that would give you an edge before a combat roll and you've queued it up, it will automatically be cast at the next combat instance you're in which is a terrible mechanic. And as far as I know you can only queue 1 spell so any other spells you have are worthless if you would normally be able to cast them in a situation that would be helpful.My recommendation: Stay away from the digital version and buy the actual boardgame."

,Not Recommended,247000,13662388,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,TiamosLoren,"If you desire a single- or local-player experience with a faithful and loyal recreation of one of the most treasured board games Games Workshop ever created, are interested in digital versions of board games for their ease of accessibility and how versatile they can be when playing with others/with yourself and some AI's, or even if you just want a good time-killer that you can come back to at any time when you wish to resume a game (a feature not currently available for the actual board game, I might add, without manual note-taking!) then I cannot recommend this enough.I expect a lot are asking ""Then why are you not recommending this game?"" It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.Why can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.Having played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.So to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money."

My friends and I have a blast playing (I got a four pack) and I absolutely love the myriad of characters/classes.  Playing on random character choice is fun, though the AI has a thing for picking the Exorcist and excelling at it.  I once played a game where I eventually dispatched his Exorcist, forcing him to choose from 3 new classes, but he pratically gave up on his next choice (lasting a total of 3 turns) and the one after that!  His third set of classes included... yep, you guessed it: another Exorcist.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had snatched up all the Talismans, he might have won, garnering a large amount of strength, but after busting through and snatching a talisman from me, he lost his last two lives in the Vampire's lair.  Positioned strongly with a Marter with a massive amount of strength, I destroyed the Ice Queen and finally finished the game.The computer AI in this game is great, but it seems a little cheap sometimes.  I'd like the ability to tweek the AI (unless I'm missing a portion in the options where you can) and a more stable online multiplayer (I've only had it mess up once for me, but I hear others complaining) but this game was worth every penny, and then some.  I got the Season Pass; all the extra content is great.  I highly recommend this for board game entusiasts or anyone looking for a great game to play, online or against AI.  Don't miss out on getting the season pass, either.

We imidiately spent 9-10 hours into this game. The first game we played just vanila to get to know how the game works. It was quite fun already. After that we added the expansions and the game just got even better! The game can drag on quite a bit due to it's RNG... but it's the fun type of RNG, so that's totally okay!The goal of the game is simple. You must be the first one to reach the middle. In the vanila version, you have the crown of command there, which will do damage to each other character 50% of the times (based on a d6 roll). Characters normaly respawn/get rerolled when they die, but not when someone is in the middle. If one player is left on the board, they win.The game features quite a lot of characters to choose from. They all have their own set of stats, aswell as a set of special abilities of which some are shared, while others are unique. The most fun way to play, though, is that everyone starts with a random character and upon death they get a new, random character! During the game you will encounter many different kinds of events, monsters and items. The more expansions you have, the more random and sometimes deadly the game becomes.I would say, if you aren't sure about buying this one. First buy the vanila version only. Once you know if you'll like it, feel free to buy the rest of the DLC, they're all worth it. Though you do not need the Runestone Deck DLC, you can unlock these ingame as far as I know.Edit: The runestones basicly give you boosts to your character: you can start with more in a stat or you can more easily upgrade your character and so forth. They seem to be designed for those who want a game that'll end more swiftly. Personally I'd suggest to play without these, unless everyone has them and you want your game to end sooner."

Whilst not addressing bug issues first, has resulted in compounding errors/crashes due to adding cards from introduced cards from the expansions that have not been coded properly to new merge abilties for example with older ones.Update 2/12/2014Since the Dungeon Expansion...I recommend this game now on the basis the decks are a lot better, the new board and characters are amazing. A lot of bugs have been fixed (still a few kicking around). House rules implimented including the ""standard character"" rule for true fans who do not wish for the overpriced $2 dlc cards pay to win implimented.Another great feature is now you can add and remove players while in lobby instead of totally rehosting. Not only to mention that players who only have the base game can join any game and still use all the dlc so long as the host has provided them. This paves way for those who really like the game and encourages those not sure to buy the base first and not feel being ripped off so bad.I would recommend buying this, and make sure the dungeon is on!"

First of all it is an alright adaptation of the game and it's as much fun to play as the board game, but there are a few bad points about it. 1) you cant see the board. only a crooked perspective that is far away or a zoom on one single field so it is really annoyingly hard to check out the board and the cards on it. 2) there are a lot of bugs and the game crashes sometimes when you use magic 3) the controls are bad. Often players do stuff they dont want to do because of that. It could be so simple, but they chose to make it complicated. 4) there is no punishment for leaving a game (like 30 min ban or so) so players ALWAYS leave when they draw a bad card, role a 1 or think they lose or have a bad character and so on.

When making choices, you often have to consider the odds of an awful thing happening. Yet, even when the ONLY way something bad can happen is if I roll two 1's in a row, that's what WILL happen... and it doesn't happen infrequently. It happens over and over and over again. I've only EVER been able to get into the middle track once and no matter what character I play, the computer controlled players get nearly all good luck and I get nearly all bad luck. Frankly, it doesn't even feel like luck. It feels like the computer is actively controlling the dice rolls so it can hose me. For example, the dice rolls are always causing me to lose everything, yet I've never seen a computer controlled player lose their belongings. Immediately after losing everything, one of the computer controlled players WILL roll exactly what they need to land on that square and collect everything I lost.While the boardgame is recreated decently, with a colorful board and characters, the result is stagnant, lifeless, and uninspired. There is a lot that could have been done to graphically enhance the game for a computer via animated cards and board and combat, but the developers chose not to do anything but reproduce the board and the cards exactly as they would appear when playing around a table.  Why they didn't enhance the computer version with effects and animation is a mystery. It's like the developers had no imagination. Since it is so exacting the better choice is to buy the boardgame. The only thing the 'Digital Edition"" offers that is different from the original is the ability to play Talisman with people who aren't in the same room.The user interface is simply horrible. Every moment of every turn is stretched out into a laborious sequence of moving and clicking. The game control elements are spread out all over the screen, so you have to move the mouse from one end of the screen to the other whenever an option is presented, rather than keeping the interface elements near one another so they are easy to use.Others have reported a plethora of bugs. I can't say I've really encountered any, but then I've never actually played much beyond the beginning of any game. My 'luck' is SO bad that I can barely get started before I'm so far behind that catching up is impossible. It isn't much fun to continue playing when losing is a foregone conclusion, so I end up quitting to play something that is actually entertaining."

It's a great game for getting your friends together for an old-school dice-rollin', card drawing good time, and there -is- some strategy involved or you're going to get quickly left in the dust. This still needs to be polished (the AI especially, is -real- dumb) and as of this writing the multiplayer is buggy as hell, dropping people and lagging out. However I'm willing to keep playing, I have faith in this game based on what I've seen and over time I'm sure the bugs will be squished and this will turn out to be a VERY enjoyable game with friends."

Not only is it always more fun to play with people you know, but it avoids the problem of players disconnecting (a group of friends will rarely abandon the game they start, whereas the opposite cannot be said).Cons:1. After the first 30 minutes approximately, I always get bored. Every single time. I just feel like quitting and going and doing something else. Exception is where my real-life friends are in the game.2. Rolling one die each turn for movement can be very annoying.  Often you are very eager to land on a particular square, and you need to go through a painful, painful, grind to roll the number you need.

All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential.Although there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times.Another thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise!Expansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!Pros:-Lots of fun with friends-Wide variety of heros-Playable on a toaster-Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn)-Unpredictable-Amazing when you have access to expansions-You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!Cons:-Very luck driven-Games are super long-Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions-AI can be really dumb"

It feels unique and like a 1980s fantasy story/movie as a Roguelike board game.  My Steam recommendation comes with a big HOWEVER:  Ahem.  However, there are two main sets of deterrents from this digitized Talisman game, mechanical and technical.Note that this was my first time EVER playing Talisman in any form!Mechanics-wise, the digital version seems to be an accurate port of the tabletop game. This means, for good and for ill, whatever the tabletop game is, the digital game is too. I enjoyed the ability for each person to have a personal adventure on the same game board while competing for resources and, ultimately, victory. I liked how it was, effectively, a board game version of Dokapon Kingdom (Wii), similar to the card game Munchkin for its randomness and occasional hilarity, and that it was a board game Rogue-lite. Also, props for having a cadre of possible followers, and spells that were rare and powerful!What did I dislike about the mechanics? There is simply TOO MUCH ROLLING! Want to move somewhere? You must roll and get the exact number you need to proceed! Rolling at locations (board spaces), such as to determine whether at a bar you gain or lose money while gambling, or if you start a bar fight, is more sensical and generally should be kept. Rolling was much less of an issue early game and for me as a newbie since I didn't know what I was doing and was not a stickler on trying to win my first game - at least at this phase. I understood ""Be an Assassin, go around killing stuff, level up, and try to win,"" and I wound up close to winning.A simple fix would be to allow movement of any number of spaces no more than the rolled number. Did you roll a 3? You can move 1, 2, or 3 spaces instead of just 3.A second major issue is the need to farm.  Yes, you need to farm in a tabletop game originally released in the 1980s - before the release of video games like Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior that made farming in RPGs popular.  Why?  Because you simply -need- higher stats, more money, and more treasure to survive random encounters and other players in this game!  As a warning to Talisman newbies:  You may reach the center area of the board (and achieving this feels quite random), but you NEED a Talisman to complete the game (found at the top left of the inner rectangle) AND enough Strength or Craft to get through the Mines or Crypt respectively.  This means boosting these stats via fights (randomly generated) or finding the right items to boost your stats (randomly placed).Perhaps it was because we used the Grim Reaper expansion, but the victory condition of, ""All other players must be dead for you to win, even if you're at the Crown of Command,"" made the game take -entirely- too long! Since even dying once is effectively enough to eliminate one person forever, saying, ""Death is permanent,"" would have been enough to expedite the game tremendously! (Currently, a dead player character respawns on at the start of his next turn at his starting space with no gear, no level up bonuses, no followers, and possibly no spells. If this happens at the late game, this dead PC may as well be out of the game.)  My workaround?  A player at the Crown of Command needs to remain in this space for 3 consecutive turns.  If another player reaches the Crown of Command, this timer resets.  This way, the game does not take 60+ minutes to declare a victor with someone already at the Crown of Command, but allows people to get close and perhaps win.We had some technical problems, too. The game, in general, worked. However, one of our players was repeatedly removed from the game due to connection problems, and we had to restart Talisman about 4 times within 20 minutes to get the game running with all of us again. (To do so, the host should go to Online Game >> Private Game while the others should go to Online Game >> Resume Game once the game is up. This will resume a game from the last auto-saved spot.)In addition, the UI is confusing to new players. In the tabletop version of this game, playing a spell card is as easy as declaring you're playing it, then playing it. In the digital version, each player needs to queue spells to go off at the right time. (I accidentally cast Sleep on myself because I assumed it would go off on the next person's turn.) I also felt unsure of what things did until I did them - like gaining followers or fighting things or trying to use the Portal. Sometimes, this was no big deal (like fighting), but sometimes (like using the Portal), I wish I would have known and understood the important bits before I went through with my actions.Is Talisman worth playing?  That depends.  I liked it because I also liked Munchkin and Dokapon Kingdom and feel they capture the essence of this game better.  Munchkin bypasses the board entirely and go straight for the random danger/delight/treasure in a similar fashion to Talisman, with less die rolling. (As an aside, there is a Munchkin Quest board game which I've not played.)  Dokapon Kingdom's interface is generally better than Talisman's, but it suffers from ""too long to play this game casually in a group setting"" syndrome.  Dokapon can be enjoyed in short bursts among friends, but is not at all meant to be completed in a single sitting.  (According to GameFAQs, Dokapon Kingdom's full game length, from start to finish, is around 60 hours!)  Talisman seemingly -is- meant to be completed in a single session, but around 4 hours for a digital version of a board game made me want to add the aforementioned house rules just to change that to 30-60 minutes.  If you can deal with the tremendous randomness, and have supportive friends who enjoy playing Talisman with you, Talisman is a worthwhile game.Talisman, in its current form, is somewhere between a tabletop board game and a tabletop RPG.  It's more complicated than Monopoly, but less complicated than D&D 3.5.  A full game of Talimsan (an estimated 3.5 to 5.5 hours) is around the estimated session time of a tabletop RPG, like D&D.Talisman is something to experience once or on occasion, but it requires a dedicated group to enjoy it perpetually.IN SUMMARY:+Competitive fantasy RPG-lite and Rogue-lite adventuring.+Fun to play, unique in its design, and created and maintained as a passion project.+Assassin, Ghoul, and Dark Cultist classes are likely to get you a win.+Less setup and hassle than many tabletop RPG campaigns.-Way too long.-Way too random.-Way too confusing without someone first telling you a lot of the game (how to win, what classes to play, what stats do, the good and bad options)."

My only real complaint is that the AI seemed like it was cheating since it would regularily get the rolls it needed to win some unlikely battles or land on a coveted card. I found myself using an exploit to get around the questionable rolls but recently it was updated and the exploit no longer works. The new update seems to generate a dice table the same way many other digital dice games do. I got the season pass for this one also and have been loving all the DLC. The Dungeon is pretty cool.

You are playing against the game as much as you are your opponents.  While this game does not lack meaningful decision making, there is a heafty dose of RNG as well."

There are always people playing it (at least in Europe), the community is nice, even if there is a problem the devs help- not many games out there you can say something like that about. Yes, the expansions are pretty expensive, and the game itself is 4.5 ed (which is a shame, since the series became so stripped and partitioned compared to the 1st edition), but it hasn't lost it's magic in any way.10/10 would become a toad again."

I don't know if you can still buy them, but back then you could get, like, a dozen expansions that came with additional game boards like a dungeon and one that allowed you to travel through space. My brother and I liked playing the expansions more than the vanilla game because every expansion added these wicked overpowered new characters and objects and instead of the usual gameplay strat of ""just travel around the outer region for a half an hour to level up before going towards the middle"" it became ""bum rush the space lanes to get the laser rifle and the anti-grav belt and spend the next fifteen minutes griefing the other players until they get mad and give up"".Dad says: If you like this kind of nerd♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's a pretty good buy at $5, but bear in mind that the vanilla game will get old after a couple of hours once you're familliar with all the cards and/or you don't have actual people to play with on mumble. You'll be wanting to get some of the expansions if you enjoy it and those will cost like $5 each, but they should mix up the game enough that you'll find lots of added enjoyment.

I mean, ""questing"" with my friends.We'd all be sitting on the carpet in the living room, game pieces scattered thither, huddled around the game board as if we were spying into one our dads' Playboy magazines trying not to get caught. Tensions ran high as we traversed the outer ring of the board (or Outer Earth as we called it) in search of glorious adventure and immense wealth.Eventually, one friend would amusingly decide to try to kill off another; starting a great fued betwixt families, and a furious battle would ensue. With every roll of the dice, the once trusting and playful comrades, would try to land on each others spaces to chip off yet another foe's life. All in the hopes of being the last warrior standing... until of coarse... the final blow was struck... the fallen combatant, silent in his shame, with head hung low, would sit and let the anger of defeat fester like a boil. As the heckling and laughter of his friends grew louder, ringing in his ears, becoming too much to bear, the conquered warrior would growl in rage! Leaping up from the game and running away like the wind. Totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ He'd jump upon his iron steed, and peddle off into the night, cursing us.

It's an all-time classic board game.Only downside is they charge about the same amount for the DLC as they do for the real game's expansions, so if you actually can get a good regular gaming group together, getting the actual game is probably a much better course of action for you.Note: as of this writing, the DLC list has shrunk down to three, so the above comment may no longer be valid, but during the Early Access, you could see listed all the expansions for the physical game at the same price.

Talisman: Digital Edition is a fairly honest representation of the board game, so the fact that it is digital and online really opens up opportunities for multiplayer, and guarantees you'll never lose the game to something ridiculous like a water leak in your home.That being said, there's major UX issues that hinder and confuse gameplay, some rules don't seem to work 100% correctly, and obviously there's no room to play home-made classes that are agreed upon by the other players. Additionally there's a huge lack of explanation with some things, like what the Reaper actually does - all we get is the box description from the physical product and zero readout on the rules. Some things entirely lack labels and direction, like the instructor lets you choose Strength (with no label) then Craft (with no label) so it is really easy to get Strength when you meant Craft or be confused by the whole unlabeled situation.I'd love to give the team feedback on sticking points and things that needs adjustment, but I want to hear from them first before doing so.

I have bought this and the majority of its expansions for myself and my friends in order to continue to play this with them. unfortunately you can purchase tabletop simulator for cheaper and download talisman off of the steam workshop for free and that is all expansions. but today the reason i am typing a bad review is simply that the AI is broken and does not operate normally. if you do not win within 30 rounds your chances of winning are null. ecample; i was playing an ogre chieftein and achived the crown of command but the last AI a wizard had the warlock quest reward prolific pockets (if his gold count is zero he gains 1 gold) and he has the physician follower (pay 1 gold to heal 1 life) it is now impossible to win the game and wastes about 2 hours of gametime because the wizard AI has no desire to win or lose which means i cannot complete the game. this is about the most frustrating thing i have ever encountered in the game but so far this games single player playability is horrible. and its easier to play talisman on tabletop simulator. the only reason you should purchase this game is for achievements and they will be difficult with a broken AI. until they patch their AI this game is a no go. to conclude, I love this game i have the 2nd edition version IRL as well as the 4th edition IRL ive spent hundreds of dollars on this game and i love the models and designs. but the digital edition is a waste of time."

I've started well over ten games now and have not been able to finish one - every game has crashed! The game always crashes, and this really should have been sorted out before releasing the game.  Quite frankly, steam should refund all purchases as the game is completely unplayable and unfit for purpose (if it were any other product it would be breaching trading laws).  How the company can contine to sell expansion packs is beyond me - the original game needs massive improvement first.

For those of us who lived in that time, before Germany came along and showed the world how great board games can be, this is a well realized throwback nostalgia title.That's not to say Talisman is a great board game. It's really not. It's exceptionally RNG heavy and can be frustrating at times. But, it's also pretty fun. Particularly when playing with a group of friends over Skype, Mumble, etc. The game itself is very easy to learn. Roll a die. Move. Do what's on the board. Try to improve your character enough to get to the center, defeat the challenge, and win the game.The software implementation of Talisman by Nomad is pretty good. The animations and sounds are good, the graphics are pretty, and it plays the way you would expect. We've only run into a few bugs, one game-breaking, over a bunch of sessions. One of the really nice things Nomad did was allow the host's version of Talisman to be played. I have the full season pack, and a bunch of my friends have the core game only. I host, and we can play with all of the expansions.There are 3 expansions out so far. The best one at the moment is The Dungeon, which adds a large board segment to one of the corners. I'm very much looking forward to when all of the expansions are out and you can play a big mega game.Game time can run a bit long. While this is faster than the tabletop version, budget about one hour per player per game.I recommend, but this definitely isn't for everyone. I sunk about 100 hours into Talisman Prologue (which was their single-player ""Beta"" version of this and about a dozen hours so far for the full release. This is a fun one to pull out once in a while with friends, like any good board game."

Whilst I have many fond memories of Talisman from my childhood, this is a terrible implementation of a game that has long past exceeded its best-by date.Talisman itself is sadly lacking in the current era of boardgames, with little to no strategy or choice left to the player. It is dictated far more by the random roll of the die, than any particular desire of the player. Even Monopoly provides more strategy, and choice of action. This is a faithful implementation of the original, for what little that is worth.The main issue is the interface, which is an abomination. Trying to play with friends rapidly becomes an excercise in extreme frustration, wherein you battle the shoddy controls - instead of battling your friends. Laggy, unresponsive and unintuitive are the nicest words I have to say about it. I wish I could refund it, and I feel terrible for gifting it to several of my friends who now all have a much poorer opinion of me.If you have any fondness for Talisman, any decent memories of the game - leave them as that, memories.

I would go into more details but I suspect that most people looking at the game are less familiar with the original than I am.On top of that there is two other very big issues that make it worse still, it's clearly been written by a pay to play money farming developer, it has a huge amount of very expensive DLC content, expensive compared to the main game, and it also has a UI that appeared to be designed to make actually playing the game as slow as possible.  The interface requires you to click about 2-3 times as many times as a well designed interface would do and in pointlessly specific areas.

The programmers haven't solved that problem well at all. Computer opponents don't have much strategy besides accumulating stats and items. They perform like mediocre bots in the single-player training missions of an online FPS. A human player would wipe the table with them every time, except the AI appears to get a boost via favorable die rolls and card draws, likely to disguise its lack of real strategy. The first few games this doesn't matter much, but after dozens of games it sucks the enjoyment out of it.If you have 3 friends willing to play the game with you, I'd buy this game in a heartbeat.

That being said, this game really walks the line between whether or not to give it a positive or a negative review overall.The design flaws of the Talisman game really manifest itself when you play with a rigid, impassionate interpreter of the game.   This doesn't seem like a bad thing, but Talisman has evolved over the years with very little consistency: there's a huge variety of nuances in the language used.  Phrases such as ""...at any time..."" implies a different expectation than what is actually practiced in the game.The honest truth is, people zone out when they play Talisman.  You miss a few turns in jail, or wait for four other players to battle dragons, abuse spells, and ponder over quests; just so you can roll a 3 and scoop up a bag of gold.  There's a whole layer missing from the electronic version of the game that you get when you are playing on the tabletop with your friends that really is the only thing that makes Talisman an acceptable use of an afterrnoon.The game would also benefit from an ability to remove specific cards from out of the deck; because there are some really grossly imbalanced combinations as well as cards you just get sick of seeing- like the one that takes all the face up city cards and put them on top of the adventure deck.  The electronic version of the game also takes longer to play, as every step of the game is iterated out individually.  The dice roller seems very suspect as well.  I've had back to back snake eyes when dicing with death as well as +3 Craft from the Reaper in three stops.The game does give you something to do while your waiting in a que or auto-running to your next mission, but it's hard to recommend solely on the experience it offers.  To be honest, considering how horribly overpriced the Fantasy Flight version of the game is, I would still recommend this version of the game over the table top version.

I hate that it's negative, but I am way too ticked off at this game NOT to give it a negative review. Second, this game makes me wish I had bought it AFTER the Stean refund policy change. I would refund this pile in a heartbeat. Now let me get into the things I hated about the game. Also, for the most part, you are not going to read anything here that are not in the other reviews. If you like the board game, you might like this if you don't crash. If not my gripes are similair to othersSo, I bought this game a few months ago, but never got around to playing it. I left Neverwinter Nights, and get a pop-up saying if I buy a character for Talisman the profits with go to charity. Great! I love to help charity. And it is a shaman. Shamans and Druids are some of my favorite characters. So load up the game, and search the main page for a tutorial. There's none, which is troubling, but I figure, 'hey, it's probably a tutorial as you play kind of game'. Which it is. Problem is you ghave to choose your character with stats that you have NO CLUE what they do. So I do what I always do in a fantasy game where I'm not sure about the mechanics. I pick the Warrior, because it is almost aways the easiest class. I also make sure there is only one  opponent, because i wanted the make the game as easy as possiblee.Then I get into the game. My first turn I roll, get a 6 move to the temple. My whole strategy tois to get the two weapons that the fighter can have, then play from there. I roll again, then have to fight an ape. I lose. No prob. It's the beginning of the game, and I can't expect to win every dice roll. Now I don't remember all my opponents turns, (partly because he was taking turns when I was reading text) but basically he didn't have ONE bad thing happen on any of his turns. So, I take my thirds turn and fight a creature with craft, and lose again. Next turn, roll again, got a dragon, lost again. Now mind you, you don't get a choice on whether to fight or not. Some classes give some choice in some situations, but mostly, roll and get blssed or f-d. So, I'm down 3 lives, and have some event where I lose ANOTHER LIFE! My opponent. Again, my opponent has lost no life, and hasn't even had to fight. I am a WARRIOR and I have won no fights. I just want a weapon. So I spend my one gold to get back 1 hp because I am at one HP. THEN I get the second gold that would have allowed me to get a weapon.  Then I roll a demon which I would have to roll a 6 to tie. So back to 1 hp. At this point I say F this game. So I want to see what happens when you die, so I attack the creature with craft (magic) because he should have an advantage. And THEN I win. *Faceplam*Anyway I was done within 5 minutes of that. My opponent was already in the second ring. This game is JUST RANDOM LUCK. I own 600 on Steam, (though I've prob only played a little over 500 of them) and this will likely wind up on the bottom 50 of them."

I only played a couple hours and it literally consisted of clicking dice roll, and then moving that many spaces. This is just not a game that works well without friends present.Additionally  the layout of the game is just plain confusing. There were so many times I was trying to click on cards to read them, then accidentally moved there, or did something else. The interface is not intuitive at all."

SOMETIMES, you can resume game (which is a cool feature) but othertimes it just will not work. It gets really funky. Now, to me, there is nothing worse than spending 2.5 hours on a game with 3 other people and right as it's getting good the multiplayer takes a dump all over and we can't finish the game. The support is also non-existant (thanks Nomad) so don't believe this will change any time soon, but if enough people are buying and playing maybe that will change (I highly doubt it. Wishful thinking maybe). TL;DR: Solo play is worth it at sale price, but mulitplayer is a big risk although it is insanely fun."

Talisman is a massive game in its ""analog form"" and with all of the expansions and four players, the setup is considerable and games can be marathons. But that's all good as boardgamers expect that. That said, Talisman Digital Edition fots nicely on my PC, requires mere minutes at most of setup an most importantly, captures the sheer fun of Talisman, Isn't that why we play games, for fun?A few negative reviews commented on the woeful AI. But, perhaps these folk are playing the prelude titled Talisman: Prologue. I have found the AI to be pretty good. And let's not forget that Talisman is largely a luck based game. All of the so-called tactics I have seen and heard about the game must still bow to the capriciousness of the deity known as RNG; even an AI like Deep Blue cannot predict the vagaries of dice rolls.There are a few issues that linger. One of the most annoying is when an AI opponent draws an event card. Unless you are a speed reader or you know every Talisman card by rote - and with all of the expansions in the physical boardgame there is an insane number of cards, you won't have time to read what the event is. You have to zoom in on the board section where the event is. The same holds true for other non-spell cards. This has been brought up to the devs but as yet there has been no fix for this.The digital version allows you to earn runes which grant advatages in gameplay. [AI also collects these as well]. I like the mechanic as it lends a sort of leveling up feeling.The Dungeon Expansion is next up and I cannot wait for its release! If it is as faithful as the physical version of the game, it's going to be a blast.I think that Talisman Digital Edition is a wonderful introduction to the fun world of tabletop boardgaming and it scratches the itch of tabletop boardgamers who want to play without the crazy setup and rather forced solo variants for the physical game found round the interwebz.This is a STEAL at the price and I would advise buyers to spend a little extra dosh and get The Reaper and Frostmarch expansions as they add considerably to the game.I hope that more boardgames experience a digital conversion. Are you listening Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight?EDIT: 18 November. The Dungeon expansion really ramps this game up considerably. The AI can be quite nasty and that's good as Talisman is a cut throat game.I am hopeful that the devs will release Blood Moon and The Dragon next. These two expansions literally change the game, adding a bit more unpredictability to a game that can punch you in the face already and have you smiling about it.UPDATE January 15: Ya gota love this developer. With the latest update there are two new free characters. These two are not even present in the physical boardgame but were last seen in the 1986(!) version of Talisman. More achievements plus what seems to be a hint that the Highland expansion is next! This is very cool as it is a one of the big corner expansions!!"

A real life Talisman game can usually take up 6hrs. With the turn speed for the PC ramped up to 10 I finished my first game in 3hrs.  This is not a problem as playing well in games causes you to level up unlocking new stuff. Quite what I'm not yet sure as it will take more than one game to level up. The other major difference is price. A full set of Talisman with the expnasion will srt you back nearly £100 for the physical version.I do love my physichal set and this does lack the atmosphere of having some like minded mates round for a good boardgames session. But as an introduction to the game or as a way of killing the hours over the summer while your mates are on holiday this is highly recomended. Also if you have friends who play but dont live locally it is also possible to set up an online game over the web.

This game brings all that fun back, but with the option to save and quit when the sun starts peeking through the windows and you need to hide away for a few hours.However, it does feel like there are still some bugs to work out, such as abilities that can be activated 'at will' don't seem to be available to use when the 'at will' need arises. This may be a bug or I am missing the prompts to give me that opportunity. The only other downside I can see is you are not physically sitting at the table with your friends as you play to toss around the smack talk and make deals on the fly to take a problematic character down.All in all, this is a fantastically fun game to play and all of the expansions are more than worth it for the added content and additional characters.

The digital implementation of the game features an intuitive interface, crisp artwork, and balance improvements that don’t allow a Chaos Warrior to run rampant across your game board and on top of competing players.  The only real downside is that the AI is not very good and doesn’t try to win the game –however the game plays well in multiplayer and is really a blast.  If you want to play an old school early 1990’s board game online, love games workshop, or just want to turn your buddies into a toad and curb stomp them . . . this game is for you!"

We can save our game if interrupted for dinner or if it gets too late and continue at another time, which is a bonus compared to the board game.I recommend it to any fans of the board game, you will feel right at home.

,Recommended,247000,13658667,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Winter Wolf,"The Pros:The game is pretty. The art is pretty much as I remember the board game. The UI while unintuitive does cover most things. Winning can be fun.The Cons:Losing can be really boring. Being stuck on the command crown for endless turns whilst your one remaining opponent wanders the outer regions merely healing when you get the command spell to hit (every 1 in 5 times, and I started that end game approach with 8 fate) is not my idea of going out in a blaze of glory. The AI makes no attempt to get near you once you are down to two players.There are many moments of frustration in the game. Many of them aren't particularly meaningful except as an ""I gotchya"" tweak that the game pulls on you. (Being unable to control when some spells go off, having situations where you are forced to target yourself with abilities or spells because the UI doesn't allow you to back up, losing all your items/gold/followers to bad encounters, rarely ever burning a fate point that actually helps, the list is probably endless.) That said if you are a fan of random, I think this game really hits that spot.Whilst Catan (the online version) is kind of sad for not having multi player options, Talisman does have this.I can't say I think much of the pay to play nickle & dime approach (and what big dimes they are!) but it is nice that you can customize what you get in terms of characters/boards. I haven't done that but I expect those who want to enjoy multi player will eventually get the relevent characters.One thing seems a bit inobvious but is probably true anyway: You are able to win with any of the characters. The key being that you spend the time to learn how that character survives and adapts appropriately. Some might have a steep curve.I am recommending this game with a 6/10. Meaning: ""caveat emptor"" if you have problems with random games. It is fun once you set aside the disappointments and frustrations."

It fixes a lot of issues that were present in 2nd. Starting characters with high craft are no longer at such a steep disadvantage to those of high strength. The inclusion of the fate mechanic can help ever so much with catastrophic dice rolls and, for myself, makes being evil desirable.Digital edition is based off 4th Edition rules and faithfully done so. This game is, as of writing this, still a work in progress, so there are bugs to work out. However, the development team is continuously releasing patches to fix problems and content updates, to include new expansions and characters for those who have bought them.For those who enjoy Talisman, I recommend getting the season pass, which unlocks all content for T:DE in perpetuity.

I wish it was a little more graphically enhanced, like little spell effects or something, to add some flare to the game, but it stays true to what it's like watching a game play out set up on your table, so can't really complain.  With the option of expansions to add to the experience, it really does cover its bases nicely.There are only two negatives I can think of.  1, as with many games where you roll a die, at times it can feel like the computer cheats.  Or rather, I just now played a game, where any space I landed on that could have turned me into a toad for rolling a 1 on, I rolled a one.  Every.  Single. Time.  I feel like 1 is a very common number rolled, and I'm not sure why, but I get that gut feeling that something isn't balanced.  You get to moments where the game poops on you repeatedly, over and over, and just runs you through the mud.  I'd say it's just coincidence, but all too frequently it happens.The second negative is that there is no option to speed up gameplay and just auto-resolve a winner.  Why is this a problem?  Because I was playing a 4 player game - me vs 3 other AI players.  I died first when one character got to the Crown of Command.  Problem?  The game will not end until all other players are dead too.  Well, it's been an hour and a half and I'm still waiting for one AI to die.  One repeatedly rolls to use the crown and rolls twos about...three times out of 6 rolls.  The other AI player is repeatedly healing himself.  What does this cause?  A NEVER ENDING GAME.  I can't quit, or else I lose the progress of playing this entire game (maybe I can?  I don't know, but I'm not about to quit to find out I do...), but now I have no choice other than to wait for this game to play out, even if it takes more hours.  This.  Is.  Maddening.  Completely broken. >_<  Once you die, it should end the game and tell you who won....not make you sit and watch for hours and hours while a computer plays against itself....."

Like boardgames? Then you'll like this. Like the original Talisman boardgame? Then you'll like this. I've played the boardgame several times, and quite enjoy this as it takes out all the hassle of setting the game up. Granted playing the boardgame is still lots of fun.There are the odd bugs but the developers are still active, killing the bugs and adding new things to the game (I haven't played in a while and was greeted with a updated UI during the game which I felt improved it!) Also newly added to the game the ability to play with 6 players, AI, local or online.There's hours of fun to have with th ebase game without the DLC, the DLC adds more depth and variation to the game but isn't needed; unless it's been changed if an online game is played only the host needs to have purchased the DLC meaning if you're lucky you'll get a preview of DLC too."

It's convenient if you just want to relax, play a quick single player game and move onto to other things you need to do that afternoon.  There's plemty of expansions and alot of characters to choose from that keeps it interesting.On the downside, however, the game does have its flaws.    Spells not working when casted/que'd. Picking targets for spells sometimes doesn't work properly or is confusing.     Some cards don't work occasionally like, ""Use this card before another players turn"" where you'll try to use it but nothing happens and you just get a ""dismiss"" option only.   And my personal complaint is the computer player almost always rolls a ""6""  and you'll get ten ""1's"" in a row which can be frustrating.Overall, it's still a fun game to play if you look past the flaws.   Catch it on sale.   Highly recommend getting the expansions (Dungeon, Highlands, etc) for it as well as it adds another level to the game."

I haven't even read the instructions but after playing with others online, I am learning pretty quickly how to play this game.  It's a fun fantasy/strategy board game.  It isn't too complex and it's kind of luck-based. There is a low player-base, but I am always able to find a match without waiting too long.  The servers that people seem to play on are USA and Europe.  Another cool thing about this game is that other people can share their characters with you.  By this I mean that if you don't have the DLC, and the HOST of the game does, then the host of the game is able to share their characters with you and the other players in the game.  Also, if you have a bad internet connection and disconnect from the game, you are able to rejoin the match once you re-open the game. I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale for only $4.49 and it was well worth it.  You should definitely buy this if you are into board games."

There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG.The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO!Since I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in.So the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.This is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?!Still love the game!!"

Without the expansion content enabled, it's a much more straightforward and less interesting experience.  The UI could also benefit from some adjustments, as it's sometimes difficult to click spells before the game moves past the point where they're legal to play, and at times you're forced to make a decision without the ability to click around to examine details of the game state... issues which can both be largely mitigated by familiarity and careful attentiveness, but which will hopefully be remedied in the future.All of this together makes for a game that's a lot of fun with a bit of investment, but which does not make a good first impression.

I would reccommend this game to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends, but if youre looking for good gameplay on your own... unless you really just want some nostalgia This game isn't for you.Pros---------------Good time waster with friends-nostalgic for you long time Talisman players-interesting interactions-you can laugh at the horrible AICons---------------Horribly buggy at times... many of which are game breaking (for example followers or spells that let you choose what your reroll will be will often reroll your second dice if you have 2 to choose from, or if you visit a shop and dont have enough money for an item the game just doesnt know what to do and breaks)-purely based on RNG very few times is decision making or skill going to win you the game because 90% of this game is pure luck unless you get some crazy powerful items from some of the expansions (cough cough clockwork owl) or if you get characters that can see the top of the deck like sage or spy.-kinda already stated as a pro but the AI is horrible, some might see that as a good thing because they can give you good items for bad ones or engage in battles they clearly cant win or dont use some items because they forget to... but otherwise its kinda stupid-DLC for the game can be pretty pricey, if you buy the game and all expansions (not including the standalone characters) currently available it will go for roughly $45 or you can make it $75 and buy the season pass which includes all current and future DLC except one that was sold for charity.TL;DR: The game is great to hang out with friends especially if you cant get together im person easily (or at all) But if you want everything its gonna be quite the money drop, the game is also horribly buggy and seems to lack some quality of life features like cancel buttons for most actions (shopping or spell casting for example) but if you can get past the bugs and horrible AI, then its a good time with your friends guarenteed!"

,Recommended,247000,29405845,Posted: 21 January,all,DreadApostle,"Nice game if you like games like snakes and ladders but with warrior and wizzard pieces instead of generic pawn pieces. There is very little to no strategy in this game, it is almost ENTIRELY down to dice rolls. You roll a dice and move here, roll another dice to see what happens, pick up an 'adventure' card which could be an item or enemy, then roll another dice to determine the outcome. It is about as 'strategic' as playing roulette or lottery. I'm not having a go at this game, it is an amusing way to pass time, but if you read that there is a strategy to winning this game it is not entirely correct.. unless by strategy you mean staying in one region of the board until you have enough items to progress to the next then so be it. I guess to some extent that would be considered a strategy. I have played this game for a couple of hours and it was amusing, but it was amusing in the way that snakes and ladders would be if you had beautifully crafted pieces available instead of generic pawn pieces and instead of there being only snakes there were dragons and goblins you had to deal with and instead of automatically sliding backwards down a snake you got to take a dice roll which can be modified by items you pick up to detemine what happens to you. I definately dont see myself investing a lot of time into this game but it is worth the investment if you are looking for an amusing 'filler in type of a game' that can easily pass an hour or so of your time when nothing else seems to tickle your fancy."

Now it came to Steam and on a sale I took my chances.Pros:+ Great art & figures just like the boardgame.+ Long game time (depends how you look at it)+ Various characters to choose from, each with their own special skill(s)+ Some interessing items, followers & spells to get or sites to visitCons:- To much depends on the lucky dice rolls- Because of the dice rolls, the game can drag on and on, even if you have the Staff of Command- Long game time (depends how you look at it)- Imbalances on character front. A thief has 100% chance to Steal from you, even if you are the most powerful character on the board. It would be more interessing and more fair that the victim is able to save and hurt the thief when caught. Same for a sorceress with Beguile.- Did I already say it depends to much on the lucky dice rolls?Personally, I enjoyed it first but later on the myriad of (un)lucky dice rolls, character imbalances & to long game times diminished my enjoyment rapidly. I would rather spend my time on other games where I have much more controle at the games progress - and I have to blame my own stupidity - than on the sheer luck of a dice roll.If they do some tweaking to give your chosen character a fairer chance/saving roll against some odds, I might take another look at it and change my mind about it . . ."

The UI bugs break the rules of the game.Lots of games have a few bugs here and there.  And there are some bugs that are only slightly annoying - or make you have to perform workarounds - but after just 2 days I'm encountering bugs in *THIS* game that actually cause the game to cheat the player out of their win.  Not in the usual sense, but in the sense that the user interface breaks and fails to let you take the actions the rules say you're supposed to be able to take.For 2 whole months there was a longstanding bug that if any AI player tries to cast the Weakness spell, the UI freezes and gets caught in a loop unable to continue the game so you have to start a new game.  And if you have the Weakness spell in the deck, and are playing against 3 AI players, then the chance of this happening at some point during the game is actually pretty high.  They had this problem reported for over 2 months and didn't fix it until just yesterday.So now I try again.  And run into another rules-cheating bug that stole my shot at winning the game away.  The HERMIT (the guy who gives a talisman to the first player to land on him) appeared in the Plain of Peril.  I open the Portal of Power, which puts me on the Plain of Peril where I'm planning to interact with the Hermit and get that talisman (a necessary item to be allowed to win the game), and the user interface doesn't have a provision for how to let you interact with cards on that space - it doesn't let you.  So the hermit is effectively a dead card when it appears there, which is definitely not how it's supposed to work.  By this point in the game other means of getting talismans were too far away and I wasn't going to be able to get one in time before another AI player would win.  Had I known the game was lying when it said the HERMIT would give a talisman to the first player who landed there, I might have tried a different tactic.  As it was, in this game it was too late.The game was basicaly too buggy and not ready for release yet."

It's my favorite hobby when I can gather friends. Most of my income comes from tabletop games as well. Still, this is by far the most broken, dumb, and luck-dependent game I've ever played, not to mention it has player elimination in the late game, which might stretch for hours and hours and hours.I had heard about Talisman before, but never got the chance to play it. I ended up getting it on Steam recently to play it later. Also, after reading good reviews and trying the solo mode (the other app), I thought: ""It looks dense, but nice after you get used to it"". I even decided to get the Season Pass during last summer sales--oh, how I regret...Indeed Talisman gets slightly better overtime, after you get used to it. But in the end, it's a bad game, made worse in every aspect I could find. I ended up playing one match with a friend plus 2 AI's. One of them (Martyr) started off nicely, them the other AI (Assassin) and I (Sorceress) started catching up, until the Assassin made it to the end, trying to kill us off. Martyr was really close, but she got really, really bad rolls, despite she had built up pretty well, and she was the first to be elimnated, despite having dominated the entire game. My friend was next. Then, I spent DOZENS of turns surviving the Assassins attacks, not being able to reach him in any way. I couldn't get in because there were no amulets available, and I couldn't drop my quest (to get another one), which was to hurt another character, in order to maybe get a Talisman, because the only character in the game was out of reach. So I quit the game with 6 life, because I was tired of just surviving, not being able to do anything against it.The only pro in this game was getting a friend to laugh at it together, because Talisman is just ridiculous with all the luck-fest (and those who deny it have either been away from better, modern, and more balanced board games, or are just blind fans.... or both). The cons: too much luck (you roll dice for EVERYTHING), INSANELY slow, even with AI on top speed, broken mechanics, very unbalanced, takes way too long (almost 2 hours had gone by when it felt like the game was finally starting)... Not to mention broken achievements on top of that.To sum it all up, stay as far away from it as possible! Go buy an actual board game to play with friends. Or pick ANY OTHER board or card game on Steam, because you have a very, VERY high chance (I'd almost bet on 100%) of getting something better."

It can be really annoying when you think your in a winning position with a spell you've got and you cast it and it either doesn;t work as intended or doesn't work at all. Or what as happened to me several times it crashes the game!!! very annoying when your typical game lasts a few hours and can be ruined at anytime. You find yourself not wanting to use spells and items, which goes against everything that is enjoyable about the board game. Its a shame i think the game developers should concentrate more on getting everything working right than releasing new expansions that just add to the frustration."

I don't mind it myself because it can be really enjoyable to play with your friends and in my opinion that's what's most important about these type of games.But when you're making a video game adaptation of a board game, you have to somehow compensate for the lack of physical interaction between the players and the social part of it - by making the game experience much smoother, faster, more manageable (simplifying the things that the players have to do mechanically - taking away all of the mess with tokens and cards etc.) and approachable.And this is the standard that I expect from every board game adaptation like this - this is something that is pretty much must be if there's any point in hoping that one would play it longer than 2 game sessions.And this is where this title fails - the UI is really, really clunky, a lot of interactions seem not to work as expected; not to mention some pretty annoying bugs that we've tackled very early on into the game. These are the basic things that the game should provide, and while I find the existence of bots really helpful (when someone suddenly has to go somewhere or just got really tired of the game, he can leave without spoiling the fun for everyone), this is not really enough to compensate for the rest of the issues this game has.The game itself is quite fun, as I said, but the board game original is the one that should be praised - the digital edition is very mediocre and is, as it seems to be, a superficial, hastily made, badly playtested piece of programming crap, and for that, thumbs down."

I never got the chance to play the original board game, but if it were up to me, I would have pulled this spell out of any games I played with other people. The radical swings it causes either totally ruin the game, or extends the length of the game to the point where it is agonizing.If radical, late-game shifts in power balance are ok with you, then I can recommend this game.

And i won't go into discussion about skills, cos there is no objective method to measure them (i played at least about a hundred games of real life board Talisman, been playing it on and off for the last 12 years, i consider myself at the very least experienced), and while my experience with the board game is somewhat 50% love and 50% hate, i find the PC talisman to be more akin to 10% love and 90% hate.It is very convient and plaesant to play on the PC but the game just feels so heavily rigged and unnatural that despite talking with some tolerant and wise people about it, i PERSONALY cannot recommend this game with a clear conscience.But, i can recommend to at least try it IF you are a fan of the Talisman series, no harm done cos it can go good, it can go bad, but it will certainly be a bit amazing.Huge thanks to cheshirecatgirl and Wock73 for being wise and helpful instead of hatemongering."

Boy, what a dope I was. In fact, playing this now, I can't even imagine or remember why I liked it so much in the first place. To paraphrase another reviewer, all this game wants to do is make you lose. I thought perhaps one of the expansions might make it a little better, but here's how a list of the Reaper Expansion adventure cards reads: A robber gobsmacks you from behind - lose all gold; flash flood - if you have a mule, it dies a miserable, horrible death by drowning and you lose all your possessions; plague outbreak: all your followers become infected with bubos and die miserable, horrible deaths. And so on. Actual play with AI characters using the base set goes something like this: AI player 1: roll 5, land on a Forest; you encounter a frightening, powerful Wraith...who smiles at you and gives you an Amulet - no one can harm you with a spell, ever! AI player 2: roll a 3, land in the Crags; you found three gold! AI player 3: roll a 6, land on a Field; you encounter a fiery, angry dragon - you pit your Strength 3 Wizard against a giant Strength 7 reptile...and win! You: roll a 1, land on a Stream; your Strength 7 Troll encounters a Strength 2 Wolf...and loses! Lose 1 Life! Lose all Gold! Lose all will to live or ever play this effing game ever again! Basically, you spend hours and hours trying to beef up at least one trait so that you are strong enough to pass a duel with the Sentinel guarding the gate to the middle ring, then work your way through the middle ring (which is ten orders of difficulty harder than the outer ring was) to pass a trial which will allow you to get to the center of the board and engage in ultimate combat to see who is the winner. Unless someone has the Reverse Decision spell, which can reverse the outcome of any combat, making you start all over again from the beginning. There is very little fun to be found in this game, both by design and because of the clunky, unfriendly nature of the user interface (after seven hours, I STILL can't figure out how to make sure I get to use a particular item or a spell in combat). Also, it uses the first edition art, which is fussy, cluttered, and amateurish at best, and, ""Hey, my little brother got a gold star in his art class, can he draw the Prophetess card?"" at worst. MIGHT be fun for five seconds from a nostalgia standpoint, but, really...save your money - just look at the screen shots and video and say to yourself, ""there but for the grace of gaming gods go I."""

,Not Recommended,247000,30459998,Posted: 11 March,all,[SA] Xanith_DeGroot,"To explain this game in one word: LuckGet lucky with the character you getGet lucky with your draws, your dice rolls, your enemies dice rollsOr you lose.This game has no skill in it. You get lucky with your rolls, And you win. Simple as that.But, only problem is, that is horrible game design.Now that wouldn't be as much of a problem if it where not for the card effects, namely those from the DLC.Bace set is good and fairly balenced, But once you add all the DLC in, things get a little bit... well... kids use steam. So I'm just going to say stupid. Lets look at the clasic set for a moment. There are some spells, and other effects, that allow you to teleport, but not in the inner regon.. Thats all fine and dandy. But then there are cards from some of the DLC cards that let you teleport. And thats it. They let you teleport up to the crown of command. The item that exist to end the game. There are no downsides to these teleports. You just use the card, and get a free win. It would be fine, if it wasen't so easy to get said items. No long is it this fun race to the middle, it is now a race to see who can get the teleport item first, and thus win the game. I unfortunately thought that this game would be as fun as the table top verson was, But I was wrong.Oh wait, I'm not done yet! This game is dead! No one plays this game anymore, So I suppose there is no reason to even write this revew, But you never know. The graphics are outdated, And the devs clearly don't want to improve them. There might be 2-3 open public games, so unless you have friends who also want to waste money on a dead videogame, or you did what I did and made the mistake of doing and buying the 4 pack, you have to fight horrible made AI that play overly aggressively, and will never try and progress the game. I can never finish a game because I tend to get too fustrated with the fact that an AI just attacked me for the 5th time in a row, and the game has gone on for about 40 minutes, or atleast it feels like, and there is nothing interesting that happens, making it imposobal to keep playing."

This is one of those games that holds a special place in my heart and I bought this specifically so I could share it with my friends... The base ruleset is unplayable, unfun and without a workshop for mods to fix this, I will never recommend this game for anyone.In the board game, once someone has the crown of command, no more healing can occur. On THIS however, a troll with 6 gold can face tank the spell, run up to the top with nothing I can do but spend over a half hour (yes we counted) clicking ""yes, continue"" etc. On top of that, making the command spell have a 50% chance of success is just prolonging the game.I believe that adding a steam workshop to this game so you can customize rules, card sets and characters more easily would fix all my issues with this particular version. However as is, this is a literally waste of time and effort. Please games workshop give the community the chance to do what I know so many have done with your board game and let us make the game more fun as we see fit."

Since it contains a functional solo game, one that sells for a significant fraction of its price, this makes its purchase a pretty low-wattage afterthought, if you have any interest in getting in on a value - and have some friends of a similar temprament who like these kind of board/card based RPGs.The game is nearly impossible to complete playing with 2 human players over the Internet.

Heck, I've even played it for an absurd quantity of time (but not the ones you see in my profile, as I often open it during work and let it in the background) and bought two expansions.But no, the game planly sucks. It would be a really nice and good game, but let's be honest: there is no randomness in it, the game just choose a set of possible winners from the beginning and drive the events and the dices accordingly.You know who is going to win since the firts 6/10 turns, as it's pretty obvious who always get the best dice results and cards. Among those there is then a bit level of uncertainess of who will exactly win, but halfway of the game you know the winner.And this apply to you, too: the moment you start the game and EVERYTHING that happens to you is useless for, let's say 20 turns in a row, you know this is a game you will not win. Just quit, start another round, and try again.Useless like never getting a single enemy encounter for 20 turns, just always getting the exact dices number to move to all those area where you don't draw an event card, or getting a couple that are totally useless. Or you never getting the number you hope, and the IA getting ALWAYS the number you get, so you just go on for 5-6 turns in a row moving to a useless space and the IA getting the same exact number and landing every time in your space and fighting you and killing you because it ALWAYS get the good number even if they have like 20% of chance for it.And, no, it's not just a matter of bad luck: it's a matter of bad luck for a couple of games, but it's not when you play like tens of games and the pattern is always there.

After that you get to chose where you go, whether right or left and that's pretty much all.  Everything else is a no-brainer.  Kill the guy who is winning.  Steal the best items.  Rinse repeat.And how you win...*sigh*.  The goal is totally anti-climatic...the objective is basically a king of the hill thing where you kill off the other opponents to win.  It would be much better if you could just end the game there but since its so hard to even get there thanks to everything based on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ die rolls, they really have to make it so that someone has a chance to get to you while you do nothing but roll to try and hit everyone for a life point.  Talk about fun...not.  The slow drip of waiting for your turn even when you're not on the hill creates more stress than it should.Worst of all is the hateful RNG.  Yeah, I know that getting toaded is just part of the game but you may as well rage quit if your toaded because you are going to be hard pressed in getting everything you earned back while the rest of the players go ape $#*%!.

Each time it happens I quit the game and start over.  Am I really that unlucky or is it the game just trying to present me a challenge?

My only major gripe is that the AI opponents aren't programmed to win; they never go for the Crown of Command (CoC). When a human player reaches the CoC, the AI opponents just keep running back and forth healing making the endgame mind-numbingly boring. The only way to play this game with AI is with the Race for the Crown option turned on. Improved tweakable AI algorithms would go a long way to solving this issue."

Great if you have a group of friends as only one needs to own the extra content.This game is very enjoyable as Single Player against AI as well. There is also to option to set how fast the AI plays, so for the less patient or more experienced, the AI will blast through their turns.If you are new and learning however, you can set the AI speed slower to understand whats happening with ease.Like traditional board games, especially of this kind, the game length can take 1 hour at the least.With experience and knowledge games get faster, but expect lengthy games.With that said, there is an Armageddon rule to set a 'Turn Limit', which is great for shorter games.Overall, tonnes of options and possibilities.

The presentation and mechanics are great.  Unfortunately, the AI is abysmal.  Actually, the AI is non-existent; it's just a random number generator.  The AI will not try to win once they have a talisman and adequate strength.  Instead they just wander around the board, picking up random trash and fighting random monsters.  The player will inevitably win the game, it's just a matter of patience.  I suppose if you have friends who own it and can make the time to play with them, it's a great game.  If you're thinking of buying it as a solo game, however, do not waste your money.Note to devs:  if you fix the AI, I'll happily give this a ringing endorsement and buy all the DLC without hesitation.  But not until then.EDIT:I'm changing my recommendation from a ""No"" to a qualified ""Yes"".  Here's why:  You can select the house rule Sudden Death and thereby nullify much of the problem with the AI.In this mode, you play for a set number of rounds (determined by you at the start of the match), and the player or AI with the most improved Strength, Craft, and total count of gold, spells, followers and items wins.  This plays more to the strength of the AI since, as noted above, it mostly roams around gathering stuff and improving its stats.  You can easily lose to the AI in this mode.  The downside?  It's more RNG-based, since there is no defined strategic goal.  However, it's a dice-and-card game; RNG is at the core of it.  The game is, in essence, a pretty time-waster.  I can live with that.I don't know that I'll necessarily buy the season pass, (maybe during a 50% sale), but at least the game is more enjoyable in solo mode by using that house rule.  Your mileage may vary, of course, if you're prone to RNG rage."

76561197982872523,Recommended,247000,33785924,Posted: 25 July,all,_sjc_,This game played very close if not exactly like the table top game.  One of the best conversions of table top to computer games. This game preseves the essence of orginal game.That being said I have always disliked this game in design and concept.  This can be a very long and difficult table top game.  The Pvp aspect in this game can drag on forever.To all my friends that have made me play this game far too often..... get this game!(and dont ask me to play  it)

76561198017683738,Recommended,247000,15249755,"Posted: 7 April, 2015",all,Arise,A very good game with alot potential. Its not so easy to play but easy to laern. It is very frsutrating at some points and sometimes the developers clearly didnt think a few cards and actiosn through when they made the game but its fun nevertheless. (Crown ending with rolls of 1-3 are really boring)Howevr if you are into turnbased strategy with alot players Talisman is for you.
,Recommended,247000,34665189,Posted: 1 September,all,Emil,"Part of what's fun with Talisman the board game is that you can always interpret some rules differently, or even make up some rules on the fly, all in the spirit of role playing. This is impossible when a computer has set all the rules in stone, however it is still Talisman and it is enjoyable to play unless you play against too many CPU opponents. Another plus-side is that you don't have to spend 15 minutes to set up a board, and then another 30 explaining the rules to bots.Watch out for the double toad."

I love the house rules available, I woild like to see one added where a new character who has not yet been played this game can be picked after death.  My friends and I like to play this way because it allows done extra diversity in game."

,Recommended,247000,35052078,Posted: 18 September,all,RedSquirrel,"Great game even solo with a few expansions like city, dungeon, highlands.There are angels and demons and dragons and pixies and frogs.Good:Board Game on a computer, quicker playSurprising depth of strategy, interestingEach game is an adventure, replayableSimple controls easy to use, accessibleBad:Casual Pace: Board Game pace is less than action game paceReading: Card game aspect requires reading and understanding detailed rulesExploit: An exploitation allows players to quit game, restart/rejoin game, and a turn will be replayedOverall:Great indepth casual board/card game adapted from a popular board game.Talisman Digital Edition is the electronic version of a very good board game.  Porting from board game to computer speeds up game play compared to the original.  Nothing can replace actually going to a friend's house and breaking out a physical board game and rolling dice while hanging out, but seldom do we have that luxury.  Truth is that more games can be played on computer in a shorter time period.The pace of Talisman Digital Edition can be altered by changing the AI speed.  Experienced players who recognize card attibutes/rules with only seeing the card can set the AI speed to high so that the game moves quicker.  Beginning players will want the AI speed on slow if they want to follow what happens during the computer's turn.I could be wrong but I believe that Online games require each player needs to have the proper expansions to match the game, and most players want to play with all the expansions enabled.  This limits a person who does not have all the packs to playing solo.  Solo games are fun and smoother than the online experience.In the solo game, each game can be configured to have different settings, for example, what the end game rules are when a player reaches the center of the board.  Other settings are whether the game goes to the end or for a number of rounds, whether the Death character is in play or not (expansion needed for Death), whether or not you can replace quest cards, etc.There are many characters to play, each with different abilites.  Combat is broken into Psychic or Physical combat.  Items can be worn, followers taken as henchmen, horses ridden into battle, swords enchanted, spells cast, combat won, experience spent on attributes.Very enjoyable and replayable."

And it just gets better the more expansions you buy. No two games will be the same, and there are tons and tons of ways to configure games to your taste.If you don't mind a little bad luck ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t every now and then, and you hate your friends, this is the perfect game for you."

My only issue is that there seem to be connectivity issues with online play. It's extremely laggy and when I was trying to play with a couple of my friends they kept disconnecting randomly during our game. It's neat that the AI takes over when that happens but sometimes they make stupid decisions that really mess up your game. If the online play were improved a bit this game would be perfect!"
