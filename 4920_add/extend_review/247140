,Recommended,247140,17931539,"Posted: 7 September, 2015",all,Furret,"Why should you get soundodger?Well, I think you should get it because the game is fun, good music, variety in said music, starts easy, but you'll soon realise that this game is not a cakewalk, the community is generally pretty good and there's an editor. The editor is mainly the reason why this game got so much replayability. Would I have put currently nearing 400 hours in it if it wasn't for the editor? no I wouldn't.I can't stop you from reading the negative reviews, however, I think most of them don't say correct things, so keep that in mind. You like editors? You like difficult games? You like relaxing games? with the editor and custom levels, there's bound to be stuff for you, lots of it. You can literally use any music you like, not even copyrights can stop you there.I guess the only real question would be whether you like rhythm games and bullet hells in general.For most people, I think this would be a game you could easily get into, so why not give it a shot? perhaps this is the game you've been looking for that you can just put tons of hours into.The game is also a bit broken, sure, that's not enough to make me not enjoy the game, but it is really annoying when they do happen. There's lots of bugs, and it feels like Bean, the developer just doesn't care anymore. On top of that, the game doesn't have the best performance, this is because the game is made in flash. While you won't really notice the lag if you're just playing normally, if you have a bad PC, or get into making really big levels however, you will notice that.And please, do NOT use 60 FPS mode.And can't forget to mention, make sure to fully ignore autogen. if autogen is what you're buying the game for, and many have done this, bad choice. (edit: it's so bad because it does not sync correctly to the song at all, it just pays attention to how loud it is)I'd give it a 9 or 9.5/10, overall it's fun, editor adds replayability, but bugs and bad performance make it less good."

A music-based bullet hell that scores you based on how perfect you can avoidsound.The main objective, as aforementioned, is to be perfect at avoidingsound--bullets that spawn into the playing field and follow a particular rhythm and beat of the track. There are four different bullets: linears, bubbles, homers, and hearts. In game, the hearts unlock a new track that can be played as well if you seek to unlock special achievements.Soundodger+includes user levels, an editor, and auto-gen mode (creates a randomized level with whatever song selected). By default, there are six premade stages, five that, like the advanced stages, have the heart bullet that can help unlock the same bonus tracks.ReviewThe GoodI'm finding myself enjoying the editor a lot, using my favorite songs to craft nice and partially fancy levels. And after achieving perfection with the standard songs, unlocking the advanced stages as well as a couple heart stages, I'm in a constant liking of this game. A nice time-killing on a boring day. I have yet to officially unlock all hearts and getting 100% score on more advanced and premade user levels.The BadPart of me wish there were at least another mode to this game, possibly an alternative, where the game rates how well you can collect specific bullets. Auto-gen, too, isn't very good in creating stages either, but there must be a way they're done. I don't know what more to put here...Conclusing CommentsSoundodger is a pretty amazing game with all it already has. Plus, this game is accompanied with a worthwhile soundtrack that I fell in love with the more I kept playing those particular stages. Hopefully, I'll share some of my created stages with the public later on...--Hermix"

The soundtrack within the game allows you to play what looks like a campaign, unlocking new tracks with your progress, and the music is great, there's even a zen mode to make it even more relaxing! There's also a feature where you can input your music and the game generates a maze for you to play while listening to your favourite songs, how awesome is that? Totally worth it's full price!"

,Recommended,247140,8497825,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,FZeroRacer,"Soundodgers+ is an exellent update that makes a good game even better. It combines the best aspects of bullet-hell type games with a great soundtrack and hyper-clean visuals that are absolutely stunning on high resolutions. Not only that, but it has a built-in level editor allowing users to download and make their own patterns to music. It also has the ability to auto-generate to songs, but it's not as good as other games in the genre like Symphony.That said, I would highly recommend this game to people who are fans of bullet-hell, music games or both. If you really want to try it before you buy it, there's a flash version on the Adult Swim website which will give you most of the experience, sans about half of the tracks and custom song support."
,Recommended,247140,8129533,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,middlethought,"The sequel to the semi-popular flash game Soundodger on Adult Swim Games, Soundodger+ offers much more in terms of difficulty and replayability.If you haven't already, check out the original on Adult Swim, here (it has half of the levels, and the same gameplay):http://games.adultswim.com/soundodger-puzzle-online-game.htmlThough it may be easy to jump right to the level editor or auto-gen mode, Soundodger+ is mostly about its single-player experience. There are many edge-of-your-seat moments where focus and concentration are key. This may not be apparent from the first few levels or trailer; the game starts off slow, easing you into the later levels with simplified versions of the patterns; it feels a little too slow moving in, and you need to beat ~10 of these levels before the advanced levels can be played. This is my only real gripe though; the level of polish and love put into the later levels is evident in spades. (Look for advanced levels indicated by a black background.)The quality of music is also exceptional. If you peruse the Indie section of Steam often, there's a good chance that you'll recognize some of the artists; Disasterpeace, Sonic (also known as Jasper Byrne, who did all of Lone Survivor [music too]), Austin Wintory, Danny Baranowsky, Lifeformed, and Bill Kiley. That's not to say that the others not mentioned are bad; far from it. You may recognize Ghost Kollective, but other names such as Mike Forst, D. WIGHT, Anoctave and Bean proved to be exceptional with the tracks they provided.Next, the editor. Soundodger+ has plenty of very interesting mechanics; you can slow down and invert time, fill the screen with bullets, and control the movement of the outside ""enemies."" All of this can be accessed and used in the editor. Though initially appearing dense and convoluted, the editor makes a ton more sense after viewing the available online tutorials, and it can be a blast not only to play finished levels, but also to watch said levels as well. Be warned, Soundodger+ only accepts tracks encoded at 44.1 kHz; I ran into the problem of not being able to use some tracks I wanted to because of this.Finally, the Auto-Gen mode. I put this at the bottom because it's easily the weakest part of Soundodger+. Levels are typically created on a scale of how loud the music is, similar to Audiosurf. If you don't have loud tracks, you'll end up with a level that's too easy, on the scale of the early campaign levels. The levels generated often don't make sense either; the game creates a pattern only when there's a spike in the noise, causing bullets to fire off at seemingly random times. And again, the Auto-Gen mode only works for songs encoded at 44.1 kHz, same as the editor.TL;DR: Soundodger+ is highly recommended, especially if you're looking for something in the vein of Bit.Trip, Audiosurf, Sound Shapes or 140. Do not buy for the auto-gen; rather, buy for the single player experience."
76561198124522253,Recommended,247140,30395763,Posted: 8 March,all,WheezyWop,"This game is really fun, but not for everyone. Even though I do think the appearence is very nice and do not care about thepreferred 30fps you play it with, there is a slight problem: There is no real stress or adrenaline-powering motion within 90% of the game. Let me explain it a bit further.Most songs are pretty long, which isn't a real problem itself, but how the game works is that you try to hit as few 'bullets' as possible. The player is really free to move however he wants to, because he is not asked to move to a specific point most of the time, but to the emptiness to hide from everything that is flying across the screen. Even though this may sound promising, in reality it makes it really dificult to know where the *** you have to go for the first hours you play the game.Secondly, the only moment you feel happy is when you're able to get 100% out of a level, while hitting things doesn't mean you die, it only means a little number goes down. I do really think the game would be better if you somehow could die and the level started again, while it makes the ending of the song more of an surprise and makes you more active trying to dodge all bullets.The game looks like a very intens game, but when played, feels like the slowest thing you have ever done with a mouse, even though everything rushes past you.But this is all just my opinion, I have a few friends who don't think this is a real problem and LOVE it. So, even though I do think playing this game for a long time isn't really what it's made for, it sure is fun at the beginning.Sorry if my opinion isn't really build up well, first time doing this :p"
76561198016536762,Not Recommended,247140,12489838,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,sqweek,"I'm a big fan of the classic rhythm games - stepmania, osu! and the like. The games that get you immersed in the music and entwined with the beat. I could never get into audiosurf because the obstacles were on the beat, which meant you had to move out of time with the music - for me this breaks the definition of rhythm game.And I love bullet hell; played Perfect Cherry Blossom to death (which incidentally, had great music). So how does Soundodger+ stack up?Well, the bullet hell falls short at times. In a traditional shooter you have to focus on (a) dodging and (b) being in the right position to shoot your enemy(s). Here there's no shooting, just dodging -- which I have no problem with in theory, but in practice I found some levels had large periods of time where no bullets would come my way. I had a safe spot and with no other pressure to reposition I just sat still - which didn't make for very engaging gameplay. Other levels were better, including homing missiles to keep me on my toes.How about the rhythm? Well, there's two things thatabsolutely killthe rhythm of whatever song is playing. The first is the slow motion ability which you invoke via the left mouse button. This slows down the music aswell of course, and for me the effect simply doesn't work. The second occurs whenever you get hit - everything speeds up for a short time which has a hugely jarring effect on the music. I'm not suggesting death should be fun, but in a rhythm game the musicmakes the game, and if you kill my enjoyment of the music you kill my enjoyment of the game. Fortunately you can simply avoid activating slow motion, and there's an option (""Easy listening"") to disable the speedup when you get hit. So while I don't think these are worthwhile features, I don't hold them against the game as a whole.Soundodger does a pretty good job of matching the song's energy, both in pre-made levels and the auto-generated mode (when you plug your own music in). But it suffers from the same issue I had with audiosurf - it doesn't encourage me to movewiththe beat, or draw me into the music. Yes the level is generated from the music, but the gameplaythat emerges is on a totally different beat. As such I can't recommend it as a rhythm game."

Slow down and half speed modes make those nasty spots a little easier, but only just a little.  Though things slow down, the bullet keep appearing, so there is more stuff on the screen to avoid.  Use it sparingly, as the game itself recommends.  This game plays with the turntable aspect nicely too, even making the pieces move backward when the music slows and starts reversing.  Watch out :)Another nice feature is that though you have to unlock newer levels, it doesn't make it difficult to do so.  Getting scores in the 80%+ range on each level locks another level or two.  Getting 80% is actually pretty easy to do, even if you get hit one or two times.  But, you'll probably want to replay most levels until you get the 100%.  Also, complete level editor - make your own, with your own music.Controls? Pick your poison:  WASD, mouse and game controller all supported.If you like bullet hell games, mixed with a variety of music (mostly trance/dance/chiptunes/etc), this is well worth buying.  At full price even.  But, if it's on sale, most definitely."

This game did it and it did it well, but with a few minor things that didn't work so good. One of those things is the audio quality after the level generation, I hear the quality go down about 30%. You can fix this by lowering the in-game music by ~50% and boosting your main volume a bit. Also the hit box isn't as good as it is in, for example Touhou.I love the fact that I can just lay on my couch, put on my headphones and relax with some smooth jazz, or liquid dnb.

,Recommended,247140,24580742,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,The Gay Agenda,"Soundodger+ is a rhythm-bullet hell game in which bullets spawn from enemies on the outside of a rotating circle in time with the music. You must dodge them on the inside of the circle. The main game includes 20 basic levels, 18 advanced levels, and 5 heart levels. Each of the advanced levels is an upgraded version of one of the basic levels with harder bullet patterns. Levels are unlocked in sequence by getting enough score on all the previous levels. Each advanced level also contains a heart bullet, which if collected acts as a free hit. Heart levels are unlocked by finishing the required number of advanced levels with your heart intact, and consist of two upgraded basic songs and three all-new songs. The game also comes with 12 DLC levels for free, which do not contribute to the main game. Finally, the game includes a level editor and auto-generation feature so that you can play levels from your own songs.Pros:+The soundtrack is incredible. I listen to nearly all of the songs in it on a daily basis. They aren't just regular game-soundtrack songs, they're SONGS, from genres all across the spectrum. Dubstep, downbeat, chiptune, and classical are all there.+The main levels are very fun with a fairly consistent difficulty curve.+This game has several very talented creators who make great user levels and have been for a while, so there's no shortage of content.+The level editor itself is intuitive and fairly easy to use, although it has a few bugs and can lag.+There is a community for this game, and it isn't literal trash. It's actually pleasant to be in.Cons:-It has a few game-breaking bugs, but if you're just playing the main game you're very unlikely to come across any of them.-The auto-generation feature doesn't make good levels, or even levels that sync up with the chosen song very well. Use it only if you want to hear a level from a specific song and don't want to bother making it yourself.-The difficulty markers are vague at best, and often non-indicative of the difficulty of the actual level. They are rarely very far off, though -- there are no 3-difficulty levels that should be marked 5-difficulty.Tips for playing:=In the audio settings, there is an option for ""smooth listening."" Turning it on means the level no longer speeds up when you get hit, although score is calculated the same. Turn this on, it's better.=The 60fps mode works and works well, but may mess up some levels with lots of rewind. I recommend not using it because you don't want to get used to it and then turn it off to fully experience the levels it doesn't like.=Your first level you make in the level editor will, invariably, be not very good. Don't be disheartened.Overall, the cons are very minor gripes and the pros vastly outweigh them. If you like rhythm games or bullet hell games, buy this game."

Well, what if I told you that there's a game that does all that at once?It's this one.Right here.Soundodger+ has been one of the best rythm experiences I've had in my life. The music that it has is beautiful, the colors are vibrant and clear, the gameplay is tight, and it's overall very fun.There are some things however. First, it's made in Flash, so it's bound to have performance problems, even if you have a monster computer. Secondly, the Auto-Gen mode. It's not the hottest thing on the box. I would suggest ignoring it altogether and using the editor instead, which lets you punch in any song that you want.Overall, Soundodger+ is a nice goodie bag of rythm choices. I've played it for years now, and I'm never getting tired of it."

The levels in this game all feel natural and everything that fires at you fires at the right time. Think of Beat Hazard but with actual structure to it. Nothing about this game feels out of place and everything flows naturally.The level editor, coupled with the tutorials from the developer himself, are very simple to grasp and use. And with the community making so many pretty good levels, there's plenty of content that this game provides. The auto-generated levels are not so good, as it's not even close to being as deep as the core levels are, basing more on the loudness of the track over any indtrumentation going on.And of course, the soundtrack is great too! It has songs that I've had on since I bought the game and listen to regurlarly. The songs fit the game perfectly with their instrumentation and melodies and provide an amazing look when paired with the visuals.In my short time with this game, I've had tons of fun with it.

The biggest problem i have with the game right now is that the movement fells to light and floaty. It's a pretty big problem but it's not a deal breaker but it 8s still a problem. My second problem with the game is that the level select is just bad. You are only able to see 3 or 4 levels at a time and it makes getting to the later levels a pain my segestion is to make the selected one a little smaler and have more of the screen used for the list. My last problem with the game is thatgeting user created levels is a pain. Its presented the same wayas the main levels which wasn't amazing in the first place and didn't include a serch bar. Even witth a tool like the steam workshop in place they just completely ignored it.

First of all it claims that it's a Music game. Yeah it is... kinda.The layouts of the levels are made as if you are playing against the song but the gameplay needs no understanding of the rythm or listening when you have to do something. You just dodge what the song is throwing at you. Every tone is one ""bullet"" that tries to hit you. And this is really well done. You feel like the song is your enemy. BUT the game should actually be called Soundpatternlearner+. The first levels are really fun and you feel like you need skill to beat the song. But when the game starts throwing hundreds of ""bullets"" at you there is no way that you dodge a wave at the first try. It's just learning patterns and trial and error. Or maybe I just suck at reacting :D. BUT the presentation of the game is brilliant. The visuals look so simple but they are pleasing to the eyes like the style of an Edmund McMillen(IndieGod :D). And the music is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. If you like electronic music this is your heaven. Chiptune, House, Dupstep this game has everything you're looking for in the sound department.So the conlusion is:Presentation: yesGameplay: NoOh yeah this game also has an auto-gen mode where the game genarates a level to a mp3 file you give it, which is awesome.Just buy it because of the music it's worth it :DDD6.5/10"

Not only is the concept of the game of notes and music very good but the creativity was even better. For those of you who have played rock band or guitar hero, this game is very similar. Except for the fact that instead of hitting the notes you're trying to avoid them and instead of the notes coming in a straight line they come from circles that circle you.

A minimalistic stage design combined with bright and contrasting colours allows the player to see every bullet and distinugish it from your ""ship"" with ease. I found the game suprisingly hard at first , compared to other similar games such as Beat Hazard, but soon got addicted to the challenging gameplay and lovely contrasting colours,and as the stage fires waves of bullets upon you, based upon the tempo, bpm and other characteristics of the song, you have to try and dodge them, and with each hit taken it fastforwards the song. However, on left click you have a 'time-slow' button that allows the player to slow the song down while retaining full movement, but at the cost of not having a multiplier bonus carry through the slow, in order to make the game a bit easier. I found the game suprisingly hard at first , compared to other similar games such as Beat Hazard, but soon got addicted to the challenging gameplay and lovely contrasting colours.Pros;Fun, addictive gameplayAbility to play own musicClear gameplay.Cons;File-selecter takes you out of game, would be nice an in-game one so you can see the colours provided for the stage.Can be incredibly difficult for beginners, maybe have a difficulty option?Overall, i would say this a must have if you are into music or bullet-hell games, and with endless replayability i would strongly reccomend this to anyone"

This game's main purpose is for you to dodge a barrage of bullets in a circular field that fire rhythmically with the music. The songs included are already pretty fun to listen and play to, and the game lets you add in songs of your choice and create your own map, or simply auto-generate a game for them (which isn't as fun as actually creating the bullet patterns yourself).The game is incredibly straightforward, however, as there is only one mode of play. With the absence of variety, this game can get boring quickly, or if bullet hell games just aren't as fun to you. Personally, I stick around for the music and the sole purpose of seeing how many retries it'll take me to get a 100% before I rage quit.As for recommending this game, I probably would not. It is a fun game, but it doesn't last, especially for its price.

Or a bullet hell that makes games from that genre look weak.The secret is to dance to the music and consider the bullets ballet partners. Treating it as such opens up a whole new degree of enjoyment and relaxation. The levels are very much choreographed and are recommended to simply go with the music and flow.If you like Audiosurf, Super Hexagon, or any other game of this genre, BUY IT! Confirm it with the flash version if you must, but this is a worthy title to own. The music is downloaded in both FLAC & MP3 formats!After playing a few of the levels and listening to the soundtrack outside the game, I threw “Warm Up” (Album: “Anjunadeep” by Above & Beyond), a few misc tracks, and wrapped up with the Nyan Cat Song (【UTAU】Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!【桃音モモ】【ミクカバー】.mp3 @3:46/5MB) under the auto-gen before jumping back to the pre-created levels. “Warm Up” brought about many of the elements seen in a pleasant way. It seldom required the slow-mo speed and largely resolved the issue of how to dance with the cubes.  It’s certainly a recommended auto-gen. The Nyan Cat song… This is a bullet hell *from hell* with even slow-mo over half the time.While the auto-gen does a valiant effort with maintaining the same feel as the hand-crafted levels, it’s a hit and miss with the success throughout one’s collection and even points in some tracks."

The colors and contrast in the game is very colorful and pretty. The selections of songs they have vary from dubstep, to slower electronic music, to classical. Creating a very nice selection of music to play to. The game is basically a bullet hell dodgeball and as you finish each song, the more perecent you are closer to finidhing the song, the more it goes to unlocking more songs to play.The hitboxes on the ""bullets"" are only at the tips to give you more flexibility in your movements and allows for really tight dodges between two bullets. Although the selected music from the game is really nicely paced and progressively gets more challenging, the music you can load in yourself is a mixed bag of challenges depending on the song you decide to play. Most music you pick, unless it is a slow paced song, will have you mutilate the song by unsuccessfully dodging the unecessary amount of projectiles being flown at you as the game really doesn't keep a good flow to the songs you pick and analyze. It just shoots out millions of projectiles hoping you know what you're doing.All in all, this game can keep you occupied with some really nice music when you have a boring day.8/10"

It's lovely to get taken into a trance when you're doing astounding on a given song... and absolutely infuriating when you nick a triangle 80% of the way through the song.  Honestly I might have more playtime on this if it wasn't for what might seem like a petty thing - the sound it makes when you get hit.It's like... anxiety inducing, to the point where I'm trying mostly to dodge to not hear that, because I like to play with the music moderately loud (as it's like more than half the game) and with headphones, and then if I slip up I get a very loud, zen-shattering, rewind screech that breaks my mood into pieces.  Not only did I just ruin my score, I also just got ear-wrecked.  Again, sounds petty, but it's sort of a big deal to me.  (I can likely mod a file for that or something?  But eh.)I love the game otherwise, seriously.  It's fun to swirl in circles and fluidly dance around a sweet pattern, and the light show it puts on even entertains others while they're watching.

If you've ever played any arcade shooter, you already played soundodger. It's far from perfect and further from being original, but you will definitely forget about that once the music kicks in! You're a little circle that dodges the particles made by the music itself.You dodge the sounds of music eminated by the likes of Austin Wintory, Mike Forst, and Disasterpeace! If you don't, the music will become mixed up and will transport ahead of your mistake, while keeping track of your percentages. You can also enter into a bullet-time like mode, but be warned; if you do it will affect your overall percentage! You can go a whole song in this mode, but you'll never complete with a 100% because of this.It isn't without it's faults either, unfortunately! My main problem is it's repetitive nature, of course every game like this is going to be repetitive, but this is different. Like after a while (20 minutes I'd say) you're going to be bored with it. Not to mention the tracklist starts over when you hit the new levels! The game does have a level editor, which you can import songs and track it yourself, but the problem here is it's tedium. You'll be sitting at your desk, face smooshed into the screen, trying to get that one bullet into the perfect spot.In reality, if you have time to kill, this game is right up your ally!

May cause epilepsia, but there's an explicit warning, so that should be no problem.If you like bullet-hell games, this is the one to play. But unlike a shooter your only job is to, well, dodge sounds. You can slow down if it's to hard, but that will decrease your score and ruin the sync, which is overall amazing. The soundtrack itself is already good, so the DLC is a must have if you enjoy the game, but there are also two options to insert yours:1.""Auto-Gen mode"":Just grab any MP3 of your choice and the game will generate a level for you. The screen is pretty messy then and the levels are like insanely hard, but I do fully respect that feature, as it was probably pretty hard to be programmed. And it's definately faster than...2.The level editorwhich is definately my favorite thing in the game. It's a little complicated at first, but once you are in you can make any level using your downloaded songs. You may use four or more spots to let the three""Enemy types""pop out: The stanDART one (sorry, I had to bring this one) which is small but guided by a lot of it's same kind, the BIG BALLS which are harder to doge and the SQUARES OF DOOM, which are coming after you... And the best thing of all those: You can share your levels with other users, as long they can be beat possibly.Even if it isn't, you can fail at levels without having to ignore the music and interesting visuals, just completation won't be yours then.I highly recommend youto check this game out, if you are into challenges and/or bullet hell games you will love ""Soundodger +"" more than anything else you've played before."

The number of bullets produced even for slow paced music is intense, and the failure fast forward is gut wrenching. Guess I'm looking for a more relaxed auto-genner, and zen mode for customs doesn't seem to be available."
