,Recommended,247350,1941995,"Posted: 23 September, 2013",all,Roll for Initiative,"Artemis is a diamond in the rough. It's very much unlike any other space sim I've ever played. The game has you play a starship bridge officer, responsible for controlling one of the ship's systems. Pretty cool and all, but there's a twist. In most space sims, a player is responsible for running the whole ship. He controls the weapons, he directs the ship to its destination, and so on. Artemis is different in that each of the ship's systems are run by other players. The bridge crew is entirely composed of humans, not AI.There are five stations to man in Artemis: Helm, Engineering, Weapons, Science and Comms. Helm controls the ship's movement. Engineering deals with repairs and modifying the power levels of each system in the ship. Weapons handles, well, weapons and shields. Science has control over the sensors, scanning targets for information on its systems and crew. Comms handles communication with other vessels, both friend and foe.This 5-man setup provides a lot of depth to the game, but it is not difficult to learn by any means. The actual mechanics behind the workings of each system are surprisingly simple to learn. The genius of Artemis is how the mechanics of all these systems work together to form a complete, compelling experience for everyone involved. All crew members need to have good synergy if they want to complete the mission. As long as you keep up a friendly attitude, pay attention to your fellow crewmates and do your part to keep the ship running, you will have a high chance of success.Originally, the game could only be purchased through the developer's website. It could only be played through LAN, and it cost 40 bucks, because that version came with extra copies to be played on other computers for a full LAN party. LAN play is fun as hell, but that alone doesn't make for much mass appeal. Fortunately, the developers have realized this and have added online play. The Steam version of the game costs a mere 8 bucks, because it's only one copy. A dirt cheap price for what could be an endless amount of fun with friends? That's a steal.If you're going to play online, you'll need to get a program called Teamspeak to communicate with other players. There is a teamspeak server that is decently populated for most of the day. IPs for servers can be found there. Its address isartemis.teamspeak3.comand its password is Artemis1. The community is very friendly, supportive, and a whole lot of fun to play with.Give Artemis a shot. This game deserves a lot more attention. It really is unlike any other space sim on the market. It's about as close to being in Star Trek as you can get. I'll see you in Starfleet."

I know that many people play it on a VPN, but there's nothing quite like all playing together.  Drinking encouraged, almost required, for maximum enjoyment.The game is low-to-medium hardware intensity;  whatever machine is running the Main Viewer should have a decent video card, and be comfortable with multiple outputs if a laptop.  One of our players successfully plays with nothing more than an iPad.  Support since 2.0 has improved dramatically.The biggest issue is players not knowing the nuances of their individual roles, and what buttons are where (since they've moved since 1.6)."

However, if all you're looking for is joining a Starfleet ship, this game exceeds expectations and then some.What you see is what you get: you and a group of friends fly a spaceship, each member getting their own interface.While some interfaces may seem daunting due to the amount of information displayed (particularly engineering), each one of them is well designed and surprisingly intuitive; you'll get used to the controls rather quickly.The gameplay is rather standard as far as Star Trek flight sim games go (mostly combat), but it does deliver this sense of belonging to a rich universe (even if the map is the size of a single solar system)Speaking of solar systems, the world objects (or rather the lack of) are the only drawback of the game. Maybe I shouldn't expect much from game that takes up a quarter of a gig, but a couple of planets and moons wouldn't go amiss.Overall, it's a great party game for those who love sci-fi. Just don't be caught on dreams of grandeur."
76561198096079278,Recommended,247350,13012593,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,FriendFive,"QUICK DISCLAIMER: Ignore my hours of playtime as reported by Steam. I have played a few times and most of the time I am running the EXE outside of Steam. I probably have several hours of game time now.This game is a little buggy, a little uneven, and does not feel like it's yet been fully realized. Having said that, I can still fully and wholeheartedly recommend it, but with  a few caveats that I will get to later. The bottom line is: this game is so much fun! Seriously, if you are into, or were ever into Star Trek then you owe it to yourself to get it. Artemis is a simulation of what it might be like to be part of the bridge crew on a starship like the Enterprise.Here's how it works: You run one instance of the game as a server and then each player (up to six for a full bridge crew) runs another instance and those clients connect to the server. Each player picks one or more stations to manage (captain, helm, tactical, engineering, science, and communications) and each station gets its own interface needed to perform its functions to run the ship. So the helm gets a control layout to be able to fly the ship, engineering gets controls to manage power to various systems and mitigate damage, and the tactical officer gets to fire the weapons. The captain ties it all together, making decisions and issuing orders to other crew members. The captain has his own view which is a map with some basic information, or s/he can simply use the main view screen which is provided by the server.The developer clearly intended originally that this game would be played by people all in the same room and the simulation lends itself well to LARPing and role-playing. An ideal setup would be all six players in the same room using their own machines and whichever machine is running the server (any one of the machines could run the server and one of the clients--you DO NOT need a separate machine and/or copy of the game to play) would be connected to a big screen tv to show the main screen. Thankfully, the latest version of the game allows for playing over the internet. My gaming group uses Skype for voice chat since the game provides no native voice chat. It works fine for us.The server is what runs the actual simulation and it allows for setting up various scenarios in the game and tweaking all sorts of parameters to increase or decrease difficulty. The are various sorts of ally and enemy ships to encounter and bases to dock with and defend. The game has modes for multiple ships with their own crews that can go head-to-head or do missions cooperatively. One server can support up to 36 players (six bridges with each having their own crews of up to 6 players).Each role has different things to do to keep the ship running smoothly. Admittedly, some stations are more fun to play than others. Also, some stations feel very heavy on the micro-managing and others feel like there's not much to do; many people complain about the communications station for being sort of thin in this area. I actually don't mind playing Communications Officer You can hail friendly or enemy ships, monitor distress calls from friendly bases or ships being attacked, demand that enemy ships surrender, taunt enemy ships into attacking, direct friendly ships away from deadly areas of space, order friendly ships to attack, prepare bases for docking to improve refuel and rearm performance. And most importantly, you have the button to set off the red alert klaxon. As Communications Officer, you may also get side quests from friendly forces which usually take the form of, ""Dock with this base to download this data, then take it to this friendly ship and then come back and dock with use to get more energy/coolant/weapons/etc.""So once again, I do recommend this game if you have at least two friends to play with. You DO NOT need six people to play this game. At the very least, you need helm, tactical, and engineering, but personally, I like playing with five or six people. Also, as I said before, the game has no native voice chat if you are going to playing over the internet. Something else to be aware of is that the game does nothing for you in terms of matchmaking or anything like that. You'll need to have each player connect to the server via IP address and you'll need to set up port forwarding on TCP 2010 to be able to have any of the clients be able to connect. One other gotcha to to be aware that when you play over the internet, you won't be able to use the IP address of the server that is reported in the game. That IP will only work when playing over a LAN. You'll need your internet-facing IP address to hand out to the players for connecting to the server.I bought the six pack and gave the five other copies to my gaming group. I've had fun playing this game over the internet as well as all in the same room. It's a lot of fun especially if you have a madcap gang to play with like I do.I just hope the developer continues to work on this game. It's good already but it feels like it could go a lot farther."

I just want to say that it is a great time with friends and this game has made many updates and changes over the years and is definitely worth the 6.99 price tag.This also requires no vr equipment and can be purchased on Android and iOS.What this game requires is a minimum of 3 computers. One server and 2 clients with more clients as necessary. You can connect any device to the server whether it  is a phone, tablet or pc and the game will connect everyone to the same game.The server doesnt even have to be a PC. I've found if you also have the Android version(havent tried this with iOS) you can run a server off a tablet or phone.  though I've not fully tested this under a full simulation.This game has lot of flexibility with mods as well.  So if you the style of the Star Trek ships there is a mod for it.There is constantly new content being written by the community too as well as the dev.If you buy the game here on Steam you are only limited to the one computer that you have it installed on.  If you buy it from their website ($40 usd) You will get a full copy which you can distribute multiple clients to your friends without them having to buy the game.  And you can distribute clients as necessary per game session.  Remember you have the liscence for client distrubution up to the number of bridge slots.  Anything past that is considered piracy.This is a developer who has spent time developing Star Trek games in the past and new this was the kind of game we all looked forward to.

The setup was epic: 1 TV, 6 monitors, 5 guys and 1 spaceship we were all in charge of! There certainly were some high expectations going into the simulation.The problems started right at the beginning. We started the game and had absolutely no idea how everything worked. There were no tutorials and no hints. Everything seemed alien to us and even downloading the game manual didn't help, because it was made for an earlier version of  the game.Determined not to give up, we started googling for help. Luckily, some guy had made a 30 minutes long ""short tutorial"" to Artemis. Our captain watched the whole thing and each of crew members watched their own section. This was by far the easiest way to get to know the controls of the game. Once they were explained to you in youtube, it was not so complicated after all.Spirits were high when we finally launched a random scenario and were able to defeat it. It was fun playing as a team and there were even some very nerdy roleplaying going on with our captain walking around with a coffee mug in hand giving orders.However, the random scenarios were all kind of the same. You have to defend your bases and eliminate the enemies, that's pretty much it. We were hungry for some exploration and plot, so we tried to launch some of the custom scenarios.The custom scenarios are a very nice idea - they allow people to create scenarios with plots and twists and turns for your delight. However, much of the scenarios were made for game version 2.0 and we had the newest version from steam (2.1.1) and I guess this is why all the scenarios had severe problems - game simply stopped running etc. Even after much trying, we couldn't get the custom scenarios to work.Now I realize Artemis is a single-man project and it's awesome how awesome it is, even now. But you should be aware it is not really a finished game with good support. It's a single-man coding project with a small community that has made a handful of scenarios.Right now Artemis is more of a simulator and less of a game - though it could change in the future. It's unique, however, and if you are really into space and stuff and have a couple of friends living close by who feels the same way, I definitely say it's worth your money to try it together (just don't expect everything to be perfect)!"

That or they voice a concern that then changes the plan completely.I also noticed that one of the flavour texts that pops up while you're waiting for the server to start the round explains how to cause some havok:If the Engineer removes power from all systems and then puts 300% power into the warp core, the ship will self-destruct the moment it overheats. ( I may have done this a couple of times to unsuspecting friends. :P )"

76561198071985563,Recommended,247350,18398162,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,[Sheltari],"The IdeaUnofficially the official ""totally-not-Star-Trek"" Star Trek bridge simulator. You get a crew together and take command of a starship to valiantly defend USFP resources and interests. Ideally, you'll end up with a captain and five officers for the helm, weapons, engineering, science and comms stations. If you're short a player or two, fret not: you're able to man multiple stations if need be.The Graphics & SoundSimply put, they're not top-notch; the game looks and sounds both aged and basic even in light of its release date. That being said, its UI is thematic and fairly consistent throughout. Furthermore, it's still able to provide that awe-inspiring scenery where you look out into the vast expanse of space and just let your mind float adrift among the stars... and enemy debris, but mostly stars! The sound sticks right to the classical ol' space beeps, boops and bweens. The music's actually fairly good, limited though it may be.The UIAs stated above, the UI is thematic and consistent. It's easy enough to navigate around it, though the controls themselves need plenty of explaining and/or pressing-stuff-to-see-what-it-does. I do highly recommend reading the manual and digging up the control configuration file.The GameplayLet's start with game modes: Solo (single ship, can still have multiple players), PVP (ship vs ship), Co-op (multiple player-controlled ships), and Scripted. To hone in on that last one, the premade scenarios can be lightly compared to challenges or quests. Players can make their own scenarios as well, in which a seventh player would typically take the position of GM and spawn in enemies and environmental hazards for the players to deal with. Whichever mode you choose, it's also worth noting that you can customize a lot of the settings from enemy and player ship stats to what kind of ships and environments will appear in what quantities. This customization, combined with the ability to setup your own encounters, allows you to effectively tighten down to the perfect mixture of difficulty and enjoyment. Speaking of enjoyment...The game's always more fun with friends. Always. There's the issue of role assignment that makes role-based teamwork difficult at times, but once you're past that each position can provide a challenge. Yes, a captain gives orders for the crew to follow, but agoodcaptain listens to input here and there while always ensuring that the crew has direction so they don't lose focus, get bored or feel useless. The helm officer goes where the captain instructs, but a good one is already coming about to bear on the next objective. Each role has room for improvement... even Comms has hidden levels of skill to strive for.If you step back and think about the way the game plays, it doesn't seem like it should be so interesting: you fly around, kill some baddies, resupply then rinse and repeat until victory. Then... you consider the sense of tension and urgency created by that group environment. The captain spins their plan and tells the crew what they want, helm focuses intently on maintaining firing arcs while avoiding those of the enemy ships, weapons carefully targets the opposition's weapons systems with beams while loading and firing torpedo tubes, engineering constantly shifts power levels up and down to provide better performance without overloading systems, science keeps an eye on ship statuses and positions while providing beam frequencies for weapons to fire on, comms keeps an eye on station supply levels while directing allied ships and demanding the enemy's surrender. During this, each player is providing vital information to the other stations. Depending on your crew this can mean a loud mess, a constant stream of curt statements in a rotation, or the one thing feared most by all captains: total and utter silence from the stations. Autonomy's good, but silence rarely is.I'll leave gameplay on this final and important detail: there are no offical dedicated servers. The community hosts either with their computers or through servers they run maintain/pay for themselves. In most cases this means you'll need to know about port fowarding and/or setting up LAN environments in order to play with other people. It's a sharp disappointment since the game is geared so heavily towards group play.The Final ProductIt's a blast if you're up to the task of organizing and operating a match. I've converted eleven people IRL to the cause so far; we LAN party it up just about every weekend. Get some friends, get to a guide on how to setup an Artemis server, and get to defending the galaxy from Kralien scum.Note: I have many more hours played than on record; my group often launches it sans-Steam."

I've bought this game twice, once on here, and once on the official site(which is more friendly for modular and local play), and would do so again in a heartbeat.This game is a true platform, able to fit a wide variety of gaming niches. It works equally as well for casual party play in a living room with friends and family using their personal laptops, as it does for a fully purpose-built touchscreen bridge setup in conjunction with LARP away teams. It's a must have for any fans of Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, or Babylon 5, and anyone who wants to experience the thrill of teamwork on the bridge of a spaceship.This is a game that can be played by as few as 1 person(who has to run the entire 6 station starship by themselves!), to as many as *88* (8 ships, each playing a carrier that holds 5 starfighters) on a single server!(To be honest, I don't think this has ever happened, but it's possible!)  With the right scripted mission and Gamemaster support, the number of people that can participate in a mission across multiple servers is *unlimited*, as we found out during the 2017 Artemis Armada Convention.In the multiple years I've owned this game, I've had ever increasing amounts of fun with it. The developer(just one guy!) is constantly adding new content and functionality, listens to feedback on the official forums, and honestly just wants people to have fun playing his game. There are other games out there that might look 'better,' offer VR, or have some bip and bops that this game might not, but there truely nothing that can beat the immersion of sitting behind the weapons screen (your own, real life screen!) of a cruiser, watching enemy ships come into range on the main screen (just a few feet away, in real life!), and asking (or yelling for) the Science officer sitting nearby to give you the frequency your beams should be set to.This game does not have any sort of dedicated server support, so while plenty of groups do play over the internet, it's up to each person to find people to play with.  I do not feel that this is a flaw, however, and this game works best when you have a ship's crew in the same room.The communities that have sprung up around this game are, while secondary to the game itself, absolutely excellent. From the official forums, to the modding and mission scripting folks, to the yearly convention in Cleveland, OH, to the many, MANY groups worldwide that run their own events, this is a game built by the players to be whatever they want it to be."

It has a lot to do with the fact that my recorded Steam time is abysmal but do not let this fool you: I must have logged between 200 and 300 hours for sure on this game by now. The fact is that it is not a DRM protected game at all and act very oldschool in this aspect. So much oldschool in fact that you can just copy and paste the game from your Steam directory and play it without a care in the world. A feature which the best mods around use to its full potential and which explain why I don't have much time at all logged on Steam: I always start the game from my desktop to load said mods.This game is a dream come true for any Star Trek fan who ever wanted or dreamed to be on a starship bridge to participate in whatever task is required for the ship to function. Artemis divide this in 3 primary roles and 4 secondary roles of which the former are Helm, Weapons and Engineering and the later being Captain, Science, Communications and Fighter Pilot. All 7 stations serve a critical role on any given ship and while you could technically fly a ship without the secondary stations it would certainly greatly impact on the overall efficiency of all the primary ones.After all this have been said and done, the core of the game really resolve around communication between the crew to resolve problems. Only Science and the Captain actually have a full view of the ""outside world"" on a global scale and while the Helm and Weapon officers also have a short range view of surrounding space, the communication officer and especially engineering have absolutely no clue of what is going on. It is thus critically important that every station report their own info/problems to everybody else to be able to perform about any task in an efficient manner... Just like it would/should happen on a real starship bridge!My primary concern when I bought this game was that I would not be able to find anybody online to play along. It was a very valid concern at the time because you do need at a minimum 4 players to have an efficient ship and I had nobody else in my friend list interested in playing the game with me. With some digging around forums and such I discovered two groups which are not only present but extremely active and really friendly to newcomers as well. The one group which I strongly recommend for new players is the United Stellar Navy (USN) which can easily be reached and joined on their discord server and who also are responsible for maintaining thegame countdown web pagewhich display publicly when the next planned Artemis game is going to happen. A quick visit on that page will show you all you need to know about Artemis players activity: there is a game planned for every single day on the week and that won't stop anybody from creating an impromptu game on the fly if enough player bust in at the same time and make a request for it.In conclusion, I must say that this is clearly one of the best game I ever purchased in my life.

Your top of the line dreadnought requires 10% of its entire power reserve to do a 180 degree turn.Targetting becomes broken when enemies go in and out of visibility in a purple cloud, which by the way destroy your engines if you even graze them even with shields on when your objectives clearly tell you to explore them.Those are all from just half an hour of wasting my time and that of 5 of my friends...If you could fix all these things and improve the pace of the game a little, this would be boatloads of fun but as of now, I don't see how this game can be sold on steam."

You could not simply join up with pubs and work together.I immediately uninstalled the thing and haven't touched it since.This isn't the 1990's. There is NO EXCUSE for making a multiplayer game without some sort of matchmaking feature in order to join up with other random players.Maybe there is some sort of matchmaking ability now.
