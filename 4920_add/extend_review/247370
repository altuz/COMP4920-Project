Because it does everything right. From the controls, to the chunky pixelated and colorful graphics, to the awesome soundtrack and amazing replayability and challenge level, this game does everything right.Mutant Mudds Deluxe is a port of the 3DS title of the same name (minus the Deluxe part) and it does it right: It brings the fun to the bigger screen and puts more into the mix to make it even better.The controls are simple: you jump and shoot - but you can also hover in the air for more precision (and sometimes you'll need to hover to reach some platforms as well); The graphics are like they should be for a game like this: colorful, full of life and original. They claim it to be ""12-bits"", but you know what? I don't think so few bits can accomodate the amount of fun you will have playing this game. It's pretty large as well with plenty of areas to conquer (plus some really difficult secret ones) and you will have so much fun that it will be pretty difficult to put it down after you start playing it.This game is a serious love-letter to those early platforming titles from the late 80's and early 90's, packed with everything that made some titles from the era classics.Do you really need a score after everything I said? Sure, here you go: 9/10. Why 9/10 if you praised the game with every single line you wrote, you may ask. Simply because it doesn't have exploding Spaceships and Flamethrowers, because if it did, this game would be so good that you would need to change your pants after every single section. Buy this game right now! - Actually, buy 2 copies, so you can keep one sealed. - Wait, that's not how it works anymore? Screw society!"

Seeing as there are no Mario games on Steam, this game holds a special place in my heart. Originally a 3DS Exclusive, the Deluxe version of the game was eventually ported to PC via Steam with Achievements and trading cards!I originally played this on 3DS, before discovering that games are much cheaper on Steam. I devoured the Demo on 3DS (though even that took many hours), and felt a rush of nostalgia when I found it on Steam - and better yet, it was on sale!With alternate levels as an accompaniment to the main story, and secret levels within the main story, this game has a lot of replayability. You can also buy weapons by collecting the coins in every level. The soundtrack is also great, making this game worth at least what I paid for it - $4.99 - if not more."

,Not Recommended,247370,18558823,"Posted: 18 October, 2015",all,SunkythePootis,"Mutant Mudds is one of those games I feel like it only gets positive praise just because it's based on the NES classics. If you look past the fact it's based on NES games you just end up with one of the most boring platformers I've ever played.First off the game has really stiff controls which makes the platforming harder than it needs to be as it almost forces you to use the jetpack for every single jump you make. I feel like if the character's speed increased a bit like to around Megaman's walking speed it would help make the controls more responsive for a platformer like this. The level design is the typical get from one end of the level to the other end while dodging enemies and 3D thwomps, which I would be ok with but it stays the same through out the game with next to no new gimmicks added in every world.On your way you get diamond pieces which there are 100 in each level and these star pieces with one at the end of the level and one in a secret room. In order to beat the game you have to collect all of them. So if you miss some collectables by the time you beat all the levels you are going to have to backtrack and get the collectables you missed because without those you are not going to beat the game.There are upgrades you unlock during your journey but you can only carry upgrade at a time, and you're going to need them in order to access the hidden areas. The upgrades include a jetpack upgrade which has your jetpack last alot longer and a gun upgrade which has your gun deal more damage and also break certain yellow walls. So if you find the door which leads you to a hidden level and you don't have the upgrade to get to it....you have to exit the level, equip the upgrade and go all the way back to where you found the level. This can get tedious very quickly especially when you're in the backtracking stage of your playthrough.Speaking of hidden levels, these doors you find in the middle of a level take you a challenge room where everything is either black and white or red and black (because virtual boy) and....they the same as the regular levels....nuff said.SPOILER ALERT:So what do you get for getting all the collectables in the game.......NOTHING because the game just ends. No final boss, no final level, just ends and shows credits. After you get beat the game you unlock the nerd's grandma which has all the upgrades you had to switch through equipped. There are also some harder versions of levels you completed but at this point I just stopped caring about this game.This game has a major problem where it gets boring after a while with the same enemies and level gimmicks being pasted over and over again, the collectables don't even help make the game more fun as it just adds more tedious gameplay to drag it out. Doesn't help that there is no boss fights to test your skills on.At the end of the day it's just a boring, generic platformer that just happened to get tons of praise (and a Wii U sequel in the works) just because of it being 8bit. If you want to play a retro platformer then I don't recommend this. There are much more enjoyable 2D platformers to play including retro ones.Infact here are some I recommend over this which are available on steam:Freedom PlanetShovel KnightDucktales RemasteredMegaman 1-6 via the Legacy CollectionSonic the Hedgehog 1-3 & KnucklesRouge LegacyRayman Origins and LegendsIf you really have to get this game then I recommend wait for the game to come on sale as it's not worth the £7 price tag even if you're a NES fanatic."

I have now completed Mutant Mudds' demo on the 3DS, Mutant Mudds on 3DS, Mutant Mudds Deluxe on Wii U, and Mutant Mudds: Deluxe on PC.  I was also partially finished with Mutant Mudds: Super Challenge when my 3DS mysteriously disappeared.  Honestly, I think that says enough about the game.  If you like platformers with good level design, play this game.  Also, make sure to get all the water sprites.  They unlock Granny and the CGA-land levels, and you really want those."
,Recommended,247370,29504055,Posted: 26 January,all,Kefen,"TL;DR: A short, slow-paced but pretty enjoyable retro-platformer, provided you buy it while it's on sale, are a big fan of the genre, have patience and good timing (granted, that's a lot of prerequisites, but I had fun! YMMV.) Also it's possible to play with a controller and I definitely recommend it!Mutant Mudds is a ""2.5D"" (you can move between up to three planes in a level) platformer with correct (if not very varied) pixel graphics and a solid, classic gameplay that may remind you of Gargoyle's Quest in that you can hover during a jump. And also in how slow your character moves.Get through 40 levels, 20 normal ones and 20 ""dark-world"" ones (arguably more challenging). Collect all tokens in each of them. Find the hidden warp zone in each of the 20 normal levels. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. With enough tokens, you can buy power-ups (high jump, longer hover or faster gun with longer range), but until you complete the main game, you can only use one of those at a time. Once you unlock everything you can, you get to use all power-ups together, which allows you to unlock further warp zones requiring good mastery of all your special moves.Now you need to be way into old-school platformers and be quite patient because:- Your character is SLOW. Forget about Super Meat Boy.- While most levels aren't too difficult, you do need good timing to jump, hover and end up on blinking platforms.- High jump requires you to press jump and ONLY up. This makes sections where you need to jump, move while hovering and then high-jump relatively frustrating. I still managed to unlock all achievements in about 8 hours of gameplay.- Admittedly, there isn't a lot of variety in enemy sprites.Conclusion: I bought it on sale, and got a nice few hours out of it. 6/10, no regrets."
,Recommended,247370,12092587,"Posted: 13 September, 2014",all,NeoRizer,"So like yeaaah, Mutant Mudds... odd little title but defintely a great one for someone craving a dose of ultra precision platforming. At first the game feels really cumbersome and clunky because let's face it, it's not supposed to play like New Super Mario Bros... You won't be running at top speed and almost sliding off in to a chasm only to do a triple backflip in to a ground pound... nope, none of that here. You walk, you hover, you jump, you shoot... bout it.This game is very... let's say, square.... or rather pixel perfect... everything works in blocks, rows and lines... so if you keep that in mind when you're traversing the trecherous one hit kill spike traps, you'll be better off. The game is intended as a grueling challenge for older children, around the age of like 10-12... and for someone of that age, I can see this being incredibly frustrating and they will surely deem this game unbeatable... but it's really not.Don't expect ""Impossible Game"" or ""Super Meat Boy"" quality challenge here is basically what I'm saying. If you can tolerate playing most web based flash games for longer than 15 minutes, this game will proove only an above average challenge for you. You shouldn't at any point want to throw your controller at a wall... if you do, then you have no patience because that's all this game really requires.Sure there's a time limit for speed running levels but that's more of a tacked on thing if you're craving more Mutant Mudds after you've collected over 4000 objects... and if you are, please seek some help. After the inital batch of normal stages and ghost stages I cringed at having to do 20 more stages with good ol' grannie but I actually found those stages the least frustrating after I had finished a few.All in all the game is good, you can finish everything in roughly 5 to 6 hours which is decent for the price. Other less experienced platformers might take a bit longer but I can't see this game taking you more than 10 hours.Side Note: There's an exploit where you can stand on the very edge of spikes if they're on a platform, so use that knowledge to your advantage if you're having trouble finishing some of the harder areas."

The 3D effect was nice, but I didn't use that as much as I thought I would. Now that it's on Steam, I thought it was overall much better than the 3DS version (besides being able to play on the go, obviously).Achievements are available and it seems like there's more content. I enjoyed going through the levels and getting a bit of nostalgia. The soundtrack is what made this game so much better. I often found myself humming to in frustation, because this game is also a challenge! I wasn't TOO hard, but the challenge is definitely there. Several attempts were made on many levels, especially Granny's levels. Her levels were the best imo because every power-up is used to complete the secret levels.Lastly, for those wondering, customized controls are available, so I was able to control the game to my liking.I recommend this game and Xeodrifter, which also uses that 'layer' mechanic that I haven't seen in a game before!"

Give MegaMan a jetpack, throw him in some Virtual Wario Land levels, add some well thought out powerups, and voila.  Unlike a lot of titles, which mimic the ridiculous difficulty of more chaotic classics, MMD isn't brutal.  Instead, you move slow and actions are deliberate, so the game forces you to play at it's pace.If you like the pace of early MegaMan's, even if you don't enjoy the game per say, definitely give this a shot.  It's got the feel, with a more conventional structure, that combines collectibles with platforming ala Mario 64 or Money Seize."

Super tight controls are nice, like in games such as super meat boy and hyper switch force for example, are PRIME examples of what a decent platformer is.This is neither of those things. This game has horrible spawn platforms, poor stage design with a collect-o-thon of gold and medals, but more often than not do i see myself making sacrifices to the health pool or dying to cheap mechanics (like the floating) or the near perfect timing to kill a mob before a moving panel etc. Having a tight game with perfect timing and excecution is a wonderful idea, but only if it works on the title promoting it. The main toon is slower than most ""deactivating"" platforms. The mobs are literally placed in spots ensuring a pit-fall or some other shinanigan.This game tries, and it tries hard. It looks crisp, feels rewarding, has achievements and badge progression, but it is so cheap. Cheap is the perfect word. When I die, I dont blame my skill, I blame poor mapwork and toon placement. In games like super meat boy, if I die, I have myself to blame and only myself. When I die here, I sigh. Because Ice, Or Mob, Or this or that.This game is cheap."

76561197983662248,Recommended,247370,13511193,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the reviews too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery. Shouldn't happen for this game, but I am nothing if not (mostly) consistent.Gameplay: On its surface, Mutant Mudds doesn't seem too impressive. It's an indie platformer in the vein of the NES games which inspired it. After playing it through, I can definitely agree with the sentiment that the game isn't too particularly impressive. However, this game does manage to be a good bit of fun, with a surprising bit of challenge in some of the hidden levels, albeit also with a rather wonky difficulty curve.This game is best described as a level-centric Metroidvania-lite. There's four levels per ""world"" and five worlds total; twice that if you count the alternate stages for these. Within these stages are hidden stages which are unlockable via the three powerups you collect throughout the game: a powerup that lets you hover for longer; a powerup that allows your shots to break down barriers (not doing any additional damage to enemies, oddly enough), and a powerup that lets you jump much higher than initially. You can only hold one of these powerups at a time, but there are secret characters which you can unlock that have all three at one time. These characters are used to unlock CGA stages, a more difficult series of levels which are used mainly for completion's sake and nothing else. This game is also something of a collect-a-thon, albeit a very mild one. There are 100 collectables per stage, amounting to 4,000 by the game's end. These aren't hidden in particularly challenging places, but they do force you to do some precarious jumps from time to time.The main gimmick of the game is that there are three planes of stages. One thing that I learned was that this game was  a port of the 3DS version, and after learning that, I can see exactly where the gimmick came from. While I don't own a 3DS and as such can't say for myself as to how good the 3D effect is, I can say that the game does an okay job of recreating that feeling of depth, even if some elements of the foreground do get in the way from time to time. It's not a dealbreaker, however. As for the stages themselves, they're fairly ""rompy."" I really can't think of any other way to describe them. There's no boss battles in this game, which rather surprised me considering that a boss fight could work with the control scheme, but again, it's not a big deal. My biggest complaint about the controls (and is a complaint shared by many others) is that movement is very sluggish and can potentially lead to a somewhat boring experience. I do wish your character moved faster, but that would also require changing a lot of the stage design.At the end of the day, Mutant Mudds Deluxe isn't out to blow the hinges off of anyone's door. What it instead intends to do is give you a pretty good time. It did only take me just over five hours to 100% the game, and almost exactly the same amount of time for a person who is much better at platformers than me to 100% the game. Beyond that, I don't see much in the way of replay value. I don't know if I'll ever be coming back to this game, to be quite frank. I did have a good time, though, and I do feel like I got my $10 of value. 7/10.Story: Nothing remarkable; I'll be skipping to Graphics.Graphics: When you start the game, it launches in a window... with menus. In fact, things like screen resolution and control configuration aren't actually baked into the game, meaning that if you wanna change controls, you'll have to go into windowed mode in order to change your settings. A bit disappointing, but that would mainly be a niche issue if you ask me. Once you get that business sorted out, the game doesn't have any graphical issues whatsoever. As for the art design, it reminds me quite a bit of Wonder Boy's graphics. It of course comes down to how you feel about pixel art, but for my eyes, the game wasn't that bad. Animations are smooth, there's pretty good shading on the enemies, and it all has a pretty nice style. Good stuff all around. 4/5.Sound: Again, this comes somewhat down to taste, as the soundtrack for this game is entirely chiptune music. It's not bad, but I don't really remember much of it, even after having just played it. As for the sound design, it's just some bleeps and bloops. Not really worth discussing all that much. Of course, there's no voice acting either, but did you really expect it? Pretty alright and nothing more on this front. 3/5.Overall scores are: 7/0/4/3; cumulative score of 7.0/10. It's just a fun, simple little platformer that doesn't go too far beyond being fun or simple."

Way-back when, the platforming genre dominated home consoles,and today it remains a genre that evokes nostalgia in the best of us. Most games I have played fail miserably when it comes to kickstarting that trip down memory lane. Thankfully, Mutant Mudds Deluxe didn't end up on that short-list. Upon my first time playing, this game gracefully slapped failure in it's face, raised it's middle finger to all those that tried to hard, donned it's sunglassess then lit up a cigarette. Mutant Mudds Deluxe is nothing short of amazing. It's a platformer with some really nice tight controls (you have the option to play this game with a game-pad if you so choose), the best jet pack mechanic I've ever used, great level design, which in itself is great because you have to jump into different layers of the levels, so foreground, background, you know the score.What sets this game apart from most modern platformers? Well it has some real nice scrolling, the sprites are great, but the number one thing that set me off was the soundtrack. The soundtrack is pure chiptune, and that's never a bad thing. It sounds like it was done on a chiptracker, from my experience it sounds like an NES soundchip, so FamiTracker maybe? Ahh... Who cares, it's a great soundtrack, a great game, and one that sound be downloaded instantly. Easily one of the best indie games I've played, and a massive reccomendation to anyone that loves the genre."

,Recommended,247370,7855246,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,okram2k,"eleased this week on Steam from Renegade Kid is indy platformer Mutant Mudds Deluxe. On sale right now for $4.99 thanks to Steam and their never ceasing sales I picked up this nod to retro style platformers and gave it a try. The story in Mutant Mudds is uh… I think there’s a hint of a story somewhere. The closest nod to any sort of story telling is a quick collection of scenes of you watching tv in your house, flash to an asteroid, flash to a news caster about an invasion, flash to you outside your house armed with a jetpack and rifle! Ready, set, go!So for whatever unexplicable reason our four-eyed hero is off to save the world as the only uh… kid… in the right place at the right time with his trusty rifle and jetpack. I would say something about the travesty of sending children off to war only to be slaughtered but these Mutant Mudd guys aren’t exactly the most organized or ferocious invasion force I’ve ever seen. I think they went through King Koopa’s army training because mostly they just pace around back and forth on set paths and hope somebody is foolish enough to run into them.So you go through the levels with two goals, collect all the golden diamonds throughout the level and grab the water sprite at the end of the level. There are exactly 100 gold coins… I mean diamonds spread across each world and it is a good progress meter to judge just how many dumb Mudds you have to blast before you’re near the end. As with any good platformer the levels consist of a fair amount of enemy blasting and precision maneuvering in order to get to the goal. As you progress the levels get quite noticeably tougher and much less forgiving.One of the major features of Mutant Mudds is the ability to jump to one of three levels, foreground, regular, and background. There are certain points where you can jump from one to the other and there’s a bit of strategy involved here. You have to be careful not to say, jump to the background right on top of an enemy. Also as one of the goals is to collect all the “gold diamonds” there are sometimes certain paths you can take which might keep you from getting all the diamonds this run and force you to repeat the level.As you progress at certain intervals of the currency you can unlock power-ups. From what I can tell you can only equip one power-up at a time (although perhaps later you can unlock the ability to equip more than one?) They are quite handy, one increases the range of your rifle, another doubles the amount of time your jet pack can keep you hoovering, and the last has a big super jump that sends you flying high into the air. These power-ups are vital as well for accessing hidden secret zones in each level as some are tucked away in places that are impossible to reach without a power-up. I found doubling the jetpack fuel capacity by far the most handy as it makes jumping puzzles a lot more forgiving especially when trying to get timing correct.Overall I found the game quite appealing. I like the multi-layered levels and the graphics are pretty darn decent pixel works. The music is also really good and made me a bit nostalgic. You almost think this game would have been an old classic SNES rom rather than a newly released game to steam. It’s clear the developer had a long love for Mario and the likes and did a pretty good job emulating and expanding on old classics. The game doesn’t leave me without complaint as I wish four-eyes knew how to shoot in a direction other than parallel to the ground and the jetpack would be more handy if you could turn it off then back on again. All the same, for $5 it’s worth your money if you’re a fan of the old classics but the game can get frustratingly hard. For me, the game has to be played in short spurts or I start to get annoyed at the tricky timing required for some of the jump puzzles.Final Score:Graphics: 7.5/10Game Play: 8/10Music / Ambiance: 9/10Story: 4/10Value: 7/10Overall: 7.1/10Visit my blog to check out more indy game reviews!http://markofithian.com"

But the game is still worth nothing.Ok, credit where credit is due, platformer games don't need a story, the music dosen't hurt your ears and graphic experts would say that the graphics are passable for what it is trying to do, but still, the game lacks heart. I could feel the absoutely terrible enemy placment wieghing down on me through each and every stage and that made me take long breaks for days at a time, and some levels were so hard that they actually bored me. I use an xbox 360 controller and the controls were appauling at times, like when you get the vertical boost which fails on every level of game design sure, it helps you get through each stage but the designers never put any extras or easter eggs in to make you want to explore.There is no payoff for getting everything and I cannot believe I wasted 15.8 hours of my life on this worhtless piece of binary coding.By the way, I love shovel knight.

,Recommended,247370,11121042,"Posted: 7 July, 2014",all,Caponetone,"Pretty fun game. Controls and platforming are well done.However, I still have a few gripes with the game. One, it can get repetitive as you will need to play every level multiple times in order to fully complete the game. Two, the level design is a bit repetitive as well. In a Mario or Donkey Kong game, you will get a variety of new platforming elements thrown at you in each individual level you play. The problem with Mutant Mudds is that is has 20 individual levels in 5 total worlds, only each world has variety, not the individual levels themselves. Three, the game was originally designed for the 3DS so the level design will feel slightly awkward with no stereoscopic 3D, but this is more of a nitpick than an actual problem.The Deluxe version includes 20 extra levels, which are dark world levels. These levels  are the same as the levels you already played except for the fact that you can't kill any of the enemies unless you have a temporary weapon found in-level.After you complete the game you can also complete the grandma levels which are the hardest in the game but on the flipside you can equip all 3 powerups at the same time.As a gamer who loves platformers, fully completing the game and collecting all steam achievements took a little less than 8 hours. Overall, If you're a gamer who loves platformers then it's hard to not recommend MM: Deluxe for 9.99. Even with the gripes i'd say the game deserves an 8/10, but this is coming from a person who loves this genre of gaming."

In the same way Zool was Gremlin's answer to Sonic the Hedgehog, I didn't expect much longevity as aesthetics over style doesn't work for me. You can have all the lovely sprites in the world,  but if the level design sucks, there's nothing to keep the player interested. I'm pleased that I persevered with Mudds though as it does have decent levels to battle through,  and more importantly,  it gives the player reasons to return to already completed worlds. There's hosts of secrets,  many of which you can't find on first visit as you lack the necessary power-ups. I'm happy to say that the worlds in which you visit do have more in common with Super Mario than they do with the aforementioned Zool, or Superfrog, to name but a few.  This game is a completionists pipe dream. It's tough,  unforgiving and the ice levels p**s me right off to the point of vowing a negative review, but it is also very rewarding.  I thoroughly enjoy games that open up extra levels when you accomplish goals.  I've never had a much fun like that since Yoshi's Island on the Snes.

It gets progressively challenging, and the ghost levels are specially difficult because you can't kill the enemies, but to me, the game never went to the point of being frustrating or unfair.

Believe me!When you start the game there is a short clip on the story about a meteor strike and that's when it starts! Not much story here. So this is a game that is based on the gameplay. The gameplay of Mutant Mudds Deluxe is very solid and easy. You can jump between 3 layers from foreground to background, but every jump needs to be timed well. Or else you land yourself on an enemy and you lose 1 of your three health hearts. When playing this for the first time you will probably die al lot because there are some points in the game that require very accurate jumps. Your goal is to finish every level and every level is swarming with mutant mudd enemy's that you can shoot or avoid to get past them. Also you collect some sort of coins that you can use for power ups in the game and 100% completion. There are 100 coins in the levels to collect. But there are some levels that don't contain coins in them and are just made for extra challenge. When further in the game you can even colelct medals with a different character, so more fun!The Power ups you can get in the game are very well used and you need them all the time to get past obstacles and enemies. You even need to combine the power ups to get to certain points in the game. Many of the levels contain bonus stages and NEED specific power ups to get there. You need some backtracking to do.The game let's you unlock extra characters, play a lot of bonus stages and gives you a lot of retro platforming challenge!If you can get the hang of it, you can play this game all the way through within 10 hours.
